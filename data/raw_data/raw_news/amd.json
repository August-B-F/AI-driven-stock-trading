            "content": "AMD keeps dominating the CPU market with its Ryzen lineup. While the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is still at the top spot, AM4 CPUs are still selling like hotcakes.\n\nAfter Ryzen 7 9800X3D with 6000+ Units Shipments, Ryzen 5 5500 is at Number Two, Outselling the Entire Core Ultra 200S Stack\n\nAMD keeps dominating Intel in CPU sales and this has been the case for a while, particularly after the launch of X3D processors. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D alone is outselling several top-selling Intel processors. The processor has come up at the top position once again, selling over 6000 units in the entire month of March. The report suggests that the final number will be a few hundred units higher and this should make the number closer to 7000 units.\n\nSurprisingly, the entry-level six-core Ryzen 5 5500 is still one of the top choices for PC gamers and users in general. On the one hand, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D sells for a whopping $479, and on the other hand, the Ryzen 5 5500 sells for a sub-$90 price tag. The processor sold over 3000 units last month, followed by Ryzen 7 7800X3D, which is on par in popularity with the Ryzen 5 5500.\n\nIntel and AMD CPU sales Amazon US March 2025. Credit: @TechEpiphanyYT\n\nOnce again, we see the top mostly comprise AMD Ryzen CPUs and the only Intel processors to make it to the top 10 best-selling CPUs list are the Intel Core i5 12400F and Intel Core i7 12700K. The 12-core/24-thread i7 12700K from the Alder Lake family sold over 1000 units in March for an average price of $234. There are hardly 12-core processors for this price tag, making it an excellent choice for budget and mid-range PC builds that cater to the demands of content creators and gamers.\n\nAs for the Core i5 12400F, it is a solid competitor to the Ryzen 5 5600X, offering 6 cores and 12 threads for $33 cheaper and trades blows with the latter. To this date, the Alder Lake and Zen 3 are hugely popular amongst budget PC builders due to their excellent price-to-performance ratio. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the Core Ultra 200S series as well as for the Ryzen 9000 non-X3D processors.\n\nWe do see Ryzen 9000 CPUs selling well, but they are still outperformed in sales by many Ryzen 5000 and Ryzen 7000 processors in many regions. This time, the Ryzen 5 7600X is the most popular Zen 4 non-X3D processor and the only best-selling Ryzen 9000 chip in the top 10 is the Ryzen 9 9900X. Ryzen 9 9950X comes after Core i9 14900K with 1000+ units shipments.\n\nThe Core Ultra 200S has flopped and the only best-selling CPU in the lineup is the Core Ultra 7 265K with just over 500 units. The final results show AMD sold around 31,600 units (78.74%) while Intel only 7,500 (21.26%). This helped AMD generate about $7.8M in revenue and about $1.5M for Intel.\n\nNews Source: @TechEpiphanyYT",

            "content": "Both Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 have done wonders to improve the perception and position of AMD within the graphics card market. Upcoming RX 9060 Series cards could compound these gains but will be the final additions to the family for the foreseeable future. However, whispers tell of another pixel pusher on the way from Team Red, bearing a familiar moniker.\n\nAccording to reports from ITHome and Benchlife, AMD is preparing to release Radeon RX 9070 GRE (Great Radeon Edition). The graphics card will soon enter mass production, meaning its launch shouldn\u2019t be too far behind. It\u2019s currently unknown whether this model will reach beyond the borders of China, like Radeon RX 7900 GRE before it, but there\u2019s no reason to give up hope just yet.\n\nIn terms of specifications, current leaks describe Radeon RX 9070 GRE as boasting 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM and a 192-bit memory bus. For context, this is a stepdown from the 16GB and 256-bit configuration found on Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT. This suggests AMD\u2019s new addition to its roster would retail for less than the $549, possibly impinging on the $499 price point held by Radeon RX 7800 XT.\n\nThis buffer and bus width also mirror GeForce RTX 5070, potentially giving AMD an edge against Nvidia if it adopts pricing according to my guestimate above, albeit with slower GDDR6 modules. Of course, the real test of Radeon RX 9070 GRE\u2019s value will be through its performance and there\u2019s no word on what cutbacks its die could face past a trimmer memory configuration.\n\nUntil AMD confirms the existence of Radeon RX 9070 GRE take all the above with a grain of salt. Following that, its relevance to most would-be buyers will ultimately depend on worldwide availability. Until then, it\u2019s likely that GeForce RTX 5060 Ti will occupy attentions as rumours claim it will launch later this month.\n\nI\u2019d certainly welcome more additions to the graphics card market, particularly in the wake of poor availability and frustratingly fluid pricing. It\u2019s too early to tell whether Radeon RX 9070 GRE would be a worthwhile addition to the space, but I\u2019ll be keeping a watchful eye on it.

One trial evaluated sozinibercept in combination with aflibercept 2 mg (Eylea), the other in combination with ranibizumab 0.5 mg (Lucentis). The comparator in both trials was aflibercept or ranibizumab used alone.\n\nVascular endothelial growth factor is responsible for the growth of new blood vessels in neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Aflibercept targets VEGF-A and -B along with placental growth factor; ranibizumab targets VEGF-A. Sozinibercept acts by blocking VEGF-C and -D, according to Opthea.\n\nJason Hsu, MD\n\n\u201cThe hope was that by blocking VEGF-A, -C, and -D, we would see improved efficacy above and beyond our current VEGF-A blockade, especially given that there are a subset of patients who have a suboptimal response,\u201d Jason Hsu, MD, codirector of Retina Research at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, told Medscape Medical News.\n\nCOAST and ShORe Trials\n\nThe aflibercept trial, known as COAST, evaluated intravitreal sozinibercept every 4 or 8 weeks in combination with intravitreal aflibercept administered every 8 weeks after three loading doses delivered 4 weeks apart, comparing with the use of aflibercept only every 8 weeks. The ranibizumab trial, known as ShORe, compared sozinibercept every 4 or 8 weeks in combination with ranibizumab every 4 weeks vs ranibizumab only.\n\nAfter Opthea announced results last week of the failed COAST trial, the company decided to speed up the readout of topline data from the ShORe trial, which also failed to show the combination treatment with sozinibercept was superior to ranibizumab alone.\n\nIn COAST, patients receiving sozinibercept combination therapy with a dosing regimen of every 4 weeks or every 8 weeks had an average change in BCVA of 13.5 and 12.8 letters from baseline to week 52, respectively, vs 13.7 letters with aflibercept only (P = .86 and .42, respectively), the company reported.\n\nIn ShORe, patients who received sozinibercept combination therapy had an average improvement of 13.3 letters with treatment every 4 weeks or 12.6 letters with treatment after 8 weeks after a year of treatment, whereas those on ranibizumab only experienced an average improvement of 14.3 letters (P = .32 and .09, respectively), the company said.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed that COAST and ShORe did not demonstrate the improvements in vision with sozinibercept combination therapy compared to standard of care that we had hoped for,\u201d Frederic Guerard, PharmD, CEO of Opthea, said in a press release.\n\nIn the press release, Opthea stated it must sort out a number of obligations to regulators and investors. \u201cIn light of these matters, there remains material uncertainty as to Opthea\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern,\u201d the company stated.\n\nHsu noted the phase 2b study of sozinibercept in combination with ranibizumab \u201clooked promising,\u201d and demonstrated an improvement in BCVA of more than three letters over ranibizumab alone, and gains of more than six letters in patients with occult choroidal neovascularization.\n\n\u201cTherefore, many of us were looking forward to the results of COAST and ShORe,\u201d he said.\n\nThe phase 3 trials included a dosing regimen of sozinibercept injections every 8 weeks along with the standard dosing of every 4 weeks used in the phase 2b trial.\n\n\u201cIn the published subgroup analysis of the phase 2b trial by lesion type, OPT-302 demonstrated the greatest benefit in occult lesions, so it will be important to see what proportion of patients in the phase 3 trials had occult lesions and if these proportions were similar to the phase 2b trial,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there ended up being a higher proportion of minimally classic lesions in the phase 3 trials, for example, that may have contributed to the apparent negative study results. In retrospect, it might have been better to specifically focus on recruiting a high proportion of occult choroidal neovascularization.\u201d\n\nAdding a second agent to the standard anti\u2013VEGF-A regiment in neovascular age-related macular degeneration has been \u201ca high bar,\u201d Hsu said. He cited the previously published CAPELLA phase 2 trial of an anti\u2013platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (rinucumab) combined with aflibercept to treat the neovascular form of the condition, which failed to show any benefit of the combined treatment.\n\nThe bispecific antibody faricimab (Vabysmo), which blocks both VEGF-A and angiopoietin-2, is one combination therapy that has demonstrated durability in treating neovascular age-related macular degeneration, Hsu said.\n\n\u201cI think there will be other combination therapies that may also prove fruitful in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cFor instance, blocking other inflammatory mediators in combination with VEGF-A may prove to yield better results. I\u2019m still optimistic.\u201d\n\nThe phase 3 and phase 2b studies were funded by Opthea. Hsu disclosed his group has received grant support as a clinical trial center for Opthea, Genentech/Roche and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.\n\nRichard Mark Kirkner is a medical journalist based in Philadelphia.",

Team Red blames memory compatibility issues for the processors \"failing to complete POST,\" even though the affected chips reportedly did pass POST and worked for anything from half an hour to several months before dying, with many cases showing physical damage.\n\nThis week saw a Redditor compile a list of 108 Reddit posts involving a Ryzen 7 9800X3D that died, along with 12 other Ryzen 9000-series chips that suffered the same fate. 98 of the failures, or 82%, occurred on Asrock boards. It's stated that the processors passed POST and worked for varying amounts of time before dying with no signs of failure.\n\nThat many instances doesn't represent a huge number compared to the thousands of Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPUs sold each week \u2013 the processor is incredibly popular with gamers, and for good reason. But it's not an insignificant figure, either, so AMD gave an official response to some outlets.\n\nAlso read: AMD hits record CPU share as new top GPU and OS emerge on Steam survey\n\n\"We are aware of a limited number of user reports involving Asrock AM5 motherboards failing to complete POST. Following a joint investigation, AMD and Asrock identified a memory compatibility issue present in earlier BIOS versions, which has been rectified in the latest BIOS,\" the company wrote, repeating previous statements made by Asrock.\n\nAMD added that failure to POST can be caused by several factors and does not necessarily indicate a non-functional CPU. It recommends that anyone experiencing problems start by updating their BIOS to the latest version for their motherboard. If issues persist, the next step is to contact AMD's customer support team.\n\nAsrock responded to the reports last week. The company said that it had inspected a motherboard from a system where the CPU showed burn damage. It claimed there was no burn damage around the mobo or VRM area. After \"cleaning and removing debris\" from the CPU socket, the motherboard booted up successfully with the original BIOS and passed long-term stress tests.\n\nAMD is saying that a memory compatibility issue prevented the CPUs from POSTing, stopping them from working entirely \u2013 as one would expect. But the Reddit post states that these problematic chips are passing POST and working for a while before failing, sometimes with electrical or burn damage, which doesn't sound like a symptom of the issue AMD is blaming.\n\nOne can only conclude that AMD's statement is referring only to the cases where the 9800X3Ds didn't pass POST, and not those that suffered permanent physical damage. Nevertheless, a lot of user response to the explanation has been negative. It's possible that the company will follow-up with another statement at a later date.",

Reports of chip-killing burnouts have been steadily mounting, with more than 100 cases now reported.\n\nThanks to the heroic work of Reddit user natty_overlord, a detailed compilation of CPU failure reports is available for all to peruse, and currently shows a total of 108 reports of dead 9800X3Ds. Most reports show the chip dying after only a few weeks or even days of use, with no apparent issues showing up before the moment of demise.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nLuckily, most affected users have been able to RMA their CPUs for either a refund or a replacement without issue, and considering the thousands of Ryzen 9000 chips that have been sold, it's not a serious problem. Still, that many failed chips is a bit concerning, especially when we still have essentially zero idea what's causing these premature deaths.\n\nMysterious origins\n\nOkay, there might be some clues to be gleaned from natty_overlord's report, so we're not totally in the dark here. Of the 108 currently-reported cases of Ryzen 9800X3D failure, a whopping 86 of them involved ASRock motherboards. 13 reports were from users with Asus boards, five from MSI, and one from Gigabyte.\n\nSo, is ASRock responsible? It's possible that the Taiwanese motherboard maker bears part of the blame here; natty_overlord also documented 10 other Ryzen 9000 chip failures (including the 9900X and 9600X), all of which occurred on ASRock mobos. Still, multiple failures on Asus and MSI motherboards would appear to indicate that ASRock isn't solely at fault.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any one chipset that's suffering from these issues, either. The majority of 9800X3D failures were split between X870 and B850 motherboards, with a smaller (but not insignificant) number on X670 and B650 models. In short, there's no way of knowing what's causing these failures, although AMD is no doubt investigating.\n\nWhat you should do\n\nUnfortunately, there isn't much you can do to protect yourself from this mysterious chip-killing bug, short of simply not having an ASRock motherboard, perhaps, given the heavy weighting of failure reports for ASRock hardware. If you've been considering buying a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, it might be worth holding off for the time being.\n\nThe good news is that if your PC is affected, most reports seem to have been satisfactorily resolved via an RMA process, either directly to AMD or to the retailer in cases involving pre-built PCs.\n\nNaturally, I'll continue to monitor this story and will follow up with any fresh details that emerge. I've reached out to AMD for comment, but I suspect I won't get any meaty info there; 108 isn't a small number of dead chips, but it's not such a large amount that Team Red really needs to worry that something is seriously amiss.",

So, let\u2019s see what the red team will be bringing to gamers.\n\nThe key features of these patents are Neural Network-based Ray Tracing, Traversal and Procedural Shader Bounds, Ray Tracing Structure Traversal Based on Work Items and Lossy Geometry Compression Using Interpolated Normals for Use in BVH Building and Rendering.\n\nGoing into more details, the Neural Network-based Ray Tracing seems similar to what NVIDIA is doing with the Neural Shaders. So, I guess now PC gamers will be fine with this tech? After all, some criticized NVIDIA for introducing it as a new \u201cgimmick\u201d.\n\nThe point is that AMD appears to be going all in with Ray Tracing for its future hardware. So, in theory, RDNA5 and the next-gen consoles (PS6 and the next Xbox) should be more capable of running ray-traced \u2013 or even path-traced \u2013 games.\n\nThis also proves how far ahead NVIDIA is. The exact same thing happened with DLSS. NVIDIA first introduced it, only for AMD to follow up (one or two years later). Now if only there were any RTX50 GPUs to buy.\n\nRealistically, I don\u2019t expect any games to support these new RT techniques anytime soon. We are most likely looking at things that may happen in two or three years from now. So, this is a nothing-burger for most of you. Still, it can give you an idea of where things are heading.\n\nYou can find links for all of AMD\u2019s RT patents here. All of them have brief descriptions, so you can find out what AMD is trying to achieve with them.\n\nStay tuned for more!",

These graphics cards feature the Navi 48 GPU core with 16 GB VRAM and come at prices of $599 and $549 US, respectively. AMD has stated that the Radeon RX 9070 has been a major success for them and is outselling RTX 50 GPUs at several retailers. But the Red Team isn't stopping with its RDNA 4 action.\n\nITHome reports that AMD is working on a brand-new Navi 48-based RDNA 4 graphics card, which will be called the Radeon RX 9070 GRE. The GRE or \"Great Radeon Edition\" series of graphics cards have mostly been confined to Asia Pacific regions such as China, but there were a few instances in which the cards were sold globally such as the RX 6750 GRE series and the RX 7900 GRE. Now, the Radeon RX 9070 GRE seems to be following suit.\n\nAs per various chat logs with retailers and their sources, ITHome managed to find out that the Red Team's Radeon RX 9070 GRE will be offered at an attractive price point, offering better gaming value than the Radeon RX 9070 and also offering a lower price tag to those who can't afford the XT variant. The Radeon RX 9070 GRE may likely target a sub-$500 US price tag between $449 - $499.\n\nIn terms of specifications, it is being reported that the Radeon RX 9070 GRE might feature a further cut-down Navi 48 core with 192-bit bus memory and 12 GB of VRAM. This should compete against NVIDIA's RTX 5070, which also offers 12 GB of VRAM. But we can't say for sure what the final specs might be unless more credible information arrives. With that said, the launch of this graphics card is expected to take place before the Radeon RX 9060 XT (Navi 44), which should be arriving later this quarter.\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9000 \"RDNA 4\" GPU Specs:\n\nGPU Radeon RX 9070 XT Radeon RX 9070 Radeon RX 9070 GRE Radeon RX 9060 XT Radeon RX 9060 Radeon RX 9050?

            "content": "Today, the MLPerf Inference v5.0 results were released. This release was, as one might expect, mostly dominated by NVIDIA Hopper systems, but there were a number of Blackwell GPUs out there as well. We also saw AMD and Intel have a number of submissions, but both were focused on two different parts of the market. What we did not see was a lot of chipmakers outside of those three, except for a Trillium result.\n\nMLPerf Inference v5.0 Results Released\n\nStarting with Intel, the company had several results with the Xeon 6900P and Xeon 6700P series. These results spanned a few OEMs as well. Intel\u2019s marketing slide saying that it \u201cRemains the only server CPU on MLPerf\u201d feels a bit strange since there are plenty of NVIDIA Grace and AMD EPYC systems, they are just focused on the GPU results in those systems. Intel\u2019s point might be that the Xeon results are the only CPU-only results.\n\nNVIDIA, as usual, had a ton of results. It was nice to see the B200 and some of the Grace platforms make their marks on the test.\n\nPerhaps most interesting is that in NVIDIA\u2019s briefing materials they focused on the DeepSeek-R1 671B inference performance. A fun note, they are showing FP8 and FP4 here. A FP16 model is something like 1.2-1.3TB so an 8-way NVIDIA H200 system does not have enough HBM to fit a FP16 version.\n\nAMD for its part showed both single node and multi-node AMD Instinct MI325X performance in the realm of the NVIDIA H200. NVIDIA is really ramping on Blackwell at this point, but it is still great to see. AMD also is starting to enable its partners to submit results. NVIDIA does a lot of this work for its partner OEMs/ ODMs, so AMD following suit is nice to see.\n\nIn AMD\u2019s MLPerf Inference v5.0 blog, the company also highlighted its Deepseek-R1 671B performance tuning with AMD Instinct accelerators. That was certainly a theme.\n\nFinal Words\n\nThis was a bit of a strange one. Intel was doing its own thing showing CPU-only inference. That is a valid use case, and we are going to have a crazy cool article/ video on CPU inference in the next 48 hours. NVIDIA still had a lot of H200 results after Jensen said at GTC two weeks ago that the H200 was not worth buying. AMD has the MI325X competing with the H200 which is good to see. The one strange thing was that both NVIDIA and AMD went out of their way to highlight Deepseek-R1 tests not in MLPerf Inference during their MLPerf Inference releases.\n\nYou can check out the MLPerf Inference v5.0 results here.",

            "content": "Our data center growth in India, in particular, is propelled by increasing market share among the top three hyperscalers, says Jaya Jagadish, country head and SVP of Silicon Design Engineering, AMD India\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nYou're reading Entrepreneur India, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media.\n\nFrom the 1940s to 2025, data centers have traversed a long way: From housing mammoth machines based on vacuum tubes and wires to today's powerful servers, the evolution has been colossal. A data center is a physical facility that organizations use to house their critical applications and data. At heart, these data centers are powered by a central processing unit (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU), and data processing unit (DPU).\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD), a fabless company, designs and manufactures the processors and GPUs that fuel data centers. In the last quarter, almost 50 percent of AMD's revenue came from the data center business. India is one of the strongest growing markets for AMD and the company has made substantial investments and placed strategic bets on the region to foster innovation, talent, and infrastructure for years to come. Data centers are one of the key areas of investment. AMD India plays a pivotal role in the company's global data centre business, contributing significantly to both innovation and development on the global stage. Around 25 per cent of AMD's global workforce is based in India, which equates to approximately 8,000-plus engineers engaged in various projects across the product portfolio.\n\n\n\nAMD's business in India has also seen remarkable growth, doubling over the past two years. \"The data center growth in India is driven by both EPYC processors and Instinct GPUs. Our ability to deliver high-performance processing power tailored to the needs of Cloud and enterprise clients remains our key strength. Today, our revenue is well-balanced, with over 50 percent coming from data centers, while embedded networking products, game consoles, and PCs each contribute approximately a quarter to our overall earnings,\" Jaya Jagadish, country head and SVP of Silicon Design Engineering, AMD India told Entrepreneur India.\n\n\n\nA critical aspect of its 2025 growth strategy is strengthening collaboration with customers, partners, independent software vendors (ISVs), and system integrators (SIs). \"These partnerships enable us to drive innovation and capture new business opportunities. Our data center growth in India, in particular, is propelled by increasing market share among the top three hyperscalers,\" the country head said.\n\nGrowing demand and innovations\n\nAMD EPYC-based instances claim to deliver superior performance at a lower total cost of ownership (TCO). \"From startups, SMEs to large corporations, educational institutions, and government initiatives, use AMD EPYC for its ability to resize instances and reduce operational costs. Many of the largest government projects and digital transformation initiatives are already powered by AMD EPYC instances, reinforcing its critical role in driving efficiency at scale,\" she said, adding that local Cloud service providers are also integrating AMD EPYC CPUs into their infrastructure.\n\n\n\nAMD India has a partnership with the Indian Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES). This collaboration marked the launch of two supercomputers, Arka and Arunika. Beyond this collaboration, AMD continues to work closely with OEMs, system integrators (SIs), and customers across various industries. The engagement spans across large government projects and private sector initiatives.\n\nAs the demand for computing power, data processing and AI workloads grows exponentially, IT leaders are under pressure to scale their infrastructure efficiently while managing costs.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the gaps, AMD is innovating in high-performance CPUs and GPUs, which enhance performance, efficiency, and scalability for modern data centers. For instance, its fifth generation processor, Turin, addresses various workload requirements that are optimized for both scale-out Cloud environments and scale-up enterprise applications. The company has been broadening AMD Instinct AI accelerators portfolio, too. Recently, it launched the AMD Instinct MI325X, to facilitate advanced generative AI tasks. To further streamline AI deployment, AMD is developing an open and unified AI platform, for seamless AI operations across data centers, Cloud environments, and personal devices. This enhances flexibility for enterprises looking to integrate AI across their IT infrastructure.\n\n\"Our goal is to provide our enterprise clients with the necessary tools to train and implement AI models on a large scale. Innovations such as energy efficiency, compute-in-memory solutions, and ultra-low power inter-chip communication are among the advancements that will create new use cases for integrated circuits (ICs),\" Jagadish explained.\n\nEnsuring energy efficiency\n\nEnergy efficiency is one of the key priorities for AMD. \"We are aligned with India's sustainability goals. We believe performance shouldn't come at the expense of higher power consumption. AMD plays a crucial role in enhancing data center energy efficiency by focusing on holistic design approaches,\" she said.\n\nIts goal is to maximize performance-per-watt, enabling data centers to achieve higher computing power with lower energy consumption, ultimately reducing operational costs and environmental impact.\n\nFor instance, AMD's 30x25 goal, announced in 2021, aims to achieve 30 times energy efficiency improvement for CPUs and GPU accelerators powering AI and high-performance computing (HPC) by 2025, compared to a 2020 baseline. \"Through architectural advancements and software optimizations, we have made significant progress, already reaching approximately 28.3 times energy efficiency improvement as of 2024,\" she explained.\n\nThese innovations not only cut energy consumption but also translate into significant cost savings for data centers. AMD-powered servers consume up to 20 percent less power than competitors, helping organizations reduce operational expenses while lowering their carbon footprint.\n\nBeyond data centers, AMD is focused on defense, military, aerospace, and telecommunications \u2014 both wired and wireless communications. \"Additionally, we see significant growth opportunities in the industrial market, where our solutions are helping drive digital transformation and operational excellence,\" she concluded, sharing insights into the 2025 outlook.",

            "content": "In the latest round of machine learning benchmark results from MLCommons, computers built around Nvidia\u2019s new Blackwell GPU architecture outperformed all others. But AMD\u2019s latest spin on its Instinct GPUs, the MI325, proved a match for the Nvidia H200, the product it was meant to counter. The comparable results were mostly on tests of one of the smaller-scale large language models, Llama2 70B (for 70 billion parameters). However, in an effort to keep up with a rapidly changing AI landscape, MLPerf added three new benchmarks to better reflect where machine learning is headed.\n\nMLPerf runs benchmarking for machine learning systems in an effort to provide an apples-to-apples comparison between computer systems. Submitters use their own software and hardware, but the underlying neural networks must be the same. There are a total of 11 benchmarks for servers now, with three added this year.\n\nIt has been \u201chard to keep up with the rapid development of the field,\u201d says Miro Hodak, the cochair of MLPerf Inference. ChatGPT appeared only in late 2022, OpenAI unveiled its first large language model (LLM) that can reason through tasks last September, and LLMs have grown exponentially\u2014GPT3 had 175 billion parameters, while GPT4 is thought to have nearly 2 trillion. As a result of the breakneck innovation, \u201cwe\u2019ve increased the pace of getting new benchmarks into the field,\u201d says Hodak.\n\nThe new benchmarks include two LLMs. The popular and relatively compact Llama2 70B is already an established MLPerf benchmark, but the consortium wanted something that mimicked the responsiveness people are expecting of chatbots today. So the new benchmark \u201cLlama2-70B Interactive\u201d tightens the requirements. Computers must produce at least 25 tokens per second under any circumstance and cannot take more than 450 milliseconds to begin an answer.\n\nSeeing the rise of \u201cagentic AI\u201d\u2014networks that can reason through complex tasks\u2014MLPerf sought to test an LLM that would have some of the characteristics needed for that. They chose Llama3.1 405B for the job. That LLM has what\u2019s called a wide context window. That\u2019s a measure of how much information\u2014documents, samples of code, et cetera\u2014it can take in at once. For Llama3.1 405B, that\u2019s 128,000 tokens, more than 30 times as much as Llama2 70B.\n\nThe final new benchmark, called RGAT, is what\u2019s called a graph attention network. It acts to classify information in a network. For example, the dataset used to test RGAT consists of scientific papers, which all have relationships between authors, institutions, and fields of study, making up 2 terabytes of data. RGAT must classify the papers into just under 3,000 topics.\n\nBlackwell, Instinct Results\n\nNvidia continued its domination of MLPerf benchmarks through its own submissions and those of some 15 partners, such as Dell, Google, and Supermicro. Both its first- and second-generation Hopper architecture GPUs\u2014the H100 and the memory-enhanced H200\u2014made strong showings. \u201cWe were able to get another 60 percent performance over the last year\u201d from Hopper, which went into production in 2022, says Dave Salvator, director of accelerated computing products at Nvidia. \u201cIt still has some headroom in terms of performance.\u201d\n\nBut it was Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell architecture GPU, the B200, that really dominated. \u201cThe only thing faster than Hopper is Blackwell,\u201d says Salvator. The B200 packs in 36 percent more high-bandwidth memory than the H200, but, even more important, it can perform key machine learning math using numbers with a precision as low as 4 bits instead of the 8 bits Hopper pioneered. Lower-precision compute units are smaller, so more fit on the GPU, which leads to faster AI computing.\n\nIn the Llama3.1 405B benchmark, an eight-B200 system from Supermicro delivered nearly four times the tokens per second of an eight-H200 system by Cisco. And the same Supermicro system was three times as fast as the quickest H200 computer at the interactive version of Llama2 70B.\n\nNvidia used its combination of Blackwell GPUs and Grace CPU, called GB200, to demonstrate how well its NVL72 data links can integrate multiple servers in a rack, so they perform as if they were one giant GPU. In an unverified result the company shared with reporters, a full rack of GB200-based computers delivers 869,200 tokens per second on Llama2 70B. The fastest system reported in this round of MLPerf was an Nvidia B200 server that delivered 98,443 tokens per second.\n\nAMDis positioning its latest Instinct GPU, the MI325X, as providing performance competitive with Nvidia\u2019s H200. MI325X has the same architecture as its predecessor, MI300, but it adds even more high-bandwidth memory and memory bandwidth\u2014256 gigabytes and 6 terabytes per second (a 33 percent and 13 percent boost, respectively).\n\nAdding more memory is a play to handle larger and larger LLMs. \u201cLarger models are able to take advantage of these GPUs because the model can fit in a single GPU or a single server,\u201d says Mahesh Balasubramanian, director of data-center GPU marketing at AMD. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have to have that communication overhead of going from one GPU to another GPU or one server to another server. When you take out those communications, your latency improves quite a bit.\u201d AMD was able to take advantage of the extra memory through software optimization to boost the inference speed of DeepSeek-R1 eightfold.\n\nOn the Llama2 70B test, an eight-GPU MI325X computers came within 3 to 7 percent the speed of a similarly tricked-out H200-based system. And on image generation the MI325X system was within 10 percent of the Nvidia H200 computer.\n\nAMD\u2019s other noteworthy mark this round was from its partner, Mangoboost, which showed nearly fourfold performance on the Llama2 70B test by doing the computation across four computers.\n\nIntel has historically put forth CPU-only systems in the inference competition to show that for some workloads you don\u2019t really need a GPU. This time around saw the first data from Intel\u2019s Xeon 6 chips, which were formerly known as Granite Rapids and are made using Intel\u2019s 3-nanometer process. At 40,285 samples per second, the best image-recognition results for a dual-Xeon 6 computer was about one-third the performance of a Cisco computer with two Nvidia H100s.\n\nCompared with Xeon 5 results from October 2024, the new CPU provides about an 80 percent boost on that benchmark and an even bigger boost on object detection and medical imaging. Since it first started submitting Xeon results in 2021 (the Xeon 3), the company has achieved an elevenfold boost in performance on Resnet.\n\nFor now, it seems Intel has quit the field in the AI accelerator-chip battle. Its alternative to the Nvidia H100, Gaudi 3, did not make an appearance in the new MLPerf results, nor in version 4.1, released last October. Gaudi 3 got a later-than-planned release because its software was not ready. In the opening remarks at Intel Vision 2025, the company\u2019s invite-only customer conference, newly minted CEO Lip-Bu Tan seemed to apologize for Intel\u2019s AI efforts. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with our current position,\u201d he told attendees. \u201cYou\u2019re not happy either. I hear you loud and clear. We are working toward a competitive system. It won\u2019t happen overnight, but we will get there for you.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019sTPU v6e chip also made a showing, though the results were restricted to the image-generation task. At 5.48 queries per second, the 4-TPU system saw a 2.5-times boost over a similar computer using its predecessor TPU v5e in the October 2024 results. Even so, 5.48 queries per second was roughly in line with a similarly sized Lenovo computer using Nvidia H100s.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis post was corrected on 2 April 2025 to give the right value for high-bandwidth memory in the MI325X.",

            "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -4.75%) is one of the world's leading suppliers of chips for data centers, personal computers, and even cars. The data center business is the company's main focus right now, as it tries to compete with Nvidia in the market for graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used to develop artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAMD has won several of Nvidia's top customers since launching its first AI GPU, Instinct MI300 series, in late 2023, and it continues to release new versions with more processing power. Last month, data center giant Oracle announced it placed a large, multibillion-dollar order for one of AMD's upcoming GPUs, which hasn't even hit the market yet.\n\nAMD's data center business is coming off a record year in 2024, and 2025 is shaping up to be even better. Its stock currently looks like a great value, so here's why now might be an excellent time to buy.\n\nOracle placed a huge order for AMD's latest chips\n\nAMD's first AI GPU, the MI300X, was designed to rival Nvidia's H100, which dominated the industry in 2023 and for most of 2024. It has attracted several buyers, including Oracle, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms, some of which are yielding better performance and lower costs compared to using the H100. AMD has since launched the more powerful MI325X to compete with Nvidia's newer GPUs, and it will release a whole new lineup this year called the MI350 series.\n\nIn order for AI software applications to become \"smarter,\" the models at their foundation need to become bigger, which means developers need more computing power. Oracle's Gen2 cloud data centers are some of the most efficient in the world for AI training and AI inference. Not only do they use the latest GPUs from Nvidia and AMD, but they also run on Oracle's random direct memory access (RDMA) networking technology, which moves data from one point to another much faster than traditional Ethernet networks.\n\nSince most AI developers pay for computing power by the minute, faster processing can translate into substantial cost savings, which is why industry leaders like OpenAI, Cohere, Meta, and Elon Musk's xAI are using Gen2 infrastructure.\n\nOn a conference call with investors on March 10, Oracle chairman Larry Ellison said the company placed a multibillion-dollar order to buy 30,000 of AMD's upcoming MI355X GPUs. These chips haven't even started shipping yet, and won't ship in any meaningful volume until mid-year.\n\nBut there's a clear reason Oracle wants to be at the front of the line: The MI355X is based on AMD's new CDNA (Compute DNA) 4 architecture, which delivers 35 times more performance than the older CNDA 3-based chips like the MI300X. Simply put, they could perform as well -- or maybe even better -- than Nvidia's latest Blackwell chips, which have become the benchmark for AI development.\n\nAMD's data center business is coming off a record year\n\nAMD generated $25.8 billion in total revenue during 2024. Its data center business accounted for almost half of that, bringing in a record $12.6 billion, which was a whopping 94% increase compared to the prior year.\n\nAMD CEO Lisa Su said GPU sales specifically represented $5 billion of the data center segment's total revenue, but she believes that will scale into the tens of billions annually over the next few years. Oracle's massive order of MI355X GPUs is just one example that proves she might be right.\n\nBut AMD has also become a top supplier of AI chips for personal computers, which helped drive its \"client\" segment to a record $7 billion in revenue during 2024. That was a 52% jump from 2023, and this will be a key business unit to watch because AMD's chips will allow more AI workloads to run on devices. This reduces reliance on external data centers, and creates a faster, more convenient experience when using chatbots and other AI software.\n\nOn the flip side, the remainder of AMD's 2024 revenue came from its gaming and embedded segments, which shrank by 58% and 33% on the year, respectively. The gaming business should get a boost in the next few quarters from the recent launch of AMD's new Radeon 9070 GPU, which has received excellent reviews so far. The outlook for the embedded segment is less clear, but the company does expect growth in 2025.\n\nAMD stock looks like a good value right now\n\nBased on AMD's $3.31 in non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per share (EPS) in 2024, its stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31.2, as of this writing. That makes AMD much cheaper than Nvidia, which trades at a P/E ratio of 36.7.\n\nMoreover, according to Yahoo! Finance, Wall Street's consensus estimate suggests AMD's EPS could rise to $4.67 in 2025. That places its stock at a forward P/E ratio of 22.1, which means it would have to soar by 41% this year just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 31.2.\n\nWe already know 2025 is shaping up to be a record year for AI data center spending. Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms plan to spend over $300 billion (combined) on infrastructure and chips by the end of the year, according to their own forecasts. That doesn't even include spending from other AI giants like Oracle, OpenAI, and Tesla, to name a few.\n\nConsidering AMD's current valuation, soaring data center revenue, and potential growth in 2025 (and beyond), this could be a great time for investors to swoop in and buy the stock.",

However, for productivity use, it easily outperforms the other two Zen 5 X3D chips, and anything offered by Intel for that matter. AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D Review by Jacqueline Thomas \"The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D might be the most powerful gaming processor on the market right now, but that doesn\u2019t mean it has a de facto lead on every other chip on the market. Most people will have no problem getting by with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which just so happens to be much much more affordable at $479. Instead, the 9950X3D is geared towards gamers that both play games and use creative apps like Photoshop and Premiere, the latter of which sees a 15% performance improvement over the 9800X3D. For a pure gaming PC build, though, you\u2019re probably better off saving that extra $220 for a better graphics card.\" The Gamer's Choice: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU",

They obtained data by primary data collection and from the literature from January 2021 to March 2022.\n\nPatients over 50 years of age in Bulgaria, Germany and the US who had late-stage AMD (neovascular AMD or any form of geographic atrophy [GA]) in one or both eyes and caregivers who cared for patient diagnosed with late-stage AMD were recruited through ophthalmologic clinics. Recruitment in Bulgaria and Germany were via online newsletters and through social media in the US, the investigators described.\n\nThe main outcomes were the direct disease-related health care expenditures, indirect medical costs such as care support and assistive technology, well-being cost (loss of well-being) and productivity cost (loss of productivity due to the disease for patients and caregivers).\n\nEconomic findings\n\nA total of 128 patients (80 women) with late-stage AMD were included; 120 patients (94%) were aged 60 years or older. Sixty-one caregivers (43 women) were included, of whom 55 were 45 years or older.\n\nThe main findings in the study were as follows. \u201cThe estimated per-annum total costs attributable to late-stage AMD were \u20ac449.5 million ($512.5 million) in Bulgaria, \u20ac7.6 billion ($8.6 billion) in Germany, and \u20ac43.2 billion ($49.4 billion) in the US. Across all countries, 10% to 13% of the total cost incurred was attributed to direct medical costs. In Germany and Bulgaria, the biggest contributor to the total economic burden was reduced well-being (67% and 76%, respectively); in the US, loss of productivity (42%) was the biggest contributor,\u201d Paudel and colleagues reported.\n\nThe study findings showed the substantial burden of late-stage AMD on patients and caregivers in the areas surveyed. \u201cAcross the 3 countries, reduced well-being and loss of productivity were relatively large contributors to the total economic burden. Direct medical costs contributed to a relatively small portion of the total cost. Implementing measures to reduce the AMD incidence, delay disease progression, and alleviate humanistic burden may help reduce the economic burden of late-stage AMD.\n\n\u201cThese findings suggest an urgent need to identify strategies to minimise the costs and impact for patients, caregivers, and society. Raising awareness and improving early detection and access to vision rehabilitation services could help mitigate some of the indirect costs imposed by vision loss due to late-stage AMD. Access to current and future therapies for late-stage AMD, including both neovascular AMD and GA, holds promise for reducing the projected increase in AMD burden amid global aging populations,\u201d the authors concluded.\n\nReferences:",

            "content": "Previous-Generation Cards\n\nNormally, I\u2019d recommend a previous generation card, but the RTX 40 Series and AMD 7000 cards are almost entirely out of stock or massively marked up at major retailers. There are still a few older-generation cards you can pick up relatively easily, and they\u2019re some of the only options under $500, with newer generations only having the more expensive cards live. These cards are squarely targeting 1,920 x 1,080 for gaming, so don\u2019t get your hopes up if you have a higher resolution or refresh rate.\n\nAMD\n\nBefore the 50 Series launch, I was using a Sapphire Pulse 7900 XT, a card I would love to recommend now, as it served me well for two years at 3,440 x 1,440 and was under $700 in June 2023. Unfortunately, it\u2019s currently hard to find in stock, and restocks will slow down considerably now that the new AMD cards are on the market.\n\nInstead, I'd reach a little further down the power scale and grab an RX 7600. While I haven't spent time with this model, I\u2019ve been historically pleased with Sapphire\u2019s cards, and it should be fairly capable at 1080p in older titles, indie games, and great for your average evening of Rocket League or Minecraft.\n\nAgain, this card isn\u2019t going to push 1440p, especially in newer games, and it\u2019s going to lack some of the features you\u2019re seeing on the latest and greatest GPUs. It should get you down the road until things have hopefully calmed down a bit, though.\n\nNvidia\n\nAs of early April 2025, the only previous-generation card I can consistently find in stock from Nvidia is the RTX 4060, a GPU which is also approaching two years on the market. It was a capable card at 1080p, but it doesn't keep up quite as well with today\u2019s games, and you'll have to turn the settings down to even consider 1440p.\n\nOf the available picks, I like the MSI GeForce RTX 4060 Ventus 2X Black, a compact card with a low power requirement that should fit into basically any modern system. MSI has a great track record for reliable, straightforward graphics cards, and this one is in stock and recently discounted.\n\nOf the two, I think the AMD is a better buy, even though it\u2019s performance is slightly less impressive on paper than the RTX 4060. At the sub-$500 price point, a $100 price difference can be massive, so keep an eye out for discounts to make sure you\u2019re getting the best deal, especially as these generations begin to close out.\n\nBuying Used\n\nWhen it comes to GPUs, I'm generally a fan of buying new. Not only will you ensure you have proper warranty and RMA support if something goes wrong, but it can be hard to know if someone misused the GPU, either through heavy crypto mining, poor temperature control in their system, or artifacts and issues they didn't disclose. I'm often a fan of buying used in other areas, but with demand and prices so high, it can be hard to trust strangers.\n\nIf you do buy used, make sure to do your legwork. Local meetups via Craigslist or Reddit can have great deals and give you a chance to inspect the GPU, even if you can't make sure it boots up. You can also ask for video proof of the card running a game that also includes the serial number in one continuous shot. If you\u2019re considering buying a used card online, make sure you\u2019re aware of the marketplace and payment processors' return and dispute policies.\n\nWhen you get the card home, inspect it immediately for any damage to the card, particularly on the PCIe fin and the power connectors. Once installed, a software tool called GPU-Z can verify the card\u2019s hardware to make sure it matches the expected numbers for the model. Run some games on it right away, so that if anything is wrong you can reach out to the seller right away.",

Even though in both cases, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D died, they are both different in regard to the damage incurred.\n\nIn the previous case, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D was damaged without any signs of damage, but this one literally exploded. Surprisingly, both had the same motherboard model: ASRock X870 PRO RS, and it's no surprise that most X3D CPU failures have been reported on ASRock motherboards.\n\nImage Credit: reddit.com\n\nThe user reported that his system was only three weeks old, and he bought the CPU from Micro Center. The system didn't show any unusual signs, but the CPU was running somewhat hotter than usual even on ideal with 50-58 degrees Celcius. This was despite using a decent AIO cooler. The system did fine on light workloads and gaming, but as per the user, he tried to increase the load to see if there was anything wrong with the system.\n\nImage Credit: reddit.com\n\nAfter several hours, he found his system had turned off and didn't post despite removing the GPU. Upon removing the CPU from the socket, he found a bulge on the CPU, revealing that his 9950X3D had died. The motherboard pins weren't bent or damaged but were discolored due to high voltage/temperature.\n\nThis is similar to what we saw in one such incident where ASRock reported that their motherboard worked totally fine, and they found no damage to the socket, but rather it was debris that caused the death of the CPU. However, such incidents show that there is something wrong with how the voltage is managed and supplied to the CPUs on ASRock motherboards, particularly the 800 series.\n\nNonetheless, these incidents are replicated on motherboards by other vendors. ASRock still leads all of them as we saw that the majority of the 100+ reported cases were on ASRock motherboards. The question is why hasn't this issue been deeply investigated yet, as we see such cases almost every other day.\n\nNews Source: Reddit",

            "content": "If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). This company, which is in the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\n\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this chipmaker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 1.48%, on average, in the last two quarters.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, Advanced Micro came out with earnings of $1.09 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07 per share, representing a surprise of 1.87%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.91 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.92 per share, delivering a surprise of 1.10%.\n\nPrice and EPS Surprise\n\nWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Advanced Micro. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nAdvanced Micro currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.01%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\n7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days\n\nJust released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys.

ZT, a major server designer with over $10 billion in annual revenue, brings 1,000 engineers into AMD's camp, instantly beefing up its capabilities in full-system integration. This deal isn't just about chips anymore. As CEO Lisa Su put it, customers now need the whole packageand AMD plans to deliver exactly that to cloud titans like Microsoft and Meta Platforms.\n\nWhile Nvidia has been building its AI factory empire around a tightly controlled, end-to-end model, AMD is betting on openness. Su made it clear AMD isn't trying to own every piece of the stackbut rather, to give customers the building blocks and freedom to choose what fits best. In an era where hardware demands for AI are rising exponentially, that flexibility could be a powerful differentiator. As AI workloads get more complex, hyperscalers are looking for suppliers who can move fast, integrate deeply, and avoid vendor lock-in. AMD's open approach may be the edge it needs.\n\nThe ZT deal follows AMD's earlier buys of Xilinx and Pensandosignaling a clear roadmap toward full-stack AI and cloud solutions. The manufacturing arm of ZT will be sold off, but the engineering brains stay in-house, boosting AMD's Data Center Solutions unit. Su also echoed a broader theme heard across the industry: we're still in the early innings of AI adoption, and demand is surging far faster than expected. With this move, AMD is positioning itself not just as a chip supplierbut as a serious contender in powering the next generation of AI data centers.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

The conflict between RISC and CISC chip instruction sets (ISAs) \u2014 \"reduced\" designs versus \"complex\" ones \u2014 rages on to this day with RISC-V.\n\nFor the past few years, AMD has been exploring a unique approach to speeding up some of its processors with 3D V-Cache, a technology that stacks more L3 cache on top of Ryzen cores. By doing so, the company avoids crowding the 2D plane of its chips, and it's able to cram in more memory without making its CPUs larger. With the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, AMD has now evolved 3D V-Cache to the point where every hardcore gamer will want one \u2014 even if few people actually need a $700 CPU.\n\n3D V-Cache first appeared in the Ryzen 5800X3D in 2022, and AMD brought it to laptops in 2023. While there were some obvious downsides initially \u2014 the 5800X3D had slower clock speeds than the standard Ryzen 5800 \u2014 AMD has steadily improved the technology. The Ryzen 7 7800X3D and Ryzen 9 7900X3D were both notable for reaching the same maximum clock speeds as their 2D counterparts. While AMD's second-generation 3D V-Cache technology isn't as big of a leap in the 9950X3D (and other recent chips like the 9900X3D and 9800X3D), the company has managed to overcome the few compromises it's had to make so far. Simply put, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is a beast of a CPU for gaming and productivity work alike.\n\nAMD 90 100 Expert Score Ryzen 9 9950X3D The 9950X3D is a powerhouse of a desktop processor, with tons of L3 cache to speed up gaming and no compromises for intensive productivity work. The only downside is its relatively high price. Pros Excellent performance\n\nNoticeable gaming improvements\n\nRelatively cool temperatures Cons Very expensive compared to other desktop CPUs $700 at Best Buy\n\nWhat's new in the Ryzen 9 9950X3D?\n\nThe 9950X3D is a 16-core processor with a 4.3GHz base clock speed and a boost speed of 5.7GHz, just like its 2D sibling the 9950X. The big difference between the two is in their total L2 and L3 cache: the 9950X has 80MB, while the 3D V-Cache technology crams 144MB in the 9950X3D. By having more cache, the 9950X3D is able to tackle more processing loads without hitting RAM, which could take eight to 10 times as long, according to Robert Hallock, AMD's former director of technical marketing (he's now serving as VP and GM of Intel's Enthusiast Channel Segment).\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\nThe major upgrade in the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, in addition to being powered by AMD's new Zen 5 cores, lies in the positioning of its 3D V-Cache layer. Previously, it sat on top of Zen 3 and Zen 4 cores, which slightly hindered cooling and overall performance. Now, the 3D V-Cache layer sits below the 9950X3D's Zen 5 cores, which gives those hotter elements direct access to your CPU fan\u2019s heatsink. The 9950X3D has the same 170 Watt TDP (Thermal Design Profile) as its 2D variant, so cooling shouldn't be a huge problem, and unlike most other 3D V-Cache chips, it's also fully overclockable.\n\nDevindra Hardawar for Engadget\n\nIn-use: An absolute powerhouse\n\nI expected the Ryzen 9 9950X3D to wallop every other PC CPU I've tested, but I didn't expect the leap to be so dramatic. In the Geekbench 6 single-threaded CPU benchmark, it was 20 percent faster than the Ryzen 9 7900X I was previously using. The 9950X3D was also 33 percent faster in the same benchmark's multi-threaded test. (I didn't have a 7950X3D for direct comparison, but based on a median of scores from 3DMark users, it hits 14,290 points. The 9950X3D reached 17,025, or 19 percent faster, in my testing)\n\nCPU GeekBench 6 CPU 3DMark CPU Profile Cinebench 2024 AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 3,366/18,950 17,025 Max 134/2,124 AMD Ryzen 9 7900X 2,822/14,216 12,553 Max 113/1,103 Apple M4 Max 4,090/26,394 N/A 190/2066 Apple M2 Ultra 2,776/21,403 N/A N/A\n\nI've only seen better scores from Apple's hardware. The M4 chip is slightly faster for single-threaded tasks, while the M4 Max and M2 Ultra chips in the Mac Studio trounce AMD's multi-threaded Geekbench 6 scores. Still, you could build a solid Ryzen 9 system for far less than the Mac Studio M4 Max's $2,000 starting cost, even while accounting for the 9950X3D's $700 price tag.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\nApple doesn't always come out ahead. In the Cinebench 2024 multi-threaded benchmark, the 9950X3D slightly surpassed the M4 Max chip. That result is also a sign that AMD's flagship chip will be a big help for Windows-based content creators. The 9950X3D and the M4 Max both took 14 seconds to transcode a 4K clip into 1080p, which is the fastest result we've ever seen.\n\nThe major appeal of the 9950X3D is that it'll also be able to handle demanding games over the next few years without bottlenecking high-end GPUs like NVIDIA's RTX 5080 and 5090. On my system, which is using an RTX 5090 and 64GB of RAM, the 9950X3D reached 195 fps in Cyberpunk 2077 while playing in 1080p with high graphics settings. The Ryzen 9 7900X, on the other hand, hit 166 fps with the same GPU and RAM. You'll see less of an immediate uplift at higher resolutions, where your video card is doing more of the work. Cyberpunk hit 64 fps in 4K without DLSS upscaling on the 9950X3D, while it struggled to reach 56 fps on the 7900X with the same settings.\n\nFor 4K, in particular, the 9950X3D could be useful for scaling performance for monitors with faster refresh rates. On the 7900X, Dragon Age: The Veilguard ran at a smooth 250 fps in 4K with graphics settings and frame generation cranked up, but with the newer chip I saw 270 fps. If you\u2019re running a 4K 240Hz monitor with a less powerful GPU, you\u2019ll likely have a better shot of edging close to 240 fps thanks to 3D V-Cache.\n\nGiven all of its power, I was surprised to find that the 9950X3D ran at a relatively cool 81.5 Celsius at 100 percent load. It also idles between 30C and 35C, depending on what you\u2019re doing. Those results are pretty impressive for a CPU that can push up to 170 Watts.\n\nDevindra Hardawar for Engadget\n\nShould you buy the Ryzen 9 9950X3D?\n\nMuch like NVIDIA's $2,000 RTX 5090, I can't easily recommend the $700 Ryzen 9 9950X3D to most people. Most gamers would likely be better off with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which sells for a more reasonable $479. Sure, it has half as many cores, but the majority of titles don't tap into many of those to begin with. There's also the $600 12-core 9900X3D, which could be more useful for people who actually need a healthy amount of CPU cores.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\nYou could of course consider AMD's current chips without 3D V-Cache, like the Ryzen 7 9700X, which has an MSRP of $359 but is currently selling for under $300. But if you're already in the market for an expensive video card, it's likely worth paying a bit extra to get more L3 cache. When AMD first debuted the 5800X3D, the company claimed 3D V-Cache alone boosted 1080p performance by 15 percent. As games get more complex and demanding, having more available cache could be even more useful. (And it's also easier to pay more for a better chip now than buying a new one in a few years.)\n\nAs for Intel, it only has plans to bring its version of the technology, dubbed Local Cache, to next-generation Xeon server chips, according to der8auer and Bens Hardware (via Tom's Hardware). Intel's current high-end desktop chip, the 24-core i9-14900K, is no gaming slouch, but it's saddled with just 36MB of L3 cache.\n\nWrap-up\n\nIf anything, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is yet another sign that AMD is on a hot streak. After releasing a pair of excellent midrange GPUs, which showed that the company can genuinely go toe-to-toe with NVIDIA, this CPU and its accompanying 3D V-Cache technology is a reminder of how AMD is far ahead of Intel in many ways. And let\u2019s not forget that it was also the first x86 chipmaker to include NPUs in laptop and desktop CPUs. While it\u2019s certainly not the best deal around, if you can afford it, the 9950X3D is the best desktop CPU you can buy today.",

The global ShORe phase 3 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of intravitreally administered 2 mg sozinibercept every 4 or 8 weeks in combination with 0.5 mg ranibizumab every 4 weeks, as per label, versus 0.5 mg ranibizumab monotherapy.\n\nResults from the trial showed that participants receiving sozinibercept combination therapy with a dosing regimen of every 4 weeks (n=301) or every 8 weeks (n=301) achieved a mean change in BCVA of 13.3 or 12.9 letters from baseline to week 52, respectively, versus 14.2 letters with ranibizumab monotherapy (n=299, P-values of 0.35 and 0.19, respectively). While, in the overall population, participants receiving sozinibercept combination therapy with a dosing regimen of every 4 weeks (n=328) or every 8 weeks (n=326) achieved a mean change in BCVA of 13.3 and 12.6 letters from baseline to week 52, respectively, versus 14.3 letters with ranibizumab monotherapy (n=331; P-values of 0.32 and 0.09, respectively).\n\nFrederic Guerard, PharmD, CEO of Opthea, commented on the decision to discontinue the trials in a press release from the company.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed that COAST and ShORe did not demonstrate the improvements in vision with sozinibercept combination therapy compared to standard of care that we had hoped for,\u201d said Guerard. \u201cWe are grateful to all patients, clinical investigators and their staff around the world who participated in the sozinibercept Phase 3 clinical program, and for their contributions in investigating new treatments for wet AMD.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, Opthea has been assessing its rights and obligations under its Development Funding Agreement (DFA) with the investors under the DFA, among others. The company updated this by saying Opthea and DFA Investors agreed to discontinue the development of sozinibercept in wet AMD with immediate effect, and that this decision did not constitute a termination event under the DFA resulting in any amount payable by Opthea. A termination event would cause Opthea to pay investors up to 4 times the amounts paid to the company under the DFA.\n\nThe company did note, however, that it remains possible under the DFA, in certain circumstances upon or following termination of the DFA, Opthea could become required to pay a multiple of the amount funded by the DFA Investors that would have a \u201cmaterial adverse impact on the solvency of the company.\u201d Termination can be triggered by a range of events, including, among other things, Opthea\u2019s insolvency, in which case Opthea will be obligated to pay a multiple of the amounts funded by the DFA Investors.\n\nThe company noted that it is currently relying on the \"safe harbor\" provisions in section 588GA of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and that trading in Opthea\u2019s listed securities will be suspended by ASX under ASX Listing Rule 17.3 until the company is in a position to provide an announcement to the market providing more clarity on these issues and the impact on its financial position.\n\nReferences:",

These include PCs from HP Inc., Dell Technologies, Lenovo, Asus and others.\n\n[Related: Opinion: Why 2025 Will Be An Important Year For AI PCs]\n\nMicrosoft said some of these features will be made available in the March 2025 Windows non-security preview update. The company plans to \u201cgradually roll out these features with the Windows controlled feature rollout to consumers\u201d over the next month.\n\nWhile Microsoft is making Copilot+ PC functions generally available for PCs powered by Intel Core Ultra 200V and AMD Ryzen AI 300 chips, these devices don\u2019t represent all Intel- and AMD-based computers coming to the market this year.\n\nThat\u2019s because the Core Ultra 200V and Ryzen AI 300 processors are the only chip families from Intel and AMD so far to come with a neural processing unit (NPU) that meets Microsoft Copilot+ PC requirement for performing a minimum of 40 trillion operations per second (TOPS). This means new PCs powered by other processor lines like Intel\u2019s Core Ultra 200U series or AMD\u2019s Ryzen 200 series won\u2019t get Copilot+ PC features\u2014unless Microsoft decides to change the requirements at some point.\n\nNevertheless, the move expands the availability of Copilot+ PC features beyond computers that are powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X processors, which were the exclusive launch chips for Microsoft\u2019s AI PC program last June.\n\nAt the same time, Microsoft said on Monday that Qualcomm-based Copilot+ PCs are getting an update to Windows 11\u2019s Voice Access feature that won\u2019t be available for compatible x86-based systems until later this year.\n\nMade available in the Windows 11, version 22H2 update, the updated Voice Access lets users control their PC \u201cusing more descriptive and flexible language\u201d in voice command by taking advantage of the processor\u2019s NPU, according to Microsoft.\n\n\u201cThis can reduce the challenges faced when learning complex steps, commands and syntax that voice access previously required,\u201d the company said.\n\nWhich Copilot+ PC Features Work With Intel, AMD Chips?\n\nThe Copilot+ PC features available for compatible x86-based devices include Live Captions, which provides \u201creal-time translations in English for audio and video content during meetings, podcasts or video playback\u201d; and Cocreator in Paint, which transforms sketches and text prompts into more sophisticated artwork.\n\nThe other two features are available in Microsoft\u2019s Photos application: Restyle Image lets users apply different art styles to images while Image Creator enables users to create visuals based on detailed prompts.\n\nOther Copilot+ PC Features Still In Testing Phase\n\nThe Copilot+ PC capabilities coming to x86-based devices are only a subset of the features Microsoft has announced over the past several months.\n\nOne feature that has yet to become generally available for all Copilot+ PCs is Recall, which was supposed to be the flagship function of such devices when they launched last June.\n\nWith Recall, Microsoft promises to provide users with a better way of finding things they accessed or viewed on their computer. The feature accomplishes this by letting users perform a natural language search against screenshots that are taken every few seconds.\n\nHowever, Microsoft decided to delay Recall\u2019s release shortly after revealing it last May due to concerns raised by privacy and security experts about how creating a central store of screenshots could give a bad actor easy access to all sorts of sensitive information.\n\nThe company has used the delay to add new security safeguards for Recall, including requirements for Windows features such as virtualization-based security and Windows Hello for biometric authentication.\n\nAfter making Recall available for members of the Windows Insider Program near the end of last year, Microsoft said the feature is now set for launch in \u201cearly 2025.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a second wave of Copilot+ PC features that consist of a contextual overlay called Click to Do, an improved Windows search, and an AI-based photo upscaling feature called super resolution are set to arrive on Qualcomm-based PCs in early 2025 and on Intel- and AMD-based PCs in mid-2025, according to Microsoft.",

(NASDAQ:AMD) and its ranking among the top picks.\n\nThe stock market has an ever-changing environment, leaving investors constantly looking for opportunities that promise substantial returns for their investments. Gaining a consistent placement in the portfolio of such investors is a growth stock. These growth stocks have historically been highly valued among investors seeking high investment returns. However, another essential characteristic of a growth stock is the risk proportional to its level of return. In other words, growth stocks may deliver significant capital appreciation but have heightened volatility.\n\nChanges often influence the volatility of growth stocks in market conditions. In this regard, the U.S. market conditions underwent many changes soon after the new U.S. president entered the Oval Office. The new tariffs brought into practice have created tension between the U.S. and its neighboring countries, including Mexico and Canada. CNBC has reported that owing to the change in tariffs, the price of many commodities, including cars, has risen. It heavily impacted the U.S. stock market. Even the tech industry, which garnered high expectations, saw a decline since the beginning of 2025, though investors still regard many companies in the industry as worthy investments.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Most Popular AI Penny Stocks to Buy Under $5\n\nWhile investors fear a potential rise in inflation and recession in the following months, some growth stocks are performing better while accumulating a high risk level. Compared to other stocks, their performance must be considered before deciding to welcome these stocks into the portfolio.\n\nDuring the past decade, growth stocks have significantly outperformed their value counterparts. A report by Vanguard stated that during the last 10 years, the U.S. growth stocks have performed better than the U.S. value stocks by an average of 7.8% per year. The upward trend increases the attractiveness of growth stocks for those seeking high returns.\n\nOn the other hand, stock markets can be cyclical, with growth and value stocks shifting their leadership roles in the market. The cyclical nature suggests that growth stocks may enjoy periods of dominance, but they are not to be mistaken as immune to market rotations, which may favor value stocks.\n\nA proper approach is necessary when investing in high-risk, high-reward growth stocks. The growth stocks may either belong to companies in emerging industries or be in possession of innovative products or services that could quickly attract the market. Though investors may be attracted to the stocks\u2019 potential for substantial gains, they also need to be cautious of the associated risks, and hence, the approach should involve thorough research and a well-considered investment strategy.",

            "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has given investors plenty to be concerned about, as its shares have continued their downward trend this year. Despite delivering record-breaking revenues and healthy profit margins in Q4 2024, the market response has been lukewarm at best. The end result? A 43% plunge in AMD\u2019s share price over the past 12 months.\n\nSure, broader market headwinds \u2013 ranging from global uncertainty to rising trade tensions and the fallout from DeepSeek \u2013 have played a role. But AMD didn\u2019t help its own case with a muted outlook for the current quarter. And with Nvidia continuing to dominate headlines and mindshare, AMD faces an uphill battle in capturing investor enthusiasm.\n\nHowever, one top investor, known by the pseudonym JR Research, believes the long-term bottom is in \u2013 and an opportunity is beckoning.\n\n\u201cAMD\u2019s valuations are arguably dirt cheap now, suggesting the market has arguably baked in a lot of doom and gloom,\u201d asserts the 5-star investor, who sits in the top 3% of TipRanks\u2019 stock pros.\n\nJR believes AMD\u2019s comeback story isn\u2019t just wishful thinking. With the company holding just around 10% of the AI data center chip market, the investor points out there\u2019s substantial room for growth \u2013 and a clear runway for long-term upside.\n\nJR also questions the assumption that AMD needs to beat back the industry-dominating Nvidia to enjoy lucrative advances, noting: \u201cAs seen with the gains made in 2024, it can still make dinks and chips at Nvidia\u2019s armor to gain share, as big tech likely seeks a diversion from getting locked into the ecosystem with Nvidia\u2019s expensive AI chips. AMD doesn\u2019t have to replace Nvidia to win.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a broader shift taking shape. Open-source AI solutions are gaining ground, particularly in China, where companies are increasingly looking beyond Nvidia. That trend could play right into AMD\u2019s hands, positioning the company as a compelling alternative.\n\nAnd while AI steals the spotlight, AMD\u2019s CPU business continues to deliver. In Q4, revenue from its client segment surged 58% year-over-year to a record $2.3 billion, thanks largely to growing demand for Ryzen chips. JR sees this arm of the business as a stabilizer that could help power AMD\u2019s rebound.\n\n\u201cAMD\u2019s bullish thesis is showing signs of life,\u201d concludes JR Research, who rates AMD shares a Buy. (To watch JR Research\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nFor the most part, Wall Street seems to agree with this approach. With 24 Buy, 12 Hold, and 1 Sell recommendations, AMD boasts a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Its 12-month average price target of $147.19 would yield gains north of 40% in the coming year.

The trial did not meet its primary endpoint of mean change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline to week 52.\n\n\"We are disappointed that COAST and ShORe did not demonstrate the improvements in vision with sozinibercept combination therapy compared to standard of care that we had hoped for,\" said Frederic Guerard, PharmD, Chief Executive Officer of Opthea.\n\nOpthea announced that the company and the DFA Investors agreed to discontinue the development of sozinibercept in wet AMD with immediate effect, and that this decision did not constitute a termination event under the DFA resulting in any amount payable by Opthea.\n\nIt remains possible that under the DFA, in certain circumstances upon or following termination of the DFA, Opthea could become required to pay a multiple of the amount funded by the DFA Investors that would have a material adverse impact on the solvency of the Company. Termination can be triggered by a range of events, including, among other things, Opthea's insolvency, in which case Opthea will be obligated to pay a multiple of the amounts funded by the DFA Investors.\n\nOpthea said it continues active discussions with the DFA Investors to explore possible options to deliver the best outcome for the Company and its shareholders.\n\nOpthea estimates it will have unaudited cash and cash equivalents of US$100 million at the end of March 2025.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

However, one cannot deny that the processor actually had physical damage, which was a clear sign of burn.\n\nThese cases were mostly related to Ryzen 7 9800X3D and the largest number of cases emerged from ASRock motherboard owners. Even though ASRock claims to have mitigated the issue by releasing a BIOS update previously, such reports are still emerging and this time, it's the flagship AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D processor. This might seem like the first case of 9950X3D failure, but apparently, it's not. We will talk about that one later, but this one seems more interesting for a few reasons.\n\nThe Redditor u/iksdeasdf posted that his Ryzen 9 9950X3D died within 9 days of usage on the ASRock Pro RX X870 motherboard. As per his claims, he ran the latest BIOS 3.20 and used the Kingston FURY 64 GB RAM Kit at 6000 MT. The problem appeared unexpectedly and suddenly. The user didn't claim that he turned on other manual overclocking for CPU but said that his PC suddenly froze and wouldn't boot anymore.\n\nImage Credit: reddit.com\n\nWhat's interesting is that his CPU didn't show any damage signs, but it is likely the CPU died and not the motherboard because the user did try turning on the system by installing his CPU on another motherboard from a different vendor, but that also didn't work. As per his claims, there was no explosion, no burn marks, or no signs of damage to the socket either. In case you are wondering if his CPU was running hot, he confirmed that the temperature was fine as well.\n\nSince his seller offers a 14-day return window, he was able to send it back to the seller without having to delve into the RMA process, which is quite tedious. Going back to what was apparently the first case of a 9950X3D failure, it wasn't on an ASRock motherboard but on the ASUS X870E Crosshair and apparently, it died the same way, silently, leaving no signs of physical damage. The motherboard was working with 9600X though, and therefore, there seems to be something off with 9000X3D processors, at least in these two cases.\n\nNews Sources: Reddit, Reddit",

This series isn\u2019t about a complete overhaul of desktop CPUs but rather a focused upgrade for APUs. The processors build on the performance seen in the Ryzen 9000 series, offering better integrated graphics and neural processing capabilities. Early indications point out that while the current Ryzen 8000G series (Phoenix) offers up to 8 cores and 16 threads, the new Ryzen 9000G might feature more cores or improved efficiency. It\u2019s clear that AMD is refining its existing architecture to better support both routine computing tasks and more demanding AI applications, all without completely changing the design playbook that has worked well in previous generations.\n\nOn the technical side, the Ryzen 9000G series is expected to include enhancements from RDNA 3.5 for graphics and XDNA 2 for additional processing capabilities. These updates were first seen in the Ryzen AI 300 series designed for notebooks, and they serve as a solid foundation for this new launch. The improvements in the integrated GPU and NPU performance are set to benefit users who rely on their systems for both standard operations and more graphics-intensive tasks. Although AMD hasn\u2019t released all the detailed specs yet\u2014such as benchmark numbers or thermal management insights\u2014the focus is on gradually improving energy efficiency and computational performance using the mature Zen 5 platform.\n\nLooking ahead, the Ryzen 9000G series is expected to be formally detailed during key industry events like Computex 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: hxl",

            "content": "It's been a rough 12 months for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -4.75%) shareholders. AMD stock peaked in early 2024, and it's been tumbling ever since. Right now, shares are down roughly 50% from that all-time high.\n\nThere are parts of AMD that are performing well and parts that have been struggling. Revenue and adjusted earnings are on the rise, but clearly, investors are worried about something.\n\nIs AMD stock a buy-the-dip opportunity? Or should investors steer clear?\n\nThe good: Server and PC CPUs\n\nAMD's core CPU business is booming. The company has been able to take advantage of a struggling Intel to grow its market share across the board. In the fourth quarter of 2024, AMD managed a 24.7% unit share and a 28.2% revenue share of the combined server and PC CPU markets. That's a dramatic increase from six years ago, particularly in the server CPU market.\n\nAMD's EPYC server CPUs have been a hit, and it was only recently that Intel was able to catch up in terms of core counts and performance with its Granite Rapids chips. In the PC CPU market, AMD's Ryzen CPUs have been growing in popularity. The company was handed a gift by Intel in the desktop CPU market with Arrow Lake, Intel's latest desktop chips. Arrow Lake suffered from lackluster gaming performance, making AMD an easy choice for many PC gamers.\n\nThe laptop CPU market is more competitive, and gaining market share requires winning over OEMs rather than selling directly to consumers. AMD has still gained plenty of ground, although Intel's efficient Lunar Lake chips and the mobile version of Arrow Lake are putting up a good fight.\n\nAMD's client segment revenue, which houses the PC CPU business, soared 58% year over year in the fourth quarter as the company gained share in a sluggish market. The data center segment grew revenue by 69%, although this segment also contains AI accelerators. Even so, AMD's EPYC chips were a key driver of that growth.\n\nThe bad: AI forecast, gaming, and embedded\n\nAMD is making a play for the AI accelerator market, and while billions in new revenue has materialized so far, growth is now coming under pressure. AI accelerator revenue topped $5 billion in 2024, but the company only expects \"strong double-digit growth\" this year.\n\nAMD isn't providing specific guidance beyond that rough estimate, which is likely not a good sign. The company sees a $500 billion total addressable market by 2028, but it's clearly struggling to steal away market share from Nvidia.\n\nOutside of AI, two of AMD's segments are having major problems. The gaming segment, which includes PC GPUs and semi-custom game console chips, saw revenue tumble 59% in the fourth quarter. Declining semi-custom chip revenue is a biggest issue as the current generation of game consoles age, but AMD's inability to gain ground in the gaming GPU market is also concerning.\n\nAMD's market share across the entire GPU market was just 10% in the third quarter of 2024, partly due to supply constraints, and partly due to Nvidia's continued dominance.\n\nAMD's embedded segment, which was supercharged by the mega-acquisition of Xilinx, is also suffering from sales declines. Revenue was down 13% in the fourth quarter and 33% for all of 2024, driven by weak end-market demand and excessive levels of customer inventory. The Xilinx deal was valued at roughly $50 billion, but the embedded segment is now generating less than $1 billion in revenue per quarter.\n\nIs AMD a buy?\n\nAMD stock trades for around 25 times the average analyst estimate for 2025 adjusted earnings per share. Given the company's current situation, the stock doesn't look particularly attractive, but it's not obviously overpriced, either.\n\nAMD's AI chip business is the biggest problem from a long-term growth perspective. The company isn't growing as fast as it needs to, given the size of the market and the seemingly bottomless demand for AI computing infrastructure. Weak AI chip growth this year puts a big dent in the company's growth story.\n\nIn the CPU business, AMD will need to contend with Intel, which has a new CEO who will likely shake things up. That could mean increased aggressiveness on pricing, quicker product development, and a newfound willingness to take risks. Intel has also completed development of the Intel 18A manufacturing process, which could give it an advantage once its future chips enter production.\n\nGiven AMD's valuation and a growth story that can best be described as a mixed bag, AMD stock doesn't look like the best opportunity right now. It's not a bad stock to own for the long term, but it's also far from a screaming buy.",

            "content": "Last CES saw AMD unveil its Ryzen 8000G lineup of APUs for AM5, bringing together speedy Zen 4 cores alongside the first RDNA-based graphics engine to desktops, succeeding their Vega-powered predecessors. Hardware leaker HXL suggests a potential successor is expected for a Q4 launch later this year, with the likely designation of Ryzen 9000G. Other details regarding the core architecture and silicon have not been detailed, so we'll primarily have to rely on guesswork.\n\nRyzen 8000G APUs were based on AMD's Phoenix silicon and featured Zen 4 cores, while some models down the stack included both Zen 4 and smaller Zen 4c cores. Similar to the Ryzen 7040 APUs for laptops, AMD equipped these processors with up to 12 RDNA 3-based CUs (Compute Units) capable of basic 1080p gaming. This is thanks to the inclusion of DDR5 support on AM5, which is also considered why AMD likely skipped porting Rembrandt to AM4, as it was limited to DDR4.\n\nZen 5-based mobile APUs are divided into Strix Point for the high-end and Krackan Point for the mid-range. AMD is expected to reuse the same silicon for the Ryzen 9000G family, giving us an inkling about the specs. Strix Point tops 12 hybrid cores (four Zen 5 + eight Zen 5c) in a dual-CCX layout, alongside a beefy 16 Compute Unit iGPU (Radeon 890M) based on RDNA 3.5.\n\nKrackan Point drops this to eight hybrid cores (four Zen 5 + four Zen 5c). While we're still awaiting die shots for confirmation, it's suggested that all eight hybrid cores in Krackan Point share the same 16MB cache pool (single-CCX), similar to AMD's budget Phoenix 2 offerings. We find a Radeon 860M solution on the graphics end, outfitted with eight RDNA 3.5-based Compute Units.\n\nBoth families have an XDNA 2 NPU capable of dishing 50 TOPS of AI performance. If our assumptions prove accurate, AMD might be in the running to deliver the first Copilot+ certified desktop offerings with these chips. As AMD reportedly plans a Strix Point refresh with Gorgon Point (Ryzen AI 400?) in 2026, they can leverage surplus Ryzen AI 300 silicon for Ryzen 9000G APUs.\n\nWhile still no more than a guess, this is a pretty significant uptick in specifications and, thus, performance over existing Phoenix APUs on desktops. It's unlikely, however, that we'll see something like Strix Halo ported to AM5 anytime soon, mainly due to its size, design, and cost. Ryzen 9000G is likely among the last Zen 5 offerings, as AMD is expected to march on to Zen 6 in 2026.",

It did release the Ryzen 8000G \"Phoenix\" APUs after releasing the Phoenix Point APUs for the mobile platform, but it has been quite a while since the launch of the Ryzen 9000 desktop CPUs as well as the Strix Point Zen 5 APUs.\n\nIt's usual for AMD to launch the APU family much later, but they eventually do make it to the desktop. Just like we had the Ryzen 2000G series, 3000G series, 5000G series, and 8000G series, AMD is rumored to launch the Ryzen 9000G series as well. The nomenclature isn't confirmed yet, but as per the prominent leaker @9550pro, AMD is set to launch a new APU series for the AM5 platform.\n\nAMD AM5 New APU\n\nMSI AM5 Unify-X MB \u2014 HXL (@9550pro) March 29, 2025\n\nThis series is reportedly coming in Q4 2025, but we have yet to hear from AMD. As far as the APU naming goes, previously AMD skipped the Ryzen 7000G naming convention and instead opted for the 8000G series, but this wasn't the case previously and likely not going to happen this time either.\n\nQ4 2025?\ud83e\udd14 \u2014 HXL (@9550pro) March 29, 2025\n\nAMD's Ryzen 9000G \"Strix\" APUs family is supposedly the Strix Point variant of the laptop series, which was launched in the second half of 2024. Going by the specs' comparison of the Ryzen 8000 Phoenix Point mobile APUs and the Ryzen 8000G series for desktops, it appears that AMD might release up to a 12-core Ryzen 9000G processor.\n\nThe highest we had on an APU is 8 cores and 16 threads, but since Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 features 12 cores and 24 threads, the supposed flagship Ryzen 9000G APU might feature the same core and thread count.\n\nThere will be a few changes in the specs as well, including the core clocks, which may be different on the desktop variants. Nonetheless, the iGPU will be the same and, based on the SKU, it could be either a Radeon 880M or Radeon 890M. The Radeon 890M is the fastest iGPU on the Strix Point, featuring 16 RDNA 3.5 cores and a clock of 2.9 GHz. The desktop variant can feature up to 3.0 GHz, but that's just our speculation.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other gaming stocks.\n\nThe gaming industry has experienced significant changes over the past few years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the sector saw remarkable growth as more people spent time indoors. However, this momentum did not continue after restrictions eased, which led to lower consumer spending on games and consoles. Economic uncertainties and challenges like inflation further impacted the industry, resulting in layoffs, studio closures, and project cancellations across the industry in 2024. Despite these setbacks, analysts are optimistic about a recovery supported by upcoming major releases.\n\nREAD ALSO: 8 Fastest Growing AI Stocks To Buy Right Now and 20 Best Fintech Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires.\n\nAccording to research firm Newzoo, video game consoles are expected to be the biggest growth driver in the market until 2027. The anticipated launches of GTA VI in fall 2025 and the new Switch console in summer 2025 are seen as key factors fueling a rebound. GTA V, the predecessor to GTA VI, is one of the most profitable games ever and has sold over 210 million by December 2024. Analysts believe new releases will encourage players to spend more on consoles and games. This could potentially reverse the industry\u2019s recent slowdown.\n\nAccording to the report by Newzoo, console software revenue is projected to increase 7% from 2024 to 2027 and outperform PC software revenue growth of 2.6%. By 2027, console revenue is expected to account for over 56% of the total PC and console software revenue of $92.7 billion. Total playtime increased by 6% in 2024 and Q4 saw the highest quarterly playtime thanks to blockbuster releases like the new Call of Duty title.\n\nEmmanuel Rosier, director of market analysis at Newzoo, told Reuters that major console titles, such as Spider-Man and God of War, are driving engagement on consoles. He also pointed out that these AAA or AAAA releases have less impact on PC gamers, who prefer older titles.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 10 best gaming stocks to invest in according to billionaires, we looked for the largest gaming companies. We reviewed our own rankings, financial media reports, ETFs, and various online resources to compile a list of the best gaming stocks.

But with the Ryzen 9000 CPUs (Zen 5) and the Radeon RX 9000 series (RDNA 4) GPUs defining AMD\u2019s next performance era, a question keeps cropping up: Where\u2019s the RX 8000 series for desktop GPUs?\n\nSo far, AMD has released two mid-level options in the 9000 series of Radeon RX desktop GPUs: the RX 9070 XT and the RX 9070. Both models are based on the RDNA 4 architecture and were officially launched on March 6, 2025. They serve as successors to the AMD Radeon RX 7000 series, which was built on the previous RDNA 3 architecture and first introduced on November 3, 2022.\n\nWhile it may seem like AMD skipped a generation with this release, the reality is more strategic and a bit more complex. The 8000 series does exist, but it\u2019s not positioned where most gamers and PC enthusiasts expected it to be.\n\nThe Ryzen 8000G Series: An APU-Centric Strategy\n\nRyzen 8000 Series APUs\n\nFirst, let\u2019s clear up the CPU side. AMD didn\u2019t skip the 8000 series entirely\u2014they just focused it on APUs (accelerated processing units). The Ryzen 8000G lineup, launched in early 2024, is based on Zen 4 architecture with integrated RDNA 3 graphics. These chips target budget desktops and small form-factor PCs, delivering competent gaming and multimedia performance without needing a discrete GPU.\n\nFor example, the Ryzen 7 8700G and Ryzen 5 8600G are solid choices for users looking to build affordable systems with respectable onboard graphics. But they\u2019re not Zen 5, and they\u2019re not part of AMD\u2019s flagship CPU lineup\u2014that baton has passed directly to the Ryzen 9000 series.\n\nThis segmentation helps AMD avoid muddying the waters. If both top-tier desktop CPUs and APUs shared the 8000 series branding, consumers might mistake integrated APUs for next-gen performance processors. By reserving the \u201c9000\u201d badge for Zen 5, AMD positions it as a clear next-gen leap, both technologically and psychologically.\n\nAMD 8000 Series CPUs\n\nName Cores Core Clock Boost Clock iGPU AMD Ryzen 5 8400F 6 4.2 GHz 4.7 GHz None AMD Ryzen 5 8500G 6 4.1 GHz 5 GHz Radeon 740M AMD Ryzen 5 8600G 6 4.3 GHz 5 GHz Radeon 760M AMD Ryzen 7 8700F 8 4.1 GHz 5 GHz None AMD Ryzen 7 8700G 8 4.2 GHz 5.1 GHz Radeon 780M\n\n8000 Series chips are based on Zen 4 and have a 65W TDP\n\nMobile RX 8000 GPUs: A Quiet Release\n\nInterestingly, AMD did use the RX 8000 label\u2014just not where most people noticed. In early 2024, AMD released several mobile GPUs, including the Radeon RX 8700M XT, under the RX 8000 series banner. These are laptop-only chips based on a tweaked version of RDNA 3.\n\nRyzen 8000 Series CPU\n\nThis quiet move may be why AMD is hesitant to use the RX 8000 name on desktop GPUs: the branding is already in use for mobile, and applying it to both mobile and desktop could lead to confusion\u2014especially when performance expectations differ dramatically between the two segments.\n\nRDNA 4 and the Jump to RX 9000: A Clean Break\n\nThe now available Radeon RX 9000 series ushers in the RDNA 4 architecture, a new chapter in AMD\u2019s GPU design. With it, AMD aims to address efficiency, ray tracing, and rasterization performance\u2014all areas where NVIDIA currently holds a lead.\n\nAMD leaked out early on that RDNA 4 won\u2019t chase the ultra-high-end (like NVIDIA\u2019s RTX 5090 or 5080 models), but will instead target the mid-to-upper range, focusing on performance-per-watt and pricing\u2014areas where AMD has historically done well. The RX 9700 and RX 9700 XT already rival the RTX 5070 and 5070 Ti in some ways and have been very well received.\n\nCoordinating Naming Across CPU and GPU Lines\n\nBy jumping directly to the RX 9000, AMD has synchronized this GPU launch with its corresponding Ryzen 9000 CPUs, reinforcing a cohesive next-generation ecosystem\u2014Zen 5 combined with RDNA 4. This uniformity simplifies marketing and provides a clearer understanding for consumers: the 9000 series represents cutting-edge technology.\n\nSimilar to how the Ryzen 7000 series CPUs were aligned with the Radeon 7000 series GPUs, this new naming convention for the Ryzen 9000 series and Radeon 9000 series makes it easy for buyers to differentiate between the products. AMD has also streamlined their naming process by adjusting the numbering system within the series, opting for labels like 9070 and 9070 XT. This change clarifies that these graphics cards are in the same category as NVIDIA\u2019s 5070 and 5070 Ti. In the previous generation of Radeon cards, designations such as 7700 XT and 7800 XT made comparisons to NVIDIA\u2019s lineup, which included products like the 4070 and 4080, more challenging for consumers.\n\nCould the RX 8000 Series Still Appear on Desktops?\n\nThere\u2019s still a chance the RX 8000 series might show up in some limited or niche desktop capacity. For example, APUs with \u201cStrix Halo\u201d\u2014an upcoming chip rumored to combine Zen 5 CPU cores with powerful RDNA 3.5 (a refined RDNA 3) graphics\u2014may carry RX 8000 branding. But these would serve specialized markets like handheld gaming PCs or compact desktops.\n\nAlternatively, AMD might reserve the RX 8000 label for OEM-only or region-specific models based on RDNA 3 refreshes. Think of how NVIDIA uses names like the RTX 3050 6GB for strategic price points and minimal architectural updates.\n\nThe Strategy Behind the Skip\n\nAMD\u2019s decision not to use the RX 8000 name for desktop GPUs comes down to four key reasons:\n\nAvoiding Branding Overlap\n\nRX 8000 is already used for mobile GPUs. Using the same name for a different architecture and form factor could be messy. Clear Generational Messaging\n\nRX 9000 (RDNA 4) alongside Ryzen 9000 (Zen 5) paints a crystal-clear picture for consumers: this is the latest generation. Marketing Momentum\n\nBigger numbers feel newer, faster, better. AMD\u2019s jump from 7000 to 9000 echoes what smartphone makers do\u2014skip numbers to signal innovation. Room for Expansion\n\nBy keeping RX 8000 for mobile and possibly integrated GPU use, AMD gives itself breathing room for future products that aren\u2019t flagship-level but still need a home.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAMD didn\u2019t forget the RX 8000 series\u2014they just had a different plan for it. While mobile users got a taste of RX 8000 GPUs, desktop users can look forward to a more unified and future-focused RX 9000 series, built on the RDNA 4 architecture and synchronized with Zen 5 CPUs.\n\nSo yes, the 8000 number exists\u2014but in AMD\u2019s playbook, it\u2019s a supporting act, not the headliner. The RX 9000 series is the main event, and it\u2019s shaping up to deliver a tightly integrated generation of AMD performance, from silicon to branding.",

            "content": "One of the foundational pieces of the fast-growing artificial intelligence (AI) market has been the advanced semiconductors that make AI tools possible. Nvidia (NVDA -5.00%) has garnered the most attention in this space, as its processors dominate AI data centers.\n\nBut its smaller rival, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -4.75%), also designs impressive artificial intelligence chips and has solid financial growth.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a better AI stock to invest in, which is the right choice? Here's the case for both and why Nvidia is still the best way to go.\n\nThe case for Nvidia\n\nNvidia holds an estimated 70% to 95% of the AI accelerator market, and that has led to amazing financial results for the company. Nvidia's sales soared 385% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025, reaching $130.5 billion, as tech companies clamored to put Nvidia's chips in their data centers.\n\nThat's been the catalyst for Nvidia's share price surging 438% over the past two years, and while it's unrealistic to assume its stock will see similar gains over the next few years, it could still put up impressive returns.\n\nTo understand why, it's important to point out that AI is still in its early stages. It may seem like it's been around for a while now, but in terms of companies investing in AI infrastructure, we're still in the early innings.\n\nCompanies have already poured hundreds of billions of dollars into AI data centers, and they're not slowing down. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes that yearly spending could reach $2 trillion by 2030.\n\nNvidia already benefits from this ramp-up in spending, and while tech companies always invest a lot in new technologies, AI spending may be unlike anything else in the past. PwC estimates AI could generate $15.7 trillion in additional GDP just five years from now, and tech companies are terrified to be left behind.\n\nConsider that in the most recent earnings calls, some tech companies have talked about economic uncertainty but haven't pulled back on their AI infrastructure spending. They know they can't afford to lose the AI race.\n\nWith Nvidia's dominant AI processor position, it's hard to imagine the company not benefiting from AI's rise over the coming years. Artificial intelligence is simply too important for tech companies to try to do it on the cheap, so investing in high-end processors -- which Nvidia designs -- is likely their best approach for the next several years.\n\nThe case for AMD\n\nOne of the best cases for AMD is that the AI data center market is so large that there's room enough for two semiconductor companies to benefit. Indeed, AMD has already reaped the rewards from its growth.\n\nAMD reported record annual revenue in 2024, with sales jumping 14% to $25.8 billion, and diluted earnings per share soared 89% to $1.00. The company's data center segment revenue also doubled from the previous year, proving that tech companies may be interested in diversifying their AI processors' needs.\n\nThat should help AMD continue its growth streak, with AMD CEO Lisa Su saying on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call that its data center business will grow by \"strong double-digit\" percentages this year.\n\nWith so much spending on data center processors, AMD is likely to cash in on at least some of the money being thrown around. Its processors may not keep pace with Nvidia's, but they could be a good alternative if tech companies want more supplier diversification.\n\nThe verdict: Nvidia is the hands-down winner\n\nWhile AMD is doing its best to keep up, it's very clear that tech companies building AI infrastructure overwhelmingly prefer Nvidia's processors over AMD's. Nvidia has such a massive lead over AMD in this market that it's difficult to imagine AMD gaining much ground against its largest rival.\n\nShockingly, based on the trailing price-to-earnings multiple for both companies, AMD's shares are far more expensive. The stock has a P/E of 106, while Nvidia's is much lower at 40. So not only is Nvidia the dominant AI processor company, but its shares are also relatively cheaper, easily making Nvidia the better AI stock to own in this matchup.",

Manson, MD, DrPH, of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, and colleagues.\n\nHowever, post hoc analyses stratified by time based on inspection of cumulative incidence curves showed a possible modest treatment effect for the primary endpoint in the first 2 years of follow-up (213 events; HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.59-1.01) but little added benefit for treatment after 2 years (131 events; HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.76-1.50), they wrote in JAMA Ophthalmology.\n\n\"Although the overall results were not statistically significant in this first large-scale trial of cocoa flavanols in reducing risk of AMD, they were promising enough to warrant further investigation to understand whether this intervention may help reduce AMD,\" Manson told MedPage Today.\n\nThe original COSMOS trial was conducted to determine whether a cocoa extract supplement and a multivitamin supplement could help prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer among older adults. The study showed that cocoa extract supplementation did not significantly reduce total cardiovascular events among older adults but reduced cardiovascular disease death by 27%.\n\nIn addition, the COSMOS-Mind trial showed that daily vitamin and mineral supplementation improved cognition in older adults.\n\nThere's been little research into cocoa flavanols and AMD. However, \"what's good for the heart is generally good for our vision and the blood vessels that supply the retina,\" Manson explained. \"It's known that many risk factors for cardiovascular disease are also risk factors for age-related macular degeneration. We were interested in whether cocoa flavanols would have a role in preventing AMD, which is the leading cause of vision loss in the U.S. and is also understudied in terms of strategies for prevention.\"\n\nAs for a possible mechanism, the study authors noted that research has linked cocoa flavanols to improved choroidal circulation in the eye and improvements in inflammation, lipids, vasodilation, and endothelial function.\n\nBobeck Sam Modjtahedi, MD, of Kaiser Permanente in Pasadena, California, told MedPage Today that the research is \"well-designed,\" although he noted that it relied on \"patient-reported AMD, with confirmation from doctors' notes, rather than looking at specific anatomic outcomes.\"\n\n\"The low number of AMD events may have reduced the ability to detect a significant difference between groups, although this is a common limitation of prospective studies like this one which explore AMD incidence,\" he said. \"The lack of statistical significance in this study, as well as the magnitude of the effect seen by the hazard ratios, would suggest that any benefit -- if there is one -- would likely be fairly modest.\"\n\nIn addition, Modjtahedi noted, \"the fact the authors only saw a possible benefit in the first 2 years, and not thereafter, would also suggest that the clinical value is likely limited.\"\n\nAny benefit \"would likely derive from the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and retinal vascular effects of cocoa extracts in the same way that we know a good diet and the AREDS vitamins can influence the risk of AMD in patients,\" he said, adding that, as for now, \"we do not have evidence to support a change in practice.\"\n\n\"Even if some supplements may be benign or have low risk, they still consume patients' time and money that may be better served focusing on more proven strategies,\" he noted.\n\nThe double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 \u00d7 2 factorial COSMOS trial, which was conducted from June 2015 through December 2020, included 21,442 adults (12,666 women ages 65 and older and 8,776 men ages 60 and older). Mean age was 72.1, 59.1% were women, and 88.1% were white. Of the participants, 1.4% had AMD, 58.1% had hypertension, 48.9% used aspirin regularly, and 41.2% used multivitamins regularly.\n\nPatients were randomized to cocoa flavanols 500 mg/day, including 80 mg (\u2212)-epicatechin, or placebo.\n\nThe primary endpoint was a composite of incident cases of AMD plus cases of progression to advanced AMD (geographic atrophy, neovascular membrane, retinal pigment epithelium detachment, or disciform scar) among participants with AMD at baseline, based on self-report confirmed by medical record review.\n\nDuring follow-up, 1.6% of patients experienced a confirmed AMD event: 316 had incident AMD and 28 had progression to advanced AMD.\n\nAt 2 years, the number of cases of incident AMD was 86 in the cocoa extract group versus 111 in the placebo group (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.58-1.02, P=0.07), while AMD progression occurred in six and 10 patients, respectively (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.28-2.09, P=0.59).\n\nBeyond 2 years, there was no benefit in the cocoa extract group versus the placebo group for incident AMD (62 vs 57 events, P=0.68), or AMD progression (5 vs 7 events, P=0.89). Incident visually significant AMD, a secondary endpoint, was numerically higher in the cocoa extract group beyond 2 years, although this did not reach statistical significance (HR 1.64, 95% CI 0.94-2.85, P=0.08).\n\nThe authors touted the study's large size and \"high rates of adherence to pill-taking,\" but noted limitations such as the trial duration, which may have been too short to detect benefit, and the daily dose of cocoa extract, which may have been too small.\n\nRandy Dotinga is a freelance medical and science journalist based in San Diego.\n\nDisclosures The COSMOS trial was supported by Mars Edge, a nutrition-focused research organization that is part of the Mars candy company. The study was also supported by Pfizer Consumer Healthcare (now Haleon) and the NIH.

Organizations that want to run AI projects can therefore better manage and optimize their infrastructure through this collaboration.\n\nAlso read: AWS offers GPU power for short AI workloads\n\nAccording to AMD and Rapt AI, an important advantage of the solution is that it enables organizations to seamlessly deploy AI in both on-premise and multi-cloud environments. Rapt\u2019s platform simplifies GPU management, reducing the time data scientists spend on guesswork when configuring infrastructure. The automatic optimization of resource allocation allows them to focus more on innovation than on infrastructure. The platform supports various GPU environments, including AMD and other suppliers, through a single instance. This should ensure maximum infrastructure flexibility.\n\nImproved inferencing performance\n\nThe Rapt AI platform is designed to work optimally with AMD Instinct GPUs. This means, among other things, that they can be used as efficiently as possible. This results in better inferencing performance and better scalability. This also applies to AI implementations that are actually put into production. The relatively recent introduction of the AMD Instinct MI325X and the announcement of the MI355X show that AMD is offering increasingly better performance for AI inferencing. The partnership with Rapt AI builds on this.\n\nThe timing of this collaboration fits in well with the growing need for efficient AI infrastructure in the current technology landscape, in which organizations such as OpenAI are looking for ways to solve the shortage of specialized processors such as GPUs.\n\nAlso read: FlexAI provides developers with multi-cloud AI infrastructure \u2018as a service\u2019.",

This graphics card has no problem maxing out any game you throw at it at 4K, even with ray tracing enabled, and does so at a price that makes the competition look downright greedy. I can\u2019t predict the future, so only time will tell if the launch price holds up. What I do know is we need more graphics cards like the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT.\"\n\nMore Radeon RX 9070 / 9070 XT Gaming PCs on Amazon\n\nEric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

            "content": "AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution is an upscaling tool for the company's graphics cards that renders video games at a lower resolution and uses software to blow them up to a higher resolution.\n\nBy using FSR, weaker graphics cards are able to achieve playable framerates in 1440p and even 4K, but the technology also allows for higher-end GPUs to play even the most demanding games in high refresh rate 4K (and even 8K in recent years).\n\nUpscaling has become a major component of PC gaming since 2020 with the adoption of real-time ray tracing, which is incredibly hardware-intensive and extremely difficult to do without some form of help.\n\nBy lowering the natively rendered resolution to a generated higher resolution, the goal is to give players the best of both worlds: playable framerates and pleasant visuals, meaning you won't necessarily have to choose between quality and performance - at least in theory.\n\nAs touched upon above, AMD FSR was launched in 2021 but has undergone several revisions as new graphics card generations have hit the shelves. FSR 2 rolled out with the release of Deathloop (May 2022) before going open-source a month later.\n\nBy this point in time, over 100 games had support for the software; however, things would become more competitive with Nvidia's DLSS when FSR 3 launched in September 2023. This update launched with RDNA 3 graphics cards (RX 7000) and required a baseline of 60fps natively before use for the best results.\n\nThat's because it rolled in Frame Generation, which interpolated generated frames between native ones for up to four times higher frame rates when compared to pure native performance. It evolved from AFMF (AMD Fluid Motion Frames) and prioritized 4K for supported video cards at its top end.\n\nIt brings us to today, with the recent release of RDNA 4 graphics cards (such as the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT) and FSR 4, which is exclusive to the two GPUs at the time of writing. Unlike the previous versions of FidelityFX Super Resolution, which was driver-based and open-source, FSR 4 is AI-powered and uses machine learning for vastly improved picture quality, smoothness, and performance options.\n\nIt's fundamentally changed what FSR can do and what it is in pursuit of competing closer with Nvidia's midrange models (such as the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070), which it largely does.",

One of the most powerful consumer CPUs around, the 9950X is the perfect processor for multiple-core and multi-threaded workloads and tasks such as content creation and video editing. You can use the 9950X for gaming, but there are better CPU options now available.\n\nHitting an all-time low price in Amazon's Big Spring Sale, the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X processor is only $528. The Ryzen 9 9950X has an impressive 16 cores with 32 threads and uses 80MB of combined L2/L3 cache with only a TDP of 170W. The base clock speed of the 9950X is 4.3GHz, which can boost to a clock speed of 5.7GHz.\n\nIf you're already on the AM5 ecosystem and looking to upgrade, the Ryzen 9 9950X drops into the existing AM5 LGA1718 socket and is backward-compatible with all 600-series chipsets. The Ryzen 9 9950X shines in multi-threaded performance applications and can still be used for gaming but pales compared to gaming-focused CPU iterations like the 9800X3D and recently released 9950X3D. The 9950X3D is also a 16-core processor, so you're paying $167 more for the 3D V-Cache and gaming performance.\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X: now $528 at Amazon (was $649)\n\nThe Ryzen 9 9950X has 16 cores and 32 threads and uses 80MB of combined L2/L3 cache with a TDP of 170W.

During this conversation, Lisa Su confirmed that the launch of the RX 9070 XT has become the most successful in Radeon\u2019s history. In its first week, sales significantly exceeded those of previous GPU launches, with AMD achieving sales figures ten times higher.\n\nThis interview follows remarks from AMD VP David McAfee regarding the RX 9070 XT launch, who characterized the demand for this GPU as \u201cunprecedented\u201d for the company. Such comments, along with sales dramatically outpacing earlier card launches, imply that AMD was not entirely ready for the RX 9070 XT\u2019s popularity on release day.\n\nLisa Su indicated that AMD is ramping up its GPU production to satisfy demand, enabling more gamers to obtain the latest graphics cards from AMD. Additionally, during the interview, Lisa Su touched on other AMD products such as Strix Halo, the company\u2019s premium APU, X3D CPUs, and Ryzen AI offerings.\n\nAlthough AMD focused significantly on their Radeon RX 9070 XT, they did not mention the lower-end RX 9070 (non-XT), which is understandable considering AMD\u2019s greater supply of the RX 9070 XT at launch; it is obviously the product AMD is prioritizing.\n\nWhen addressing the future of AMD\u2019s CPUs and GPUs, Lisa Su mentioned that they will persist in optimizing their technology across silicon, packaging, system, and software levels. As silicon scaling becomes increasingly challenging, chipmakers will need to exert more effort to enhance PC performance. Expect these areas to remain central to AMD\u2019s strategy moving forward.\n\nAnd as always, for those looking to enhance their gaming experience, remember to use our comparator to find the best deals on the Radeon RX 7900 XT GPU today.",

That is an impressive showing but the popularity does have a downside, it is now almost impossible to find an RX 9000 series card for sale at MSRP. This is a sad fact of life now, as it has been several generations since GPUs cost what they should. The price gouging isn\u2019t quite as bad as what is continuing to happen with NVIDIA GPUs, likely in part because the supply of RX 9000 series cards is more consistent than the competitors, but it still hurts.\n\nAMD have ramped up production of the cards and hopefully the as third party who actually sell the cards get more supply onto the market we will see the prices drop. She did not confirm the existence of the RX 9060, but it is pretty much guaranteed we will see that card in both 8GB and 16GB versions in the near future. This is great news for AMD and we should expect an impressive earnings report for this quarter. It is also great news for gamers as the success of the RX 9000 series should ensure AMD continues to focus on developing enthusiast cards at a time when NVIDIA\u2019s focus is elsewhere.",

The older tools for optimizing don\u2019t really fit at all. We observed these dynamics. Enterprises are throwing lots of money. Hiring a new set of talent in AI. It\u2019s one of these disruptive technologies. We have a scenario where CFOs and CIOs are asking where is the return. In some cases, there is tens of millions, hundreds of millions or billions of dollars spend on GPU-related infrastructure.\u201d\n\nLeeming said Anil Ravindranath, CTO of Rapt AI, saw the solution. And that involved deploying monitors to enable observations of the infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe feel we have the right solution at the right time. We came out of stealth last fall. We are in a growing number of Fortune 100 companies. Two are running the code among cloud service providers,\u201d Leeming said.\n\nAnd he said, \u201cWe do have strategic partners but our conversations with AMD went extremely well. They are building tremendous GPUs, AI accelerators. We are known for putting the maximum amount of workload on GPUs. Inference is taking off. It\u2019s in production stage now. AI workloads are exploding. Their data scientists are running as fast as they can. They are panicking, they need tools, they need efficiency, they need automation. It\u2019s screaming for the right solution. Inefficiencies \u2014 30% GPU underutilization. Customers do want flexibility. Large customers are asking if you support AMD.\u201d\n\nImprovements that can take nine hours can be done in three minutes, he said. Ravindranath said in a press briefing the Rapt AI platform enables up to 10 times model run capacity at the same AI compute spending level, up to 90% cost savings, and zero humans in a loop and no code changes. For productivity, this means no more waiting for compute and time spent tuning infrastructure.\n\nLemming said other techniques have been around for a while and haven\u2019t cut it. Run AI, a rival, overlaps in a competitive way somewhat. He said his company observes in minutes instead of hours and then optimizes the infrastructure. Ravindranath said Run AI is more like a scheduler but Rapt AI positions itself for unpredictable results and deals with it.\n\n\u201cWe run the model and figure it out, and that\u2019s a huge benefit for inference workloads. It should just automatically run,\u201d Ravindranath said.\n\nThe benefits: lower costs, better GPU utilization\n\nAMD Instinct MI300X GPU.\n\nThe companies said that AMD Instinct GPUs, with their industry-leading memory capacity, combined with\n\nRapt\u2019s intelligent resource optimization, helps ensure maximum GPU utilization for AI workloads, helping lower total cost of ownership (TCO).\n\nRapt\u2019s platform streamlines GPU management, eliminating the need for data scientists to spend valuable time on trial-and-error infrastructure configurations. By automatically optimizing resource allocation for their specific workloads, it empowers them to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure. It seamlessly supports diverse GPU environments (AMD and others, whether in the cloud, on premises or both) through a single instance, helping ensure maximum infrastructure flexibility.\n\nThe combined solution intelligently optimizes job density and resource allocation on AMD Instinct GPUs, resulting in better inference performance and scalability for production AI deployments. Rapt\u2019s auto-scaling capabilities further help ensure efficient resource use based on demand, reducing latency and maximizing cost efficiency.\n\nRapt\u2019s platform works out-of-the-box with AMD Instinct GPUs, helping ensure immediate performance benefits. Ongoing collaboration between Rapt and AMD will drive further optimizations in exciting areas such as GPU scheduling, memory utilization and more, helping ensure customers are equipped with a future ready AI infrastructure.\n\n\u201cAt AMD, we are committed to delivering high-performance, scalable AI solutions that empower organizations to unlock the full potential of their AI workloads.\u201d said Negin Oliver, corporate vice president of business development for data center GPU business at AMD, in a statement. \u201cOur collaboration with Rapt AI combines the cutting-edge capabilities of AMD Instinct GPUs with Rapt\u2019s intelligent workload automation, enabling customers to achieve greater efficiency, flexibility, and cost savings across their AI infrastructure.\u201d",

Perhaps not, but the silver lining in these times of high demand is that overclocked models like Sapphire Pulse Nitro+ Radeon RX 9070 XT are now back in stock and cheaper than they were earlier this month.\n\nGiven the flurry of Amazon\u2019s Spring Sale and Sapphire not explicitly listing this as a deal, it\u2019d be easy for this discount to fall through the cracks. Currently priced at \u00a3685 in the UK, it\u2019s actually notably less than the \u00a3699 it orignally debuted for in the first week of March. While I can\u2019t tell you why it\u2019s down in price, I can say it offers more value, putting it in line with MSRP models.\n\nSapphire Nitro+ Radeon RX 9070 XT Sapphire Nitro+ is designed for those who demand a truly premium pixel pusher that blurs the line between midrange and high-end. Read our review. Buy from Amazon\n\nTouting a brand-new RDNA 4 chip under the hood, AMD wiggles a lot of performance out of the midranger, placing it mostly on par with GeForce RTX 4080 Super at a lower price. Of course, your frame rate entirely depends on the game you\u2019re playing, but you\u2019ll generally see ample QHD frame rates with the occasional title welcoming 4K at max settings.\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Mirage, for example, runs at a comfortable 103fps with the resolution cranked right up. However, you\u2019ll want to stick with FHD or QHD for more demanding games like Cyberpunk 2077, all while leveraging upscalers like FSR and its accompanying Frame Generation feature.\n\nSpeaking of which, AMD has overhauled its FidelityFX Super Resolution suite with the fourth generation, bringing with it better clarity with fewer visual artifacts. You can bump any existing game that has FSR 3.1 to FSR 4 with the click of a few buttons, but games like Cyberpunk 2077 that cap out at FSR 3 are bound to the previous iteration.\n\nSam found FSR 4 to be a feather in Radeon RX 9070 XT\u2019s cap, praising its ability to improve ghosting, anti-aliasing, particle effects, and transparency effects. It does come with the smallest of frame rate penalties over 3.1, but you\u2019ll notice finer details such as falling confetti, hair, blades of grass, and the likes all become much sharper with a more native look. A worthy trade-off, if you ask us.\n\nMy recommendation is that you give AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT a shot. If push comes to shove, Amazon allows you to return it within 30 days of receipt for a full refund. And in the meantime, make sure you\u2019re following Club386 on Google News because we\u2019ll unearth new deals each and every day.",

            "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without the semiconductor industry. The majority of development happens inside data centers that are filled with graphics processing units (GPUs) from leading suppliers like Nvidia (NVDA 3.16%) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).\n\nHowever, AI workloads are also demanding more memory and storage capacity not just in data centers, but also in personal computers (PCs) and smartphones, and Micron Technology (MU 2.32%) is a top supplier of that hardware. The company just released its financial results for its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended Feb. 27), and they revealed soaring revenue led by AI-related demand.\n\nHere's why Micron stock could be a great buy for investors seeking exposure to the AI boom.\n\nAI requires an increasing amount of memory\n\nMemory is a critical component in data-intensive AI training and AI inference workloads. It stores information in a ready state so it can be called upon by GPUs instantly, which speeds up processing time. Micron's HBM3E (high-bandwidth memory) for the data center is the best in the industry, delivering 50% more capacity than competing solutions while consuming 30% less energy.\n\nNvidia is using Micron's HBM3E in its industry-leading Blackwell GB200 GPU, which is currently the gold standard for AI development. Nvidia will also use it in the upcoming Blackwell Ultra GB300 GPU, which will deliver even more processing power for AI applications. Since Nvidia's top four customers have ordered 3.6 million Blackwell chips already, it's no surprise Micron is completely sold out of its HBM3E solutions for calendar year 2025, and is already experiencing strong demand for its 2026 supply.\n\nMicron says the market for HBM was worth $16 billion in 2024, and is set to more than double to $35 billion this year. It could then be worth $100 billion by 2030, so there will be astronomical financial rewards for staying ahead of the competition. In order to do so, Micron plans to launch its new HBM4E solution for the data center in 2026, which will provide a whopping 60% increase in bandwidth compared to the previous generation.\n\nBut Micron's AI opportunity transcends the data center. As chips become more powerful, AI workloads will shift to PCs and smartphones, allowing chatbots and other applications to run offline. This will create a faster user experience and make them accessible from anywhere. The company says AI PCs already require a minimum DRAM (memory) capacity of 16 gigabytes, up from an average of 12 gigabytes for non-AI PCs last year.\n\nSimilarly, most AI smartphones now require 12 gigabytes of capacity or more, up from 8 gigabytes last year. Micron's smartphone memory solutions are used in a number of Android-powered devices from top manufacturers including Samsung.\n\nMore memory capacity translates into more revenue for Micron, so the company is positioned to win whether AI workloads are processed in data centers or on devices.\n\nMicron's revenue is soaring, led by the data center\n\nMicron generated $8 billion in total revenue during its fiscal 2025 second quarter, which represented a 38% increase compared to the year-ago period. However, there was a much bigger growth story beneath the surface of the headline number.\n\nRevenue from Micron's compute and networking segment, which is where it accounts for its data center memory sales, soared by a whopping 109% to a record $4.6 billion. Plus, revenue attributable just to HBM made up $1 billion of that figure, which was also a record high.\n\nOn the flip side, revenue from Micron's mobile segment shrank by 33% to $1 billion, as customers had some built-up inventories that softened demand. However, the company expects to see modest growth in the mobile business this calendar year overall, especially as AI smartphone adoption kicks into high gear.\n\nMicron's strong top-line result led to a significant increase in its profitability, with earnings per share (EPS) doubling to $1.41. That trend is likely to continue in the current fiscal 2025 third quarter -- the company is forecasting $8.8 billion in revenue and $1.37 in EPS, representing year-over-year growth of 29% and 356%, respectively.\n\nMicron stock looks like a bargain relative to its peers\n\nSince some of Micron's hardware like the HBM3E memory is already sold out this year, there is some predictability to the company's financial results. Wall Street's consensus forecast (according to Yahoo!) suggests its EPS will come in at $6.93, placing its stock at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 13.6.\n\nThat's a 40% discount to AMD's forward P/E ratio of 22.7, and an even steeper 47% discount to Nvidia's forward P/E ratio of 25.9:\n\nAs I highlighted earlier, Nvidia is using Micron's HBM3E in its flagship GPUs like the GB200 and GB300. Since Nvidia already has orders for millions of those chips, Micron is likely to experience monumental sales growth in tandem over the next couple of years. As a result, it's hard to justify the steep discount in Micron stock.\n\nPlus, Micron will benefit significantly as AI workloads shift from data centers to PCs and smartphones, so the company is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this technological revolution. As a result, I think Micron stock could be a great addition to any balanced portfolio.",

However, this is the first time that AMD managed to not only outperform its previous generations but also beat NVIDIA fair and square in sales. Apart from AMD's confirmation of selling 10 times more sales than the previous generation, the RX 9070 XT can be seen selling like hotcakes right from the retailers.\n\nMindfactory, which is one of the biggest retailers in Germany, is seeing some terrific sales of the Radeon RX 9070 XT. Multiple GPU models are now currently in stock, starting from \u20ac795, including VAT. Without VAT, the prices can be anywhere from US$715 to US$764, which is quite higher than the announced MSRP. Despite that, the GPUs have sold dozens of units for each model on the very first day of this week.\n\nIt's reported that the Radeon RX 9070 XT sold about 105 units on Monday with all these models combined. These include models like XFX RX 9070 XT Quicksilver, PowerColor RX 9070 XT Hellhound, and XFX RX 9070 XT Mercury Magnetic Air RGB. Here are the latest stats, as can be seen from the website:\n\nPowerColor Radeon RX 9070 XT Hellhound: 40 units PowerColor Radeon RX 9070 XT Quicksilver: 20 units XFX Radeon RX 9070 XT Mercury RGB OC: 30 units XFX Radeon RX 9070 XT Mercury RGB OC White: 20 units XFX Radeon RX 9070 XT Mercury Magnetic Air RGB OC: 10 units\n\nThese come to 110 units as it includes a few more units sold today. The RTX 50 series GPUs have witnessed lower sales combined when compared to the RX 9070 XT. As far as the RTX 5070 Ti goes, which is a direct competitor to the RX 9070 XT, the GPU currently sits at $250-$300 higher than the latter, selling only 10 units. The RX 5070 Ti is definitely a bit faster, but the price gap is too much to offer better value than the RX 9070 XT.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 First Mindfactory Data of the current Week\n\n[RX 9070 XT] => 105\n\n[RTX 5090] => 20\n\n[RX 7600] => 10\n\n[RTX 5080] => 10\n\n[RTX 4060] => 10\n\n[RTX 5070 Ti] => 10\n\n[RX 7800 XT] => 10\n\n[RTX 5070] => 5 \u2014 TechEpiphany (@TechEpiphanyYT) March 25, 2025\n\nOn the other hand, the GeForce RTX 5090 is the best-selling GPU but sold just 20 units. Since there is currently one model available, which is also quite expensive compared to all other GPUs, it's expected. However, availability matters as well and the RTX 5090 isn't as abundant as the RX 9070 series. Nonetheless, the Palit RTX 5090 GameRock edition is currently in stock at \u20ac2,990, which translates to US$2690 without VAT. Not necessarily a great price, but we have seen the GPU retailing for over $3000 in multiple regions.\n\nLet's wait for the week to end to get a full picture of the GPU market, but we will likely see RX 9070 XT dominating.\n\nNews Source: Mindfactory",

The result is that the series has now become the biggest hit versus the prior generations of Radeon GPUs.\n\nIn an interview with ASUS's China Manager, Tony Yu, AMD's CEO confirmed that the series was a big hit, and it surpassed the first-week sales figures versus the prior generation of Radeon GPUs by 10X.\n\nI'm very proud of the team on RDNA 4 [....]. Because when we do a new architectural generation, we have to decide its primary characteristics many years in advance, and for RDNA 4, what we really wanted to do is bring the best gaming capability to a very, let's call it good price point, so that we could get more gamers to have access to this technology. Sometimes you think, of course everyone likes a very very high-end GPU but it's not so many people can access it so 9070 XT has been a fantastic success. It's the No.1 selling for all of the AMD Radeon generations for first week sales is the by far 10x higher than previous generations. And we like to see people happy. People are very happy with 9070 XT. Dr. Lisa Su (AMD CEO) via Bilibili (ASUS Tony)\n\nWe have already seen the Radeon RX 9070 XT taking up the top spot among various retailers across the globe, with some even selling over 5000 units on launch day, a number that far exceeds the sales volume of NVIDIA's recent RTX 50 GPUs, which are not only facing supply issues but are also priced way above their MSRPs due to non-availability. The same is also the case with the Radeon RX 9070 XT, but despite that, you still get better value and performance backed by 16 GB of VRAM on these RDNA 4 offerings.\n\nThere was even a report of AMD selling over 200,000 Radeon RX 9000 GPUs since launch. However, that turned out to be inaccurate as AMD confirmed that it made no such statement. However, we can still very much believe that the official number, whatever it may be, is a huge one and a big win for Team Red. The company also managed to hit almost 50% market share in Japan with its Radeon RX 9070 GPUs for the first time.\n\nWe are going to no problem, we are very excited about it and we are increasing the manufacturing so we can have more gamers to have access. Dr. Lisa Su (AMD CEO) via Bilibili (ASUS Tony)\n\nAs the demand for RDNA 4 GPUs increases, Dr. Lisa Su also confirmed that they are increasing the manufacturing of their latest GPUs so that more gamers can have access to them. This would lead to better supply and, in turn, better prices for gamers. Lisa Su also confirmed that more RDNA 4 GPU action is on the way and that might probably be hinting at the Radeon RX 9060 series, which will be arriving in 16 GB and 8 GB flavors in the coming months.",

            "content": "Key Takeaways Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia, and other chip stocks rallied Monday.\n\nThe move higher follows reports the White House may not announce tariffs targeting the semiconductor industry.\n\nChip stocks have had a rough start to 2025 amid tariff worries, as well as concerns about companies' commitment to investing in AI infrastructure.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), and other chip stocks rallied Monday following reports the Trump administration may not target the semiconductor industry as part of the tariffs scheduled to take effect on April 2.\n\nAMD shares were up nearly 8% in recent trading, making it one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500. Nvidia shares climbed close to 4%, while NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) added 5%. Micron Technology (MU) and Qualcomm (QCOM) shares were also higher, with the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX) climbing over 3%.\n\nOver the weekend, The Wall Street Journal reported that tariffs targeting specific sectors such as automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors are unlikely to be announced on April 2. Reciprocal taxes on targeted nations are still expected to go into effect.\n\nChip Stocks Have Had a Tough Start to 2025\n\nWorries that semiconductors could be subject to tariffs of 25% or more, as Trump previously suggested, have weighed on chip stocks in recent weeks, with the SOX index down 5% for 2025 so far. Investors also have been wary further export curbs could drag on chip sales.\n\nThe emergence of a lower-cost model from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has also raised concerns about how much Big Tech firms will invest in AI infrastructure. However, many of America's biggest tech giants recently announced plans to boost their spending, with Amazon saying it expects to spend more than $100 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, following similar announcements from Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta Platforms (META).",

The overall (OA) incidence of treatment discontinuation and rates for each specific cause were calculated. The probability of each discontinuation caused over time from treatment initiation and the associated risk factors were also determined.\n\nThe results showed that 655 individuals (28.5%) discontinued intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy. Among the 5 main reasons for discontinuation (patient\u2019s decision against clinician\u2019s advice, continuation of therapy at another clinic, clinical decision, systemic diseases, or death), clinical decision was the most common cause. Kaplan\u2013Meier curve analysis indicated a higher frequency of clinical decision-related discontinuation within the first two years of treatment. Worse visual acuity increased the likelihood of discontinuation due to clinical decisions, while younger individuals were more likely to stop treatment by choice. Better visual acuity and greater distance from the clinic were associated with a higher probability of continuing therapy elsewhere.\n\nInvestigators concluded that anti-VEGF treatment discontinuation in neovascular AMD was frequent, stopping both clinician-directed and patient-influenced factors, encompassing health status and personal preferences.\n\nSource: bjo.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/22/bjo-2024-326152",

The administration is also reportedly set to limit some industry-specific tariffs that were set to take effect, including those on cars and chips.\n\nIn the tech world, news early Monday out of China that Ant Group, the Jack Ma-backed tech conglomerate, has trained cheaper AI models using Chinese-made chips and those from AMD was the latest sign the AI race continues to push new boundaries.\n\nSpeaking last week at its GTC Conference, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the introduction of lower-cost models \u2014 like those most notably put forth by China's DeepSeek \u2014 shows the computing needs for AI are actually higher than previously thought. Nvidia's chips are also subject to an export ban from the US in China.\n\nRead more about Nvidia's stock moves and today's market action.\n\nEarlier this year, Nvidia stock fell over 16% in a single day after DeepSeek's R1 model matched the performance of higher-cost AI models like those from OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) at a fraction of the cost.\n\nJensen Huang, head of the chip company Nvidia, appears at the GTC developer event. (Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images) \u00b7 picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nIn the weeks since these developments, the industry has seen similar breakthroughs in the same vein as that vocalized by Huang. These reflect the larger-than-imagined potential of even deeper AI investments rather than exposing the limits of current plans. (See also: Jevons Paradox.)\n\nAlso in tech news, a South Korean AI chip startup FuriosaAI reportedly rejected an $800 million offer from Meta. This takes a potential headache away from Meta shareholders, who might have to price in regulatory overhangs and integration costs, and shows AI startups have plenty of confidence to explore the market independently.\n\nTech-specific developments, though a boost for the AI trade on the margins, still take a back seat to trade news. And though AI may not be the clearest fundamental winner or loser due to Trump's tariffs, tech's central role in the stock market rally since late 2022 has seen these stocks retain their leadership position on the way up and the way down.",

The rally comes amid reports that President Donald Trump may delay the planned April 2 tariffs on the semiconductor sector. However, during multiple events on Monday, Trump reiterated that tariffs would be introduced soon. Meanwhile, chip powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) climbed over 3%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.3%.\n\nAMD specializes in high-performance computing, graphics, and AI solutions.\n\nWhat\u2019s Behind the Surge?\n\nOverall, tech and chip stocks gained momentum on Monday following a report from The Wall Street Journal stating that the White House is considering a sector-based approach to reciprocal tariffs. According to the report, industries like automobiles, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals may be excluded from the proposed trade measures.\n\nDespite everything, the Monday surge provided some relief for investors after AMD shares tumbled 30% over the past six months, largely due to sluggish demand for personal computers and traditional servers and tariff uncertainties. Additionally, the company has faced challenges competing with Nvidia\u2019s stronghold on AI accelerators.\n\nInsights from TipRanks\u2019 Bulls Say, Bears Say\n\nTipRanks\u2019 Bulls Say, Bears Say tool offers a quick snapshot of analysts\u2019 viewpoints on AMD stock. Users looking for a concise breakdown of bullish and bearish sentiments can leverage this tool for valuable insights.\n\nBulls are optimistic that AMD is experiencing strong demand for its AI GPUs, securing major customer orders. Moreover, its PC CPU market share is also expanding, driven by performance gains and new partnerships. On the other hand, bears noted that AMD shares may face range-bound trading as investors evaluate the MI350X rollout and the possibility of oversupply in client CPUs.\n\nIs AMD a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nOverall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on AMD stock, based on 25 Buys, 11 Holds, and 1 Sell assigned in the last three months. The average share price target for AMD is $147.81, which implies an upside potential of 30% from current levels.\n\nSee more AMD analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "We recently published a list of Cathie Wood\u2019s Top 12 AI Stock Picks in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other Cathie Wood\u2019s top AI stock picks in 2025.\n\nSince founding ARK Investment Management in 2014, Cathie Wood has earned her place next to legends like Warren Buffet, Ken Fisher, and others. Wood\u2019s investment philosophy centers around identifying and investing in disruptive innovation, which she has put to great use through ARK Innovation ETF.\n\nHistorically, Wood has favored tech stocks. She put substantial value into tech companies that promised to disrupt their respective industries through innovation. That hasn\u2019t changed much, and if anything, she seems to be doubling down. Since the beginning of the year, Wood has seemed to smell great opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). In fact, the latest installment of ARK Invest\u2019s research, ARK\u2019s Big Ideas 2025, puts AI up there in terms of today\u2019s most transformative innovations.\n\nREAD ALSO: Paul Singer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks and 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Seth Klarman.\n\nWood recently commented on the research in a video posted on ARK Invest\u2019s YouTube channel, and her takeaways confirm that she is all in on AI. Right from the start, she believes AI is the story today and in the future. She said:\n\n\u201cAI has been the big story for the past two years, and it\u2019s still the big story. In fact, it is the biggest catalyst to all of the innovation taking place out there uh, it is the reason that the world seems to be speeding up.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Wood is convinced that the ongoing AI-driven productivity will put an end to the rolling recession. She said this in her podcast \u201cIn the Know,\u201d which outlined a bullish vision of technological innovation driving real GDP growth. While referencing the economic decline that she believes has been ongoing since the Fed began raising rates in 2022, she said, \u201cWe\u2019re coming to the end of [the rolling recession]. The bad news is we do have to go through this process.\u201d\n\nWood and her investment firm have built a reputation for making high-conviction bets on early-stage companies (and industries). Interestingly, one of the key paragraphs in ARK\u2019s Big Ideas 2025 focuses on the risks of investing in innovation. While it points out the risks, it also gives away one of the core beliefs that makes Wood the investor she is: \u201cRisk is how you unlock exponential growth.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe reviewed ARK Investment Management\u2019s 13F holdings, as of Q4 2024 and selected the fund\u2019s top 12 AI stock picks. We then ranked the top 12 AI stocks in ascending order based on ARK Investment Management\u2019s stake value. Additionally, we have mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nARK Investment Management\u2019s Stake Value: $145.74 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge Funds Holding Stakes: 96\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) is a technology company that designs and manufactures semiconductor products, including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs, used in various applications like gaming, data centers, and embedded systems. It is the most significant player in the AI chip market, right behind Nvidia, affirming why it is one of Cathie Wood\u2019s favorite stocks in the burgeoning sector.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) is renowned for providing advanced GPUs to enable AI workloads at affordable prices. It is a competitive advantage that offers quality to budget-conscious consumers and is expected to trigger an increase in orders as demand for AI chips rises. In reaction to Nvidia\u2019s hegemony in that market, AMD is already offering the MI300 series of accelerators. Additionally, to compete with Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell line, it introduced the MI325X accelerators.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) is among the best AI players because it boasts a solid and reliable customer pipeline for its AI chips. Microsoft is one of its biggest customers for the flagship MI300X GPUs to drive several GPT 4-based Copilot services. Likewise, it had an impressive 2024 as it progressed in the AI market. Its data center revenue amid the AI boom surged 69% to a record $3.9 billion and was up by 94% for the year to a record $12.6 billion.\n\nOverall, AMD ranks 8th on our list of Cathie Wood\u2019s top AI stock picks in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "AMD has recently launched its Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D processors, which are designed to be the top offerings for gaming and content creation on the AM5 platform. It appears that AMD is also gearing up to introduce Zen 5 to a new sector: workstations. Recent shipping manifests (via Tom's Hardware) have revealed the next-gen Zen 5 Ryzen Threadripper CPUs, indicating that TRX50 and WRX90 users will soon have new options for upgrades.\n\nThe Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9000-series lineup is anticipated to include five processors with core counts of 16, 24, 32, 64, and 96, all based on the Zen 5 microarchitecture. Given that AMD's Zen 5 core complex die (CCD) incorporates eight cores with 32 MB of L3 cache, a 16-core Threadripper Pro 9000-series CPU will utilize two compute dies, a 32-core variant will employ four CCDs, a 64-core model will contain eight CCDs, and a 96-core version will consist of 12 core complex dies and 384 MB of L3 cache.\n\nThese specifications closely resemble those of the existing Threadripper 7000-series, suggesting that the cache structure may remain unchanged. However, there are rumors that AMD might skip a 12-core variant this time around.\n\nIt's important to note that the details from shipping manifests are not official. At this point, the launch timing for AMD's next-generation Threadripper and EPYC processors remains uncertain. Historically, AMD has released new Threadripper CPUs significantly later than their Ryzen desktop and EPYC counterparts, which implies we might not see the Zen 5 Threadripper CPUs until mid to late 2025. Nonetheless, there's always the possibility that AMD could surprise us with an earlier release.\n\nAnd as always, for those looking to enhance their gaming experience, remember to use our comparator to find the best deals on the GeForce RTX 4080 GPU today.",

            "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock has not had many bright spots over the past year, even though the company plays a central role in supplying AI chips and delivered record revenues in Q4 2024. Despite these achievements, AMD shares have been on quite the slump, tumbling ~40% over the past 12 months.\n\nConcerns over slowing capital spending by hyperscalers, export restrictions to China, and the looming threat of a trade war have collectively dampened enthusiasm. AMD\u2019s lukewarm guidance for Q1 2025 has further exacerbated investor worries.\n\nEven so, AMD isn\u2019t standing still. The company is doubling down on its AI ambitions, looking to expand its presence in the rapidly growing data center market. Its next-generation AI accelerator, the MI350, is slated for a mid-2025 launch, with CEO Lisa Su highlighting strong customer demand and accelerated development progress during the Q4 earnings call.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, some investors see opportunity taking shape. One such investor, known by the pseudonym Oakoff Investments, believes the recent pullback could offer an attractive entry point for those betting on AMD\u2019s longer-term potential.\n\n\u201cAMD\u2019s fundamentals remain strong with promising AI and data center growth, making the recent stock price dip an attractive buying opportunity,\u201d explains the investor.\n\nOakoff is bullish regarding AMD\u2019s continued advances with its new generations of CPUs and GPUs, noting that the latest MI350 series is expected to provide a \u201cgreat leap in AI performance.\u201d Needless to say, the investor believes this bodes well for the company going forward.\n\n\u201cAMD has been consistently gaining market share in the server CPU market thanks to the strength of its EPYC portfolio,\u201d notes the investor. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing any major risks to its CPU dominance in the next few years.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Oakoff posits that the bulk of AMD\u2019s revenues will continue to move toward the lucrative Data Center segment. The investor notes that this strategy is bearing fruit for the company, as Data Center EBIT for full-year 2024 grew by 175% year-over-year \u2013 while revenues also expanded by 69% year-over-year in Q4 2024.\n\n\u201cI believe AMD is quite well positioned in today\u2019s still bullish (so semis) environment where we see strong demand from AI infrastructure builders and so-called \u2018AI enablers,\u2019\u201d concludes Oakoff. The investor is therefore rating AMD a Strong Buy. (To watch Oakoff Investments\u2019 track record, click here)\n\nWall Street, at large, also holds a positive outlook on AMD, supported by 25 Buys, 11 Holds, and a single Sell rating, cumulatively assigning AMD a consensus Moderate Buy rating. The 12-month average price target of $147.81 indicates a potential upside of ~39% over the next year.

            "content": "AMD\u2019s AI Pivot: Is this a strategic move or a desperate gamble? How will it impact the employees who make it possible.\n\nAMD layoffs will affect 4% of its workforce as it shifts focus from gaming to AI and data centers, aiming to challenge NVIDIA\u2019s dominance in the AI chip market. With increasing competition from both NVIDIA and Intel, AMD is betting big on its Instinct MI300X GPUs and upcoming MI350-series. But will this strategic move give AMD the edge it needs, or is it a last-ditch effort to retain its position?\n\nIn November 2024, AMD announced job cuts that would slash its workforce by 4%, which means 1000 employees will lose their jobs from its total of 26,000 employees. This strategic move of AMD layoffs aims to focus on high-growth areas like artificial intelligence (AI) to take over Nvidia\u2019s position in the AI chip market which holds more than 80% of the AI GPU market and AMD has been the second-largest.\n\nTech layoffs in 2025 are already ramping up and now it looks like the trend is here to stay.\n\nUnderstanding the AMD Layoffs\n\nAMD saw a 59% drop in gaming unit sales in Q3 2024, pushing it to focus on AI and data centers to better compete with NVIDIA\u2019s H100 and Blackwell GPUs amidst job cuts. This is not something new. AMD had to lay off workers previously too in 2002, 2008, 2009, and 2011, as part of their efforts to remain competitive.\n\nThe layoffs are going to take place mainly in the company\u2019s US offices in the course of the next few months. While the layoff is raising concerns among employees and industry observers about the stability of jobs in the tech sector, AMD is providing severance and career support.\n\nAI Move\n\nAMD has collaborated with other companies to boost its AI technology. Microsoft\u2019s Azure uses AMD\u2019s Instinct MI300X GPUs in their virtual machines known as ND MI300X v5. AMD plans to increase the production of MI325X chips to compete with NVIDIA.\n\nThe company\u2019s CEO, Lisa Su, expects to earn $5.5 billion in AI chip sales this year. They are also working to improve its ROCm platform and supporting open-source projects like Tinygrad, which could enhance software compatibility and make AMD\u2019s AI hardware a stronger contender.\n\nCompetitive Edge\n\nNvidia\u2019s dominance lies in hardware, software, and scale. There was a 69% revenue drop in AMD\u2019s gaming segment due to a decrease in console chip sales. Its gaming GPUs (Radeon) have floundered against Nvidia\u2019s RTX lineup, with Steam surveys showing RDNA 3 cards barely registering. As the gaming hardware market is dwindling, AMD is maneuvering its resources to mid-range GPUs and AI-first priorities where it sees its future potential.\n\nAMD is facing competition not only from Nvidia but also from Intel. Intel\u2019s 15,000 job layoffs and pivoting to Gaudi 3, puts AMD in dire straits. Now the question arises as to whether AMD can compete with these giants and gain ground in the AI market.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for AMD\n\nAs per AMD CEO, Lisa Su, the MI350-series which is expected in the second half of 2025 will enhance performance boost in AI. If Tinygrad, AWS, or Google expand the use of AMD\u2019s MI300X GPUs, AMD could gain market share.\n\nAnalysts and investors have opined that AMD\u2019s layoffs will hurt the AI market. Immediately after the layoff announcement was met, its stock dropped approximately 2.3%. AMD\u2019s recent layoff might fund R&D or acquisitions like their past strategic purchase of Xilinx (a key FPGA chipmaker). However, investors\u2019 sentiments remain cautious as AMD\u2019s stock fell 5% in 2024, while NVIDIA stock surged 200%. The balance between the performance of the two tech giants, Nvidia and AMD, has been interesting to see.\n\nFinal Thoughts on the Future of AMD\n\nAMD\u2019s layoffs and doubling down on data center chips underscores a phenomenal move as it is battling to dethrone Nvidia. The question remains whether the leaner structure of AMD is the correct move to effectively compete in the AI domain or whether it is a desperate gamble to close the gap with NVIDIA and Tesla in the AI race.\n\nWill AMD\u2019s AI-focused strategy give results as planned, or is it just a desperate gamble?

The company noted that the trial did not meet its primary endpoint of mean change in best corrected visual acuity or BCVA from baseline to week 52.\n\nThere was no numerical difference observed in the key secondary endpoints. Sozinibercept combination therapy was well tolerated.\n\nOpthea said it has undertaken a thorough review of the data, following the receipt of these results, to ensure both its accuracy and integrity. No anomalies were identified through the process that would cause the Board to adopt an alternative view on the data.\n\nFollowing the negative results in the trial, Opthea has been assessing its rights and obligations under its DFA with, among others, the investors under the DFA. In light of these updates, it is possible that under the DFA, Opthea could become required to pay amounts to the DFA Investors that would have a material adverse impact on the solvency of the company.\n\nOpthea's Management and Board of Directors have been in active talks with the DFA Investors to explore possible options for the company in respect of its clinical trial program and to identify whether there is a better pathway.\n\nOpthea and the DFA Investors could reach a negotiated settlement that is different from the parties' existing rights under the DFA.\n\nThe company noted that the DFA Investors have security over the assets of Opthea in the form of an \"all assets\" lien. As a result, Opthea is unable to incur further non-equity funding or dispose of its material assets without the prior consent of the DFA Investors.\n\nOpthea said, \"At this stage, no decision has yet been taken with respect to either trial, including whether to discontinue activities for the COAST trial or accelerate and unmask the ShORe trial. Discussions continue with the DFA Investors to determine the most appropriate course of action.\"\n\nAs of February 28, 2025, Opthea has an unaudited cash and cash equivalents balance of $113.8 million.\n\nAmid these issues, there is a material uncertainty as to Opthea's ability to continue as a going concern.

These logs have revealed key details about two of the upcoming models: the Threadripper Pro 9975WX and 9965WX. The processors are based on AMD's new Zen 5 architecture and expected to introduce significant upgrades while maintaining compatibility with existing platforms.\n\nThe leaks, first spotted in shipping manifests by user @Olrak29_ (since deleted), confirm the existence of the 32-core Threadripper Pro 9975WX and the 24-core Threadripper Pro 9965WX. Both CPUs will feature hyperthreading, with 64 and 48 threads, respectively. This aligns with their predecessors in the Threadripper Pro 7000 series, which also offered the same core and thread configurations. However, the new models will benefit from the Zen 5 architecture, promising improved performance and efficiency.\n\nOne notable constant is the thermal design power (TDP), which remains at 350W for both models. This matches the wattage of the current-gen Threadripper Pro 7000 series, ensuring drop-in compatibility for existing systems.\n\nBeyond these two models, the Threadripper Pro 9000 series is expected to feature five models in all, ranging from 16 to 96 cores. Chips including a flagship 96-core/192-thread Threadripper Pro 9995WX, a 64-core/128-thread 9985WX, and a 16-core/32-thread 9955WX have previously been spotted. Interestingly, AMD may skip the 12-core variant this time.\n\nUnder the hood, the Zen 5 architecture brings a smaller 4nm process node, offering better power efficiency compared to the 5nm node used in the Threadripper 7000 series. Each Zen 5 core complex die (CCD) packs eight cores and 32MB of L3 cache, meaning the 32-core 9975WX will utilize four CCDs, while the 96-core 9995WX will house a whopping 12 CCDs and 384MB of L3 cache. This cache structure mirrors the current generation, suggesting no major changes in this area.\n\nThat said, while the leaks provide a glimpse into AMD's plans, it's important to note that shipping manifests are not official sources. AMD has yet to confirm the lineup or announce a release date. But the mere appearance of these logs hints that an official launch could be just around the corner.\n\nImage credit: Tom's Hardware",

The fact that the US debt-to-GDP ratio has risen to over 122% poses significant risks, according to the founder of Bridgewater Associates.\n\nOver the last two quarters, GDP has been gradually increasing, and unemployment and inflation have been relatively stable. However, Ray Dalio has warned that America\u2019s national debt is a problem that is imminently coming and that it will rock the boat. According to Dalio, the US deficit must drop from a projected 7.2% of gross domestic product to about 3% of GDP.\n\n\u201cWe have a very severe supply and demand problem. Some people think we\u2019ll handle it because we\u2019ve handled it so far. I don\u2019t think they understand the mechanics of debt.\u201d Dalio said\n\nDalio\u2019s caution comes as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration struggles to retain significant tax cuts while simultaneously cutting the annual deficit, which most recently hit $1.8 trillion.\n\nAccording to Dalio, President Trump has undoubtedly shown that he is not afraid to use economic pressure to further his objectives. An examination of his executive orders since assuming office is sufficient proof that he has what it takes to reduce the US deficit and heightened debt levels.\n\nHowever, the Oval Office might have lost some of its goodwill with the countries that would have hurried to its aid by inflicting pain through trade tariffs. Uncertainty around trade policy has exacerbated investor anxiety on Wall Street as they worry about how a potential trade war will affect the world economy.\n\nTariffs against Canada, Mexico, and China are part of Trump\u2019s trade policies, which are intended to rebalance the economy to America\u2019s advantage. Nevertheless, they have the potential to trigger an economic slowdown and higher inflation.\n\nEven as Dalio remains concerned about the US debt levels and the uncertainty triggered by trade wars, he remains bullish about the US equity markets. Bridgewater Associates\u2019 portfolio has significant exposure to tech stocks as it looks to benefit from the AI spectacle.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make the list of the 10 Best stocks to buy, according to billionaire Ray Dalio, we selected the top 10 stocks in Bridgewater Associates\u2019 portfolio as of its Q4 2024 13F filing.

            "content": "AMD's upcoming Threadripper PRO 9000 series will carry on similar core specs as its predecessor, as was spotted in the latest NBD shipping manifest.\n\nAMD Shimada Peak aka Threadripper PRO 9000WX SKUs Leaked in the NBD Shipping Manifest\n\nAMD's Threadripper series offers terrific computing potential for workstations and AMD has continued the Threadripper series since the time it launched it alongside the Ryzen 1000 series. While AMD has already delivered the Zen 5-based Ryzen 9000 CPUs for mainstream desktop platforms, the Threadripper 9000 series is yet to arrive.\n\nAMD hasn't even announced the CPUs, but we are already seeing some leaks related to the SKUs in the Threadripper 9000 family. The Threadripper 7000 series was launched in 2023 and was based on the Zen 4 architecture. On the other hand, the Threadripper 9000 will utilize the Zen 5 architecture and is expected to be released this year.\n\nAs spotted by the user @Olrak29_ (tweet deleted), two of the SKUs from the Threadripper 9000 series were spotted in NBD shipping logs, revealing and confirming the model names and some of their specifications. One is the Threadripper PRO 9965WX, featuring 24 cores, and the other is the Threadripper PRO 9975WX with a 32-core configuration. These will feature hyperthreading as usual and hence, we will see 24-core/48-thread and 32-core/64-thread contigs respectively.\n\nFor comparison, both of their predecessors feature the same core/thread configuration, and just like the Ryzen counterparts, we won't be seeing an increase in the core/thread count. Both CPUs will be rated at 350W, a TDP that is common across all the Threadripper PRO 7000WX processors, including the slowest 12-core variant and even the fastest 96-core CPU. Remember that the 9975WX isn't the fastest Threadripper chip you will see, but it is going to be the flagship Threadripper PRO 9995WX, a 96-core/192-thread monster chip.\n\nThen there should be a Threadripper PRO 9985WX as well, featuring 64 cores and 128 threads. The crucial differences between the 9975WX/9965WX and 7975WX/7965WX are the architecture and the clock speed. The clock speeds are yet to be known, but other smaller things like the socket and the process node are known from earlier leaks. These CPUs will utilize the same SP6 socket as the Threadripper 7000 series and will be based on a 4nm process node, which is smaller and more power-efficient than the 5nm node used on the latter.",

            "content": "AMD Targets Market Share Growth With New Radeon GPUs The upcoming ASUS Radeon RX 9060 XT series aims to challenge NVIDIA's dominance in the desktop GPU market.\n\nThe world of graphics processing is evolving rapidly, and AMD is making significant strides with its Radeon RX 9000 RDNA 4 series graphics cards. Currently, this lineup includes four models: the ASUS Radeon RX 9070 Prime OC, ASUS Radeon RX 9070 TUF Gaming OC, ASUS Radeon RX 9070 XT Prime OC, and ASUS Radeon RX 9070 XT TUF Gaming OC. However, fresh developments suggest that AMD is poised to enrich its portfolio as ASUS prepares to launch additional Radeon RX 9060 XT cards, with the official announcement anticipated before the summer of 2025.\n\nAs reported by various sources, including H&Co, AMD's initiative seems to challenge NVIDIA's stronghold in the desktop GPU market, where AMD held merely 10% share as of 2024, but the RX 9070 series could enable the company to capture over 20% in the coming year. Much of this shift results from NVIDIA\u2019s struggles, which have included disappointing performance from its RTX 50 series, among other issues.\n\nAccording to the latest updates from ASUS, the upcoming Radeon RX 9060 XT series will comprise six models: ASUS Radeon RX 9060 XT 8 Go Dual, ASUS Radeon RX 9060 XT 8 Go Dual OC, ASUS Radeon RX 9060 XT 8 Go Prime, ASUS Radeon RX 9060 XT 8 Go Prime OC, ASUS Radeon RX 9060 XT 16 Go TUF Gaming, and ASUS Radeon RX 9060 XT 16 Go TUF Gaming OC. The inclusion of the \"Dual\" series marks the return of an entry-level option from ASUS, which had not been available in 2025 until now. This aligns with AMD\u2019s broader strategy to compete effectively with NVIDIA by offering a diverse product range.\n\nAMD's revival in the GPU sector demands further enhancements across several facets of its technology. Experts suggest that FSR 4 adoption, which is AMD's answer to NVIDIA's DLSS, lacks sufficient game title support, with only 21 compatible titles, compared to over 100 under NVIDIA's umbrella. This inadequate availability stifles potential sales and user interest.\n\nThe RX 9070 XT graphics card is commendable for its ray tracing capabilities, outperforming its competitor, the RX 7900 XTX, by nearly 15% on average. Notably, it achieves similar rays tracing performance to the RTX 4070 Ti Super. However, it lags significantly when subjected to demanding path tracing effects, revealing a performance gap of over 65% in certain use cases, such as games like Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nAnother area where AMD needs to strengthen its offerings relates to frame generation technology. Currently, FSR 3 frame generation features higher latency compared to NVIDIA\u2019s offering, which is a crucial aspect for gamers who value smooth, responsive gameplay. Observations indicate that AMD's frame generation cannot yet compete effectively against NVIDIA's well-established and broadly supported technology.\n\nFinally, AMD\u2019s productivity performance, particularly in professional settings, is an area of concern. NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA technology provides a significant edge, dominating the computational heavy tasks involving AI and rendering. AMD is attempting to bridge this gap with its forthcoming UDNA architecture, aiming to unify gaming and compute-focused capabilities.\n\nAMD must also consider how best to enhance its Radeon Anti-Lag technology, an important feature to compete with NVIDIA Reflex, known for reducing input latency across numerous gaming titles. Currently, AMD\u2019s solution offers limited support, focusing on only three games, a stark contrast to NVIDIA's widespread implementation.\n\nIn summary, while AMD is generating increased interest in its GPU offerings with recent developments, it must work diligently to address shortcomings in technology adoption rates, performance enhancements, and productivity capabilities. The RX 9070 series shows promise, but for AMD to maintain momentum and assert itself seriously against NVIDIA, these hurdles must be overcome before the company can genuinely claim a substantial market presence.",

            "content": "On that note, investors are understandably disappointed that AMD has not come close to matching Nvidia's growth. And while I doubt that will change in the future, I do think the market has become overly pessimistic where AMD is concerned. Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase by 40% in 2025. That makes its current valuation of 32 times earnings look downright cheap.\n\nKelleher at Argus Research recently wrote: \"Share gains in client and in data center CPUs, market leadership in console gaming, and the much-enhanced embedded business all position AMD for long-term growth exceeding that of the peer group.\" He also argued that AMD's share price does not accurately reflect its long-term growth potential as it continues to take CPU share from Intel and possibly win GPU share from Nvidia.\n\nOverall, AMD reported strong financial results in the fourth quarter, but the market was disappointed because its data center sales missed estimates. Total revenue increased 24% to $7.6 billion and non-GAAP net income increased 42% to $1.09 per diluted share. On the earnings call, CEO Lisa Su told analysts that AMD's data center AI sales would increase from $5 billion in 2024 to \"tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue over the coming years.\"\n\nAMD designs chips for four key end markets: data centers, client (laptops and desktops), video game consoles, and embedded processors. The company in recent years has consistently gained market share in central processing units (CPUs) in the client and data center segments, while Intel has lost market share. But AMD has failed to take share from Nvidia in the markets for graphics processing units (GPUs) and the similar (but more specialized) chips dubbed artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators.\n\nMark Mahaney at Evercore has set a 12-month price target of $115 per share on Uber. That implies a 55% upside from its current share price of $74, and a $240 billion market cap.\n\nJim Kelleher at Argus Research has a 12-month price target of $160 per share on AMD. That would amount to a 52% gain from its current share price of around $105, and a $260 billion market cap on the company.\n\nShares of Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) have climbed by 255% over the last year, bringing its market value to about $200 billion. However, several Wall Street analysts expect Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) to top that market cap in the next year. Among them:\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf AMD's data center GPU revenue accelerates in the second half of 2025 as CEO Lisa Su predicts, that could pull the stock out of the doldrums and potentially drive it to the 52% gain that Kelleher anticipates. Regardless, this would be a good time for patient investors to open a small position in the stock.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nUber Technologies: 55% implied upside\n\nUber is a leader in mobility and food delivery services. It operates the largest ride-sharing platform and second-largest restaurant food delivery service in the U.S. as measured by revenue. Uber also has the largest ride-sharing platform in nine other countries, and the largest food-delivery platform in seven countries.\n\nThe company has several important competitive advantages. First, its ability to offer mobility and delivery services through the same platform creates cost efficiencies through cross-selling opportunities. Second, its scale strengthens the network effect inherent to its business; the number of trips it facilitates is increasing more quickly than the number of people using the platform, which means users are engaging with the platform more frequently.\n\nUber reported solid financial results in the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 20% to $12 billion on strong sales growth in the mobility and delivery segments. Uber also reported a higher take rate in both segments, meaning it kept a larger percentage of every dollar spent on its platform. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA increased 44% to $1.8 billion.\n\nUber may not be a traditional AI stock, but CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told analysts on the latest earnings call that autonomous vehicle (AV) technology will be a $1 trillion opportunity for ride-sharing platforms. Uber is uniquely positioned to benefit given its unmatched scale. \"Uber can deliver the lowest operational costs for our AV partners because we are leaps and bounds ahead on every aspect of go-to-market capabilities,\" he said.\n\nLooking ahead, management estimates that adjusted EBITDA will increase at a compound annual percentage rate in the high 30s to 40 range over the next three years, which implies similar earnings growth. That forecast makes the stock's current valuation of 17 times earnings look cheap. The stock could gain 55% in the next year, as Mark Mahaney at Evercore expects, especially if Uber's partnership with Alphabet's Waymo continues to expand. Patient investors should feel confident buying a few shares today.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

It\u2019s also received a pre-launch spec bump.\n\nOriginally expected to launch with an AMD Hawk Point processor (up to a Ryzen 9 8945HS chip), the AM01S has been retooled with an upgraded motherboard and now supports up to an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 Strix Point processor.\n\nThat means instead of supporting a processor with up to 8 Zen 4 CPU cores and up to 12-core RDNA 3 graphics, the mini PC will support chips with up to 12 Zen 5/5c CPU cores and up to 16-core RDNA 3.5 graphics plus an NPU that delivers up to 50 TOPS of on-device AI performance.\n\nAYANEO says the AM01S has a 4 inch display that\u2019s \u201cbeen upgraded to a native horizontal display, improving compatibility with system interfaces and third-party applications.\u201d While there are still no details about the screen resolution, brightness, or other characteristics, the company says the screen will let you use the mini PC without an external monitor (which could come in handy during setup, or if you\u2019re using the system mostly for headless operations, for example), or treat it as a second screen for an extended desktop experience. You can also use it to view system status information including temperature and fan speed, or for widgets that show things like weather forecasts or a clock. It can also be used to display performance information from tools like MSI Afterburner, or \u201cas a control for specific software.\u201d\n\nThe touchscreen display is surrounded by an aluminum frame, and it can either lie flat against the top of the computer or you can tilt it at up to a 90 degree angle to make the screen easier to see if the AM01S is positioned so that the screen would otherwise point straight upward.\n\nThe AYANEO AM01S has a 1 liter chassis with two SODIMM slots for DDR5-5600 memory, two M.2 2280 slots for PCIe 4.0 SSDs, and a cooling system that includes a large CPU fan, a heat sink, dual heat pipes, and a second fan that covers the SSD. AYANEO says this allows for effective heat dissipation with the system running at up to 65 watts.\n\nPorts include:\n\n2 x USB4 (40 Gbps)\n\n5 x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A (10 Gbps)\n\n1 x USB 2.0 Type-A (480 Mbps)\n\n1 x HDMI 2.0\n\n2 x 2.5 GbE LAN\n\n1 x 3.5mm audio\n\n1 x DC power input\n\nPricing and availability details haven\u2019t been revealed yet.\n\nSupport Liliputing Liliputing's primary sources of revenue are advertising and affiliate links (if you click the \"Shop\" button at the top of the page and buy something on Amazon, for example, we'll get a small commission).

            "content": "Yesterday, Funcom revealed the detailed PC specifications of their upcoming large scale multiplayer survival game Dune Awakening. There's already a benchmark (with character creator) available on Steam to test out the expected performance, but these specs will be welcome nonetheless, especially since they anticipate a reasonably optimized game despite the usage of Unreal Engine 5.\n\nDUNE AWAKENING MINIMUM (LOW) MEDIUM RECOMMENDED (HIGH) ULTRA Settings 1080p 30fps 1080p 60fps 1440p 60fps 2160p 60fps OS Windows 10 64-bit (or newer) Windows 10 64-bit (or newer) Windows 10 64-bit (or newer) Windows 10 64-bit (or newer) Processor Intel Core i5-7400 AMD Ryzen 1200 Intel Core i5-8600K AMD Ryzen 5 2600 Intel Core i7-10700K AMD Ryzen 5 5600X Intel Core i7-11700K AMD Ryzen 7 5800X Memory 16 GB RAM 16 GB RAM 16 GB RAM 16 GB RAM Graphics NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB) AMD Radeon 5600XT (6GB) Intel Arc A380 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 (8GB) AMD Radeon RX 6600 (8GB) Intel Arc A770 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 (8GB) AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT (12GB) Intel Arc B580 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 (12GB) AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT (12GB) Storage 60 GB available space SSD 75 GB available space SSD 75 GB available space SSD 75 GB available space SSD\n\nWe already knew that the game would support NVIDIA DLSS 4, including Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation. Now, Funcom has confirmed that Dune Awakening will also integrate 'the latest open upscaling and advanced frame generation tech from AMD', which would appear to hint at AMD FSR 3 support (FSR 4 is exclusive to the new AMD GPUs) as well as Intel XeSS 2 with XeLL to lower latency.\n\nAdditionally, thanks to a partnership with Razer, Dune Awakening integrates Razer Chroma RGB and Razer Sensa HD Haptics, enhancing immersion. The Razer Kraken V4 Pro headset provides synced lighting and intelligent haptic feedback, just like the Freyja Gaming Cushion, which will let you feel the hum of your ornithopter as if you were sitting on it.\n\nThe following tweakable settings were confirmed, too:\n\nSettings\n\nRemappable keyboard & mouse controls\n\nBetter support for AZERTY/QWERTZ and ESDF users\n\nSubtitles on/off\n\nSubtitle backgrounds\n\nOptional chat indicators or chat bubbles in social areas\n\nOptional loadout hotbar, mini-radial or radial wheel\n\nController rumble on/off\n\nScreenshake on/off\n\nMotion blur on/off\n\nFOV adjustment\n\nFramerate limiter\n\nUltrawide HUD option (21:9 and 32:9)\n\nMultiple audio channel sliders\n\nMultiple sensitivity sliders\n\nGeneral Gameplay\n\nController support\n\nDialogue system with path highlights\n\nAudio SFX to support key actions/events\n\nTutorials with highlighted text\n\nTutorial repository for reviewing unlocked or missed tutorials\n\nEmotes system\n\nHelp popups on several menus to explain specific features or game mechanics\n\nLast but certainly not least, Game Director Joel Bylos spoke in a brief video about the business model ahead of the pre-order opening. Dune Awakening will be buy-to-play only, so there won't be any optional subscriptions. Bylos stressed that this won't be an early access launch. That said, Funcom has a long history of supporting games like its MMOs (Anarchy Online is still active 25 years later) and, more recently, Conan Exiles, and the same will happen with this one through a combination of free updates and optional premium DLCs.\n\nThere will also be optional Season Passes, which include several DLCs, but the DLCs will also be purchasable separately. Finally, as with most games, there will be five days of advanced access for those who purchase the most expensive editions. Bylos noted that this, however, helps the studio balance server load, ensuring a better experience for everyone. Furthermore, when the game launches for everyone, there will be new servers for those who don't wish to join a server where others have already started progressing.\n\nFor our interview with Joel Bylos at a recent event, head to this article. Dune Awakening is out in less than two months on PC, while the console versions will be released at a later date.",

            "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 0.93%) has been ahead of the curve in terms of the AI sell-off trend. The chip stock peaked in March 2024 and has trended lower ever since, and is now down by around 50% from its all-time high.\n\nHowever, numerous Wall Street analysts have much higher price targets on AMD, suggesting that it could be a screaming buy here. Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities has the highest price target on Wall Street for AMD stock at $225. With AMD shares hovering around $100, that indicates a potential 12-month upside of around 125%.\n\nAny investor would be happy with that kind of return, but is it realistic to expect?\n\nAMD isn't the leader in any particular industry\n\nAMD has always produced great hardware, but it never seems to be the leader when it matters most. In the early 2000s, Intel was the top dog in the processor space, while AMD was only allowed to stick around because Intel didn't want to be broken up for being a monopoly. History has repeated itself in the AI chip race, where Nvidia is dominating the incredibly important data center market.\n\nIn Q4, AMD's data center division generated $3.9 billion in revenue, up 69% year over year. However, Nvidia continued to eat AMD's lunch. In its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter, which ended Jan. 26, its data center revenue grew by 93% to $35.6 billion. So, not only is AMD's data center division much smaller than Nvidia's, but it's also growing at a slower rate. That's not a winning combination, and is a big reason why AMD's stock has been such a poor performer recently.\n\nThe core of the investment thesis for AMD in early 2024 was that onlookers expected that it would start to gain some ground on Nvidia throughout the year as the largest AI chip buyers started to focus more on hardware geared toward inference rather than training. However, that trend didn't emerge, and Nvidia also didn't lose any ground on the inference front as it launched its new Blackwell architecture graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nFurthermore, AMD hasn't been doing great in its other markets. Its gaming revenue was down 59% year over year in Q4, while embedded process revenue decreased by 13%. Client revenue was a bright spot, up 58% year over year to $2.3 billion. However, the PC market isn't really growing in size, so that revenue stream will continue to be quite cyclical.\n\nStill, despite AMD's somewhat disappointing Q4 results, its overall revenue grew by 24%, and profits rose by 42%. Most companies and their shareholders would be happy with those results, but because AMD hasn't been gaining ground on its key rival, the stock price has continued to sink.\n\nThis is where the new AMD investment thesis comes in, as it's starting to look like a value play.\n\nAMD's stock appears to be fairly priced\n\nAMD's stock isn't necessarily dirt cheap from a trailing earnings perspective. For a few recent quarters, the business wasn't optimized for earnings, so its trailing earnings multiple looks inflated. As a result, investors would be better served to use the forward price-to-earning (P/E) ratio to gauge the stock's valuation, as that metric is unaffected by the one-time events that skewed the trailing earnings metric.\n\nAt 21.5 times forward earnings, AMD trades at a slight premium to the S&P 500, which is currently valued at 20.5 times forward earnings. Given that AMD is expected to grow its revenue by 23.4% and 20.7% in 2025 and 2026, respectively, that slight premium seems like a reasonable price to pay.\n\nCould AMD stock rise by 125% in the next year, as Hans Mosesmann projects? I doubt it. That would give AMD a ridiculously high multiple for a company that is not a best-in-class provider. However, I think market-beating returns are certainly attainable from today's price, and investors willing to hold onto the stock for three to five years will likely beat the market if they take positions in the stock now.",

In recent years, AMD has emerged as the preferred choice for gamers, often topping sales charts, including Amazon\u2019s CPU best-sellers list.\n\nJust yesterday, AMD dominated the top 15 spots instead of Intel. Surprisingly, the top processor was AMD\u2019s Ryzen 7 9800X3D, a high-end gaming chip, priced at $480, despite its occasional stock shortages.\n\nThe top 15 list featured a mix of older and newer AMD processors, such as the Ryzen 5 5500 and Ryzen 5 5600X, indicating that AMD has successfully kept older hardware relevant and in demand.\n\nHowever, today\u2019s best-seller list paints a slightly different picture, as Intel has managed to secure several spots, with older models like the Alder Lake chips offering more affordable alternatives to current AMD processors.\n\nInterestingly, Intel\u2019s latest Arrow Lake processors did not make it to the top 50 best-sellers on Amazon. This suggests that many customers prefer the more affordable Intel options or turn to AMD, which has shifted the market dynamics significantly in recent years.\n\nFor more information on these topics, visit diplomacy.edu.",

However, rustling for Radeon rather than GeForce may be significantly easier according to one retailer.\n\nSpeaking to YouTuber Moore\u2019s Law Is Dead, a major retailer has apparently claimed that AMD is \u201cdelivering 2-4x as many RDNA 4 GPUs as all weekly Blackwell shipments combined.\u201d Making matters worse for Nvidia, the store highlights it\u2019s only receiving shipments for GeForce RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070 with RTX 5090 effectively MIA.\n\nThis retailer\u2019s account is likely indicative of the wider landscape but stock levels for current-generation AMD graphics cards remain low. At the time of writing, UK retailer Scan has no Radeon RX 9070 XT models available for immediate sale and is only able to offer less-than-half of its RX 9070 listings. Meanwhile it\u2019s impossible to get any RDNA 4 GPUs from Newegg USA unless you fancy opting for a combo with another component such as a PSU.\n\nGeForce RTX 50 Series stock is in a similarly hard to come by at both retailers. However, any availability is an improvement over the sparse landscape Overclockers UK highlighted just a few weeks ago. The problem now becomes adherence to MSRP, as both AMD and Nvidia graphics cards are commonly selling for higher prices due to supply failing to keep up with demand.\n\nWhile picking up a current-generation pixel pusher is possible today, the smart move remains waiting a while longer for market conditions to cool down. I expect demand for Radeon RX 9070 XT especially to remain high, given the stronger value it offers relative to RX 9070 and versus GeForce RTX 5070. AMD and its partners are presumably doing all they can to address these problems and capitalise on excitement for its new cards, so a little patience should go a long way if you\u2019re hungry for RDNA 4. April could provide some reprieve, according to Yeston.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping GeForce RTX 5060 and Radeon RX 9060 Series graphics cards don\u2019t suffer the same supply issues as their siblings, especially if the former is arriving later than planned. The last thing budget gamers need is an unexpected price bump.\n\nWhile the graphics card market is bananas right now, there\u2019s still plenty of exciting stuff happening elsewhere in the world of PC tech.

That doesn't mean there aren't other contenders for the throne.\n\nTwo large companies vying to make inroads into the AI infrastructure market and steal some Nvlidia thunder are Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). Let's look at which of these two AI contenders is the better stock to own.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nThe AI infrastructure market\n\nAMD and Broadcom are taking different approaches to the AI infrastructure market in a bid to take some market share away from Nvidia. Both have been seeing strong growth coming from AI.\n\nAMD holds the No. 2 spot in producing graphics processing units (GPUs) behind Nvidia. These chips have become the backbone of AI infrastructure due to their powerful processing speeds that can handle AI workloads. However, with about a 10% to 17% market share in the GPU space, it greatly trails Nvidia, which controls more than 80% of the market.\n\nAMD's biggest issue has been its inferior software platform compared to Nvidia. The company didn't develop its ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) software until around 2016, a decade after Nvidia created its CUDA platform. Meanwhile, semiconductor research company SemiAnalysis found its GPUs to generally be unusable for AI training out of the box due to software incompatibilities.\n\nAMD's GPUs have been used more for AI inference, as well as as an alternative to Nvidia chips when they aren't available. AMD has found a strong niche in the central processing unit (CPU) data center market, where it has been taking more market share. While GPUs provide the power, CPUs act more as the brains of the operation. It's not as big of a market, but it's still an important one that is growing quickly along with the AI infrastructure market.\n\nA computer chip with the letters AI on it.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBroadcom, on the other hand, doesn't make GPUs or CPUs. Instead, it has been attacking the AI infrastructure market by helping customers develop custom AI chips called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). While these custom chips lack the flexibility of GPUs and take more time and money to develop, they outperform GPUs for the specific tasks for which they are designed and they consume less power.\n\nThe company also participates in the networking side of AI infrastructure where it makes components such as Ethernet switches and network interface cards (NICs). These components are integral in managing the flow of data and distributing AI workloads across servers.\n\nHowever, Broadcom's biggest opportunity is in the custom AI chip market. The company currently has seven AI chip customers at various stages of development. For the three farthest along in that development, it predicts that it will have a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market opportunity in its fiscal year 2026 (ending October 2026) alone, as these customer look to build AI chip clusters consisting of 1 million AI chips. While Broadcom won't get all of that business (some will likely continue to go to Nvidia), it is a big opportunity. Meanwhile, its newer customers should help drive revenue growth in later years.\n\nAMD grew its data center revenue by 69% last quarter to $3.9 billion, while Broadcom increased its AI-related revenue by 77% to $4.1 billion. That's pretty similar, although Broadcom appears to have the larger AI opportunity moving forward. Broadcom has a number of custom AI chip customers ramping up the next few years that should help propel growth, while AMD will have to continue to try and chip away at Nvidia in the GPU market.\n\nValuations and verdict\n\nAMD is the cheaper of the two stocks.

            "content": "In this article AMD Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nLisa Su, CEO of AMD, attends the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit at the Grand Palais in Paris, Feb. 10, 2025. Benoit Tessier | Reuters\n\nWhen Lisa Su became CEO of Advanced Micro Devices in late 2014, the company was in dire straits and on the brink of potential bankruptcy. In its core market, computer processors, AMD wasn't competitive with rival Intel . The company had billions of dollars of debt, and had committed to manufacturing chips for customers that may or may not exist. By the end of the year, AMD was worth a mere $2 billion in market value, while Intel was valued at about $180 billion. \"I actually had mentors in my career saying, you know, I don't think that that's a good move,\" Su, 55, said in a speech at Stanford University in March, reflecting on her decision to take the gig a little over a decade earlier. Su is in a very different spot today. AMD passed rival Intel in market value in 2022 and is now worth $172 billion, a roughly 85-fold increase during Su's tenure. Millions of gamers rely on AMD processors every day as they power up their Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation consoles. AMD chips are so important that the U.S. government sees them as critical to national security. Yet AMD still views itself as an underdog. That's because it's a distant second in artificial intelligence, behind Nvidia , the almost $3 trillion behemoth that dominates the market for graphics processing units, or GPUs. To have a serious role in the future of technology, AMD knows it needs a bigger chunk of the AI GPU market, where the biggest tech companies in the world are spending many billions of dollars a year on advanced infrastructure. Underpinning AMD's strategy is Su's belief, rooted in her engineering background, that success in this industry is driven by making the right technical decisions that lead to the highest-performance chips. It can take a long time to see the results show up in products. \"One of the things that I like to say about the semiconductor industry, or technology in general, is the decisions that we make today, you will really see the impact three to five years down the road,\" Su said at Stanford. \"It is all about making the right bets.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nSu stands out in Silicon Valley, especially during Women's History Month, because she's the only female CEO among the top 10 semiconductor companies by market cap. Chips remain a male-dominant field, with women accounting for just 30% of the industry's head count, according to Accenture. She's also been the highest-paid female CEO for five years running, according to an Associated Press survey. The stats aren't favorable across the corporate world. About 10% of Fortune 500 CEOs are women, with 52 in the group in 2024, up from 41 in 2021, according to the Women Business Collaborative.\n\n'She knows what they do'\n\nSu, who's known to make bets in her personal life \u2014 she's a fan of Texas Hold 'em, and has been spotted playing poker with her sales staff \u2014 is making a long-term professional wager on AI. AMD has committed to announcing new AI chips on an annual basis and building out a software division with thousands of employees to create open-source tools for its chips that can compete with Nvidia's dominant CUDA language. Su is deeply involved with the company's technology road map, frequently visiting the company's chip labs, said AMD technology chief Mark Papermaster. \"Lisa is so admired by the engineering team because she knows what they do, and they know she knows it,\" Papermaster said. AMD declined to make Su available for an interview. Su was born in Taiwan in 1969 and came to the U.S. as a child because her dad came for graduate school. She's described her childhood as a \"typical Asian upbringing\" centered around school. She attended The Bronx High School of Science in New York. She first encountered the semiconductor industry as a freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she did her undergraduate work before pursuing a Ph.D. in electrical engineering. Her research centered on the manufacturing side of chips. As a graduate student in 1992, she wrote an award-winning paper about testing silicon-on-insulator technology. That ended up being one of the core production methods used to improve chips during the 1990s and 2000s. Su went to work at Texas Instruments after graduating and then IBM , overseeing research and design teams focused on chip manufacturing. There, she was tapped to be the technical assistant for Lou Gerstner, IBM's chair and CEO at the time. After IBM, Su joined Freescale Semiconductor as its CTO, a particularly rare feat, as even today only about 8% of tech companies have women in that role. In 2012, she was hired by AMD's then-CEO Rory Read to run the company's business units. Su's ascension to the top role in 2014 kicked off one of the biggest turnarounds in the history of the technology industry. When she joined AMD, it was a company at a low point and many people believed it might not survive much longer. \"AMD was having some serious cash issues,\" said Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights and a former AMD executive who left the year before Su joined. \"AMD had to completely press the reset button.\"\n\nAn artificial intelligence processor is displayed by Lisa Su, chair and chief executive officer of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., during the Computex conference in Taipei, Taiwan, June 3, 2024. Annabelle Chih | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nOn her first day as CEO, AMD's stock was trading at just over $3 per share. It's now at more than $106 per share. AMD is the fourth-most-valuable U.S. chip company, ahead of Intel, and behind Nvidia, Broadcom and Qualcomm . The rebound started with tough decisions nearly as soon as Su took over. That included cutting 7% of AMD's staff. She also turned to Sony and Microsoft to build AMD's game console chips, a move designed to help the company's cash flow and to fill the chip factories it had already committed to using. But Su said during her talk at Stanford that it wasn't the cuts that saved AMD. Rather, it was the bet on developing new technology. \"It's fairly clear in tech, there's no such thing as cutting yourself to be a winner,\" she said. Su turned AMD's attention to products, and she encouraged staff to prioritize building the highest-performance chips. She also made the decision to stop selling lucrative server chips until AMD had products that could compete with Intel on performance, Papermaster said.\n\nRedesigning from the ground up\n\nOne big problem for AMD was that its processor design was aging \u2014 and quickly. Su approved a \"blank sheet\" approach that emphasized a redesigned compute core \u2014 AMD's most valuable intellectual property \u2014 from the ground up. It took years, and AMD didn't start selling products based on its \"Zen\" core until 2017. The technology is now on its fifth generation of improvements. On Su's watch, AMD was the first major company to embrace a technology called \"chiplets.\" Instead of manufacturing one big chip with all the elements needed \u2014 the compute cores as well as an input and output block \u2014 AMD could make smaller chips and then assemble them together. Chiplets allowed AMD to be more flexible and more efficient in manufacturing. The change also allowed AMD to use different foundries for different parts of the chip, and reduce the risk associated with manufacturing, a critical consideration due to the company's tight cash position. It was a good fit for AMD, especially as it transitioned in 2019 to use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to build its chips. The focus on chiplets allowed AMD to grow at a time when Intel was suffering from its investments in the wrong manufacturing technologies, said Scott Thompson, professor of electrical engineering at the University of Florida, who said he has followed Su's career since her doctorate. \"Lisa Su knows fundamentally how chips are made,\" Thompson said. \"She understands the risk with different technology options, and she can assess that risk and make the right choice.\" Intel declined to comment. Chiplets are now used by nearly every major processor company, and the technology was a core part of AMD's first \"big GPU.\" AMD's experience in chiplets enabled it to take an announced data center GPU \u2014 originally designed for supercomputing, which is different from AI applications \u2014 and simply swap out the CPU chiplets to make it one large GPU better suited for AI. AMD's first big GPU, the Instinct MI300X, launched in 2023, just over a year after OpenAI launched ChatGPT and kicked off the generative AI boom.\n\nLisa Su, CEO of AMD, left, and Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia Benoit Tessier | Ritzau Scanpix | Mads Claus Rasmussen | Reuters\n\nThe next arc\n\nAMD's revenue in 2024 jumped 14% to about $26 billion, nearly five times as much as when Su took over as CEO. The company spent $6.5 billion on research last year, over six times its outlay in 2014. But its current relationship to the GPU market leader, Nvidia, resembles its standing against Intel in CPUs a decade ago. AMD has AI accelerators on the market, has told customers and investors when to expect future chips, and recorded $5 billion in AI chip sales last year, up from $100 million in 2023, according to Papermaster. Still, it lags far behind Nvidia, which reported $115 billion of data center chip and networking sales in its latest fiscal year. AMD shares are down more than 10% so far this year after dropping 18% in 2024. That followed a 128% pop the prior year. The biggest challenge for Su may lie in software. AMD's hardware is comparable to Nvidia's chips and can even win in some benchmarks. The company's AI chips are viable, and Su is building their credibility. While AMD is the only real alternative to Nvidia, most AI developers already know how to use Nvidia's proprietary CUDA software, which allows programmers to access core hardware parts of a GPU for AI development. For Su, the answer is ROCm. That's AMD's version of CUDA, and it's free to use. Su is counting on ROCm to help AMD win over developers who want more than just what Nvidia offers. Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment. Last year, AMD reorganized some of its software groups, including the teams working on ROCm, into a new AI software division. AMD also began to open source many of its important components and hardware details, allowing programmers to more easily access the raw power of the company's AI chips. To achieve widespread adoption of ROCm, Su will need her team to hit up AI developers and make efforts to shake off AMD's reputation as a hardware-only company. In December, Su personally reached out to one public critic of AMD's software, posting on social media after the meeting that \"we have put a ton of work into customer and workload optimizations but there is lots more we can do.\" Su generally plays down the market-share rivalry with Nvidia. She sees the AI chip market growing to $500 billion per year by 2028 \u2014 the same size as the entire semiconductor market before the AI boom. She's counting on AMD to get a big chunk of it.",

These technologies will pave the way for the next generation of visual fidelity while focusing on some big performance uplifts for all.\n\nStarting with DXR 1.2 (DirectX Raytracing), Microsoft is introducing two new technologies which include OMM (opacity micromaps) and SER (shader execution reordering), which will help deliver huge performance boosts.\n\nOpacity micromaps s ignificantly optimize alpha-tested geometry, delivering up to 2.3x performance improvement in path-traced games. By efficiently managing opacity data, OMM reduces shader invocations and greatly enhances rendering efficiency without compromising visual quality.\n\nShader execution reordering offers a major leap forward in rendering performance \u2014 up to 2x faster in some scenarios \u2014 by intelligently grouping shader execution to enhance GPU efficiency, reduce divergence, and boost frame rates, making raytraced titles smoother and more immersive than ever. This feature paves the way for more path-traced games in the future.\n\nDXR 1.2 aims to deliver up to 40% improvements in performance during complex scenes as demoed within Remedy's Alan Wake 2 which was showcased at GDC with the latest tech while delivering substantially detailed raytraced visuals.\n\nThe company states that NVIDIA has already embraced these two cutting-edge features and will enable driver support across GeForce RTX GPUs while they are also working with AMD, Intel and Qualcomm for wider adoption.\n\nAnother major aspect that is being introduced by Microsoft is support for cooperative vectors, which is a brand-new programming feature coming to Shader Model 6.9, very soon. With these cooperative vectors, developers can leverage new hardware acceleration engines for vector and matrix operations, allowing them to integrate neural rendering techniques directly within the graphics pipeline.\n\nAll major hardware vendors, including NVIDIA, AMD, & Intel, are on board the Cooperative Vectors and Neural Rendering train:\n\nNeural Block Texture Compression is a new graphics technique that dramatically reduces memory usage, while maintaining exceptional visual fidelity. Overall, our partners at Intel shared that by leveraging cooperative vectors to power advanced neural compression models, they saw a 10x speed up in inference performance.\n\nReal-time path tracing can be enhanced by neural supersampling and denoising , combining two of the most cutting-edge graphics innovations to provide realistic visuals at practical performance levels.\n\nNVIDIA unveiled that their Neural Shading SDK will support DirectX and utilize cooperative vectors , providing developers with tools to easily integrate neural rendering techniques, significantly improving visual realism without sacrificing performance.\n\nMicrosoft will also be delivering updates to Windows WARP (Advanced Rasterization Platform). WARP, a CPU-based software renderer for DirectX, will get enhanced capabilities and performance updates. This renderer runs solely on the CPU and requires no GPU, making it perfect for systems without compatible GPUs for diagnostics. WARP will now be fully compliant with DX12 Ultimate and will get support for all the latest features such as raytracing, mesh shaders and work graphs.\n\nIn addition to this, Microsoft will also have day-one support for DirectX Raytracing 1.2 (DXR) within their DirectX debugger and profile known as PIX, on Windows. All three technologies are going to be available in the preview Agility SDK which lands in late April 2025. The following are some of the demos showcasing the use of Neural Rendering within tech demos:",

Some of the most powerful graphics cards you can buy are capable of running the most demanding games, all the while maintaining steady high frame rates. Furthermore, you can tweak every game's graphical settings to find the perfect balance between performance and visual fidelity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you've ever dwelled inside a game's video settings, you've more likely than not come across the VSync option. Turning it on might not affect any graphical elements on the screen at first glance, but those who have a handy always-on FPS counter will notice that it caps your frame rate. This can sometimes result in a lower frame rate than what your GPU is capable of outputting, but in practice, VSync aims to deliver a smoother gameplay experience.\n\nNvidia's G-Sync and AMD's FreeSync are similar technologies that are used to eliminate screen tearing. If all three features claim to work towards the same goal of providing smoother gameplay, why do certain monitors boast support for G-Sync while others advertise AMD's FreeSync capabilities \u2014 especially when VSync is already an option in most games? If you've ever wondered why all three technologies exist in tandem, here's a quick explainer going over the major differences between VSync, G-Sync, and FreeSync.\n\nAdvertisement",

            "content": "AMD reportedly has no plan to use its new RDNA 4 gaming GPU architecture for the integrated graphics in its new Ryzen CPUs. After being really impressed by the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT, we were hoping the company\u2019s new GPU architecture could be used as the foundation for a new, smaller GPU inside the company\u2019s chips, but it looks as though that\u2019s not going to happen.\n\nAs we found in our AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT review, the company has made great strides with its latest RDNA 4 GPU architecture. With its massively improved ray tracing performance, as well as the vastly superior image quality of FSR 4, this new AMD GPU went straight to the top of our guide to the best graphics card, but it looks as though this new GPU architecture isn\u2019t going to move into the company\u2019s next-gen CPUs.\n\nThis latest rumor comes from a post on X (formerly Twitter) by regular tech leaker Kepler_L2, after looking at the Github code for AMD\u2019s latest GPUOpen drivers for its APUs in the Vulkan graphics API. Crucially, there\u2019s a section referring to Gfxlp12 (referring to RDNA 4), which is followed by \u201c// dGPU only,\u201d where the \u201cd\u201d is presumably short for \u201cdiscrete.\u201d\n\nThe implication here is that RDNA 4 is only going to be used in discrete GPUs, unlike RDNA 2 (GfxIp10_3), RDNA 3 (GfxIp11_0), and RDNA 3.5 (GfxIp11_5), which can all be called by the driver. \u201cNo RDNA 4 APUs,\u201d says Kepler_L2, followed by a thinking emoji.\n\nWhile this is potentially disappointing news, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if AMD decided to skip RDNA 4 for its next-gen CPUs.\n\nHistorically, AMD\u2019s accelerated processing units (APUs) with full integrated Radeon GPUs have regularly been a generation behind when it comes to GPU architecture. The Ryzen 7 5700G\u2019s GPU was still based on the old Vega architecture when it was released, despite AMD already having RDNA 2 gaming GPUs such as the Radeon RX 6800 XT.\n\nWith AMD also moving to its new UDNA architecture in the future, which unifies its gaming and enterprise architectures under one roof, the company has probably decided it would be more efficient to wait for its next-gen GPU before it makes any radical changes to its CPU designs.\n\nThat said, the new AMD Strix Halo platform has now shown the potential for integrated graphics if AMD goes all out on the GPU design, and it would be great to see what one of these chips could do with the RDNA 4 architecture under its belt.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to buy a new processor now, check out our guide to the best gaming CPU, where you\u2019ll find all our current recommendations, and you can also read our Ryzen 5 8600G review, where we take a look at one of AMD\u2019s latest desktop CPUs with integrated Radeon graphics.\n\nYou can follow us on Google News for daily PC games news, reviews, and guides.

            "content": "Update: AMD reached out to Tom's Hardware to clarify that no claims about sales numbers were given at the event. There was discussion about strong demand for RX 9000 (and X3D), but the 200K claim was not a part of that conversation, according to AMD. The Benchlife page which seems to have been the original source of the claim has also been pulled.\n\n\n\nAMD recently announced that its first run of 200,000 RX 9070-series GPUs has nearly sold out. According to BenchLife.info [machine translated], AMD made this claim during its Advancing AI summit recently held in Beijing, China, where it also talked about the recent release of its Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D chips.\n\nThe RDNA4 GPUs were highly anticipated, especially as Nvidia\u2019s RTX 50 series GPUs were severely understocked. And while Team Red has had months to stockpile graphics cards at retailers, the unprecedented demand for the RX 9070 XT meant that supply was quickly cleared out by frustrated gamers.\n\nBecause of this, some stores and scalpers are taking advantage of the situation, selling 9000-series GPUs way over the MSRP. Even legitimate retailers have reportedly been selling base models at a 22% markup, with some attributing this to tariffs. Despite this, the RX 9070 is on track to become one of the best-selling GPUs of its time, with the graphics card already ranking on top of Amazon\u2019s best-seller lists.\n\nAMD hasn\u2019t released any data to back up its 200K GPU claim, so we can't verify how accurate its sales claim is. But if it\u2019s true, it means that Nvidia\u2019s supply situation is way worse than we believe. After all, we can see this with the better availability of RX 9070 GPUs versus Nvidia\u2019s 50-series.\n\nTeam Green has already admitted to a GPU shortage with its RTX 5090 and 5080 GPUs. However, even the mid-range RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 cards are nowhere to be found. Rumors have swirled that Nvidia supply should improve in the coming months, while an AMD AIB claims that GPU supply for AMD will stabilize by April. These reports likely pertain to chips being released to GPU manufacturers, so we'll likely have to wait for April to June before we see these new stocks arrive on store shelves.\n\nWhile news like this may give us hope for an affordable latest-gen GPU that\u2019s readily available, the way Nvidia has been treating gaming GPUs makes us inclined to not believe anything until we see stocks arrive. As for AMD, it now has the chance to claw back some market share from Nvidia if it can take advantage of the situation and deliver 9070-series stocks before Team Green ramps up deliveries and fills the market with 50-series GPUs.",

The follow-up was at 5 years. The baseline mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) best-corrected VA (BCVA) was 0.42 \u00b1 0.036. The mean CMT was 326.9 \u00b1 10.8 \u00b5m, and the greatest linear dimension (GLD) was 4,037.3 \u00b1 188.5 \u00b5m.\n\nOf the 126 patients, 63 were followed for 5 years with treatment. \u201cAlthough the BCVA significantly improved in all cases of total AMD (including type 3 macular neovascularization [MNV], type 1 or 2 MNV, and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy) until the first year after treatment, it gradually declined and returned to the baseline levels (p < 0.05). The mean BCVA in all patients declined from 0.42 \u00b1 0.036 logMAR at baseline to 0.36 \u00b1 0.055 logMAR at 5 years,\u201d a difference that did not reach significance, they reported.\n\nThe average CMT decreased significantly and was maintained throughout the follow-up period. Multivariable analysis identified the pretreatment GLD as the only independent risk factor for better vision after 5 years of treatment (p = 0.0024).\n\nThe study also showed that patients needed fewer injections from the second year and the number gradually decreased during the follow-up period.\n\nThe IVA treatment was discontinued in 36 (44%) cases during the follow-up period. However, 12 of these eyes (33%) experienced recurrence; significant recurrence was observed in patients who received a higher total number of aflibercept injections. Macular atrophy was significantly more likely to occur in cases with occult MNV with subretinal hemorrhage than in cases with other forms of nAMD, the authors reported.\n\nWada and colleagues concluded, \u201c\u2026aflibercept monotherapy using the TAE regimen-maintained baseline VA and reduced CMT for 5 years in Japanese patients with nAMD.

            "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock has been on quite the wild ride lately, dropping a significant 46% over the past year. Such a plunge typically means significant potential risks actualizing in pragmatic commercial reality to the detriment of shareholders. However, things are a little different with AMD.\n\nUnder the radar, AMD is making headway in the data center arena, and I\u2019m convinced that it might just flip its underdog status into a legit top contender. Despite the stock\u2019s recent nosedive, AMD\u2019s data center business remains a game-changing string in its bow, with current price troubles potential representing a neat buy-the-dip opportunity for investors watching the semiconductor wars from the sidelines.\n\nWith the stock about to dip below $100 for the first time since mid-2023, I remain bullish on AMD, given its oversold status. When the stock languished at current lows in 2023, it bounced back to break above $200 in less than a year. As the world can\u2019t get enough high-quality semiconductors right now, AMD will likely bounce back and rediscover its market luster later this year.\n\nAMD\u2019s Stock Price Plunge Explained\n\nAMD\u2019s 46% slide over the past year was steep, to say the least. Reassuringly for AMD shareholders, the broader tech sector wasn\u2019t spared either. All tech companies have suffered, but to different degrees. If we include external macro factors like rising interest rates, recession fears, and the ripple effects of Trump\u2019s tariff tantrum \u2014 seeing high-beta stocks selling off at the first hint of trouble is not much of a surprise.\n\nFor context, the S&P 500 has shed 10% since its February peak, while the Nasdaq has taken an even harder hit. This has spooked investors and sent them scurrying away from growth stocks.\n\nIf we add in somewhat jerky supply chains, lasting trade friction, and fresh doubts about global chip demand, it becomes clear why the industry is navigating some choppy waters. Unfortunately, AMD\u2019s troubles go deeper than just macro turbulence. This is because it\u2019s locked in fierce competition with Intel and Nvidia, the two titans that have long dominated the PC and data center market. The pressure is coming from all sides, which, despite seeming daunting at first, ultimately serves AMD shareholders in the long term because the company will be leaner and meaner, having gone through hard times.\n\nAMD\u2019s Quiet Revolution Amid Data Center Boom\n\nWhile Wall Street has been busy selling the stock, AMD\u2019s data center division has been firing on all cylinders. For 2024, AMD celebrated a year-over-year data center revenue growth of 94% to $3.5 billion. Remember that data center growth was just 6% in the previous year, which shows how rapid AMD\u2019s penetration in space has been.\n\nMuch of this success can be attributed to the company\u2019s EPYC processors, which have steadily clawed their way to command around 25% of the x86 server market, an extraordinary leap from almost nothing a few years back. This is huge in a space that Intel practically had in a stranglehold for decades. Today, big names like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure are deploying AMD chips to power cloud computing, big data, and artificial intelligence workloads. And, with the global data center market expected to grow around 10% annually over the next five years, AMD is firmly in the slipstream of a powerful trend.\n\nBeyond CPUs, AMD is also making headway in GPUs and specialized accelerators for AI and high-performance computing (HPC). Its acquisition of Xilinx back in 2022 added FPGA (field-programmable gate array) tech to its arsenal, thereby providing AMD with a more substantial portfolio to pitch to enterprise customers looking for flexible, scalable solutions in data centers.\n\nRecent commentary from AMD\u2019s management reaffirms this. As soon as AMD folded Xilinx\u2019s adaptive computing tech into the mix, its future performance was almost guaranteed. That synergy seems to have been a huge part of why AMD\u2019s revenue has grown so swiftly in recent quarters.\n\nAMD\u2019s Valuation Disconnect Creates Bullish Opportunity\n\nIf AMD is successful in data centers, why is its stock taking a beating on Wall Street? The answer is that Wall Street analysts have short memories. Currently, AMD is trading around 22x forward earnings for the current financial year and about 17x for next year\u2014multiples that could easily be considered value territory in a high-flying tech leader like AMD.\n\nAnalysts are starting to notice the disconnect. Some peg AMD\u2019s fair value in the mid-$140s, while shares hover well below that level. Skeptics could argue that AMD\u2019s growth might taper off in the latter half of the decade, but that pessimism feels overdone and overpriced. Data center demand remains solid, and AMD\u2019s market share gains prove it can outpace the broader industry.\n\nIs AMD a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nWall Street analysts maintain a Moderate Buy consensus on AMD stock, backed by 25 Buy ratings, 11 Holds, and one Sell rating issued over the past three months. The stock\u2019s average price target of $147.81 per share points to a potential 43% upside from current levels, suggesting shares may be trading at a meaningful discount.\n\nThe Hidden Gem in the Semiconductor Race\n\nAMD stock has provided market whiplash for thousands of investors in recent years as the stock whipsawed in line with changing sentiment. However, the stock remains a gem, priced at ~$100 per share.\n\nSemiconductors are lucrative, and the competition is fierce. Meanwhile, legacy leader Intel is spending a fortune on new factories while Nvidia practically rules the AI-GPU niche (for now). If global markets lurch into a more profound recession, spending on fancy data center hardware could shrink even further\u2014but it will not disappear. Even in the worst-case recession scenario, data centers, AI, and semiconductor supremacy will still be big business with plentiful demand.\n\nAMD has carved out a sweet spot in a monster market, while its valuation is more reflective of a bargain-basement stock struggling to break even. While short-term jitters keep speculators busy, AMD keeps beefing up its servers and doubling down on its core business strategy. As an AMD bull, I expect an intense comeback tale that pays off when macroeconomic jitters subside, and the stock market returns to risk-on mode.\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

It has been impossible to find for weeks, and now it\u2019s back for $479 at Amazon (and at Amazon UK). That\u2019s the official launch price, which is great because I refuse to pay a penny over it.\n\nThis processor is built specifically for gaming, and I think it\u2019s the best option on the market right now. It crushes demanding titles with ease, using AMD\u2019s 3D V-Cache technology to push performance beyond what you\u2019d expect from an 8-core CPU. The 96MB of L3 cache is what makes the difference. It minimizes latency and maximizes frame rates, which is exactly what I want from a gaming processor.\n\n9800X3D is all about raw performance. It features 8 cores and 16 threads, runs on AMD\u2019s latest Zen 5 architecture, and can boost up to 5.2GHz. While some CPUs rely on brute-force clock speeds or excessive core counts, this one focuses on efficiency and smart caching, which is why it delivers such high frame rates.\n\nI also like that it\u2019s built for the future. It supports DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0, meaning your system will stay relevant for years. If you\u2019re planning a high-end gaming build, this processor will make sure your GPU isn\u2019t bottlenecked, letting you squeeze every last bit of performance from your system.\n\nFeature Details Cores / Threads 8 Cores / 16 Threads Base Clock 4.7 GHz Boost Clock Up to 5.2 GHz L3 Cache 96MB (3D V-Cache) Memory Support DDR5-5600 PCIe Support PCIe 5.0 Power Draw (TDP) 120W Socket AM5 Cooling Solution Not included Price $479 Best For Gaming\n\nIf you\u2019re serious about gaming, this is the processor for you. It\u2019s built for AM5 motherboards, meaning you get access to faster RAM, better storage speeds, and PCIe 5.0 compatibility. If you\u2019re upgrading from an older Ryzen CPU or building a new rig, this is the best option for gaming performance at this price.\n\nThat said, you will need an aftermarket cooler, since AMD doesn\u2019t include one in the box. Given how well this CPU performs, though, that\u2019s a small trade-off. Plus you'll probably want to buy a water cooler and radiator for it anyway.",

Don't fret, however, because you can still get these GPUs equipped in a prebuilt gaming PC for a reasonable price. The Radeon RX 9070 GPUs are the new mid-range champions of this generation. Both cards offer phenomenal performance while undercutting their Nvidia competition.\n\nThe Best Deal Today: RX 9070 XT Prebuilt for $1599.99\n\nThis Skytech gaming PC was already the best \"deal\" we could find on an AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT prebuilt, but it's even cheaper today. Amazon just dropped the price by another $100, which means you can get it for $1599.99. That's a great price for a newly released GPU that stands toe to toe with an RTX 5070 Ti (or RTX 4080), which could easily run you well over $2,000 in this absurd market.\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 / 9070 XT Gaming PCs on Amazon\n\nMore like this Maximize Efficiency, Minimize Hassle With UGREEN's Tech Accessories Pricing on these Skytech gaming PCs varies wildly on Amazon, but notable highlights are the Skytech RX 9070 gaming PC for $1349.99 and the Skytech RX 9070 XT gaming PC for $1599.99, which are the best prices we've seen so far for these respective GPUs. The Skytech RX 9070 gaming PC for $1350 is about $150-$200 less than the best prices we're seeing right now for an RTX 5070 or RTX 4070 Super gaming PC. The Skytech RX 9070 XT gaming PC is about $200-$500 less than an RTX 5070 Ti or RTX 4070 Ti Super gaming PC right now.\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 / 9070 XT Gaming PCs at Best Buy\n\nSpecial mention goes to this Skytech prebuilt gaming PC. Not only is it currently the least expensive Radeon RX 9070 XT gaming PC at Best Buy so far, it's housed in the excellent Lian-Li O11 Vision ATX computer case.\n\nWe reviewed both AMD graphics cards\n\nWe rated the AMD Radeon RX 9070 an 8/10. It costs the same as the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 but it performs better in the majority of games we tested and also includes more VRAM (16GB vs 12GB), which should supposedly make it more futureproof. From our tests, it draws about the same amount of power as the RTX 5070.\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 Review by Jacqueline Thomas \"The AMD Radeon RX 9070 is an excellent 1440p graphics card that makes the competition all but irrelevant. It brings excellent 1440p performance, often breaking into high-refresh territory, even without frame gen, and even brings an AI upscaler to the table for better image quality. The only thing that holds this graphics card back is how close it is to the Radeon RX 9070 XT.\"\n\nWe rated the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT a \"perfect\" 10/10. Even though it costs $150 less than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, the 9070 XT beats it out in several of the games we tested. In a few benchmarks, the results aren't even close. The 9070 XT also has 16GB of VRAM, the same as the 9070 and 5070 Ti. On the flip side, it does draw more power and get hotter on average compared to the RTX 5070 Ti.\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Review by Jacqueline Thomas \"PC Gaming has been in a decadent spiral since 2020, and the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT is a reminder that it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. This graphics card has no problem maxing out any game you throw at it at 4K, even with ray tracing enabled, and does so at a price that makes the competition look downright greedy. I can\u2019t predict the future, so only time will tell if the launch price holds up. What I do know is we need more graphics cards like the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT.\"\n\nEric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

This appears to be something of a surprise to the AMD rep, referred to as Mr. Sato, who said that the company, \"isn't used to selling graphics cards\". Er, righto...!\n\nAccording to Japanese website ASCII (via Google translate), AMD was attending an \"influencer\" event alongside several AIB partners including ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte and PowerColor when the 45% market share claim was made. Reportedly, however, those board partners expressed concern about future sales due to limited GPU supply.\n\nDespite that, the ASRock rep, referred to as Mr. Haraguchi, aspired to even greater market share for AMD. \"We're below the majority. We're the opposition party, so let's aim for 70%,\" he said.\n\nWhile we can't verify AMD's claims, they do stand to reason. Such has been the paucity of availability of Nvidia's new RTX 50-series graphics cards, at least by any metric to which we are aware, that it's hard to imagine that AMD isn't making pretty major inroads into Nvidia's market share.\n\nIn fact, it would be easy to believe that AMD has been selling more graphics cards since the launch of its new Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT GPUs than Nvidia currently is with its pretty much impossible to buy RTX 50-series cards.\n\nOf course, the new AMD pairing haven't even been on sale for fully two weeks and AMD's very recent successes are arguably as much about pure availability as a clear competitive advantage. Nvidia GPUs supplies seem to be so low, that almost any reasonable level of AMD availability is bound to be greater.\n\nAll of that could change in a flash should Nvidia pull out the stops on RTX 50 production and actually inject decent volume into the GPU market. So, it will be interesting to see later this year when various market research outfits publish figures just where AMD and Nvidia's market share end up.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nJPR's most recent figures, by way of example, put AMD at 17% for the last quarter of 2024, up by 7%, which obviously predated the release of the new AMD cards. The first quarter of 2025 which runs until the end of March will likewise largely exclude sales of those GPUs. So, it will be Q2 2025 where we'll really get a feel for any medium to long term market share gains for AMD.\n\nIt's hard to imagine AMD won't further substantial gains in the next few quarters. But as the data we posted in that JPR story demonstrates, AMD's market share has been consistently on the slide since as far back as 2005, almost regardless of the quality of its graphics offerings. Will this time actually be any different?",

The additions are expected to drive top-line growth for Embedded and Gaming segment. For 2025, AMD expects a modest increase in revenues for the Gaming and Embedded businesses.\n\nAMD shares have lost 13.1% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s decline of 8.2% and the Zacks Computer \u2013 Integrated Systems industry\u2019s 0.0%. AMD has been relying on its portfolio of fifth-gen EPYC Turin, fourth-gen and third-gen EPYC processors, as well as Instinct accelerators and ROCm software suite to fight off competition of NVIDIA, shares of which have dropped 10.9% year to date. In 2024, AMD\u2019s Data Center revenues accounted for roughly 50% of annual revenues and jumped 69% year over year to $3.9 billion. EPYC instances increased 27% in 2024 to more than 1000, with hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services, Alibaba, Google, Microsoft and Tencent launching more than 100 general-purpose AI instances in the fourth quarter of 2024 alone.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices AMD recently expanded its x86 embedded processor portfolio with the launch of the fifth-generation EPYC family server of processors. The company also expanded its gaming offering with the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 graphics cards. Through its embedded EPYC portfolio, AMD supports high-performance compute, high-bandwidth network connectivity and security, and high-performance storage requirements for enterprise and cloud infrastructure. The latest processors help networking, storage and industrial edge systems to process more data, faster and with greater efficiency. Meanwhile, AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 graphics cards, part of the Radeon RX 9000 Series, are based on the much-anticipated AMD RDNA 4 graphics architecture. However, will the latest additions help AMD stock recover in the near term? The company has been suffering from stiff competition from NVIDIA NVDA in the cloud-data center and AI chip markets. Growing demand for custom AI chips offered by the likes of Broadcom is increasing concern over market share.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRich Partner Base & Acquisitions to Boost AMD\u2019s Prospects\n\nA rich partner base that includes Cisco Systems CSCO, International Business Machines IBM, Amazon, Alibaba, Google, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Dell Technologies and Tencent has been playing a key part in expanding AMD\u2019s footprint.\n\n\n\nCisco has selected AMD EPYC Embedded 9005 Series processor for one of its high-end firewall products, while IBM Storage Scale System 6000 is leveraging the processor due to the introduction of redundant paths for high data availability and robust connectivity options.\n\n\n\nAMD has been on an acquisitive spree to strengthen its AI ecosystem and bridge the technological gap with NVIDIA in the race for AI dominance.

As you can assume from the event's name, AI was AMD's one of the major focuses, which seems to have taken the tech world by storm.\n\nImage Credit: benchlife.info\n\nIf you care more about the GPUs and stuff, then thankfully, AMD did talk about its recently launched RDNA 4 GPUs as well as the Ryzen 9 9000X3D CPUs. The RDNA 4 lineup made its retail debut on 6th March with the Radeon RX 9070 series launching first in the lineup. The series features Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 GPUs, which quickly sold out in most parts of the world and were in fairly good quantities.\n\nIn case you have been wondering how many units AMD might have shipped in the first batch, AMD gave its answer at the summit. It claims to have sold over 200,000 units of both GPUs and all of those were sold around the launch. We don't have the exact timeframe for this data, but hardlytwo weeks have passed. It's likely that the data corresponds to the first week or just the first batch.\n\nImage Credit: benchlife.info\n\nAt the moment, the GPUs don't have very good availability, but reports suggest stability in the next few weeks. Moreover, AIBs have been increasing the prices of their custom editions to the point where the RX 9070 XT is retailing for over $200 more than its announced MSRP. AMD did announce that it is 'encouraging' MSRP prices, but it doesn't control how AIBs and distributors want to price their cards.\n\nOn the other hand, NVIDIA has also claimed to have shipped twice the RTX 50 series GPUs in the first five weeks compared to its RTX 40 series. However, the chart NVIDIA showed had no numbers. So, we don't have any way to estimate it in order to compare with AMD card shipments.\n\nIn a few weeks, we will likely see better availability, but both AMD and NVIDIA board partners have been increasing their prices steadily over the past week. Just yesterday, we saw Acer launching its RX 9070 series lineup with the Nitro RX 9070 XT OC edition costing $829, while ASUS increased the RTX 50 and RX 9070 series GPU prices to over 1.5X for select editions.\n\nNews Source: Benchlife",

            "content": "China's GMKTec has announced the EVO-X2, which it claims is \"the world's first AI mini PC equipped with the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 processor.\" The device was shown off at the AMD Greater China Channel Summit today, with top red-team execs like CEO Lisa Su and SVP & GM Jack Huynh in attendance. GMKTec was lucky enough to get Dr. Su to sign one or more of the new EVO-X2 mini PCs, and the source blog hints there is a batch of Signature Editions.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: GMKTec blog) (Image credit: GMKTec blog and social media)\n\nDetailed hardware specs of the EVO-X2 are not readily available, and the product page has yet to be published by GMKTec, so you'll have to settle for a brief outline for now. As far as the internals go, all we are sure about is that this compact desktop will pack an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 processor. However, its performance in DeepSeek R1 tests is more than 3X that of an RTX 5080 desktop GPU, according to purported GMKTec hardware demonstrations.\n\nTo recap the AMD Strix Halo APU's specs, it features a Zen 5 architecture CPU configured with 16 cores and 32 threads (two CCDs), operating at a maximum frequency of 5.1 GHz. As an APU, this is joined by a beefy iGPU, namely the RDNA 3.5 architecture Radeon 8060S with 40 compute units. Rounding off the processing package, there is an XDNA2 NPU which is capable of 50 TOPS. AMD has also shoved 80MB cache onboard, but buyers will have a choice of the RAM quota (up to 128GB of 256-bit LPDDR5X-8533 RAM) at time of purchase.\n\n(Image credit: GMKTec blog and social media)\n\nBack to pixel peeping to unearth more details about the GMKTec EVO-X2, and one of the first comments we can make is that it is pretty sizable for a mini PC. In the image featuring Jack Huynh, you can see the AMD SVP & GM holding a Geekom machine, which appears to be a traditional '4 x 4' NUC-a-like. With the EVO-X2 in close proximity, we Photoshop-estimate that the EVO-X2 is a '5 x 4.5' and larger in the remaining dimension.\n\nImages shared by GMKTec on social media provide further ideas about the shape and form of the EVO-X2. Also, we can clearly see a power button to the front, alongside an SD card reader, a Thunderbolt (Type C) port, twin USB (Type A ports), and a headset jack. Around the back are three more USB (Type-A) ports, another Thunderbolt, HDMI, DP, an RJ45 network port, another headset jack, and a barrel power jack.\n\nEnthusiasts are excited about the new generation Strix Halo APUs from AMD. So if GMKTec can get its product on shelves ahead of the likes of the HP Z2 Mini G1a and Framework Desktop - at an attractive price - it will have won a minor coup. We don't know how many 'Lisa Su' signed models there are, but the source blog hints there is a batch.\n\nAs for who will be first with an AMD Strix Halo, Asus originally slated its ROG Flow Z13 for release in February, but it still seems to be in pre-order purgatory, and it's not a mini PC. The Framework Desktop machines with Ryzen AI Max chips aren't expected until Q3 this year. The other machine we have heard about, the HP Z2 Mini G1a, is set to be released in 'spring.'",

Oommen expects the first innovation from this alliance to come in this calendar year.\n\nFor Cisco, this alliance is a continuation of the strategy put in place several years ago to be more interoperable and open. Historically, Cisco has been accused of being closed and proprietary and keeping customers locked into their products. While I think the competitive chatter was far greater than the reality, there was some truth to it.\n\nThis is something Jeetu Patel, who took on the role of chief product officer last year, has changed.\n\n\u201cOver the past three to four years, we have made a huge amount of progress in this area. We have partnerships with Microsoft in security; our collaboration products work with Microsoft Teams and Zoom; our XDR takes in telemetry from competitors; and we have partnerships with multiple AI companies,\u201d Patel told me.\n\nThe willingness to be open is something all vendors should embrace as openness creates better competition and drives innovation and brings costs down.

The brand informs its customers that it ships as many units as possible every week, but current supplies are insufficient to meet demand. With just a little patience, though, the brand says it expects to get orders back on track by May.\n\nIt seems that nobody is safe from GPU shortages. Starting with Intel and its Battlemage cards, followed by Nvidia\u2019s RTX 50 Series, and now AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 9000, none managed to satisfy demand regardless of pricing. An especially grave situation for AMD, which banks on market share, a thing that can\u2019t be done if only a small portion of users manage to purchase its cards.\n\nThe Japanese market is a prime example of this situation were many have opted for Radeon cards, which pushed AMD\u2019s market share to 45%. While GeForce\u2019s limited availability may have played a role in this, AMD should double down and release even more GPUs somehow before the winds change. More supply should also improve prices, which would subsequently drive adoption rates up. Maybe enough to convince some Nvidia users.\n\nFor those who didn\u2019t follow the news, AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT saw price hikes similar to Nvidia\u2019 GeForce RTX 50 Series, including models that began at MSRP. Even so, many buyers bit the bullet and got one anyway, perhaps to avoid further increases or because they had enough of waiting. Either way, this meant that store availability was non-existent in some places, and inconsistently priced in others, with the drip-feed supply asking for as much as 10% or 20% above MSRP.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be an issue if store shelves were adequately filled. There is no issue with non-MSRP models as long as basic options are readily available at the official price. We hope GPU manufacturers find a solution quickly as many users are starting to grow impatient. The focus on high-margin datacentre chips is partly to blame for this, but that\u2019s a story for another day.",

It costs the same as the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 but it performs better in the majority of games we tested and also includes more VRAM (16GB vs 12GB), which should supposedly make it more futureproof. From our tests, it draws about the same amount of power as the RTX 5070.\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 Review by Jacqueline Thomas \"The AMD Radeon RX 9070 is an excellent 1440p graphics card that makes the competition all but irrelevant. It brings excellent 1440p performance, often breaking into high-refresh territory, even without frame gen, and even brings an AI upscaler to the table for better image quality. The only thing that holds this graphics card back is how close it is to the Radeon RX 9070 XT.\"\n\nWe rated the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT a \"perfect\" 10/10. Even though it costs $150 less than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, the 9070 XT beats it out in several of the games we tested. In a few benchmarks, the results aren't even close. The 9070 XT also has 16GB of VRAM, the same as the 9070 and 5070 Ti. On the flip side, it does draw more power and get hotter on average compared to the RTX 5070 Ti.\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Review by Jacqueline Thomas \"PC Gaming has been in a decadent spiral since 2020, and the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT is a reminder that it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. This graphics card has no problem maxing out any game you throw at it at 4K, even with ray tracing enabled, and does so at a price that makes the competition look downright greedy. I can\u2019t predict the future, so only time will tell if the launch price holds up. What I do know is we need more graphics cards like the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT.\"\n\nEric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

The tech specialist said that it's aiming to hit a market share of 70% in the space.\n\nNvidia continues to lead the market for high-end gaming GPUs, but it's been facing some supply constraints of its own. The situation has opened the door for AMD to gain some ground in the category, but the overall picture for the company is more complicated.\n\nWhat's next for AMD?\n\nDespite today's gains, AMD stock is still down roughly 13% across 2025's trading and 45% over the last year.The company is now valued at approximately 22.5 times this year's expected earnings.\n\nWhile some areas of AMD's business have continued to look quite solid and the company has been making some significant gains in the GPU market for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, the company's momentum in the AI space has been softer than investors had expected. But with the stock down big over the last year and trading at relatively low valuation multiples, performance improvements could power a substantial rebound for the company's share price.",

            "content": "So you're after an AMD Radeon RX 9070 / XT? While the price is great, trying to seemingly find one at retail price is about as easy as finding a PS5 in 2020. Instead of paying inflated prices, I'd instead recommend picking up a prebuilt gaming PC\u2014and these Skytech options are some of the best I've seen.\n\nPrebuilts aren't just for people who don\u2019t want to tinker. These days, buying a prebuilt can actually save you money, especially when GPU stock is this scarce. And let's be real, not everyone has the patience (or technical confidence) to put together a custom rig without something catching on fire.\n\nTo help you in your search, I've scoured Amazon for the best Skytech gaming PCs featuring the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT, and here's what I found.\n\nFor just $1,349.99, this is the cheapest way to get your hands on an RX 9070\u2014and honestly, it's a solid deal. You get an Intel Core i5-14400F (perfectly fine for gaming), 16GB of DDR5 RAM (6000MHz), and a 1TB NVMe SSD.\n\nThe 650W Gold PSU is technically enough for this build, but I'd prefer something a little beefier. If you plan to add more components later, you might want to upgrade the power supply. That said, if you just want a plug-and-play rig that runs 1440p games at high settings, this is a great deal.\n\nSame specs as the Shadow, but this one comes in white. If you\u2019re all about aesthetics and want your setup to look like a futuristic space station, this is your pick. The mesh front panel also improves airflow, which is nice because nobody likes thermal throttling.\n\nDownside? It\u2019s $350 more than the Shadow for basically the same internals. You\u2019re paying for the case and cooling improvements. But hey, if looks matter, go for it.\n\nNow we're talking. The Skytech Blaze4 swaps in the RX 9070 XT\u2014which, by the way, clears Nvidia's RTX 5070 Ti in most benchmarks. You also get an AMD Ryzen 7 7700, a better 850W Gold PSU, and the same 16GB DDR5 RAM and 1TB SSD.\n\nThis build is $1,599.99 right now (normally $1,699.99), which makes it one of the best-value RX 9070 XT PCs I\u2019ve seen. If you want 4K gaming without selling a kidney, this is it.\n\nSkytech Chronos Gaming PC \u2013 $1,899.99\n\nIf you have a massive game library (or just hate deleting stuff), the Skytech Chronos is worth a look. It upgrades you to a 2TB Gen4 NVMe SSD and 32GB DDR5 RAM, which is overkill for most people\u2014but also really nice to have.\n\nThis is a solid pick for streamers and multitaskers, but if you don\u2019t need the extra RAM and storage, you can save money by going with the Blaze4.\n\nSpecification Comparison\n\nModel CPU GPU RAM Storage PSU Price Skytech Shadow Intel i5-14400F RX 9070 16GB DDR5 1TB NVMe 650W Gold $1,349.99 Skytech Archangel Intel i5-14400F RX 9070 16GB DDR5 1TB NVMe 650W Gold $1,699.99 Skytech Blaze4 Ryzen 7 7700 RX 9070 XT 16GB DDR5 1TB NVMe 850W Gold $1,599.99 ($100 off) Skytech Chronos Ryzen 7 7700 RX 9070 XT 32GB DDR5 2TB NVMe 850W Gold $1,899.99 Skytech Rampage (Intel) Intel i7-14700F RX 9070 XT 32GB DDR5 2TB NVMe 850W Gold $1,999.99 Skytech Rampage (AMD) Ryzen 7 9700X RX 9070 XT 32GB DDR5 2TB NVMe 850W Gold $2,099.99 Skytech King 95 Ryzen 7 7800X3D RX 9070 XT 32GB DDR5 1TB NVMe 850W Gold $2,099.99 Skytech O11 Vision Ryzen 7 9800X3D RX 9070 XT 32GB DDR5 2TB NVMe 850W Gold $2,299.99\n\nStill Team Intel? Then the Skytech Rampage is for you. It swaps in an Intel Core i7-14700F, which is better for high-refresh gaming in some cases. You also get 32GB DDR5 RAM, 1TB Gen4 SSD, and an 850W PSU.\n\nIntel fans, this is your best RX 9070 XT prebuilt. But at $1,999.99, it\u2019s not the best value on this list.\n\nIf you want an all AMD system, this version of the Rampage features Ryzen 7 9700X\u2014which beats Intel in multi-core workloads and gaming longevity. It also has 2TB SSD storage and 32GB DDR5 RAM.\n\nIt\u2019s $2,099.99, so you\u2019re paying for premium specs. If you want a rig that\u2019ll last for years, this is a good investment.\n\nWant 4K gaming at ultra settings? Skytech King 95 is the best prebuilt under $2,100. It pairs a Ryzen 7 7800X3D with a RX 9070 XT, which is the ideal CPU/GPU match.\n\nIt\u2019s a beast, but the 1TB SSD is a little small for this price point. Otherwise, this is as good as it gets without hitting $2,500+.\n\nIf money is no object, Skytech O11 Vision is the most high-end RX 9070 XT prebuilt on this list. You get a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, 32GB DDR5 RAM, 2TB SSD, and a Lian Li PC-O11 Vision case, which for me is arguably the best-looking case here.\n\nIt\u2019s $2,299.99, so unless you need this much power, you can save $200 with the King 95. But if you want top-tier performance, this is it.",

Facing questions about RDNA 4 supply, AMD Japan's Marketing Manager Yoshiaki Sato claimed (machine translation) that Radeon has boosted its market share in the country to 45% with RDNA 4, the highest it's ever been.\n\nAMD had high ambitions for this generation, and Nvidia's woes made it the perfect opportunity to strike and increase its dwindling market share. Admittedly, supply constraints have spoiled the value of these RX 9070 series GPUs, of which the flagship is within reach of the RTX 5070 Ti at a more affordable MSRP. Of course, this generation, retailers are interpreting the 'suggested' part in MSRP quite literally. While AMD has attributed these stockouts to unprecedented demand, the RX 9070 XT ($599 MSRP) typically starts at $800 depending on the retailer.\n\nThe session was joined by popular influencers who praised AMD's Ryzen 9000X3D CPUs for low temperatures but also expressed a desire for more I/O on the motherboards. Afterward, Ms. Saki Suzuki and Mr. Sato from AMD gathered at a roundtable, side-by-side with board representatives from ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, PowerColor and Sapphire.\n\nThe board partners, despite wanting to sell more Radeon GPUs, reported they lacked the production capacity to meet demand. Mr. Sato, responding to the point raised, stated, \"AMD isn't used to selling [so many] graphics cards.\" This was later followed up by an important statistic, with Mr. Sato reporting a 45% retail market share for Radeon GPUs. \"We're the opposition party, so let's aim for 70%,\" said Mr. Sato, though such high ambitions require a reliable and steady supply chain. These comments are recorded in this video, starting from four hours, seven and a half minutes.\n\nIt's important to understand this figure is quite vague. We presume it refers to the share of Radeon GPUs sold in Japan since earlier this month, when RDNA 4 hit shelves. The best global statistic we have is from the Steam Hardware Survey, where Radeon's market share (including iGPUs) plummeted to 11.5% in February. If AMD manages to offer RDNA 4 at MSRP, whether it be by ramping up production or offering rebates, we could probably see this number tick up. At least that's what AMD hoped to achieve this generation.",

            "content": "Product Info ACEMAGIC F3A Type Mini PC Price $899\n\nThe adoption of AMD's APUs in modern-day mini-PCs, especially their Phoenix and Strix Point lineup, is at its peak right now, with several manufacturers emerging on the scene to capitalize on the market demand. This indeed has made it difficult for an average consumer to opt for a specific manufacturer, but out of all the options available, ACEMAGIC definitely stands out, and this isn't just simply a statement, rather it is backed by reviews of the company's product lineup, done by us and those in the market.\n\nIn the mini-PC segment in particular, it won't be wrong to say that ACEMAGIC has evolved into a leading brand, offering the industry's top-end specifications and a quality end product that ticks all the boxes. Their newest F3A mini-PC follows the same trend, as this particular device has employed AMD's Strix Point \"Ryzen AI 300\" platform, which is indeed one of the fastest options available in the market. ACEMAGIC was kind enough to send us a review sample, and based on our internal testing, we have categorized it as one of the best mini-PCs in the market right now.\n\nACEMAGIC F3A \"AI Mini PC\" - A Rundown of Specifications\n\nFirst and foremost, the mini-PC is powered by AMD's flagship Strix Point APU, which is the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 APU. This particular chip features 12 cores based on the Zen 5 core architecture in a combination of 4x Zen 5 and 8x Zen 5c cores, and this computing layout basically targets utter efficiency, while keeping performance in line, which what makes this APU a leading option for mini-PC manufacturers. With a boost clock of up to 5.1 GHz along with 24 MB of L3 cache and 12 MB of L2 cache, high-end computing workloads are a delight with this APU.\n\nWell, moving onto the next most essential part of the mini-PC is the onboard iGPU, which is the Radeon 890M iGPU, based on the RDNA 3.5 graphics architecture. It features 16 compute units and a clock speed of 2900 MHz, and it is one of the most powerful iGPUs in the market right now, and when you factor in technologies such as FSR 3 with Frame-Gen, AMD Fluid Motion Frames 2, HYPR-RX and many more, the graphical performance of this mini-PC becomes enough for modern-day AAA titles.\n\nFor storage/memory combination, our unit features 32 GB DDR5 memory rated at 5,600 MT/s in a dual-channel configuration, and is accompanied with a 1 TB SSD as well. The mini-PC comes with 2x M.2 2280 PCIe slots as well, hence the SSD capacity can be expanded up to 4 TB depending upon your usecase. Apparently, 32GB/1TB is the base configuration with the F3A mini-PC, and you can take it up to 64GB/1TB as well, which will ultimately push up the pricing. Apart from this, here's how the port and connectivity options look like:\n\nHDMI 2.1 (8K@60Hz) \u00d71\n\nUSB4 Type-C (8K@60Hz) \u00d72\n\nDP2.0 \u00d71 (8K@60Hz)\n\nUSB3.2 Gen2 Type-A Port \u00d74 (5Gbps)\n\nRJ45 Gigabit Ethernet Port \u00d72\n\n3.5mm Audio Jack \u00d72\n\nNow that the specifications are covered, the next part is the most of interesting of all, and based on what ACEMAGIC has integrated with the F3A, it's safe to say that the mini-PC is a complete package, offering performance, portability, connectivity and aesthetics, all in a single unit.\n\nACEMAGIC F3A \"AI Mini PC\" - Unboxing & A Closer Look\n\nWell, having a great unboxing experience pretty much helps in concluding the quality of a product, and with the ACEMAGIC F3A, I would say that the process was pretty awesome. The box itself features the company's branding, along with the standard logo of AMD's Strix Point APUs, which is certainly great to see. At the back, the RAM/SSD configuration of the mini-PC is listed, and that is pretty much it.\n\n2 of 9\n\nOpening it up, the packaging is basically a \"box within a box\" one, likely to ensure safety during the shipping process. Inside the box, you get the elegant mini-PC wrapped up in a protective covering. In terms of the contents inside, there's a standard manual, HDMI cable and a power adapter to power up the unit. There's also a VESA mount included as well, that is if you want the mini-PC to be mounted at the backside of your monitor, but I didn't try it out, since I like the old fashion style.\n\nTalking about the mini-PC itself, well there's no doubt in the fact that the F3A stands out due to its impressive looks, since the device features an elegant metallic design, that really catches the eye. Moreover, the mini-PC has the standard \"ACEMAGIC\" branding at the very front, with thermal vents on the sides as well, ensuring optimal heat dissipation.\n\n2 of 9\n\nOne of the most appealing factor about the ACEMAGIC F3A mini-PC is the use of RGB lightning, which runs all around the unit, and that certainly adds up in the aesthetics of the product. It is more of a diffused look rather than plain RGB, which provides a feeling of premiumness to the user, or at least that is what I felt. For me, I'll give the looks full marks, especially since there aren't much mini-PCs out there that have more \"gamer-oriented\" aesthetics.\n\n2 of 9\n\nThe bottom of the mini-PC has the standard air vents to push air out of the unit, and in terms of the I/O configuration, the front panel contains the power button with a white light indicator, 2x USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A ports, 1x USB Type-C port and a 3.5mm audio jack. At the back, the unit is equipped with 2x USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A, USB4 Type-C, HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 2.0 and 2x LAN (2.5G) connections as well, so overall, the F3A is pretty equipped when it comes to support interfaces.\n\nNext up is the performance testing part, and that is the most interesting portion of this review, since we have done justice in terms of getting the maximum performance out of ACEMAGIC's F3A.\n\nACEMAGIC F3A Mini PC - CPU Performance\n\nFirst up are synthetic benchmarks, and for these, we had the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 run at default 28W TDP, instead of ramping up to other profiles, just to ensure stable performance.

We stacked up the mini-PC against multiple laptops and handhelds in the similar CPU segment, and while TDP ratings across these systems are different, the key idea here was to judge the APU's performance under power-efficient conditions.\n\nMoreover, we also tried running DeepSeek's distilled models locally on the machine, and I'll share the results ahead.\n\nGeekbench AI \"ONNX\" CPU (Higher is Better) Single Precision Half Precision Quantized Score 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 ACEMAGIC F3A Mini-PC (Ryzen AI 9 HX 370) 3377 1536 5988 MSI Prestige AI EVO 16 B2HMG (Core Ultra 9 285H) 3865 1525 6228 MSI Prestige A16 AI+ A3HM (Ryzen AI 9 365) 3216 1483 6144 OneXPlayer X1 Pro (Ryzen AI 9 HX 370) 2925 1425 5615 ASUS Zenbook S14 (Core Ultra 7 258V) 2338 1223 4695\n\nGeekbench AI \"ONNX\" DirectML (Higher is Better) Single Precision Half Precision Quantized Score 0 4000 8000 12000 16000 20000 24000 0 4000 8000 12000 16000 20000 24000 ACEMAGIC F3A Mini-PC (Ryzen AI 9 HX 370) 8095 11844 6016 MSI Prestige AI EVO 16 B2HMG (Core Ultra 9 285H) 7668 9781 5280 OneXPlayer X1 Pro (Ryzen AI 9 HX 370) 7667 10643 5893 ASUS Zenbook S14 (Core Ultra 7 258V) 7618 14097 5332 MSI Prestige A16 AI+ A3HM (Ryzen AI 9 365) 6799 9297 5380\n\nACEMAGIC F3A Mini-PC - Running DeepSeek R1 Locally\n\nWell, I had the knack of running DeepSeek locally on any of my devices, and what better way to test it out than with AMD's newest Strix Point APUs. I decided to run DeepSeek locally using the Ollama, a local LLM management application used to run open-source models on your machines with ease. With DeepSeek however, we decided to run \"distilled\" models, featuring 1.5 billion parameters reaching up to 70 billion. The key factor in better performance on local models is the GPU VRAM size, with RAM capacity playing a part.\n\nOllama doesn't have any sort of in-built metric to measure metrics like token response, since it is more of a powershell-based implementation, but I judged the performance based off how quickly I was getting responses, and how seamless the experience was with each distilled model variation. Starting with the base \"DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B\", this isn't hard to run locally at all, since it requires 8 GB RAM as the minimum, which was ample enough for our system.\n\nRunning DeepSeek's 1.5B model\n\nAs expected, the 1.5B parameter model ran without any problems at all, being responsive to our prompts, although it did provide concise information, but that is likely the nature of the model. Next up, we tried the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-8B, which is more of a demanding distilled model, but for the ACEMAGIC F3A, tackling it out wasn't an issue at all, although we saw a bump in memory consumption, but this was something imminent.\n\nRunning DeepSeek's 8B model\n\nLastly, maxing out the system specifications, we decided to run DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-70B, which is said to be a server-grade model, but unfortunately, AMD's Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 was uncapable of this particular distilled variant. The model was huge in size, and the mini-PC simply didn't have enough hardware to run it locally, hence we decided to skip it.\n\nACEMAGIC F3A Mini PC Conclusion - Solid Strix Point Performance\n\nACEMAGIC has quality products all through its consumer hardware lineup, and the F3A \"AI mini PC\" is certainly one of the more impressive products from the company. With AMD's Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 onboard, we get insane CPU and GPU performance in such a small and compact design that it's just astonishing to witness, showing how far PCMR has evolved. And, our internal testing clearly shows that this machine is capable of managing any modern-day AAA title, at either medium or high settings with FSR enabled, and that is something exciting to see.\n\nWith such compact devices, thermals are always an issue, but with the F3A, we saw temperatures well under balance, with temps peaking out at around 80C with the default 28W configuration, and if we had bumped up the TDPs up to 54W, the temperatures would've surely increased, but nothing that the F3A can't manage. Apart from this, the mini-PC looks great when it is on your table, offering great aesthetics, takes less place, and gives you everything in a single package.\n\nOne more impressive factor about this device is its price point, since in the 32GB+1TB configuration, the F3A mini-PC retails for $809.00 at the time of this review, since there's an ongoing discount that has dropped the pricing by up to 23%. At this price tag, this mini-PC is one of the contenders if you are looking for the best perf/$ values, being higher than counterparts like the Beelink SER9, which we have also reviewed. We can only say that you'll be surprised once you get your hands on this machine.",

            "content": "This is one that we were not expecting. The Acemagic F3A is a mini PC powered by the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. That is a super cool CPU, but the last time we looked at it in the Beelink SER9 we were limited on memory capacity with a fixed memory configuration. The F3A, however, has DDR5-SODIMMs, so naturally, we thought, why not try the 128GB (2x 64GB) kit. It worked, and this has been running llama3.3 70b and deepseek-r1 70b for the past few weeks.\n\nFor this one, we have a video that you can find here:\n\nAs a quick aside, I sent a note to a Crucial contact since after our Lenovo ThinkCentre M75q Tiny Gen5 Review Amazon, Newegg, and others went out-of-stock on the Crucial 128GB (2x 64GB) kits. I was told late last week that we should see more stock later in the week we are publishing this review with the modules.\n\nA lot of our discussion is going to be around this configuration. We had many folks bemoan that the Beelink SER9 at 32GB of fixed LPDDR5X was not enough. This is considerably more interesting. Just as a note: we also had the 96GB (2x 48GB) kit working as well.\n\nAcemagic F3A External Hardware Overview\n\nOn the front of the system we have a poewr button and audio jack which are fairly standard. There are also two USB 3.2 Gen1 Type-A ports. The other big feature on the front is the USB4 port. We often get folks saying they want to see Type-C ports on the front when they were on the rear. When the ports are on the front, folks say they want them on the rear. The F3A has both.\n\nOn the top, we get an Acemagic logo as well as our AMD Ryzen AI and Radeon stickers.\n\nThe design is a bit different. That gap on the top panel is functional for airflow. We will show that in our internal overview. At the same time, it is not linked to the bottom side vent you see here.\n\nThe top portion is a clear plastic, but that is because there is some RGB here. We showed it in the video, but it did not photograph overly well. Here is what it looks like turned on as the colors go around the exterior of the system.\n\nHere is the rear, and there is a lot going on. We have two more USB 3.2 Gen1 ports, but then two Realtek 2.5GbE ports. Next to that we have a HDMI and a DisplayPort. We showed this in the video, but the DP did not output video on the system setup, we had to use HDMI.\n\nNext to that is the rear USB4 port. It is nice to have two combined with the front USB4. Then we have a 19V DC power input and another audio jack.\n\nOn the bottom, we have labels and vents.\n\nNext, let us get inside the system.",

            "content": "Large language models (LLMs) love large quantities of memory \u2014 so much so, in fact, that AI enthusiasts are turning to multi-GPU setups to make even more VRAM available for their AI apps. But since many current LLMs are extremely large, even this approach has its limits. At times, the GPU will decide to make use of CPU processing power for this data, and when it does, the performance of your CPU cache and DRAM comes into play. All this means that when it comes to the performance of AI applications, it\u2019s not just the GPU that matters, but the entire pathway that connects the GPU to the CPU to the I/O die to the DRAM modules. It stands to reason, then, that there are opportunities to boost AI performance by optimizing these elements.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve found as we\u2019ve spent time in our R&D labs with the latest AMD Ryzen CPUs. AMD just launched two new Ryzen CPUs with AMD 3D V-Cache Technology, the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D and AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D, pushing the series into new performance territory. After testing a wide range of optimizations in a variety of workloads, we uncovered a range of settings that offer tangible benefits for AI enthusiasts. Now, we\u2019re ready to share these optimizations with you through a new BIOS feature: AI Cache Boost. Available through an ASUS AMD 800 Series motherboard and our most recent firmware update, AI Cache Boost can accelerate performance up to 12.75% when you\u2019re working with massive LLMs.\n\nReady for AMD Ryzen CPUs with AMD 3D V-Cache Technology\n\nTo access AI Cache Boost, you\u2019ll need an ASUS AMD 800 Series motherboard and an AMD Ryzen 9000 Series Granite Ridge CPU. Open the UEFI BIOS utility and navigate to the Extreme Tweaker tab. Toggle AI Cache Boost to \u201cEnabled\u201d and you\u2019re off to the races.\n\nActivating AI Cache Boost engages a variety of optimizations, including overlocking the Infinity Fabric clock (FCLK) to 2100 MHz. Boosting FCLK is an important piece of the puzzle here, since it boosts the bandwidth of data transfers between CPU cores, cache, and memory \u2014 and those transfers matter when working with massive LLMs.\n\nA brief aside for anyone who uses the same PC for both AI applications and gaming. Enabling AI Cache Boost doesn\u2019t significantly affect gaming performance, so you should feel free to leave the setting enabled even as you switch from one type of workload to the other. For enhanced stability in gaming, you might prefer to manually lower FCLK to a more conservative setting after enabling AI Cache Boost.\n\nThe performance uplift of AI Cache Boost\n\nFor our test system, we started with the ROG Crosshair X870E Hero motherboard and equipped it with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card and 2x16GB of DDR5 RAM. We tested a variety of AMD Ryzen CPUs with AMD 3D V-Cache Technology, including the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D, 9900X3D, and 9800X3D. Our first test looks at Geekbench AI with the ONNX DirectML framework and the benchmark set to measure GPU performance.\n\nAI Cache Boost Performance \u2013 Geekbench AI AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D - RTX 5090 - ROG Crosshair X870E Hero Default AI Cache Boost Improvement Single Precision Score 43932 46213 +5.19% Half Precision Score 63464 67009 +5.59% Quantized Score 32197 33347 +3.57% AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D - RTX 5090 - ROG Crosshair X870E Hero Default AI Cache Boost Improvement Single Precision Score 43625 46074 +5.61% Half Precision Score 62772 66744 +6.33% Quantized Score 32169 33275 +3.44% AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D - RTX 5090 - ROG Crosshair X870E Hero Default AI Cache Boost Improvement Single Precision Score 44099 46965 +6.50% Half Precision Score 63365 68393 +7.93% Quantized Score 32480 33774 +3.98%\n\nThe performance uplift we observed ranged from roughly 4% to 8%. That\u2019s significant for anyone running AI workflows for a good portion of their day \u2014 especially considering how easy it is to enable AI Cache Boost.\n\nSince it\u2019s early days for NVIDIA 50 Series graphics cards, we also checked the performance of AI Cache Boost on previous-gen hardware by swapping out the graphics card in our testing system for an NVIDIA RTX 4090.\n\nAI Cache Boost Performance \u2013 Geekbench AI AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D - RTX 4090 - ROG Crosshair X870E Hero Default AI Cache Boost Improvement Single Precision Score 37480 40181 +6.19% Half Precision Score 51786 54392 +5.03% Quantized Score 28097 29118 +3.63% AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D - RTX 4090 - ROG Crosshair X870E Hero Default AI Cache Boost Improvement Single Precision Score 37866 39777 +5.05% Half Precision Score 51782 53642 +3.59% Quantized Score 28157 28798 +2.28% AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D - RTX 4090 - ROG Crosshair X870E Hero Default AI Cache Boost Improvement Single Precision Score 38191 40788 +6.80% Half Precision Score 52531 56509 +7.57% Quantized Score 28247 29536 +4.56% AMD Ryzen 9 9950X - RTX 4090 - ROG Crosshair X870E Hero Default AI Cache Boost Improvement Single Precision Score 38277 40441 +5.65% Half Precision Score 52465 55823 +6.40% Quantized Score 28373 29284 +3.21%\n\nAcross the Geekbench AI test results, AI Cache Boost provides a noticeable performance bump, ranging up to 7.57% with the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D. Intriguingly, it\u2019s the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D that posts the highest numbers with AI Cache Boost enabled.\n\nAI Cache Boost Performance \u2013 UL Procyon AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D - RTX 4090 - ROG Crosshair X870E Hero Default AI Cache Boost Improvement UL Procyon\n\nAI Computer Vision Benchmark 1426 1485 +4.14% AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D - RTX 4090 - ROG Crosshair X870E Hero Default AI Cache Boost Improvement UL Procyon\n\n\n\nAI Computer Vision Benchmark 1417 1473 +4.00% AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D - RTX 4090 - ROG Crosshair X870E Hero Default AI Cache Boost Improvement UL Procyon\n\nAI Computer Vision Benchmark 1490 1680 +12.75% AMD Ryzen 9 9950X - RTX 4090 - ROG Crosshair X870E Hero Default AI Cache Boost Improvement UL Procyon\n\nAI Computer Vision Benchmark 1439 1475 +2.50%\n\nWe see a similar pattern with the UL Procyon AI Computer Vision Benchmark, with AI Cache Boost providing performance uplift across the board. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D enjoys a double-digit improvement to its score with AI Cache Boost \u2014 an increase of 12.75%, to be exact.\n\nBringing Turbo Game Mode into the mix\n\nThe outstanding performance of the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D in both the Geekbench AI and UL Procyon benchmarks suggests that we\u2019re looking at a scenario where the AMD 3D V-Cache technology is making more of a difference than the increased core counts available with the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D. To investigate this further, we ran some additional tests in which we not only activate AI Cache Boost, but also Turbo Game Mode.\n\nThis BIOS feature, already available on ASUS AM5 motherboards, optimizes performance in up to two ways. The first only applies to those with a high-end AMD Ryzen CPU with two Core Complex Dies (CCD). The second CCD allows the chip to bring a stunning wealth of CPU cores and threads to bear on multithreaded workflows, but apps don\u2019t always make use of all those resources. Turbo Game Mode disables the second CCD, allowing the CPU to operate more efficiently in certain scenarios.\n\nSecond, Turbo Game Mode disables simultaneous multithreading (SMT). With SMT enabled, each core in your AMD Ryzen CPU can operate two sets of instructions at the same time, kicking your multithreaded performance into high gear. This is invaluable for many users, but if you\u2019re looking to optimize performance for a workflow that doesn\u2019t require that many CPU threads, you can see higher performance with SMT disabled.\n\nDisabling a CCD and SMT has a significant impact on multithreaded performance, so we recommend that users only enable Turbo Game Mode when it benefits their current workflow.\n\nAI Cache Boost Performance \u2013 UL Procyon AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D - RTX 4090 - ROG Crosshair X870E Hero Default AI Cache Boost Turbo Game Mode Improvement UL Procyon\n\nAI Computer Vision Benchmark 1426 1485 1702 +19.35% AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D - RTX 4090 - ROG Crosshair X870E Hero Default AI Cache Boost Turbo Game Mode Improvement UL Procyon\n\n\n\nAI Computer Vision Benchmark 1417 1473 1570 +10.80% AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D - RTX 4090 - ROG Crosshair X870E Hero Default AI Cache Boost Turbo Game Mode Improvement UL Procyon\n\nAI Computer Vision Benchmark 1490 1680 +12.75%\n\nWith both AI Cache Boost and Turbo Game Mode activated, the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D takes the lead in this benchmark over the other test configurations, posting a whopping 19.85% increase over default settings.\n\nThe outstanding performance uplift that we\u2019re seeing here suggests that AI enthusiasts might find it valuable to enable both AI Cache Boost and Turbo Game Mode in circumstances in which their workflow doesn\u2019t take full advantage of their CPU\u2019s massive thread count. Both options are readily available in the Extreme Tweaker BIOS tab, so interested users won\u2019t find it hard at all to explore the benefits of toggling both BIOS features simultaneously.\n\nKick your AI ambitions up a notch with ASUS motherboards and AI Cache Boost\n\nThe new AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D and AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D offer an intriguing value proposition to PC enthusiasts of all kinds. Equipped with 32 and 24 threads, respectively, they\u2019re primed for fantastic multithreaded performance right out of the gate \u2014 and they offer the benefits of AMD 3D V-Cache Technology at the same time.\n\nASUS AMD 800 Series motherboards help ensure that you get the best experience with these new chips through optional BIOS settings that help optimize your experience. For AI workflows that involve LLMs, in particular, we\u2019ve found that AI Cache Boost has a lot to offer \u2014 and it\u2019s incredibly easy to enable. To make sure that you\u2019re getting the most out of your new AMD CPU, browse our full selection of AM5 motherboards ranging from top-end X870E and X870 models to value-oriented B850 and B840 options.",

            "content": "To use AMD EXPO, you'll first need to enter your motherboard's BIOS, which can commonly be done with the keys of either F2, F10, F12, Del, or ESC. You should see the prompt as the motherboard logo launches on the screen before the Windows boot-up if you're not sure. Depending on the mobo manufacturer, it could be called \"Tweaker\" or \"Overclocking\", and if AMD EXPO isn't under any of these tabs, then it could be under advanced settings. Alternatively, if your BIOS has an \"easy mode\" such as seen with some Gigabyte Aorus models, the EXPO toggle will be listed above the boot sequence on the main screen.\n\nOnce you've found the option for AMD EXPO, then you're halfway there. Much like Intel's XMP 2.0, you'll have the option for two distinct pre-made profiles, EXPO 1 and EXPO 2, which have different strengths. The first profile is considered to be the standard experience that will see the timings and frequency of your RAM kit jump up from the JEDEC defaults to what's been promised on the box. However, EXPO 2 is more of an experimental overclock, which can push performance a little further at the cost of a little extra power.\n\nTo check that your RAM is operating properly, you can head to Task Manager inside of Windows 11 for the frequency. However, some third-party programs (such as MSI Afterburner or NZXT CAM) will have the current timings and voltage as well. If things are not working as intended, you can try a different setting in the BIOS. Should your PC not boot, however, you may need to flash the CMOS before reseating the RAM itself. However, such a need for this is rare and should not be needed.\n\nUnlike Intel XMP 3.0, which is also exclusively for DDR5 RAM, there is no third profile which goes a step further at the cost of stability, nor do you have the options of two custom profiles. However, it's arguable that both XMP and EXPO (to many) could be seen as a simple on-and-off switch rather than something to agonize over.",

            "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks scored massive wins for investors last year and led the Nasdaq to a double-digit gain. This momentum continued into the early days of 2025, but in recent weeks, these once top-performing stocks have struggled.\n\nInvestors' concerns about the economy and the potential impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico have weighed on stocks -- especially those of high-growth companies. All of this has driven the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC -1.96%) into correction territory. Last week, the index fell more than 10% from its latest peak in December.\n\nBut savvy investors know that in these tough times, bargains are multiplying. Declines in the major names in AI mean some are a steal right now -- and that signals an excellent buying opportunity.\n\nIt's important to remember that uncertainty about the economy may be a problem today, but it doesn't change the overall positive long-term outlook for AI. Today's $200 billion AI market is forecast to reach beyond $1 trillion by the end of the decade, and this could generate explosive growth for certain AI companies.\n\nTwo winning companies that likely have more to gain down the road are Nvidia (NVDA -0.14%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.66%). These AI chip giants each saw their valuations sink in recent times and have fallen into bargain territory. Which is the better buy in the Nasdaq correction?\n\nThe case for Nvidia\n\nNvidia dominates the AI chip market, holding an 80% share. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) may be the most expensive around but also offer the highest performance -- something that has kept the world's biggest tech companies flocking to Nvidia. For example, demand for the tech giant's latest release, the Blackwell architecture, exceeded supply.\n\nAll of this has translated into solid growth for Nvidia throughout this AI boom. Quarter after quarter, the company has generated double-digit or triple-digit revenue growth, and revenue has reached record levels. In the most recent period, quarterly revenue rose 78% to a record of $39 billion, and full-year revenue soared 114% to a record $130 billion.\n\nSome investors worry that the high price of Nvidia's GPUs could put the brakes on growth at a certain point, especially as rivals develop better and better products. But Nvidia's focus on innovation, with a pledge to update its GPUs annually, could make it very difficult for competitors to gain significant market share.\n\nConsidering all of this, Nvidia, trading for 25x forward earnings estimates -- down from 50x earlier this year -- makes a dirt cheap buy for the long term investor.\n\nThe case for AMD\n\nAMD is the second-biggest player in the AI chip market. However, with a market share of about 10%, its AI growth story hasn't been as explosive Nvidia's. The company makes GPUs to power AI workloads and is known for offering solid performance at a reasonable price. This is great because it gives cost-conscious customers a quality option, which could result in more and more orders as AI chip needs grow.\n\nEven though big tech companies, such as Microsoft, flock to Nvidia for GPUs, they also are customers of AMD. Microsoft, for example, uses AMD's flagship MI300X GPUs to drive several GPT 4-based Copilot services.\n\nAMD aims to keep up with Nvidia by also launching innovations on an annual basis. Even though Nvidia is likely to stay well ahead, AMD still could generate massive growth by applying this strategy.\n\nAMD called last year \"transformative\" for the company as it progressed in the AI market. In the fourth quarter, the company's data center revenue surged 69% to a record $3.9 billion; for the year, it soared 94% to a record $12.6 billion.\n\nLike Nvidia, AMD has seen its valuation tumble recently and offers an interesting buying opportunity. It now trades for 21x forward earnings estimates, down from more than 27x back in January.\n\nWhich one is the better buy?\n\nAs mentioned, both companies make excellent additions to an AI portfolio, but if I could only choose one to buy during this Nasdaq correction, I'd go for Nvidia. The company has a solid hold on its market position and a plan -- a focus on innovation -- to maintain this leadership over the long run. All of this should translate into many more years of earnings growth.\n\nConsidering Nvidia's recent drop in valuation, now looks like the perfect moment to get in on this AI winner that has what it takes to extend its winning ways well into the future.",

            "content": "For decades, Intel stood as the undisputed leader of the semiconductor industry, powering everything from personal computers to the world\u2019s most advanced data centres. Its dominance was built on relentless engineering excellence, process technology leadership, and a near-monopoly in the x86 computing era. But in the fast-moving semiconductor world\u2014where innovation cycles are brutal, competition is relentless, and a single misstep can alter a company\u2019s fate\u2014Intel lost its edge.\n\nToday, the company is a shadow of its former self, outmanoeuvred by Nvidia in AI, outperformed by AMD in high-performance computing, and out-innovated by Apple, which now designs its own industry-leading silicon. Intel\u2019s manufacturing, once its greatest strength, has become its Achilles' heel, with TSMC and Samsung setting the pace in advanced nodes. Even Wall Street has lost faith\u2014Intel\u2019s removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2024 was more than a symbolic blow.\n\nPat Gelsinger\u2019s return in 2021 was supposed to change everything. His vision was to restore Intel\u2019s leadership and reclaim dominance in computing with the \u2018Five Nodes in Four Years\u2019 plan. Instead, Intel\u2019s turnaround stalled. Process delays continued, foundry customers were scarce, and while the company made some progress, it was far from enough. Gelsinger was out in late 2024, and now the task of saving Intel falls to Lip-Bu Tan, a veteran of the semiconductor industry, former CEO of Cadence Design Systems, and a deeply connected figure in the venture capital world.\n\nThe question is simple but brutal: Is it too late?\n\nIndustry Optimism: A leader who knows the ecosystem\n\nDespite Intel\u2019s struggles, Lip-Bu Tan\u2019s appointment has been widely welcomed by the semiconductor industry, sparking cautious optimism about the company\u2019s revival. Unlike his predecessors, Tan is deeply embedded in the global chip ecosystem\u2014his tenure as CEO of Cadence Design Systems (from 2009 to 2021) saw him work closely with semiconductor giants, foundries, and chip designers alike. He led the reinvention of the company, drove a cultural transformation centred on customer-centric innovation, and, most importantly, more than doubled the revenue, expanded operating margins, and delivered a stock price appreciation of more than 3,200%.\n\nAs a former member of Intel\u2019s board, his extensive venture capital background means he has nurtured and invested in some of the most promising semiconductor start-ups, giving him a unique vantage point on where the industry is headed.\n\nAshok Chandak, President of the India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA), told Fortune India, \u201cIntel\u2019s appointment of Lip-Bu Tan marks a strategic shift towards strengthening engineering excellence and customer-centric innovation. A highly respected leader in the semiconductor industry, Tan has previously participated in the IESA Vision Summit during his tenure as CEO of Cadence Design Systems. As a former Intel board member, he brings deep industry expertise, with a focus on revitalising Intel\u2019s market position through an engineering-driven approach, product innovation, and enhanced customer engagement. His leadership is also expected to play a crucial role in reshaping Intel\u2019s process technology roadmap and manufacturing capabilities.\u201d\n\nIntel needs results\u2014And it needs them fast\n\nIndustry insiders believe Tan\u2019s deep connections and customer-first approach could help Intel regain trust, secure key partnerships, and steer its foundry ambitions in the right direction. A similar sentiment was reflected among investors, as Intel shares jumped nearly 15% following the appointment of the new CEO. But optimism alone won\u2019t be enough\u2014Intel needs results, and it needs them fast.\n\nChris Miller, author of Chip War, told Fortune India, \u201cI think Lip-Bu Tan is the best possible choice for Intel's CEO. He has deep credibility with the chip industry and with financial markets, both of which have raised tough questions about Intel's future. Still, he has a complex task ahead of him in trying to win customers for Intel's foundry manufacturing business while simultaneously reversing the company's market share losses in chips for data centres and PCs.\u201d\n\nTan understands the stakes. His message to the team has been upfront and clear: \u201cWe cannot take anything for granted, and we will do regular deep dives to assess our progress. In areas where we have momentum, we need to double down and extend our advantage. In areas where we are behind the competition, we need to take calculated risks to disrupt and leapfrog. And in areas where our progress has been slower than expected, we need to find new ways to pick up the pace.\u201d\n\nAI and Data centres: The battle that matters most\n\nIf Intel is to stage a comeback, AI and data centre dominance must be the priority.\n\nRight now, Nvidia is the undisputed leader, but the AI boom is still in its early days. Companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google are searching for alternatives to Nvidia\u2019s expensive, power-hungry GPUs. This is where Intel has a chance\u2014if it can move fast enough.\n\nIntel\u2019s Gaudi AI accelerators have shown promise, offering a cost-effective alternative to Nvidia\u2019s H100s. \u201cIntel\u2019s biggest problem is that they have not been able to execute their strategies well. Nvidia\u2019s CUDA ecosystem is years ahead in AI, with more than 80% market share in the AI chips space. Meanwhile, AMD has quickly taken around 25% share in this space, and Intel\u2019s share has declined to approximately 75%. Tan will need to make some big decisions, whether that means forming new partnerships, making strategic acquisitions, or aggressively pushing Intel\u2019s AI accelerator lineup,\u201d explains Devroop Dhar, Co-founder and MD, Primus Partners.\n\nIntel also needs more than just good hardware\u2014it needs a software revolution. Most AI workloads are currently built around Nvidia\u2019s CUDA ecosystem. Tan\u2019s success at Cadence was built on deep customer engagement and long-term partnerships; applying that same approach to AI could give Intel a fighting chance.\n\nThe foundry gamble\n\nGelsinger\u2019s grand strategy was Intel\u2019s pivot to becoming a foundry\u2014manufacturing chips for other companies, much like TSMC. The logic was sound: Intel has fabs, and if it can\u2019t beat TSMC on tech, it could at least compete for customers. The U.S. government even backed the move, as part of its effort to reduce reliance on Asian chip manufacturing.\n\nBut the foundry business is cutthroat. TSMC and Samsung have decades of expertise, supply chain advantages, and\u2014crucially\u2014the trust of customers. Intel\u2019s foundry (IFS) has yet to prove it can deliver chips on time, at competitive prices, and at the scale that global tech giants require. So far, Intel has secured a few key clients (notably the U.S. Department of Defence), but winning over major commercial players remains a challenge.\n\nBrady Wang, Associate Director, Counterpoint Research told Fortune India, \u201cImproving semiconductor manufacturing takes time. TSMC, for example, spent decades and billions of dollars to grow from a follower to a leader. The chipmaking business requires massive investment, long-term research, and skilled talent.\u201d He adds, \u201cadvancing chip technology is expensive\u2014TSMC\u2019s capital spending in 2024 exceeded $30 billion\u2014and comes with high risks and long payback periods. The semiconductor industry also follows economic cycles, meaning heavy investments can turn into financial burdens during downturns.\u201d\n\nThe idea to make Intel self-sufficient in the complete life cycle of chip manufacturing was a very well thought-off, however, the Intel Foundry unit posted significant losses which has led to the discussion of whether Intel should off-load the foundry business or go all in.\n\n\u201cIntel\u2019s success and turn around are predicated on regaining manufacturing and operational excellence per the BIC metrics of the industry \u2013 which can only be achieved when Intel thinks, acts and reacts like a foundry, thus necessitating a foundry acquisition,\u201d says Danish Faruqui, CEO of Fab Economics \u2013 Fab Economics \u2013 a US based Greenfield Fab / OSAT consultancy and Semiconductor Investment advisory.\n\nFor the aforesaid goal and vision during Pat tenure Intel attempted, M&A for Tower Semi Foundry but it was not realized due to geopolitics, and Faruqui believes that Tan will follow the same path of attempting to acquire a successful and aligned foundry business. He foresees a great technology, operational, footprint and business synergies in Global Foundries as an acquisition target for Intel.\n\nStrategic acquisitions and bold investments\n\nWith Tan\u2019s background in venture capital and investments, there could be a shift in Intel\u2019s priorities. To regain its lost leadership, Tan may be open to acquisitions, partnerships, or targeted investments. Unlike his predecessors, who largely focused on internal restructuring, Tan may look outward\u2014leveraging Intel\u2019s deep reserves to acquire cutting-edge start-ups or strike strategic alliances to close technology gaps.\n\n\u201cTan has a VC background. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if Tan starts looking at acquisitions to boost Intel\u2019s capabilities in AI, chip packaging, or even alternative architectures like RISC-V,\u201d adds Dhar. Intel\u2019s cash reserves of approximately $22.06 billion and total equity capital of around $99.53 billion give Tan significant leverage.",

However, the recently released FSR4 has managed to greatly narrow the gap with DLSS technology. The problem is that most older games are unlikely ever to receive updates adding FSR 4. That's where modders stepped in to help.\n\nThe result is the OptiScaler project, a tool that allows for replacing upscaling technologies in games. In practice, this means that if a game supports at least DLSS 2, FSR 2, or XeSS, we can add newer versions of these technologies to it. This replacement isn\u2019t limited to just one technology. For example, if a game supports DLSS 2, nothing stops you from using OptiScaler to add support for FSR4. Of course, it\u2019s still an unofficial tool, so it doesn\u2019t always work perfectly. That\u2019s why the creators prepared a list where users can add information about how different games work with OptiScaler. If you run into problems, you can also find tips there on how to resolve them.\n\nYou can check the results of using this tool in the video above, which shows Cyberpunk 2077 running with FSR 4 added via this application, compared to FSR 3, which this Polish blockbuster natively supports.\n\nFSR4 isn\u2019t as good as the latest DLSS yet, but the gap between these technologies is now much smaller, both in terms of image quality and performance. This is why it\u2019s great that players can now add support for AMD's newest technology to games whose developers haven\u2019t released the appropriate updates.",

With the release of RDNA 4 GPUs, they\u2019ve made solid progress, but they\u2019re already planning to move on. Enter UDNA\u2014a new architecture poised to deliver a leap forward, both for gamers and productivity users. Here\u2019s why AMD is moving away from RDNA and how UDNA could reshape the future.\n\nWhy AMD Needs to Challenge Nvidia\u2019s CUDA\n\nProductivity Is the Next Battleground\n\nWinning over gamers often comes down to delivering competitive GPUs at the right price. AMD\u2019s RX 9000 series, despite facing challenges like ray tracing performance and pricing tweaks, has been a solid launch overall. But when it comes to productivity, the RX 9000 series doesn\u2019t move the needle much.\n\nThe productivity world revolves around CUDA acceleration, exclusive to Nvidia GPUs. Without CUDA, tasks like 3D rendering and AI workloads are significantly slower, making Nvidia the go-to choice for professionals. AMD is looking to change that. Much like Nvidia unified its GPU architecture two decades ago with CUDA, AMD\u2019s UDNA aims to bring the same consistency and performance to its lineup.\n\nUnified Architecture: A Game-Changer for AMD\n\nBreaking Free from Split Development\n\nSince AMD moved away from the GCN architecture in 2019, they\u2019ve had two separate GPU divisions: RDNA for gaming and CDNA for computing. While this split allowed for specialized optimizations, it also made development more complicated.\n\nWith UDNA, AMD will unify their architecture, streamlining development and delivering benefits across gaming and productivity. This approach mirrors Nvidia\u2019s strategy of integrating features like Tensor cores, which improved both AI workloads and gaming technologies. For AMD, a unified architecture could mean faster progress on features like FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR), which has already shown impressive advancements.\n\nThe Challenges of Recent GPU Launches\n\nLessons Learned from RDNA 4 Pricing\n\nThe RX 9000 series launch wasn\u2019t entirely smooth. AMD delayed the release to adjust pricing after Nvidia announced their RTX 50 series, a move that ultimately helped them stay competitive. However, this delay led to issues with online retailers, with some selling cards at prices far above the announced MSRP.\n\nWhile the pricing adjustments were necessary, AMD needs to ensure smoother launches moving forward. Capturing more of Nvidia\u2019s market share requires not just competitive pricing, but also a seamless buying experience for customers.\n\nListening to the Community\n\nOne positive sign is AMD\u2019s willingness to gather feedback. Before the RX 9000 launch, AMD reportedly consulted with tech reviewers like Hardware Unboxed to gauge pricing strategies. Here\u2019s their tweet on the topic. This collaborative approach shows AMD is evolving, moving away from the old strategy of simply undercutting Nvidia by $100.\n\nThe Road Ahead for AMD\n\nA Unified Vision with UDNA\n\nAMD\u2019s collaboration with Sony on the PlayStation 6 and FidelityFX Super Resolution highlights their commitment to innovation. UDNA represents a major shift\u2014not just a small improvement over RDNA 4, but a true generational leap. By unifying their architecture, AMD can better compete with Nvidia in both gaming and productivity, while delivering more value to developers and gamers alike.\n\nWhile the road ahead is long, UDNA is a promising step in AMD\u2019s journey to gain GPU market share. It\u2019s not just about catching up to Nvidia but setting the stage for a more competitive future. Gamers, developers, and professionals all stand to benefit.",

Market Competition \u2013 AI startups like Tiny Corp have started adopting AMD GPUs, proving that ROCm can be a CUDA alternative if properly supported.\n\nWill ROCm on Windows Challenge NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA?\n\nFor years, CUDA has been the industry standard for AI and ML workloads. NVIDIA has built a massive ecosystem, making it difficult for competitors to break in.\n\nHowever, if AMD successfully expands ROCm\u2019s Windows support and improves its software ecosystem, it could:\n\nReduce reliance on CUDA : Developers would have an alternative GPU stack that works seamlessly on both Linux and Windows.\n\n: Developers would have an alternative GPU stack that works seamlessly on both Linux and Windows. Make AI workloads more accessible : AMD\u2019s GPUs are often more affordable than NVIDIA\u2019s, making them attractive for startups and researchers.\n\n: AMD\u2019s GPUs are often more affordable than NVIDIA\u2019s, making them attractive for startups and researchers. Boost AMD\u2019s market valuation: Many analysts argue that AMD is undervalued compared to NVIDIA. A robust AI ecosystem could close this gap.\n\nChallenges AMD Must Overcome\n\nWhile the potential is exciting, several challenges remain before ROCm can truly compete with CUDA:\n\nSoftware Maturity \u2013 CUDA has been around for years, while ROCm is still catching up. Compatibility issues and driver instability need to be addressed. Broader GPU Support \u2013 ROCm on Windows must extend beyond high-end GPUs like the RX 7900 series to mainstream Radeon models. Developer Adoption \u2013 Most AI developers are trained on CUDA. AMD needs to invest in education and community-building to encourage a shift. Performance Optimization \u2013 ROCm must deliver performance on par or better than CUDA to be considered a viable alternative.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next? The Road Ahead for AMD\u2019s ROCm Strategy\n\nWhile AMD has yet to make an official announcement, all signs point to a growing commitment to AI and developer-friendly software. If ROCm support expands, here\u2019s what we can expect:\n\nGradual expansion to more Radeon GPUs on Windows\n\nImproved driver stability and reduced crashes\n\nPerformance optimizations for AI workloads\n\nMore collaborations with AI firms using ROCm-based stacks\n\nFinal Thoughts: Is AMD Finally Ready to Disrupt AI Computing?\n\nThe GPU landscape is shifting, and AMD has a real chance to challenge NVIDIA\u2019s dominance in AI and high-performance computing. If AMD delivers on its ROCm expansion promise, it could:\n\n\u2705 Make AI workloads more accessible on Windows\n\n\u2705 Provide a cost-effective alternative to CUDA\n\n\u2705 Strengthen AMD\u2019s position in the AI and ML market\n\nWhile we may still be months (or even years) away from full ROCm support on Windows, the momentum is building. If AMD plays its cards right, this could be a turning point for both the company and the industry.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Are you excited about ROCm on Windows? Would you switch from NVIDIA to AMD for AI workloads? Let us know in the comments!",

            "content": "AMD officially announced its latest gaming processors \u2013 the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and the Ryzen 9 9900X3D \u2013 earlier this month, and now both are up for sale over at Newegg. AMD\u2019s newest processors are likely to be just as popular as AMD\u2019s Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which has so far been the most popular gaming processor for the majority of PC gamers. It\u2019s been widely considered the best processor for gaming, and AMD\u2018s follow-ups in the Ryzen 9 family are more powerful. Expect them to be highly sought after for a while.\n\nThe new processors retail for $699.99 and $599.99, respectively. So, these aren\u2019t cheap processors. Newegg also won\u2019t be the only retailer carrying them. At the moment, though, it does seem to be one of the only major retailers with any in stock. These should eventually pop up at Best Buy and Amazon. Amazon has a listing, but you can\u2019t actually add it to the cart. B&H Photo also has a listing for both processors, but they\u2019re listed as out of stock as well.\n\nNewegg currently has the Ryzen 9 9950X3D for sale in a combo only\n\nThere\u2019s good news and bad news for those trying to get their hands on AMD\u2019s new processors. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D, the more powerful of the two, is currently only available in a bundle. The processors launched this morning and, unsurprisingly, went out of stock rather quickly. The retailer recently posted on X that it had restocked both models. However, it seems you can only buy the Ryzen 9 9900X3D as a standalone item.\n\nIn its post, Newegg does mention, however, that it may take a few minutes for the page to refresh properly and reflect the currently available stock. That being said, I\u2019ve refreshed the page on the 9950X3D several times, and it still shows as out of stock. So either the standalone processor option went out of stock again just as quickly as it came in, or Newegg only restocked the processor in bundles.\n\nIt is worth noting that the post on X is now more than 35 minutes old, but I did check right after it went up since I have Newegg\u2019s alerts on and saw the post when it was fresh.\n\nYou can still pick up the Ryzen 9 9900X3D and the Ryzen 7 9800X3D\n\nIf you aren\u2019t keen on spending a minimum of $980 for the processor and a compatible motherboard, you can opt for one of the other processors. As mentioned, the Ryzen 9 9900X3D is still in stock at Newegg as a standalone item. You can also still get the Ryzen 7 9800X3D if you want to save even more money. This processor is still an exceptional processor for gaming, and it retails for $479.\n\nBoth Newegg and Amazon have stock of the older processor model. Depending on where you order from, it may take longer to get. For me, buying on Amazon shows it could arrive as late as April 14, more than a month out. Newegg, on the other hand, shows delivery by March 14 with fast delivery and March 18 without. So, Newegg appears to be faster.\n\nBuy at Newegg (Ryzen 9 9950X3D)\n\nBuy at Newegg (Ryzen 9 9900X3D)\n\nBuy at Newegg (Ryzen 7 9800X3D)",

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.\n\nSure enough, AMD\u2019s exciting Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT graphic card prices, quoted at $550/$600, are looking too good to be true. Newegg, Overclockers UK, and even Micro Center are among the outlets that have now quietly raised the prices on the supposedly entry-level MSRP models of these graphics cards by $50-$130. Last Thursday, AMD wouldn\u2019t deny reports that its partners are explicitly allowed to rapidly increase those prices beyond MSRP, and a week later, that\u2019s already coming to pass.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that board partners like ASRock, Gigabyte, PowerColor, Sapphire, and XFX generally charge more for cards with fancier cooling solutions, those aren\u2019t the cards we\u2019re talking about today. We\u2019ve been tracking prices on ten specific models of the AMD 9070 and AMD 9070 XT that were originally introduced at their $550 and $600 MSRPs.\n\nNone of those cards are currently in stock at any retailer we\u2019ve checked \u2014 but some retailers have already modified their pricetags ahead of new shipments. Here are the changes we\u2019ve seen:\n\nAMD Radeon 9070 XT\n\nNewegg now lists PowerColor\u2019s 9070 XT Reaper at $700, a $100 jump\n\nNewegg now lists XFX\u2019s 9070 XT Swift at at $730, a $130 jump\n\nNewegg now lists ASRock\u2019s 9070 XT Steel Legend at $670, a $70 jump\n\nOCUK now lists PowerColor\u2019s 9070 XT Reaper and Sapphire Pulse 9070 XT at \u00a3650, an \u00a380 jump\n\nOCUK now lists ASRock\u2019s 9070 XT Steel Legend at \u00a3669, a \u00a399 jump\n\nAMD Radeon 9070\n\nMicro Center now lists XFX\u2019s 9070 Swift OC at $630, an $80 jump\n\nMicro Center now lists Gigabyte\u2019s 9070 Gaming OC at $670, a $130 jump\n\nOCUK now lists PowerColor\u2019s 9070 Reaper at \u00a3570, a \u00a340 jump\n\nOCUK now lists Sapphire\u2019s Pulse 9070 at \u00a3570, a \u00a340 jump\n\nNot every retailer has changed out the pricetags on every card. Best Buy, which only listed a single model of the 9070 and 9070 XT at MSRP to begin with, hasn\u2019t changed those prices yet \u2014 though they\u2019re admittedly still out of stock. (It also now lists a pair of out-of-stock Gigabyte cards at MSRP.) Micro Center also still lists three models of 9070 and four models of 9070 XT at MSRP, though all are out of stock.\n\nOn the Nvidia front, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much retailer/board partner scalping going on yet, at least at major US retailers. We\u2019re tracking six different models of $550 RTX 5070, three different models of $750 RTX 5070 Ti, and three different models of $1,000 RTX 5080 which were originally listed at MSRP prices. Best Buy, Newegg, and Micro Center are still listing the ones they stock at MSRP today.",

            "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) investors have had little to cheer about, as the stock has failed to capitalize on the AI-driven boom that has propelled other chipmakers forward. Instead of riding the wave, AMD shares have tumbled \u2013 down 50% over the past year \u2013 now hovering just above their 52-week lows.\n\nBut if there\u2019s one thing CEO Lisa Su knows how to do, it\u2019s orchestrating a turnaround. A decade ago, she pulled AMD back from the edge of bankruptcy and led it to remarkable success. Now, investors are eager to see if she can work her magic once again.\n\nJ.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur, who ranks in the top 1% of Street stock experts, set out to find answers. After meeting with Su, he came away noting the company\u2019s confident tone.\n\n\u201cOverall, the key message is that the team\u2019s strong and diversified data center/enterprise/client compute portfolio will drive strong growth in CY25 \u2013 combination of share gains, improving demand/cyclical trends, and growing momentum for its next-gen AI compute solutions,\u201d said the 5-star analyst.\n\nThe company expects to achieve \u201cstrong double-digit growth\u201d (Sur thinks over 20%) and even higher earnings growth in 2025, driven by several factors. These include increasing market share in server CPUs, especially among cloud providers and hyperscalers, along with benefitting from \u201cimproving server demand trends.\u201d AMD also expects to add more share in desktop and notebook CPUs while its gaming and embedded businesses should grow too. Additionally, its AI GPU segment should expand, with Sur expecting over 60% growth this year.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is preparing for a strong second half of the year, as it readies to launch its next-gen MI350 accelerator. Early momentum is already evident, as Oracle recently placed a multi-billion dollar order, including an initial batch of 30,000 MI355X GPUs, to build a computing cluster for AI training and inference. Sur also thinks the company is working to \u201ctransition existing customers\u201d like Microsoft, Meta, and Oracle, as well as new major cloud providers, to the MI350 platform by mid-year. This transition will set the stage for its next-gen MI400 platform in 2026, which is expected to support large-scale AI clusters with over 100,000 GPUs each.\n\n\u201cJust as important,\u201d Sur goes on to add, \u201cthe team\u2019s networking strategy encompasses a scale-up/scale-out architecture that utilizes industry standard ethernet/PCIe/UALink/Ultra Ethernet physical layer mediums which is supported by a strong ecosystem of silicon, cabling, and systems partners.\u201d\n\nYet, despite all these bullish developments, Sur isn\u2019t fully convinced. He\u2019s sticking with a Neutral rating on AMD shares, although he might as well have said Buy, considering his $130 price target factors in a 12-month gain of 32%. (To watch Sur\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThe rest of the Street leans more optimistic. While 11 analysts remain on the sidelines, 25 rate AMD a Buy, with only one Sell. The consensus? A Moderate Buy rating, with an average price target of $148.44 \u2013 implying a potential 47% gain from current levels.

The brand\u2019s new gaming-centric Ryzen 9 9900X3D and Ryzen 9 9950X3D desktop processors are now available to purchase. These new processors are now hitting the scene as high-end models in the brand\u2019s 9000 series, and they\u2019re great for those looking to pick up some high-end chips for their gaming rigs. You are looking at two new models today \u2014 the 16-core Ryzen 9 9950X3D and the 12-core Ryzen 9 9900X, and they both feature the brand\u2019s 3D V-Cache. Head below for more details on the pricing, availability, and compatibility details.\n\nSome of my favorite gear Multi-angle foldable iPad stand with rotatable metal base\n\nAMD\u2019s new Ryzen 9 9900X3D and 9950X3D processors are now available\n\nBoth the new chips belong to the brand\u2019s Ryzen 9000 series, meaning they are based on the Zen 5 architecture. The Ryzen 9 9900X3D, as the name implies, is configured similarly to the Ryzen 9 9900X, whereas the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is largely the same as the Ryzen 9 9950X. The only difference here is that they both come with a 3D V-Cache boosted CCD, offering up to 144MB of total cache.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D will cost you $599 shipped whereas the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is priced at $699 shipped. The addition of 2nd-gen 3D V-cache has added a sizable amount to the overall price as the regular Ryzen 9 9900X and Ryzen 9 9950X without the 3D V-cache are currently going for $378.65 and $544.74 shipped, respectively. Here\u2019s what the lineup looks like right now:\n\nToday\u2019s new release is headlined by the Ryzen 9 9950X3D which is compatible with the existing AM5 motherboards. You should be able to install these on your existing AM5 boards and they\u2019ll run just fine after a quick BIOS update. That saves you the hassle of picking up new supporting hardware if you\u2019re upgrading from, say, Ryzen 7 7800X3D. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D comes with 16 cores and 32 threads, and it has two CCDs in a single IO die. It features a maximum boost clock of up to 5.7 GHz, and it\u2019s an unlocked chip with a 170W TDP package.\n\nThe Ryzen 9 9900X3D, on the other hand, has 12 cores and 24 threads, and it has a total cache of up to 140MB. It features a maximum boost clock of up to 5.5 GHz and it has the same 120W TDP package as the non-X3D version. AMD is delivering good value for your money here by maintaining the same MSRPs as the last-gen Zen 4 X3D offerings. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how these stack up against Intel\u2019s newer offerings for gamers, but AMD appears to have a good spot on the market with these prices.\n\nFTC: 9to5Toys is reader supported, we may earn income on affiliate links\n\nSubscribe to the 9to5Toys YouTube Channel for all of the latest videos, reviews, and more!",

The 9800X3D swooped-in a little later and cleaned-up what was a confusing and messy launch, largely making major moves for gaming CPUs and giving us something to be excited about as it\u2019s a really good CPU.\n\nThe 9950X3D is a 16-core, 32-thread CPU with a 5.7 GHz max advertised boost, 4.3 GHz base clock, and L3 cache at 128 MB. TDP target is 170W.\n\nFor comparison, the normal 9950X also has a max advertised boost of 5.7 GHz, base of 4.3 GHz, and TDP of 170W. These are shared. The cache changes, at 64 MB of L3.\n\nThe 9950X3D has two CCDs, with one of the two CCDs bearing extra cache. This is stacked vertically. As we described in the 9800X3D review, the cache this time is flipped so that it\u2019s closer to the substrate than the lid, pushing the cores closer to the IHS. In the 9800X3D review, we demonstrated how this helped significantly with cooling.\n\n9950X3D Testing\n\nWe\u2019re keeping it incredibly simple this time. As always, you can find our test bench information published here.\n\nFor gaming tests, we have all new data including the latest Windows updates and microcode for everything. That means we\u2019ve refreshed the data set and wiped out what we had, so every CPU you that has been run was done in the last 3 days or so. We got the important ones in there. For production, we were able to salvage a lot of data since it\u2019s the same.\n\nWe\u2019ve been completely buried by one GPU after another in an onslaught of benchmarks and follow-ups the last few weeks, so for this one, we\u2019re sticking to the basics.\n\nLet\u2019s just get into it.\n\nFrequency Tests\n\nFrequency - Blender All-Core\n\nFrequency analysis is up first. We do this testing to ensure the CPUs are functioning as expected and to help explain the performance later.\n\nFirst up is the Blender all-core workload. In this test, the 9950X3D had a frequency plot that started at about 5250 MHz, but settled closer to 5020 MHz to 5080 MHz during testing. This chart is intentionally zoomed-in to make it easier to see, so the scale purposefully does not start at 0.\n\nFor comparison, the 9950X non-3D (read our review) had higher peaks, but similar valleys. It ranged from 5010 MHz to 5080 MHz. In terms of average frequency over the course of the test, the 9950X3D averaged 5038 MHz all core to the 9950X\u2019s 5036 MHz, but the X3D CPU did so with fewer peaks and more level frequencies in the middle of its range. We think this will be beneficial to it in gaming.\n\nThe 9800X3D 5220 MHz all-core, putting it well above both. This will help it in some specific workloads, but obviously the lower core count will set it back elsewhere.\n\nFrequency - Cinebench 1C\n\nThe next chart is for frequency in a Cinebench single thread workload. This has the 9950X3D up in the range of 5650 to 5725 MHz, which hits AMD\u2019s advertised frequency of 5.7 GHz. The 9950X holds its frequency steadier and with fewer dips between tile cycles, but is overall comparable.\n\nThe 9800X3D holds 5225 MHz throughout the test so it\u2019s lower than both when in a single-threaded workload in this situation.\n\n9950X3D Game Benchmarks\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate 3\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate 3 is up now. This one had the AMD R9 9950X3D at 155 FPS AVG, technically becoming a new chart topper. The 9800X3D was our chart topper last time and is now functionally tied with the 9950X3D as the best CPU on the chart.\n\nThe good news is that the 9950X3D doesn\u2019t appear to be suffering from its dual-CCD approach, so parking is functioning properly and the CPU is not hamstrung by its extra threads.\n\nThe 9950X3D outranks the 7950X3D by similar margins as the 9800X3D did: It\u2019s 23% higher average framerate, with lows comparable for the average. The 7950X3D (watch our review) outdid the 7950X, which we\u2019re using old data for but should be no greater than 2-3% different based on our study of this test, by 29%. That\u2019s with proper setup for the 7950X3D this time.\n\nAs compared to the 9950X at 101 FPS AVG, the 9950X3D outdid it by 54%. The 9950X is closer to the 7950X (watch our review) for performance, which makes sense. This game really benefits from the extra cache.\n\nIn fact, an easy example of this is the 5700X3D (read our review) vs. the 5600X3D (read our review): In some games, the 5600X3D outperforms the 5700X3D because of its higher clock rate. In this instance, the cache and core count was more beneficial than the frequency.\n\nThe 5800X3D (watch our review) remains an excellent CPU, up at 119 FPS AVG. The 9950X3D and 9800X3D outrank it by about 30%. As for Intel, it remains uncompetitive here. The 285K is getting crushed by two prior Intel generations for reasons discussed in that review, and that\u2019s with new Windows updates.\n\nStellaris\n\nStellaris is one of our favorite CPU benchmarks because it looks at time rather than framerate, which is the most tangible to a user and the most directly influenced by the CPU. Players of 4X or other grand strategy games like Total War with the campaign map, Galactic Civilizations IV with turn pacing (and that\u2019s a great game, if you haven\u2019t played it), and Civilization would also see value here.\n\nFor Stellaris, the 9800X3D and 9950X3D both perform at the top of the chart. The 9800X3D outperformed the 9950X3D with a reduction in simulation time of 5%. That\u2019s near error, but not quite. This seems to be a combination of a higher base clock and utilization.\n\nThe 9950X3D is definitely working as expected, though, because it\u2019s outperforming the 9950X significantly. The simulation time requirement drops by almost 15%, from 32.3 seconds to 27.6 seconds.\n\nThis is the one game where Zen 5 in particular had stronger gains over Zen 4, with the 9700X doing well here and proving that. That\u2019s from IPC uplift overall, where Zen 5 is benefitted.\n\nIntel\u2019s 285K is competitive with the 7800X3D and 9700X, at least. The 14900K (read our review) and 14700K (read our review) are within error of each other.\n\nDragon\u2019s Dogma 2\n\nIn Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2, the 9950X3D leads the chart. It landed at 132 FPS AVG here, passing the 9800X3D by a measurable but irrelevant 3.2%. Both CPUs lead all of Intel\u2019s, although Intel at least lands its prior two generations ahead of the 7950X3D and 7800X3D with the game\u2019s updates. This game really seems to benefit from extra cache, with the 9950X3D leading the 9950X by 46% and the 9800X3D leading the 9700X (although they have other differences) by 41%. Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 remains heavy on CPUs in NPC-intensive areas.\n\nThe 285K continues to impress with how much of a downgrade it is from not only AMD\u2019s current generation, but Intel\u2019s past generations.\n\nWe added the older results for the 3700X and 2600 to this chart. We noticed that performance on older generations hasn\u2019t changed much. At most, there might be a 5% change here, but we don\u2019t think so. Even with that though, anything is an upgrade.\n\nIntel has seen the most upgrade since our last round of tests. This game has gotten updates, so it\u2019s possible some of those were targeted at Intel. Windows updates could also affect it. We consistently saw uplift across Intel\u2019s CPUs. That\u2019s shifted the relative ranking of the 14th and 13th gen against the 7800X3D (watch our review).\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV Dawntrail - 1080p\n\nFinal Fantasy 14: Dawntrail is up now. In this one, the 9800X3D ran at 380 FPS AVG, with the 9950X3D at 373 FPS AVG. We observed relatively wide run-to-run variance in some of these results, so the error bars are wider than typical. The 9800X3D leads the 9950X3D by just 2%, so they are functionally equal.\n\nThe 9950X3D bests its 9950X non-3D variant by 50 FPS or so, or 16% here in average framerate. The 1% lows are also significantly improved, indicating that frametime pacing is keeping up with improvements in the average framerate.\n\nThe improvement over the 7950X3D is 5.8%.\n\nIntel\u2019s closest CPUs don\u2019t appear until the 14900K at 310 FPS AVG. This is mostly interesting because there was a time when Final Fantasy\u2019s prior benchmark versions were entirely dominated by Intel, with the clean division halfway down the chart. This is actually what we\u2019re seeing now favoring AMD, relegating Intel to the bottom. That\u2019s flipped in recent years and generations.\n\nIntel\u2019s 285K underperforms against its prior two generations. There was no change in performance against last time for the 285K. Intel\u2019s one advantage in this test is frametime pacing, where the 0.1% lows indicate that Intel\u2019s CPUs generally have more consistent frame-to-frame intervals than AMD\u2019s CPUs, although not by an amount that\u2019d change your experience in a noticeable way.\n\nThe 5600X3D outperforms the 5700X3D in this game. This has been known and is because of the higher clock speed on the 5600X3D, which proves more valuable than the extra cores.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV - 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the top of the chart truncates as a result of GPU limitations on the RTX 4090 (watch our review). We\u2019ll move to a 5090 (read our review) for our full revamp of CPU testing for the next major architecture, but for now, this is where we cap-out. We\u2019re sure this is deeply disappointing to all 12 of you who have an RTX 5090.\n\nThe 9800X3D and 9950X3D are about the same once again. The 7950X3D is also now about the same, as is the 9700X, thanks to the external limitations. This is a good reminder that the gains once scaling graphics are most seen in time-based situations or in seriously heavy CPU games like Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2, but otherwise, most of the time you\u2019ll get the most uplift from a GPU.\n\nStarfield\n\nIn Starfield, we had the 9950X3D at 171 FPS AVG, leading the 9800X3D\u2019s 165 FPS by 3%. The 9800X3D was notably ahead of the 7800X3D and the 9950X3D continued that, though neither had as revolutionary of a gain as we\u2019ve seen in other benchmarks.\n\nThe 14900K trails the 7800X3D, improving upon its prior round result in a meaningful way; however, because of the improvements we\u2019re seeing in the prior generations, the 285K now falls back behind Intel\u2019s 14900K in this test. The 285K still regresses and generally embarrasses Intel, trailing even the 13700K (watch our review). Intel has continually tweaked its microcode on these prior generations, so it\u2019s possible that they rolled-out a microcode that had lost some performance at some point and they\u2019ve regained some now with the 13th and 14th series. We update BIOS to the newest version for each round.\n\nAgainst the 9950X at 124 FPS AVG, the 9950X3D improves by 37%. That\u2019s one of the larger gains. Of course, if you\u2019re not going to use the extra cores, the 9800X3D makes more sense for value.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 - 1080p/Medium\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is back in our CPU test suite again with the Phantom Liberty expansion. Tested at 1080p/medium here, the 9800X3D and 9950X3D both ran at about 219 FPS AVG and were well within run-to-run variance at only fractions of a frame per second apart. The 7800X3D trails, but not by much. It\u2019d be roughly the same experience as these two.\n\nThe lead of the 9950X3D over the 9950X is 37% again, matching some of the other games. The Intel 200 series outdoes the prior generations here, finally, with the 285K at 170 FPS AVG. Unfortunately, that\u2019s still below the AM4 5700X3D and 5600X3D.\n\nF1 24 - 1080p\n\nF1 24 at 1080p is up now. This one has the 9950X3D and 9800X3D again roughly tied, with the 7800X3D not far behind. The advantage is only 7%. The 9950X3D leads the 9950X non-3D variant by 29%, slightly reduced from the advantage seen in other games. We might be hitting a GPU limit here.\n\nIntel\u2019s 14900K is its closest competition, released in 2023, with the 285K down at 9950X levels. The 5600X3D and 5700X3D results show again that this game likes frequency and IPC to some extent.\n\nF1 24 - 1440p\n\n1440p is almost exactly the same in the bottom half, with the top switching around due to GPU overhead and limitations on GPU scaling. The 5800X3D falls down the ranks as the 14th and 13th gen handle the overhead a little better and with more stable frametime pacing, which helps the average. Otherwise, things are about the same sans limitations of scaling for the 9950X3D.\n\n9950X3D Production Benchmarks\n\nGrab a GN15 Large Anti-Static Modmat to celebrate our 15th Anniversary and for a high-quality PC building work surface. The Modmat features useful PC building diagrams and is anti-static conductive. Purchases directly fund our work! (or consider a direct donation or a Patreon contribution!)\n\nWe\u2019re moving on to production tests now. This is where the 16-core CPUs do well. Historically, we\u2019ve seen the X3D variants of all of these CPUs underperform against the non-X3D parts due to power allocation to allow higher boosting. Extra cache doesn\u2019t help in our testing here normally. We\u2019ll see if the 9950X3D breaks that general trend.\n\nBlender Rendering\n\nBlender testing hasn\u2019t changed since our October round. We ran validation on several CPUs and the results came out basically identically, so we can keep a lot of data for more comparisons. This should help those of you on older hardware because we\u2019ve got more present here.\n\nThe 9950X3D required 6.6 minutes to complete the render, which is about tied with the 9950X. It was technically faster, but in reality, these are tied. That\u2019s good news for the X3D part, though: Past X3D CPUs, like the 7950X3D, have been technically slightly slower than their non-3D equivalents. That\u2019s not because of scheduling or parking, but because the frequency is slower in an all-core workload.\n\nAnother good example is the 7800X3D, which was slower than the 7700X by time required, or 5800X3D as slower than the 5800X. The 9950X3D is the first to break this trend in a big way. Technically, the 9800X3D looked like it was doing that against the 9700X, but the power target was what brought most of that change.\n\nThe 9950X3D outperforms the 285K here, with about a 7% reduction in total time required to complete the render.\n\nChromium Code Compile\n\nChromium code compile in Windows is another where the data set hasn\u2019t changed, so we were able to salvage it after validation. The 9950X3D required 81 minutes to complete the compile, which is comparable to the time required for the 9950X, but technically improved. This puts it marginally ahead of the freshly retested 285K, with a reduction in time required to compile from 285K to 9950X3D of 4.7% less time required. The 14900K required 88 minutes here, with the 265K at 98 minutes.\n\nThe 9950X3D is the new leader in our compile test. This is not going to be representative of every type of code compile, just like none of these tests is representative of every angle of a use case; however, the way we test it, the 9950X3D is the new leader short of going to Threadripper.\n\n7-Zip Compression\n\nData for decompression and compression can\u2019t be salvaged, so it\u2019s all new.\n\nIn 7-Zip file compression testing, the 9950X3D led the chart at 206,643 MIPs, or millions of instructions per second. That has it just ahead of the 9950X by 3.3%. This is one of the tests where cache can help, depending on its implementation. The 5600X3D and 5600X are good examples of this: The X3D part has a lower advertised frequency, but manages to still roughly tie the 5600X.\n\nThe 9950X3D outperforms the 7950X3D by 8.5%, which completed 191K MIPS. The 14900K is next at roughly 189K MIPS, then the 13900K (watch our review). The 285K follows all of these, down at 179K MIPS.\n\nCore count clearly matters in this test: The 3950X 16-core CPU is outperforming the 5900X 12-core CPU and 9700X 8-core CPU.\n\n7-Zip Decompression\n\nIn 7-Zip Decompression, we measured the 9950X3D at 277K MIPS, with the 9950X non-3D at 272K MIPS. You wouldn\u2019t really benefit from the 9950X3D in a meaningful way in either compression or decompression in this workload. The 9950X achieves all of the performance already, so you\u2019d need use cases that more directly leverage the cache to get value out of the 9950X3D.\n\nIntel\u2019s 14900K is its closest competitor, followed by the 14700K and then the 285K.\n\nAdobe Premiere\n\nWe saved some of the data for Adobe Premiere as well. The biggest swing was to Intel\u2019s 12th to 14th Gen CPUs here, where we saw some movement from the Windows updates recently. Most of the other parts stayed relatively stationary. Any 12th to 14th Gen CPUs with data prior to this round would move around a bit, so be aware of that; however, just to try and offer some extra data that\u2019s still mostly comparable, we\u2019ve left those parts here. Most of this data is brand new.\n\nThe 9950X3D scored 11600 points in the Puget suite aggregate extended scoring for Premiere, which puts it at the top of the chart. It bests the 9950X by 5.8%, with the 14900K closest to it, then the 285K. The improvement over the 7950X non-3D is 7%.\n\n9950X3D Efficiency\n\nWe\u2019ll keep power and efficiency testing short this time and just show a couple situations.\n\nStarfield\n\nIn Starfield, the 9950X3D ended up at 1.7 FPS/W, putting it behind the 7950X3D and 7800X3D, but tied with the 5700X3D and 9800X3D. The 9950X3D pulled 98.8W when playing this game, and Starfield is one of our games that most heavily loads the CPU (but is still nothing like an all-core Blender workload).\n\nThe 9950X non-3D part pulled 168W in this same test, putting it down at 0.7 FPS/W. That means the 9950X pulled nearly 70W more than the 9950X3D, or about a 70% increase in power consumption despite running at a lower framerate. In terms of FPS/W, the 9950X3D is both higher framerate and lower power, and so it is far more efficient. It\u2019s still not as efficient as the low-power 7800X3D, though.\n\n7-Zip Compression\n\n7-Zip compression shows that the 9950X3D can still be power-hungry. In our compression efficiency testing, the 9950X3D pulled 203.8W. That put it at 1014 MIPS/W, which makes it less efficient than about half the chart. The CPU is the best performer, but not for efficiency and that\u2019s because it\u2019s pulling 204W, its efficiency has decreased compared to some others.\n\nThe 9950X scored 979 MIPS/W and pulled the same power at 204W, making it less efficient than the 9950X3D. The 7800X3D is a lower performer overall, and in big ways, but has such impressively low power consumption that it ends up being the most efficient.\n\nOf course, if you were serious about running this kind of workload all the time, you\u2019d still want something more powerful than the 7800X3D.\n\n7-Zip Decompression\n\nDecompression testing looks better for the 16-core parts, with the 7950X3D proving incredibly efficient here, followed by an impressive result from the 7950X non-3D with ECO Mode enabled. The 9950X3D ran at 1358 MIPS/W, putting it slightly ahead of the 9950X. They\u2019re still in the middle of this chart though.\n\n9950X3D Conclusion\n\nVisit our Patreon page to contribute a few dollars toward this website's operation (or consider a direct donation or buying something from our GN Store!) Additionally, when you purchase through links to retailers on our site, we may earn a small affiliate commission.\n\nThat\u2019s it. You have the numbers.\n\nFor the quickest recap: For gaming, you can think of the 9950X3D like a 9800X3D. We didn\u2019t run into any major issues with the 9950X3D here. That in and of itself is kind of an accomplishment for AMD. The company has really struggled over the years with the dual CCDs, where one has the extra X3D cache on it. Over the years, it\u2019s taken them some time to get to a place where it\u2019s not regressive and where it\u2019s a little easier to set up. The 9950X3D does appear to do that in our experience so far and that is a major improvement for AMD. It\u2019s taken them some generations to get there.\n\nIf you have the funds and are looking to build a purely gaming computer, we think you should scale it down and go for a 9800X3D. It\u2019s just not that big of a difference as the 9800X3D often trades places with the 9950X3D and you save some money.\n\nIntel, on the other hand, is out of this conversation right now. They are not part of the high-end expensive CPU for gaming build scenario at the moment.\n\nMeanwhile, the 9950X makes sense for production-heavy builds that don\u2019t have an explicit use for that extra cache. There\u2019s definitely use-cases for this out there. We see a little bit of that in our 7-Zip testing, but for the most part in the things we test, it doesn\u2019t tend to benefit from the extra cache in non-gaming scenarios.\n\nWhere the 9950X3D, and the other X3D 16-core parts, shine is a more limited use case where you have some mix of really heavy production and really heavy gaming. If you do a lot of compression, decompression, maybe render things on the CPU, are heavy into Premiere, or do a lot of code compiles and play a lot of games, then that\u2019s kind of the use case for the CPU.\n\nIf you\u2019re in one camp or the other exclusively, then you can save some money by going for either a 9800X3D or a 9950X.\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t pay more than MSRP for the 9950X3D. CPUs tend to stick closer to MSRP, but can still have stupid prices from some retailers or third-party sellers.",

Alongside the Ryzen 7 9800X3D which debuted earlier this year, AMD has just released its two higher-end Ryzen 9 siblings in the Zen 5 \"X3D\" stack: the 9950X3D is available for $699 and the 9900X3D is available for $599. Collectively, these processors represent the best gaming chips across both Intel and AMD. Pure gamers should go with the 9800X3D and allocate their funds elsewhere; creators with deeper pockets and a penchant for gaming will benefit from the immense performance uplift on the new Ryzen 9 processors thanks to their increased core count and cache.\n\nNote: Processors are going in and out of stock (mostly out of stock, unfortunately).\n\nThe Creator's Choice: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D CPU\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D AM5 Desktop Processor 1 $699.00 at Amazon $699.00 at Best Buy $699.00 at Newegg Creative professionals who also want the best gaming chip on the market shouldn't think twice; this is the CPU to get. The new 9950X3D boasts a max boost clock of 5.7GHz with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 144MB of L2-L3 cache. In terms of gaming, it's only a few percentage points better than than the 9800X3D. However, for productivity use, it easily outperforms the other two Zen 5 X3D chips, and anything offered by Intel for that matter. AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D Review by Jacqueline Thomas \"The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D might be the most powerful gaming processor on the market right now, but that doesn\u2019t mean it has a de facto lead on every other chip on the market. Most people will have no problem getting by with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which just so happens to be much much more affordable at $479.

            "content": "Just a few months after the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D graced us with its presence, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D brings its 3D V-Cache technology to a 16-core, 32-thread gaming processor that\u2019s absolutely overkill for most people, but will have no problem keeping up with powerful graphics cards like the Nvidia RTX 5090 or whatever comes next.\n\nHowever, all of those cores come with a high $699 asking price and a 170W power budget, making this processor hard to recommend to anyone who isn\u2019t already building an incredibly powerful (and expensive) gaming PC. For anyone else, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D just makes more sense.\n\nPurchasing Guide The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D is available March 12, starting at $699. This is a suggested price, and AMD's processors have been known to fluctuate in value depending on demand.\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D \u2013 Photos 3 Images\n\nSpecs and Features\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D essentially takes the same Zen 5 cores behind the regular 9950X and pairs them with the new 2nd-generation 3D V-Cache found in the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. That means you still get excellent multi-core performance, but paired with better gaming performance thanks to a more capacious cache.\n\nUnlike the Ryzen 9 7950X3D that preceded it, though, the 3D V-Cache is now physically located below the actual CPU cores, rather than above them. This seems like a minor change, to be sure, but it ends up making a major difference in thermal performance. Because the CCD, or Core Complex Die, is what produces most of the CPU\u2019s heat, having it closer to the Integrated Heat Spreader (IHS), means it\u2019s able to dissipate heat more easily. And with AMD\u2019s performance algorithm taking thermal headroom into account, those lower temperatures mean the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is able to run faster, longer.\n\nThe physical location of the cache is about more than just temperatures, though. Because it\u2019s directly under the CPU cores, there is less distance for the data to travel, which cuts down on latency. Plus, because the cache gets more space, AMD was able to shove in a ton of it, with the 9950X3D having 144MB of combined L2 and L3 cache. That\u2019s the same amount as in the last-generation Ryzen 9 7950X3D, but it\u2019s still much more than you\u2019re going to find in any non-X3D processor.\n\nBoth the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X and 9950X3D have the same 170W TDP, though the original 9950X has a higher potential PPT. Though, in my testing, I found that both processors ended up peaking at 200W. Though, the 9950X3D did have a lower peak temperature, only reaching 79\u00b0C during the test suite \u2013 though it was tested on a different cooler than the original 9950X.\n\nLuckily, because the 9950X3D isn\u2019t using a new chipset, it's compatible with any AM5 AMD motherboard. AMD has come out and said it would support this socket until at least 2027, so you won\u2019t have to worry about getting locked into a dead platform.\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D \u2013 Benchmarks 11 Images\n\nPerformance\n\nBefore I dive into performance results, I have to note that all CPUs were tested on the same hardware, with one exception: the Ryzen 9 9950X. That was tested on an Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Hero motherboard with a Corsair H170i 360mm AIO cooler. This difference in hardware will have an impact on performance, but it\u2019s not likely to be a major difference, especially since everything is tested at stock settings.\n\nAMD Test bench GPU Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Motherboard Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Hero; Asus ROG Crosshair X870E Hero (9800X3D) RAM 32GB G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo @ 6,000MHz SSD 1TB PNY CS3140 Gen4x4 NVMe SSD CPU Cooler Asus ROG Ryujin III 360 ARGB Extreme\n\nThis happened largely because one of the mounting screws for the Asus ROG Ryujin III 360mm cooler I was using snapped when swapping to the 9950X. I will retest the processors in the coming weeks, and if anything is significantly different I\u2019ll be sure to update this section.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D is a 16-core, 32-thread gaming processor with an absolutely ridiculous 144MB of cache, so it shouldn\u2019t be too surprising that it\u2019s incredibly powerful. Even in creative benchmarks, where the 9800X3D fell behind, the 9950X3D has no problem keeping up with the most powerful chips on the market.\n\nIntel Test Bench GPU Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Motherboard Asus ROG Maximus Z890 Hero (200S); Asus Prime Z790-A (14th-Gen) RAM 32GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5 @ 6,000MHz SSD PNY CS3140 1TB Gen 4 x 4 NVMe SSD CPU Cooler Asus ROG Ryujin III 360 ARGB Extreme\n\nWhat\u2019s surprising is how well the 9950X3D holds up against 9800X3D in single-core workloads. For example, in Cinebench 1T, the 9950X3D gets 2,254 points, compared to 2,033 points, making for a 10% improvement. Then, in the 3DMark CPU Profile test, the 9950X3D scores 1,280 points, which comes in striking distance to the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K\u2019s 1,351 points.\n\nOf course, in multi-threaded workloads, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is really able to stretch its legs, scoring 40,747 points in Cinebench\u2019s multi-core test. Just like the 9800X3D, the 9950X3D does lose some top-end performance in multi-threaded applications, falling short of the 41,123 points from the 9950X and 42,245 points from the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K, but it's worth it for the boost in gaming performance.\n\nIn Total War: Warhammer 3 at 1080p with Ultra settings, the 9950X3D is able to get 274 fps when paired with the RTX 4090. Compared to 254 fps from the 9800X3D and 255 from the Core Ultra 9 285K, the 9950X3D easily takes the crown here. However, in Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p with the Ultra preset and ray tracing disabled, the 9950X3D delivers 229 fps, down from 240 fps from the 9800X3D. That\u2019s a disappointing result, but it\u2019s still way faster than the 165 fps from the competing Intel processor.\n\nOverkill?\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D might be the most powerful gaming processor on the market right now, but that doesn\u2019t mean it has a de facto lead on every other chip on the market. Most people will have no problem getting by with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which just so happens to be much much more affordable at $479.\n\nInstead, the 9950X3D is geared towards gamers that both play games and use creative apps like Photoshop and Premiere, the latter of which sees a 15% performance improvement over the 9800X3D. For a pure gaming PC build, though, you\u2019re probably better off saving that extra $220 for a better graphics card.\n\nJackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen.

            "content": "Even three years later, AMD's high-end X3D-series processors still aren't a thing that most people need to spend extra money on\u2014under all but a handful of circumstances, your GPU will be the limiting factor when you're running games, and few non-game apps benefit from the extra 64MB chunk of L3 cache that is the processors' calling card. They've been a reasonably popular way for people with old AM4 motherboards to extend the life of their gaming PCs, but for AM5 builds, a regular Zen 4 or Zen 5 CPU will not bottleneck modern graphics cards most of the time.\n\nBut high-end PC building isn't always about what's rational, and people spending $2,000 or more to stick a GeForce RTX 5090 into their systems probably won't worry that much about spending a couple hundred extra dollars to get the fastest CPU they can get. That's the audience for the new Ryzen 9 9950X3D, a 16-core, Zen 5-based, $699 monster of a processor that AMD begins selling tomorrow.\n\nIf you're only worried about game performance (and if you can find one), the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the superior choice, for reasons that will become apparent once we start looking at charts. But if you want fast game performance and you need as many CPU cores as you can get for other streaming or video production or rendering work, the 9950X3D is there for you. (It's a little funny to me that this a chip made almost precisely for the workload of the PC building tech YouTubers who will be reviewing it.) It's also a processor that Intel doesn't have any kind of answer to.\n\nSecond-generation 3D V-Cache\n\nLayering the 3D V-Cache under the CPU die has made most of the 9950X3D's improvements possible. Credit: AMD\n\nAMD says the 9000X3D chips use a \"second-generation\" version of its 3D V-Cache technology after using the same approach for the Ryzen 5000 and 7000 processors. The main difference is that, where the older chips stack the 64MB of extra L3 cache on top of the processor die, the 9000 series stacks the cache underneath, making it easier to cool the CPU silicon.",

            "content": "After providing a taste of its second-generation 3D V-Cache technology last year, it\u2019s finally time to see what it can do paired with more cores via Ryzen 9 9950X3D. The results are nothing short of spectacular, creating a processor that really does feel all-singing, all-dancing, setting the bar for CPUs moving forward.\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D \u00a3660 / $699 Pros Unparalleled multi-core performance\n\nOutstanding gaming performance\n\nDrop-in AM5 upgrade\n\nSurprisingly efficient\n\nCool under load Cons 9800X3D is better value for gaming Buy at Amazon Club386 may earn an affiliate commission when you purchase products through links on our site.\n\nHow we test and review products.\n\nWhile regular Ryzen 9 9950X did little to push boundaries, the progress 9950X3D makes is far more pronounced. It more often than not makes serious gains over its non-X3D sibling and its predecessor, 7950X3D, easily justifying its place among the crowd of AMD CPUs.\n\nSpecs\n\nComparing Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 7 9800X3D to their predecessors, namely 7950X3D and 7800X3D, it\u2019s clear that the new flagship represents more a of a seismic generational shift. Though core and thread counts remain identical, AMD has bolstered the CPU\u2019s specs elsewhere not forgetting that it packs the architectural improvements of Zen 5.\n\nModel Cores\n\nThreads TDP L3\n\nCache Base\n\nClock Boost\n\nClock MSRP 9000 Series Ryzen 9 9950X3D 16 / 32 170W 128MB 4.3GHz 5.7GHz $699 Ryzen 9 9950X 16 / 32 170W 64MB 4.3GHz 5.7GHz $649 Ryzen 9 9900X3D 12 / 24 120W 128MB 4.4GHz 5.5GHz $599 Ryzen 9 9900X 12 / 24 120W 64MB 4.4GHz 5.6GHz $499 Ryzen 7 9800X3D 8 / 16 120W 96MB 4.7GHz 5.2GHz $479 Ryzen 7 9700X 8 / 16 65W 32MB 3.8GHz 5.5GHz $359 Ryzen 5 9600X 6 / 12 65W 32MB 3.9GHz 5.4GHz $279 7000 Series Ryzen 9 7950X3D 16 / 32 120W 128MB 4.2GHz 5.7GHz $699 Ryzen 9 7950X 16 / 32 170W 64MB 4.7GHz 5.7GHz $699 Ryzen 9 7900X3D 12 / 24 170W 128MB 4.4GHz 5.6GHz $599 Ryzen 9 7900X 12 / 24 170W 64MB 4.7GHz 5.6GHz $549 Ryzen 7 7800X3D 8 / 16 120W 96MB 4.2GHz 5.0GHz $449 Ryzen 7 7700X 8 / 16 105W 32MB 4.5GHz 5.4GHz $399 Ryzen 5 7600X3D 6 / 12 65W 96MB 4.1GHz 4.7GHz $299 Ryzen 5 7600X 6 / 12 105W 32MB 4.7GHz 5.3GHz $299\n\nRyzen 9 9950X3D is a 16-core processor complete with 32 threads and 128MB of L3 cache shared across two CCDs (Core Complex Dies). So far, so much like its forebear. Dig a little deeper, though, and differences begin to manifest.\n\nBoth Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 7950X3D boost to 5.7GHz but the former runs at a higher base clock of 4.3GHz. However, the newer chip can more consistently achieve higher frequencies thanks to changes in AMD\u2019s approach to 3D V-Cache.\n\nIn a nutshell, AMD has shifted the position of the L3 cache stack below the CPU cores. This invisible-to-the-eye change benefits cooling which in turn allows for greater headroom in terms of frequencies and voltages. This is why Ryzen 9 9950X3D finally mirrors its non-X3D counterpart, 9950X, with the same 170W TDP. For a deeper dive into all-things-new with this generation of 3D V-Cache, I strongly recommend reading Tarinder\u2019s 9800X3D review.\n\nI\u2019m happy to see Ryzen 9 9950X3D maintains price parity with 7950X3D in terms of MSRP, at \u00a3660 / $699. This proves more beneficial than one might think to the new chip as pricing for its predecessor currently isn\u2019t massively lower than it was upon release. Don\u2019t forget, this CPU is backwards compatible with 800 and 600 Series motherboards providing you\u2019ve updated your BIOS on the latter, allowing you to save a buck elsewhere in service of more easily affording the chip.\n\nPerformance\n\nIn a bid to showcase Ryzen 9 9950X3D at its best, I\u2019ve paired it with GeForce RTX 5090. This will limit comparisons to 9800X3D and 7950X3D but these are ultimately the most important chips to compare. Aside from this change of CPU and GPU, the Club386 AM5 test bench remains the same as it was.\n\nDown below you\u2019ll find an assortment of benchmarks, covering content creation and more. For our gaming suite, I\u2019ve limited testing to FHD to place as much stress on the processors as possible.\n\nChip Frequency TDP Ryzen 9 9950X3D 5.123GHz 170W Ryzen 7 9800X3D 5.220GHz 120W Ryzen 9 7950X3D 4.552GHz 120W\n\nBefore we jump into results proper, note the frequency table above. These are the average all-core frequencies of each processor while running Cinebench 2024 Multi-core for 10 minutes. As you can see, frequencies are much stronger on Zen 5 X3D processors and set the stage for serious gains to come.\n\nApps\n\nMore cores and more threads begets more performance in 7-Zip Compression, so it\u2019s no wonder that Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 7950X3D are miles ahead of 9800X3D. Unsurprisingly, the Zen 5 flagship sits comfortably at the head of the pack with a 14% lead over its predecessor.\n\nCoincidentally, this is the same uplift that Ryzen 7 9800X3D enjoys over its predecessor. However, architectural improvements and a higher power budget undoubtedly play their part together in creating 9950X3D\u2019s generational performance leap over 7950X3D. Referring back to legacy numbers, 9950X3D is now king of the hill in this test to boot.\n\nCalculating the first five-billion digits of Pi leaves Ryzen 9 9950X3D hungry for more, as its results are fresh out of the oven in 84.8s. It\u2019s a cool 10% faster than 7950X3D in the same task, and again emerges as the fastest chip on the market.\n\nIPC (Instructions Per Clock) comes in clutch for Zen 5, as both Ryzen 9000 Series processors leave Ryzen 9 7950X3D behind in this Geekbench 6 Single-core leaderboard. Once architectural differences evaporate, clock speeds become king and 9950X3D pulls ahead of its sibling thanks to a 500MHz advantage in boost frequency.\n\nRyzen 9 9950X3D achieves the highest score we\u2019ve seen in this benchmark, putting yet another feather in its cap.\n\nFreeing every core and thread to unleash its potential, Geekbench 6 Multi-core sees Ryzen 9 9950X3D soar above 9800X3D and 7950X3D. It\u2019s a welcome 12% ahead of its predecessor, providing the first instance of a score above 22,000 I\u2019ve seen from AMD.\n\nHistorically, Geekbench Mult-core is a battleground that AMD concedes ground to Intel but its new flagship actually outpaces Core Ultra 9 285K. However, Team Blue has worked hard to improve performance of its latest processors in recent months. As such, further testing is necessary before declaring an outright victory for Team Red here but this is a promising result that puts Ryzen 9 9950X3D top of the stack in the meantime.\n\nZen 5 handles single precision computing more deftly than Zen 4, creating a sizeable difference in score between Ryzen 9 7950X3D and its competition in Geekbench AI. While 9800X3D performs admirably, it can\u2019t quite keep up with 9950X3D which becomes the new champ of this benchmark.\n\nNote that none of these processors feature an NPU (Neural Processing Unit), unlike Intel\u2019s Core Ultra 200S offerings. Regardless, it\u2019s best to pair top-tier CPUs with dedicated graphics for AI workloads if possible as they simply compete with the FP32 chops of a GPU.\n\nContent Creation\n\nCombine 3D V-Cache with Zen 5 and you\u2019re on to a winning combination for Adobe Photoshop. Ryzen 9 9950X3D dethrones 9800X3D as top dog albeit with a small 4% lead.\n\nShifting across Adobe\u2019s software suite to Premiere Pro and Ryzen 9 9950X3D delivers its most exciting uplift thus far. It\u2019s a whopping 19% ahead of 7950X3D, and handily earns itself the title of fastest processor in this test.\n\nThe welcome wins keep on coming as Ryzen 9 9950X3D leads the way in Blender with 625.1 samples per minute, beating its predecessor by 18%. So far, there hasn\u2019t been a benchmark where this monster of a processor has met its match.\n\nLike with Geekbench 6, improved IPC does wonders for Zen 5 in Cinebench 2024 Single-core. Ryzen 9 9950X3D expectedly enjoys prime position on the podium against 9800X3D and 7950X3D.\n\nHowever, it does play second fiddle to Core Ultra 9 285K if we refer back to results captured last year, by the same seven points that separate 9950X3D and 9800X3D. Arrow Lake updates will likely either keep this lead intact or widen it further.\n\nCinebench 2024 Multi-core turns proceedings into a two-horse race between Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 7950X3D with the former expectedly proving the better performer. A 16% generational bump is a welcome sight.\n\nCore Ultra 9 285K keeps Ryzen 9 9950X3D from winning gold overall as a mere three points separate the two CPUs. This is margin of error stuff, but Intel\u2019s contender should be all the better with patches behind it.\n\nFinally, Ryzen 9 9950X3D cements itself as champion renderer of all chips in Corona 10, delivering 15.72 million rays per second. Viewing this achievement through the lens of generational improvement makes it all-the-more impressive as it smashes 7950X3D by 26%.\n\nMemory\n\nRead speeds remain a sore spot for AMD, as Ryzen 9 9950X3D doesn\u2019t meaningfully move the needle as it beats 7950X3D by a mere 1%.\n\nUsing identical memory kits, Intel 14th Gen Core processors and Core Ultra 9 285K historically outclass all AMD CPUs in this regard.\n\nA rare win for Ryzen 7 9800X3D, there\u2019s no dethroning it in terms of memory write speeds. A tiny 2% bump separates 9950X3D and 7950X3D.\n\nRyzen 9 9950X3D latency is expectedly on the higher side, as it was for 9800X3D. Nonetheless, there\u2019s nothing to fuss over here.\n\nGaming\n\nPairing all three processors with GeForce RTX 5090 leads to a dead heat in 3DMark Speed Way and Steel Nomad. This isn\u2019t surprising as these workloads thrash the GPU more than the CPU. Regardless, Ryzen 9 9950X3D takes home silver in both benchmarks and these positions provide some indication of trends to come.\n\nRyzen 9 9950X3D nips at Ryzen 7 9800X3D\u2019s heels, losing out on the top spot by a single frame. To its credit, it does boast higher 1% lows by the same amount. Much as results point to a draw between the Zen 5 CPUs, 7950X3D isn\u2019t far behind in terms of average fps but can\u2019t muster the same consistency as its successor.\n\nTurning on all GeForce RTX 5090\u2019s bells and whistles in Alan Wake 2, namely DLSS Super Resolution and Multi Frame Generation, creates a curious difference between the CPUs.\n\nOnce again, Ryzen 9 9950X3D is marginally higher in terms of average frame rates than 7950X3D but is much better at keeping 1% lows in line. However, 9800X3D takes this handling into a class of its own, providing over 100fps in this regard. This perhaps suggests that either Alan Wake 2 or MFG doesn\u2019t play nice with AMD\u2019s dual-CCD designs.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 creates a more typical hierarchy between the three processors. Ryzen 9 9950X3D delivers a 5% lead over 7950X3D but it\u2019s 9800X3D that leads the way. Methinks difficulties with dual-CCD are showing face.\n\nImportant as processors are in handling path traced effects, final frame rates ultimately fall to the graphics card.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much in it between Ryzen 9 9950X3D and its competitors, as it matches 9800X3D\u2019s average frame rate and leads 7950X3D by 2fps. Minimum fps creates greater distinctions between the CPUs, as the Zen 5 flagship slots into second place on account of its sibling\u2019s 5fps lead in this regard.\n\nFortune favours Ryzen 9 9950X3D in Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail, netting the processor its first win in the gaming test suite. Its 2fps lead over 9800X3D isn\u2019t massive but it handily outperforms 7950X3D by 22fps on average.\n\nForza Motorsport is a chaotic race for Ryzen 9 9950X3D. It crosses the finish line with the largest average frame rate but lowest minimum performance. 9800X3D exhibits similar behaviour while 7950X3D coasts more consistently to the chequered flag.\n\nThese erratic frame rates are in part due to how Nvidia\u2019s GPU plays with Forza Motorsport. I didn\u2019t experience this problem using Ryzen 9 7950X3D for my Radeon RX 9070 XT or RX 9070 reviews.\n\nMount & Blade II: Bannerlord comes perilously close to running at 500fps thanks to Ryzen 9 9950X3D, beating 9800X3D by 20fps and 7950X3D by 25fps. Much as these three processors would deliver comparable gameplay experiences in terms of feel, a win is still a win.\n\nYou won\u2019t find many races tighter than the one between Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 7 9800X3D. Both CPUs deliver the same minimum frame rates but it\u2019s the latter that clips the win by a single frame. Meanwhile, 7950X3D mirrors its successors average fps but doesn\u2019t maintain consistency as deftly.\n\nEfficiency\n\nIn spite of its higher power draw, Ryzen 9 9950X3D keeps the coolest head under load compared to the other processors.\n\nThere\u2019s no avoiding higher power consumption on Ryzen 9 9950X3D with its out-of-the-box TDP of 170W. Stressing the processor with a 10 minute Cinebench 2024 multi-core workout sees it pull 100W more from the wall than 7950X3D.\n\nWhile gaming, the differences in system power consumption between the three systems are small. Ryzen 9 9950X3D still emerges as the most ravenous but is only 19W hungrier than 7950X3D.\n\nDividing Cinebench 2024 Multi-core scores by load watts, we arrive at efficiency ratings for each processor. Raising TDP from 120W to 170W does net more performance but does not a more efficient processor make. Ryzen 9 7950X3D remains a formidable force in this arena but there\u2019s no denying that 9950X3D does well too.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor those seeking the very best processing power on the market, look no further than Ryzen 9 9950X3D. Such powerful performance doesn\u2019t come cheap, at \u00a3660 / $699, but you\u2019re paying no more for this flagship than you would the last and its value is far higher.\n\nRyzen 9 9950X3D shines best as a hybrid or workstation chip and while it doesn\u2019t always knock Ryzen 7 9800X3D from its gaming pedestal, it proves a worthy adversary in terms of raw performance. Whether its greater versatility is worth an additional $220 will come down to the priorities of your system.\n\nIt pleases me greatly to see 3D V-Cache unleashed with a higher TDP and frequencies, showing the true might of AMD\u2019s technology. Arguably, now that the company has addressed this limitation is there any need to continue with non-X3D chips? As a cost-saving measure, perhaps, but one shouldn\u2019t let crystal ball gazing distract from the splendour of the present.\n\nSummarily, Ryzen 9 9950X3D rules over all and there\u2019s no sign of its glorious reign coming to an end anytime soon whether by the hand of AMD or Intel.",

The Radeon RX 9070 series was notably absent from any of AMD\u2019s CES news, but any concerns about that omission turned out to be unwarranted. That launch has since happened and the cards kick some serious tail.Considering our pedigree around here, we were eager to see what the top-end Ryzen 9 9950X3D could do after its initial unveiling, and thankfully we didn\u2019t have to wait very long. We\u2019ve had one of the processors in hand for a while now, and we're able to show you how it performs on the pages ahead. Before we get to the numbers, however, let\u2019s lay some foundation. The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D\u2019s main features and specification are up first...How the new Ryzen 9 9950X3D compares to the other Ryzen 9000X3D processors, and its immediate predecessors in the 7000 series, is laid out in the table above. Except for the base and boost clocks and official memory speed support, it seems like not much has changed. AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 7950X3D share what appear to be similar core counts and cache configurations, though the new 9950X3D has a higher and TDP. Of course, Ryzen 9 9950X3D features AMD\u2019s latest Zen 5 microarchitecture, and its second generation 3D V-Cache literally flips the build upside down, to allow for not only higher clocks, but clocks that boost consistently higher for longer durations.In terms of its specifications, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D only has a 100MHz higher base clock than the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, which alone should boost performance only slightly, but there are architectural enhancements at play that push performance even further. AMD has also enlarged the physical size of the 3D V-Cache die to match the CCD, and bonded it to the bottom-side for this generation. That means the CPU cores have direct access to cooling, which was a limiting factor with previous generations X3D processors. 3D V-Cache on the 5000 and 7000 series was bonded on top of the CCD, so the CPU cores radiated heat through the cache, to the cooler \u2013 this is no longer the case with Ryzen 9 9950X3D.The updates to the Ryzen 9000X3D\u2019s design and 3D V-Cache implementation also allowed AMD to enable full overclockability as well, which is new for this generation of X3D series processors.Regarding its core configuration, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is a 16-core / 32-thread, dual-CCD part, with a base clock of 4.3GHz and a max boost clock of 5.7GHz. There\u2019s 96MB of second generation 3D V-Cache on board and with Zen 5 processors , AMD officially supports a non-overclocked memory speed of DDR5-5600, though higher clocks are easily possible and DDR5-6000 remains the sweet spot for enthusiast and content creation performance. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D has a 170W configurable TDP, which is a step up over previous-gen parts (the 7950X3D is 120 watts), and slots into the same AM5 socket as the Ryzen 7000 and other 9000 series chips. We tested the 9950X3D in one of the latest X870E-based motherboards, but 600-series chipset-based motherboards will also support Ryzen 9000X3D series processors, when flashed with a necessary BIOS and CPU microcode update.Physically there\u2019s not much to see. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D looks just like every other Ryzen 9000 series processor, save for the branding on the top of its heat-spreader. All of the same cooling and accessories that fit the Ryzen 7000 series and current 9000 series will work properly on the Ryzen 9 9950X3D.The Ryzen 9 9950X3D\u2019s details as reported by CPU-Z are laid out in the images below. The family, stepping and other details are the same as standard Ryzen 9000 series processors and the only change is the amount of L3 cache.There\u2019s 80K of L1 per core (48K D-Cache [12-way] + 32K I-Cache [8-way]), which is an increase from 64K on Zen 4 / Ryzen 7000. There\u2019s also 1MB of L2 cache per core, which is 16-way set associative. Standard Ryzen 9000 series processors also feature 32MB of L3 cache per compute die but with the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, one compute die is outfitted with an additional 96MB of 3D V-Cache, bringing the total L3 up to 128MB (144MB total cache). The CCD outfitted with 3D V-Cache operates at more conservative voltages and frequencies, but the bare compute die is unencumbered.The non-symmetrical nature of the cache and clock configuration on the CCDs has some impact on the processor\u2019s behavior and ultimately its performance. On the plus side, having a standard CCD on board means frequencies can boost as high as the standard chip with many workloads, effectively maintaining flagship-level performance for both single and multi-threaded workloads. However, to ensure games and other workloads that benefit from the 3D-Vache actually run on the correct CCD, some driver wizardry is required. As such, ensuring the system is updated with the latest BIOS and AMD chipset software is a must to achieve peak performance, across a variety of workloads, especially gaming. With AMD's chipset drivers installed, an \u2018AMD 3D V-Cache Performance Optimizer\u2019 entry will be visible in Device Manager and Task Manger as well. This driver and service monitors workloads on the system and ensures games are run on the CCD with 3D V-Cache, while the other CCD is dynamically parked. Workloads that benefit most from higher frequencies prioritize the standard CCD, but still have access to all CPU resources.That massive L3 cache allows the Ryzen 9 9950X3D to keep lots of data close to the CPU cores and boost game performance. But other tweaks to the Ryzen 9 9950X3D can help general performance as well. How much does it help? Let's find out...",

The combination of high-performance AMD processors and GPUs and Azure offers impressive performance for these critical tasks.\n\n\u201cWe're excited to collaborate with Microsoft and AMD. We recognize that our customers have a preference in cloud platforms and associated hardware resources when deploying development platforms for SDV,\u201d said David Fritz, vice president, Hybrid and Virtual Systems, Siemens Digital Industries Software. \u201cWith PAVE360 recognized as key enabler for SDV development, extending our support to Microsoft Azure and AMD hardware gives our customers greater flexibility.\u201d\n\nFor automotive manufacturers to make the leap to true SDV development, a step change is needed in development methodology. PAVE360 running on Azure offers users the sophisticated cloud development features necessary for scalable SDV development while providing a system-aware view of behavior and the capability of identifying complex fault mechanisms.\n\nIn many instances software, hardware and system defects are not found until late in the design cycle or, worse still, when the fleet is deployed resulting in costly recalls and potentially significant brand damage. A system-aware approach to SDV validation helps to uncover these defects early in the modelling and simulation phase at which point many thousands of virtual scenarios can be run to isolate corner cases that otherwise would be missed. With the support of industry leaders such as Microsoft and AMD, Siemens brings system-aware SDV validation to the forefront with PAVE360.\n\n\u201cOur collaboration with Siemens and Microsoft allows automotive developers to leverage our leading AMD Radeon PRO GPUs and EPYC processors to power next generation ADAS and autonomous vehicle technologies,\u201d said Salil Raje, senior vice president and general manager, Adaptive and Embedded Computing, AMD. \u201cWe are excited to support Siemens\u2019 PAVE360 on AMD systems to enable developers with advanced automotive digital twin environments and help accelerate SDV.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy leveraging Azure's robust infrastructure and AMD's GPUs, PAVE360 now offers exceptional performance and scalability for Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) development,\u201d said Dayan Rodriguez, corporate vice president, Manufacturing and Mobility, Microsoft. \u201cThis collaboration highlights our commitment to driving innovation in the automotive industry, enabling manufacturers to achieve a system-aware approach to SDV validation and ensuring the highest standards of safety and reliability.\u201d\n\nA PAVE360 demonstrator, leveraging Siemens\u2019 Innexis\u2122 Virtual System Interconnect (VSI) software and featuring AMD Radeon GPUs running on Microsoft Azure in the PAVE360 environment, will be shown at Embedded World March 11th-14th in Hall 4 / Booth Number 4-530.\n\nTo learn more about how Siemens is providing leading development capabilities for development of the Software Defined Vehicle industry, visit https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/pave360/",

With AMD\u2019s $699 Ryzen 9 9950X3D, you don\u2019t need to choose: AMD now has the best CPU for both gaming and creator tasks.\n\nWith double the cores of the $479 Ryzen 7 9800X3D, the new 16-core Ryzen 9 9950X3D boosts performance in creator workloads like Photoshop and Premiere Pro, to the point where it comfortably beats its closest competitors in the form of Intel\u2019s Core i9-14900K and even the latest Core Ultra 9 285K processor.\n\nWhile AMD\u2019s first Zen 5 CPUs disappointed everyone in gaming, the latest X3D versions have more than made up for that.

Read More $700 at Best Buy\n\nAMD\u2019s latest productivity improvements with the 9950X3D required a redesign of its latest X3D chips. AMD\u2019s second generation of its 3D V-Cache technology sits below the processor cores, giving those processor cores better access to cooling. That lets AMD increase the base clock speed of the 9950X3D by 100Hz (compared to 2023\u2019s 7950X3D) to squeeze out more performance, because the 3D V-Cache is less sensitive to high temperatures.\n\nTest machines AMD: CPU cooler: Corsair H150i Elite LCD\n\nMotherboard: Gigabyte Aorus Master (EXPO enabled and default BIOS options)\n\nRAM: 32GB G.Skill DDR5-6000\n\nGPU: Nvidia RTX 4090 Founders Edition\n\nStorage: Samsung 990 Pro 1TB\n\nPSU: Corsair HX1000W Intel: CPU cooler: Corsair H150i Elite LCD\n\nMotherboard: MSI Mag Z790 Carbon Wi-Fi for i9-14900K / Asus Rog Maximus Z890 Apex for Core Ultra 9 285K\n\nRAM: 32GB Corsair Dominator Platinum DDR5 6600\n\nGPU: Nvidia RTX 4090 Founders Edition\n\nStorage: Samsung 990 Pro 1TB\n\nPSU: Corsair HX1000W\n\nI\u2019ve been testing AMD\u2019s Ryzen 9 9950X3D with Gigabyte\u2019s X870E Aorus motherboard, 32GB of G.Skill DDR5-6000 memory, and Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4090. (I\u2019ve held off switching our CPU testing to the RTX 5090 due to some early Nvidia driver issues.) To truly see where it fits, I\u2019ve run a variety of workloads, synthetic benchmarks, and games across all of the top gaming CPUs: AMD\u2019s new Ryzen 9 9950X3D, its existing $479 9800X3D and $449 7800X3D chips, and Intel\u2019s $589 Core i9-14900K and Core Ultra 9 285K.\n\nAll my tests were run on Windows 11 (version 24H2) with virtualization-based security (VBS) and resizable BAR enabled, and performed at 1080p resolution to analyze raw CPU performance. We don\u2019t test at 1440p or 4K in games to ensure we\u2019re demonstrating the differences between CPUs rather than GPUs, as most games rely more on the GPU at higher resolutions. Still, a better CPU can still help out at 4K, especially with upscaling technologies like DLSS or in CPU-heavy titles like Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, Hogwarts Legacy, and Microsoft Flight Simulator.\n\nIn an average of nine productivity-focused tests that I ran, AMD\u2019s Ryzen 9 9950X3D beats the 9800X3D by nearly 24 percent. It also beats Intel in my single-threaded Geekbench 6 tests, and only falls slightly behind on the muti-threaded score. Geekbench measures how well a CPU can deal with quick bursts of performance in tasks like launching apps, video encoding, or unzipping files. It\u2019s a good benchmark for measuring day-to-day tasks.\n\nFor heavier and sustained workloads, Cinebench is a better test for CPU performance. The Ryzen 9 9950XD matches Intel\u2019s Core Ultra 9 285K in single-thread performance in Cinebench 2024, but also manages to beat it when it comes to multi-thread performance. The 9950X3D is 80 percent faster in this multi-thread Cinebench test compared to the 9800X3D. That\u2019s a big win for AMD, because with the 9800X3D it didn\u2019t have enough cores to compete fully with Intel\u2019s sustained performance; you had to sacrifice it for a chip that was better at gaming. The 9950X3D can now deliver impressive creator and gaming performance seemingly without any compromises.\n\nIntel\u2019s chips did better showing me fancy graphics in a 3DMark benchmark, but we also use our CPUs for rendering videos or working on big Photoshop files, and AMD is winning there. Both the Premiere Pro and Photoshop PugetBench tests show that AMD is now comfortably ahead of Intel\u2019s 285K and 14900K for these key creator workloads. The 9800X3D was still behind Intel\u2019s latest Core Ultra 9 285K, but the 9950X3D pushes it ahead in the tests that matter to creators. The 9950X3D is also a big leap in productivity performance over the 7800X3D, around 46 percent faster in an average of nine tests.\n\nBenchmark 7800X3D 9800X3D 9950X3D Intel 285K 14900K Geekbench 6 single-thread 2773 3329 3463 3257 3168 Geekbench 6 multithread 15396 18574 22563 23698 20715 Cinebench 2024 single-thread 115 128 140 141 135 Cinebench 2024 multithread 1104 1344 2421 2361 2133 PugetBench for Premiere Pro 1.1.1 13482 13748 15974 14420 14735 PugetBench for Photoshop 1.0.3 14775 16985 16593 13677 10192 3DMark CPU max threads 8021 10060 16945 17012 15132 3DMark CPU single thread 969 1208 1281 1340 1271 3DMark Time Spy CPU score 13375 16069 17525 20852 22312 Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage 216 fps 215 fps 217 fps 182 fps 196 fps Metro Exodus 209 fps 231 fps 226 fps 188 fps 162 fps Forza Motorsport 2023 183 fps 184 fps 184 fps 156 fps 183 fps Shadow of the Tomb Raider 346 fps 377 fps 377 fps 268 fps 292 fps Cyberpunk 2077 220 fps 232 fps 233 fps 188 fps 180 fps CPU package temperatures 81C 88C 81C 87C 94C CPU package power 83W 142W 200W 239W 272W\n\nBigger scores are better, apart from when it comes to CPU power draw and heat.\n\nOver on the gaming side, AMD is so far ahead of Intel that it\u2019s not even close. In the five games I tested across Intel\u2019s top gaming chips, neither of them managed to beat AMD\u2019s 9950X3D. That\u2019s not all that surprising given how well the 9800X3D performed against Intel\u2019s latest last year, but it means you\u2019re not losing out on gaming performance if you need the extra cores and performance for creator workloads.\n\nThe only game where I found the 9950X3D performed worse than the 9800X3D was Metro Exodus, where the 9800X3D was around 2 percent faster. The 9950X3D was identical or within margin of error with the 9800X3D for the rest of the games.\n\nI also took the opportunity to re-test Intel\u2019s Core Ultra 9 285K after its round of microcode updates designed to improve gaming performance. In my previous tests the 285K was just ahead in Metro Exodus against the 14900K, and behind in the other four games. This time around Intel has managed to improve its Cyberpunk 2077 performance so that the 285K is now ahead, but in Forza Motorsport and Shadow of the Tomb Raider the 285K is still behind the previous 14900K flagship.\n\nTo add insult to Intel\u2019s injury, AMD\u2019s 9950X3D can also be overclocked to squeeze out even more gaming performance and compete with Intel\u2019s overclocking capabilities even further, which hasn\u2019t been possible with previous generations of X3D chips. Some AM5 motherboards also have an X3D turbo mode that boosts single-thread performance by enabling some bandwidth tuning, unifying CPU core distribution, and balancing some of the hardware power. The result is better gaming performance, while sacrificing some creator app performance. The X3D turbo mode makes a lot more sense on the 9800X3D if you\u2019re primarily buying that CPU for gaming, but on the 9950X3D you\u2019re probably buying this CPU for the mix of creator and gaming tasks.\n\nThe most impressive part of AMD\u2019s CPU performance dominance is that it manages to achieve this using less power and while running cooler than Intel\u2019s top chips. During the Cinebench 2024 multi-thread test I found that the 9950X3D maxed out at 200 watts of power, compared to 239 watts on Intel\u2019s 285K and a massive 272 watts on the 14900K. The 9950X3D also hit a maximum of 81 degrees Celsius during that same test (cooler than even the 9800X3D), compared to 87C on the 285K and 94C on the 14900K.\n\nAMD has raised the power requirements of the 9950X3D to a 170-watt TDP compared to the 120-watt 7950X3D, but that matches the 170-watt TDP of the 9950X and 7950X, which similarly offer 16-cores for creators but don\u2019t additionally beat Intel in gaming.\n\nThe 9950X3D has 144MB of cache, compared to 104MB on the 9800X3D.\n\nWhy would anyone buy a flagship Intel CPU right now? That\u2019s what I kept thinking throughout my tests. There could be some certain workloads that I haven\u2019t tested where Intel still pulls ahead, or future app optimizations for Intel CPUs that could affect performance, but for the vast majority of creator and gaming tasks AMD is ahead where it counts.\n\nThe only drawback for AMD is pricing. At $699, the 9950X3D is an expensive processor, just like the 7950X3D was when it debuted at the same price in 2023. You can pick up Intel\u2019s 14900K at $499 on Best Buy, or even the latest 285K for $619. There, AMD also has a $599 12-core 9900X3D that should also improve creator performance over its traditionally gaming-focused X3D chips. But if you\u2019re willing to spend extra on a desktop CPU, the 9950X3D is the best on the market, seemingly without any of the performance sacrifices we\u2019ve seen in the past.\n\nAMD used to make you choose between X-series chips for professional workloads, or the X3D versions that dominated in gaming. The 9950X3D removes that awkward choice, with a chip that is great at gaming as well as creator tasks. AMD has well and truly closed the gap on the productivity side to the point it\u2019s easy to recommend the 9950XD as the best CPU, period. If you just want a gaming PC, go for the 9800X3D, but either way AMD is the obvious choice if you want the most powerful CPU for your next PC build.",

            "content": "CCD Clock Balance\n\nI promised I would look at the core clocks between CCD0 (with 3D V-Cache) and CCD1 (without), so here I am to make good on that.\n\nLooking at the Max column in my screenshot, you can see that CCD0 cores (0-7) with the X3D cache had a lower absolute peak clockspeed in my testing, coming out at 5547 MHz. CCD1 cores (8-15) peaked about 175MHz faster at 5722 MHz. This represents a closer match in absolute clock speed between the two CCDs than I have previously seen in the 7950X3D.\n\nHowever, under an all-core workload such as the one where my picture was taken, the situation is actually slightly reversed. Looking at the current clockspeed values when all 16 cores are saturated, the CCD0 cores actually have a slight clockspeed advantage at 5239 MHz compared to the CCD1 cores at 5189 MHz. Is that enough to make a difference? Almost certainly not, but it is good to see much closer raw clockspeed parity between the two CCDs.\n\nPricing\n\nThe Ryzen 9 9900X3D and 9950X3D are slated to go on sale (tomorrow) on March 12th, 2025. The 9900X3D will be $599, and the 9950X3D will be $699, identical to the launch MSRP for the 7900X3D and 7950X3D. When I got wind of the pricing, honestly I was a bit shocked. I had guessed they would be more expensive. Whether chips are actually available at those prices remains to be seen. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D had a launch MSRP of $480, but has proven to be extremely popular and is often sold out on many retailers. When it is available, it often sells for significantly over MSRP. Right now Newegg is selling it for $593 and Amazon for $540.\n\nFinal Words\n\nThe Ryzen 9 9950X3D is AMD\u2019s latest attempt at a CPU that is good at everything. 16 high performance cores for HEDT-light performance in productivity tasks, combined with the 3D V-Cache for gaming prowess.\n\nLike the 7950X3D before it, the 9950X3D is somewhat of a complicated product, especially for gamers, as the heterogenous architecture is less straightforward than its 9800X3D little brother. But aside from that complexity, it is hard to argue that the 9950X3D is anything less than the fastest desktop CPU money can buy.\n\nWith all of this said, if AMD gave us the option to have 3D V-Cache on both CCDs so that we could avoid having one set of lower cache and one set of higher cache cores, I think a lot of folks would be interested.",

But is this discount a buying opportunity or a signal for investors to stay far away from the stock? Let's dig deeper to see what the next three years could have in store.\n\nA natural AI winner\n\nThe launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked a bonanza on Wall Street and Silicon Valley. Analysts at McKinsey projected the new technology could add a whopping $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion to the global economy by augmenting and replacing human labor. And companies rushed to buy generative AI hardware to avoid falling behind.\n\nAMD was well positioned to benefit from this trend. Like its rival, Nvidia, the company creates AI accelerator chips that are used to train and run large language models (LLMs). And while Nvidia dominates the industry with an estimated market share of 70% to 95%, the pie is growing so fast that there is room for many companies to get a slice.\n\nDespite being a clear underdog, AMD has several angles to compete in the hardware opportunity. For starters, companies will be wary about allowing their AI supply chains to become overly dependent on Nvidia because this puts them at risk of shortages or unfavorable pricing. Nvidia's flagship Blackwell chips cost between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit, presenting a good opportunity for AMD to undercut its rival.\n\nThe company also offers an open-source software platform called ROCm, which is designed to compete with Nvidia's CUDA by helping developers program their AMD hardware for AI applications.\n\nStrong operational momentum\n\nThe AI opportunity is having a clear impact on AMD's business. Fourth-quarter revenue jumped 24% to $7.7 billion, which sounds modest. However, the company's data center segment (which handles sales of AI chips) grew by a much more impressive 69% to $3.9 billion, or 51% of total sales. Unlike Nvidia, which earns around 90% of its revenue from its data center segment, AMD remains very diversified into other opportunities, such as CPUs and other types of PC and laptop hardware.\n\nWhile non-AI-related businesses are dragging down AMD's combined top-line growth rate right now, they provide diversification, which could make the company much less vulnerable to a potential slowdown in demand for AI hardware, which is a growing risk for the industry.\n\nIn February, Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella alarmed many by admitting that generative AI hasn't created much value so far. Microsoft has reportedly also canceled some leases for new U.S. data centers, which might be a sign that it is planning to scale back AI-related capital expenditures. Furthermore, the emergence of DeepSeek, which trained a competitive LLM on older, less advanced GPU chips, suggests that companies might not need the latest hardware to stay relevant.\n\nWhere will AMD stock be in three years?\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 22, AMD's shares look undervalued -- especially considering its diversification and exposure to the fast-growing generative AI opportunity. For context, the Nasdaq-100 boasts a forward estimate of 26, while AI industry leader Nvidia trades for 25.\n\nWith that said, there is no guarantee that AMD will post market-beating growth over the next three years. Generative AI remains speculative and largely unprofitable. And there are early signs that big players like Microsoft may be reducing their involvement.

            "content": "Question: How would you feel if you owned AMD stock (NASDAQ:AMD) and it crashed 60%, or even 80%, in the next few months? Sounds extreme? It\u2019s happened before \u2013 and it could happen again. AMD has been struggling this year, down about 18% since January, while the S&P 500 has remained almost flat. The stock has been weighed down by weaker-than-expected growth in the company\u2019s AI accelerator business , the unveiling of China\u2019s new resource-light DeepSeek AI model, which could reduce demand for GPUs, and also due to mounting macroeconomic concerns in the U.S., following President Donald Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs. We believe the stock could fall further to levels as low as $40 per share. Here\u2019s why investors need to be concerned.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: in a downturn, AMD stock could lose considerably. There is evidence from as recently as 2022 that AMD stock lost over 60% of its value in the matter of just a few quarters. So, could AMD\u2019s roughly $100 stock slide to around $40 levels if a repeat of 2022 were to happen? Now, of course, individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio \u2013 and in this environment, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception.\n\nWhy Is It Relevant Now?\n\nWhile the generative AI wave has resulted in surging demand for GPUs, AMD\u2019s AI accelerator business hasn\u2019t been faring as well as expected. Over Q4, AMD\u2019s data center revenue \u2013 seen as a proxy for its AI chip sales \u2013 came in at $3.9 billion, missing consensus estimates. Guidance also didn\u2019t look too good, with the company indicating that data center sales for the current quarter are likely to fall 7% sequentially. There are concerns about the broader AI market as well, as companies could become more conscious about costs after years of outsize investments in AI infrastructure. The launch of the DeepSeek AI model, reduces the need for computing capacity that generative AI models have required thus far. DeepSeek\u2019s model is open source, and it is possible that many big tech companies could take inspiration from its methods to cut down costs. If adopted widely, this could cool off the demand for AI computing power, potentially impacting GPU demand.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s trade war could also hurt companies like AMD. The Trump administration doubled the tariff on goods from China from 10% to 20%, in addition to existing levies. Last month, President Trump also suggested the possibility of a \u201c25% or higher\u201d tariff on all semiconductor chips imported into the United States. Now, AMD outsources a bulk of the fabrication of its chips to Taiwan\u2019s TSMC and import tariffs could make its products more expensive. AMD had gross margins of about 49% over the last year, meaning that the cost of its products \u2013 a bulk of which are likely imported \u2013 is over 50%. This is well ahead of rival Nvidia, which reported an adjusted gross margin of approximately 75.5%, indicating that the cost of its imported products is likely less than 25% of its revenues. This means that tariffs could have a more pronounced impact on AMD, which would need to absorb the additional costs (and potentially hurt margins), or pass them on to customers (and risk losing volumes).\n\nTrump\u2019s bold moves on tariffs and immigration have also stoked fears that inflation could come back. All of this means the U.S. economy could hit a rough spot, and even worse, hit a recession \u2013 our analysis here on the macro picture. When you factor in higher geopolitical uncertainty due to bold moves from the new Trump administration, these are critical risks. After all, the Ukraine- Russia war is still ongoing, trade is uncertain. Tariffs drive up import costs and typically result in price hikes, lower disposable income, and weaker consumer spending. This could hurt AMD\u2019s bread-and-butter CPU business, as customers of PCs and laptops could delay purchases, reducing demand for chips.\n\nHow resilient is AMD stock during a downturn?\n\nAMD stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on AMD stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Advanced Micro Devices Stock Go In A Market Crash? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes.\n\nInflation Shock (2022)\n\n\u2022 AMD stock fell 62.8% from a high of $150.24 on 3 January 2022 to $55.94 on 16 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500\n\n\u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 16 January 2024\n\n\u2022 Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $211.38 on 7 March 2024 and currently trades at around $100\n\nCovid Pandemic (2020)\n\n\u2022 AMD stock fell 34.3% from a high of $58.90 on 19 February 2020 to $38.71 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500\n\n\u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 22 July 2020\n\nGlobal Financial Crisis (2008)\n\n\u2022 AMD stock fell 87.6% from a high of $14.55 on 18 October 2007 to $1.80 on 25 November 2008, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500\n\n\u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 27 February 2017\n\nBut given its extremely high valuation, the stock appears relatively expensive, which supports our conclusion that AMD is a expensive stock to buy.\n\nPremium Valuation\n\nIn summary, it also doesn\u2019t help that AMD stock is still expensive; it trades at almost 30x trailing earnings. Sure, Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 Revenues have grown considerably over recent years, rising at an average rate of 17.8% over the last 3 years (vs. 9.8% for S&P 500). However, this growth could fade quickly if the economy takes a turn for the worse and if tariffs are imposed on AMD\u2019s products.\n\nGiven this growth deceleration and the broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself the question: do you want to hold on to your AMD stock now, will you panic and sell if it starts dropping to $50, $40, or even lower levels? Holding on to a falling stock is never easy.

            "content": "If you decided to hold off on Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs to see if AMD's new offerings were up to snuff, then you made the right choice. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards are the new mid-range champions of this generation. Both cards offer phenomenal performance while undercutting their Nvidia competition in price. They go up for sale on March 6 starting at 6am PST. The Radeon RX 9070 starts at $550 and the 9070 XT starts at $600. Let's just hope that - unlike Nvidia - AMD has its supply under control.\n\nThe jury's out as to whether or not inventory will hold, but given how well positioned these GPUs are in the stack, I wouldn't be surprised if they ended up selling out quickly. I've listed below the best places to pick up one of these cards. The current trend is that if you're set on purchasing a GPU at launch, you don't have the luxury of choosing your brand or model. If you see any in stock at a price you're happy with, buy now and think later.\n\nTLDR; This article assumes, not guarantees, there are actual graphics cards to purchase. You may stumble on this page and find out that every model at every retailer is sold out.\n\nQuick Links: Radeon RX 9070 / 9070 XT Graphics Card Listings\n\nHow much will these new AMD GPUs cost?\n\nOne of the main reasons why these new AMD cards are sure to be popular is the price to performance ratio. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 costs the same as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 yet offers superior performance and more VRAM for the same price. Even more impressively, the Radeon RX 9070 XT trades blows with the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and costs $150 less. We'll see if these suggested retail prices hold, but if they do, the winner is a no-brainer.\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 - $550\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 XT - $600\n\nWhere should I preorder these new AMD GPUs?\n\nThe retailers below are your best chances to score one of the new AMD GPUs. Four of the retailers (Best Buy, Newegg, Amazon, and B&H Photo) will have listings online. One retailer (Micro Center) will only carry them in-store. There's no way to tell exactly how many units are available at each retailer, however a Wccftech article claims that \"AMD and AIBs are reportedly shipping more Radeon RX 9070 XTs than all Nvidia's RTX 50 series GPUs combined.\"\n\nIf you want to maximize your chance of picking up one of the new AMD cards on launch day, your best bet is to check each and every retailer and buy the first card that lets you proceed all the way through checkout. Just remember that potentially thousands of other people will be clicking on the same link as you.\n\nAMD claims \"wide\" availability in this ad... let's hope that's true\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon is the one-stop shop for just about everything, including AMD GPUs. Unfortunately, manually looking for one of these GPUs on Amazon's site is quite difficult. Amazon doesn't have a general page that lists all of the available video cards, and the search results are riddled with postings from marketplace vendors charging outrageous prices or, even worse, trying to swindle unsuspecting shoppers. To make things easier, I'll add specific GPU models when I see them available, but as a rule of thumb, make sure that the vendor you're buying from is \"shipped and sold by Amazon\".\n\nBest Buy\n\nGet the AMD Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT GPUs at Best Buy 3 See it at Best Buy Based on past GPU launches, I suspect that one of your best chances of purchasing the new AMD graphics cards online will be at Best Buy. This retailer should carry every brand that will be available at launch, including Sapphire, XFX, Asus, Asrock, Gigabyte, and Powercolor. Best Buy's available inventory depends on your region; if you're fortunate enough to live in an area where graphics cards in general might not be in high demand, you'll have a much better chance of scoring a GPU here than anywhere else. Also important to note is that Best Buy GPU orders generally ship out quickly since they're either listed as in stock or out of stock (no \"backorders\" here). That means you'll likely receive your card in hand within a week. Newegg\n\nGet the AMD Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT GPUs at Newegg 1 See it at Newegg You'll also definitely want to prioritize Newegg. Like Best Buy, Newegg is expected to carry every make and model of the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT graphics cards. Newegg is an authorized reseller, so as long as you are buying from Newegg direct and not a marketplace vendor, you'll be eligible for the full manufacturer's warranty. Similar to Best Buy, orders usually ship out within the week, unless the product is backordered or out of stock. Even if the standalone cards are sold out, Newegg may sell these AMD GPUs as part of a bundle kit that includes any combination of a motherboard, CPU, RAM, or power supply. If you're working on a DIY computer build and haven't purchased all of your components, this might work to your advantage. These bundle offers do eventually sell out, but at a slower rate than the standalone cards. Micro Center (In-Store)",

Dealing with fakes seems to be part and parcel of being a tech enthusiast nowadays, but luckily Aris from Hardware Busters will very likely get his money back, via the returns process he has now begun on Amazon.de.\n\nThe retail box that the fake Ryzen 7 9800X3D was shipped in was a decent enough copy to pass inspection (the packaging might even have been genuine). Aris Mpitziopoulos, the head honcho at Hardware Busters (and who you may also know for his in-depth power supply reviews here on Tom's Hardware), says that he received the CPU on March 4, but only got around to ripping away the shrink wrap on March 9, due to a hectic schedule.\n\nOnce the box was opened, fakery was immediately apparent. See the side-by-side genuine Ryzen 9000 chip (left) and faked 9800X3D (right) in our gallery, and the coveted X3D chip is obviously a fraud. AMD transitioned to the now-familiar octopus shaped IHS with the advent of the Ryzen 7000 series of desktop processors.\n\nSo, perhaps Aris got an AMD CPU that was a couple of generations old? No. As you can see from the amazing IHS sticker peel image (top) under the sticker was an AMD FX-4100, a 32nm quad-core Bulldozer architecture chip that launched in 2011. Even in its prime, this AMD CPU lagged behind the Intel\u2019s Core i3-2100 in gaming comparison tests we conducted in early 2012.\n\nThe faked 9800X3D also features a completely different package with pins rather than pads, so an unobservant amateur PC DIYer could accidentally kill an expensive motherboard trying to crush this processor in an AM5 socket. That would be a terrible loss, and Aris was thankfully awake when he unboxed the counterfeit processor.\n\nAmazon Sold me a FAKE AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D!! - YouTube Watch On\n\nThere are a few more details about this Amazon.de purchase that are interesting to repeat. Aris says that this 9800X3D was bought new, not used or returned, from Amazon direct, rather than a third-party seller. The sealed packaging seemed genuine to him.\n\nNow Hardware Busters has to deal with the waste of time and inconvenience of receiving this fake 9800X3D. Aris reckons it will take three weeks to be refunded the significant chunk of cash spent on this fake CPU.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

            "content": "An interesting experiment by a YouTuber has shown the potential overclocking benefits of the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT gaming GPU. In a series of tests, an overclocked PowerColor Red Devil RX 9070 XT with undervolting applied showed faster frame rates in Cyberpunk 2077 than an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080, despite being hundreds of dollars cheaper.\n\nThis new AMD GPU is the first card in several years that has seriously challenged Nvidia\u2019s near-total dominance of the market. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT is a powerful and affordable option for many gamers, making it onto our best graphics card shortlist as the best option for most PC gamers.\n\nGerman YouTuber Der8auer put his own RX 9070 XT to the test in a recent video, using the premium PowerColor Red Devil model aimed specifically at enthusiasts. The YouTuber initially began by testing out some fan profile changes, setting the fans at a fixed 49% speed, and pushing the clock speed on the GPU to 3.03GHz.\n\nHowever, after increasing the power limit to around 360W, the card boosted to 3.1GHz, above the RX 9070 XT\u2019s rated 3.06GHz limit. After undervolting the card by 200mV, this figure increased to 3.4GHz, although it only remained stable with an approximate 170mV undervolting mod applied.\n\nThe results of the test are pretty conclusive, however. With a modest increase in clock speed, this particular RX 9070 XT was shown to run with an average 66fps in Cyberpunk 2077 using 4K Ultra settings with no ray tracing. That beats the performance of the RTX 5080 under the same conditions by 1fps, while also placing it higher than the RTX 4080, which could only reach 56fps.\n\nWhile this is a good sign for overclockers, Der8auer warns that, for the moment, overclocking isn\u2019t a hugely stable process on the RX 9070 XT. However, should AMD improve the stability of overclocking for this new AMD Radeon GPU, then it could offer raw performance well above its remit in the mid-tier gaming market. Much will depend on the card you choose to buy, however, with this particular PowerColor Red Devil card using higher quality components.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious to learn more about this new AMD graphics card, don\u2019t forget to check out our RX 9070 XT review, where we put it through its paces in real-world gaming tests.

Presently, the only two graphics cards of AMD's current GPU generation, the RX 9070 XT and 9070, seek the fill the budget space left in the market by Nvidia, as Team Green has pushed the bleeding edge of performance (and prices) up over the years.\n\nWith that said, there's a lot to go over with the RX 9070 XT vs 9070 as RDNA 4 features many important distinctions. While they're both substantially cheaper than some of the best graphics cards made by Nvidia, coming in at the same asking price as the RTX 5070 (no longer competing at the high-end market), there's a lot that will go into your decision of the standard or XT card in 2025.\n\nNeither the RX 9070 XT nor the RX 9070 will expressly rival what the best 4K graphics cards can do, however, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by what RDNA 4 can do from a price-to-performance perspective. We're comparing the two graphics cards based on their price, specs, performance, and more so that you're fully informed whether you're considering an upgrade or debating the switch from Team Green to Team Red.\n\nAMD RX 9070 XT vs RX 9070: Price\n\n(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)\n\nBoth the AMD RX 9070 XT and the RX 9070 were released on March 6, 2025. The former is available from $599 whereas the latter is slightly cheaper at $549.\n\nOn the surface, there's only a $50 price difference between the two, which would make the choice fairly straightforward, however, that's before factoring in the lack of an AMD-made Reference model, meaning it's solely up to AMD's partners to create, distribute, and set the prices for their RDNA 4 graphics cards.\n\nWhile you may be able to find both the RX 9070 XT and the RX 9070 for their respective MSRPs, you're more likely to see graphics cards that are more expensive than the recommended sticker prices depending on whether they are overclocked and feature enhanced cooling solutions. There's no shortage of AIB options, such as those from Asus, Sapphire, PowerColor, and Gigabyte, among others.\n\nWith that said, the RX 9070 is still the cheaper of the two RDNA 4 graphics cards, which brings an even more affordable gaming GPU even when compared to the similarly priced RX 9070 XT. If you can benefit from the lower price, then it's a great value proposition, but if you can't, then you're better off eyeing up the RX 9070 XT for the sake of a $50 difference instead.\n\nWinner: AMD RX 9070\n\nAMD RX 9070 XT vs RX 9070: Specs\n\n(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Header Cell - Column 0 AMD RX 9070 XT AMD RX 9070 % Difference Process Technology TSMC N4P TSMC N4P N/A Transistors (Billion) 53.9 53.9 0% Compute units 64 56 14.2% Shaders 4,096 3,584 14.2% AI/Matrix cores 128 112 14.2% Ray Tracing Cores 64 56 14.2% Render Output Units 64 64 0% Texture Mapping Units 256 224 14.2% Boost Clock (MHz) 2,970 2,540 16.9% Memory type GDDR6 GDDR6 N/A VRAM (GB) 16 16 0% VRAM Bus Width 256-bit 256-bit N/A VRAM Speed (Gbps) 20 20 0% Bandwidth (GB/s) 640 640 0% TDP (watts) 304 220 38.1% PCIe Interface PCIe 5.0 x16 PCIe 5.0 x16 N/A\n\nAs you may expect from the RX 9070 XT vs RX 9070, given the $50 difference, the two graphics cards are remarkably similar in many ways.\n\nThey are both midrange offerings in the market, featuring 16GB GDDR6 memory with a 256-bit memory bus and 20 Gbps effective memory, and they are PCIe 5.0 compliant.\n\nHowever, where the former excels is in its larger amount of Compute Units, Shaders, and AI cores by around 14%, which means a theoretical performance potential difference of about 10% depending on the software in question.\n\nThe RX 9070 XT can also be pushed 17% more with its near-3,000 MHz clock speed against the 9070's just over 2,500 MHz boost clock.\n\nHowever, the added boost in power potential means the total thermal power draw is significantly higher in the more expensive card by an unsubtle 38%, from 220W up to 304W.\n\nThis could be a make-or-break feature if you have a smaller PSU inside your machine and don't want to upgrade it alongside the GPU, so that's something to keep in mind.\n\nWinner: RX 9070 XT\n\nAMD RX 9070 XT vs 9070: Performance\n\n(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)\n\nWhile there's only a $50 difference between the RX 9070 XT and 9070, paired with incredibly similar hardware under the hood, the performance disparity of both graphics cards shows what that extra gear can do.\n\nStarting with the synthetic benchmarks, the RX 9070 XT confidently pulls ahead in benchmarking tools such as GeekBench 6 Compute (OpenGL and Vulcan) with respective scores of 178,857 and 210,051 compared to 150,919 and 192,027 (differences of 18.5% and 9.3%). Similarly, many 3DMark benchmarks, including Time Spy and Fire Strike, feature a 10-15% improvement when contrasted directly.\n\nLooking at how both RDNA 4 graphics cards handle creative workloads, it's neck-and-neck for the most part.\n\nA slight gap in favor of the non-XT model can be seen in PugetBench for Adobe Premiere with figures of 14,306, in contrast to 13,615 (an increase of 5%). The XT card is slightly better at Blender, but neither card is great for this workload compared to a comparable Nvidia card in this class.\n\nThe two GPUs have respective strengths and weaknesses, where you may be better with the standard model if you're doing more creativity-focused tasks instead of purely gaming.\n\nThe RX 9070 is (arguably) more at home when used for gaming in 1440p instead of 2160p, as our testing indicates. For example, Cyberpunk 2077 in Ultra settings was no problem for the RDNA 4 GPU at 113fps averages, nor was Black Myth: Wukong at 70fps averages.\n\nThere are diminishing returns between the two graphics cards depending on the game in this target resolution, with near-identical figures in Civilization VII (208 versus 202fps) and comparable numbers in Dying Light 2 with ray tracing enabled. If 4K is the way you want to play, splash the cash for the XT; if 1440p is more your speed, you may get away with saving that money.\n\nAll of the marketing around the RX 9070 XT promises \"Native 4K Ultra\" so that's the main resolution we'll be looking at with our in-house benchmarks. The graphics cards delivered 63fps averages in Black Myth: Wukong with 50% upscaling in Cinematic, whereas the cheaper RX 9070 only hit 55fps averages (a difference of 16.3%).\n\nThe same can be said of Cyberpunk 2077 in Ultra settings, of which the 9070 XT averaged 61fps, but the 9070 standard couldn't hit the mark at just 53fps (15% improvement). However, that's not to say the latter card necessarily struggles; it ran Civilization VII on max settings at over 128fps, with Dying Light 2 at 79fps as well.\n\nWinner: AMD RX 9070 XT\n\nAMD RX 9070 XT vs RX 9070: Verdict\n\nWhile the RX 9070 XT and 9070 are incredibly similar, they have slightly different use cases and are priced accordingly. For the extra 4K power, you're going to want to spend the additional $50 (or so) for the XT variant as it's genuinely capable of 4K60 and above.\n\nHowever, if you're only interested in 1440p gaming, then you won't really benefit from the increase in shaders, compute units, and the higher boost clock speed in terms of real-world potential.\n\nUltimately, deciding on the two RDNA 4 cards is going to depend on the sticker price in your region. AMD has promised \"wide availability\" in direct response to Nvidia's lacking RTX 50 series rollout since January 2025.\n\nAs such, finding the two at MSRP, for the sake of $50, you may as well get the faster card, but if there's a much larger gap in price between the two, then the non-XT model holds up remarkably well.",

As you may be aware, AMD is going to launch the Ryzen 9 9900X3D and Ryzen 9 9950X3D on 12th March at $599 and $699 respectively.\n\nThe Ryzen 9 9950X3D is the fastest in the lineup, featuring 16 cores and 32 threads with base and boost clocks of 4.3 and 5.7 GHz respectively. This is also the first X3D CPU to boast 170W of TDP, making it as power-hungry and powerful as the Ryzen 9 9950X. The processor was tested ahead of launch on the PassMark platform, which revealed that the processor is noticeably faster than its predecessor, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D.\n\nImage Source: PassMark\n\nIn the single-thread test, it scored 4739 points, and 69701 points in the multi-threaded test. Since there are only three tests conducted on this processor at the moment, the final scores may vary by a small margin when more tests are conducted later. Right now, the Ryzen 9950X3D is 14.1% ahead of the 7950X3D in single-core and about 11.5% in multi-threaded tests. This is a solid uplift and is also somewhat better than its non-X3D counterpart, at least for the multi-threaded test.\n\nImage Source: PassMark\n\nThe 9950X scored about 66363 points (roughly 5% lower than the 9950X3D) but is on par with the 9950X3D in single-core prowess. Compared to the flagship Intel Core Ultra 9 285K processor, it is about 3% faster in multi-core and 7% slower in single-core tests. Overall, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D comes as strong as the non-X3D variant but will be convincingly superior in gaming and select applications.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D is also overclockable and, with a better design than its predecessors, it offers better thermal performance. Keep in mind that the PassMark scores don't always translate to exact performance in real-world applications but are a good way of measuring a CPU's potential against its competitors. The review embargo is about to lift on both the 9900X3D and 9950X3D processors, and we will see how these perform in intensive CPU applications as well as in gaming, compared to the Ryzen 7 9800X3D.\n\nNews Source: @x86deadandblack",

According to the company,1 the primary endpoint is non-inferiority in the mean change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 52 weeks. The secondary endpoint is treatment burden reduction, comparing the number of aflibercept injections received in the 4D-150 arm versus the aflibercept comparator arm over 52 weeks. The trial will be evaluating treatment-na\u00efve wet AMD patients at sites in North America.\n\nDavid Kirn, MD, co-founder and CEO of 4DMT, commented on 4D-150 and the trial design in a press release from the company.1\n\n\u201cWe believe the design of the 4FRONT Phase 3 trials, the design of 4D-150 itself, and the compelling clinical data generated to date position us for a successful product approval and commercialization,\u201d said Kirn. \u201cAs a result of our innovation, 4D-150 has the potential to become the established durable backbone therapy for these diseases and to fit seamlessly into clinical practice and economic models for retina physicians.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the company announced its phase 3 4FRONT-2 trial for wet AMD, which has an identical design to 4FRONT-1 but will evaluate 4D-150 in both treatment-na\u00efve and recently diagnosed, treatment-experienced wet AMD patients globally. 4FRONT-2 is expected to initiate in Q3 2025.\n\n4D-150 is a potential backbone therapy that is designed to provide multi-year sustained delivery of anti-VEGF (aflibercept and anti-VEGF-C) from the retina with a single, safe, intravitreal injection. 4D-150 utilizes a customized and evolved intravitreal vector from 4DMT, R100, which was invented by the company through their proprietary Therapeutic Vector Evolution platform.\n\nArshad M. Khanani, MD, MA, FASRS, chair of the 4DMT Ophthalmology Advisory Board and a principal investigator of the 4FRONT-1 clinical trial commented on the trial in a press release from the company.1\n\n\"As an investigator in the PRISM Phase 1/2 study with 4D-150, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to see firsthand its potential to alter the course of the disease and reduce the treatment burden for patients with wet AMD,\" said Khanani. \"I\u2019m thrilled to participate in the 4FRONT-1 trial and look forward to collaborating with the dedicated team at 4DMT and my fellow investigators to potentially bring 4D-150 to patients with wet AMD, with the chance to make a lasting difference in their lives.\"\n\nTopline primary endpoint data from both 4FRONT-1 and 4FRONT-2 is expected in the second half of 2027.1\n\nReference:",

Premium processors for gamers will also feature 3D V-Cache.\n\nAMD's next-generation Ryzen processors based on the Zen 6 microarchitecture will feature 12-core core chiplet dies (CCDs), marking a major shift from eight-core CCDs used in Zen 3/4/5 generation processors, if the linked reports are accurate. As a result, desktop AM5 processors will be able to feature up to 24 cores. Meanwhile, advanced laptop APUs will transition from a four Zen 5 eight Zen 5c (8+4) configuration to a 12-core structure, at least according to MLID. A Zen 6 CCD is 75mm^2 large, MLID claims.\n\nNow, the increased number of cores is a big deal. However, premium versions of AMD's desktop processors will feature up to 96MB of L3 cache, which is 4MB per core. 4MB per core is in line with existing Zen 5 configurations, so AMD does not cut down caches in favor of core count.\n\nAMD is expected to release Zen 6-based products in 2026, so it is reasonable to expect them to use a more advanced node than they use today (TSMC's 4nm-class), so think TSMC's N3P (3nm-class) given that AMD does exactly use leading-edge nodes (possibly due to supply constraints), which will be N2 (2nm-class) next year.\n\nAMD's Zen 6-based Ryzens for gaming PCs will also feature 3D V-Cache. Some laptop processors with built-in graphics will also feature 3D V-Cache, though exact configuration is something that remains to be seen.\n\nAMD Medusa Point and Medusa Ridge\n\nInterestingly, and according to MLID, AMD's standard APUs will be chiplet-based, moving away from the monolithic approach. Medusa Point \u2014 a laptop APU \u2014 is expected to feature a Zen 6 CCD with 12 cores and a 200mm^2 I/O die (IOD), featuring eight RDNA work groups, a 128-bit memory controller, and a large NPU. There is speculation that Infinity Cache may be added to enhance GPU performance.\n\nMLID also claims that the desktop version of Medusa Point \u2014 allegedly called Medusa Ridge \u2014 will use up to two 12-core Zen 6 CCD in the AM5 form-factor. That product will have a 155mm^2 IOD without an advanced built-in GPU, but possibly with a large NPU.",

One notable feature in this late pull request is introducing a new \"high precision\" mode to be found with the GFX950 target, which is believed to be the upcoming Instinct MI350X series.In prior weeks there have been AMDGPU/AMDKFD pull requests preparing more graphics driver features and new GPU support for introduction in Linux 6.15. Friday's latest pull request was mostly about landing a number of fixes but there is also some minor feature work.This newest pull brings VCN 5.0.1 IP updates, DCN 4.0.1 display fixes, SMU 14 fixes, SR-IOV fixes, RDNA4 / GFX12 DCC fixes, and even a HyperZ fix for old ATI RS400 graphics.New on the feature side though is a new per-process flag for setting desired precision. The AMDKFD kernel compute driver sees the ability added to handle per-process flags and is followed by the ability for user-space to set desired precision beginning with GFX950.\n\nGFX950 is the next iteration of AMD's CDNA compute architecture. Given the timing and all things considered, GFX950 is believed to be the Instinct MI350X series. The Instinct MI350 series is expected to launch this calendar year and there's been a lot of open-source Linux driver activity continuing around the GFX950 CDNA target.\n\nWhat this new precision mode handling is with Linux 6.15 allows setting a new \"HIGH_PRECISION\" mode for the Matrix Fused Multiply Add (MFMA) instructions on the AMD matrix cores. With Linux 6.15+ and when also running the next versions of the ROCm compute stack, ROCm will pass on the new \"HSA_HIGH_PRECISION_MODE\" environment variable when set for enabling the high precision math mode. This MFMA high precision mode is only implemented with GFX950 and the HSA_HIGH_PRECISION_MODE control having no impact for other GPUs.The AMDKFD kernel driver patches and ROCm patches don't shed any further light on this high precision MFMA mode with upcoming GFX950 / Instinct MI350X hardware. AMD Matrix Cores already support FP64 / FP32 / FP16 / BF16 / INT8 data formats.This latest set of AMDGPU/AMDKFD feature patches intended for the upcoming Linux 6.15 merge window can be found via this pull request",

The leak showed that the GPU will feature either 8 GB GDDR6 VRAM capacity or 16 GB, similar to what has been reported about the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti.\n\nThe EEC website revealed the memory configurations on Acer RX 9060 XT GPUs and today, Videocardz received more information, confirming that the GPU is indeed receiving two variants. Both the variants will utilize a 128-bit memory bus and their memories will run at 20 Gbps. This will result in equal memory bandwidth, but the 16 GB edition will have a big advantage in modern VRAM-hungry titles.\n\nMoreover, the RX 9060 XT is said to feature a single 8-pin power connector, which is why the report says it requires a 500W capacity power supply. This means the TDP of the RX 9060 is up to 225W or lower, which may or may not be higher than the 190W of the TDP of the RX 7600 XT. The custom variants will also feature an 8-pin power connector, but of course, some of them will come factory-overclocked, increasing the power consumption, particularly when overclocked.\n\nThe RX 9060 XT is supposedly going to utilize the Navi 44 GPU die and will take on the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti. The latter will also come with two VRAM variants but will feature faster GDDR7 memory. As far as connectivity goes, the leaked specs reveal that the RX 9060 XT features 1x HDMI 2.1, and 2x DP 2.1 ports.\n\nComing to the VRAM configurations, it is a surprise considering AMD released the RX 7600 XT, especially catering to the demands of modern gaming. The RX 7600 was limited to 8 GB VRAM and so would the RX 9060. However, AMD might be making a big mistake here, as 8 GB throttles performance to a great extent and if the GPU is priced over $300, it wouldn't make any sense when the RX 7600 XT was launched at $329.\n\nMore detailed specs are yet to be unveiled, and then we will likely have the RX 9050 GPU later, which was recently spotted on a Mexican retailer.",

            "content": "AMD's latest additions to its Zen 5 stack include the 16-core Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 12-core 9900X3D, set to launch on March 12. Just days before the retail embargo, a handful of Ryzen 9 9950X3D samples appear to have been tested in PassMark, a benchmarking utility (via x86deadandback on X). Based on the first few sets of runs, the 9950X3D keeps pace with its non-X3D counterpart in single-threaded performance, while landing solid wins against its last-gen counterpart in PassMark. Remember that these benchmarks may not accurately reflect the CPU's performance in all real-world applications.\n\nComing in at $699, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D retains its predecessor's specifications with a 16-core and 32-thread layout. All Ryzen 9000X3D chips integrate the 2nd generation of AMD's V-Cache technology, under which the SRAM block is placed below the heat-producing CCDs for more thermal headroom. This is reflected through the elevated clock speeds and higher power limits, with the 9950X3D rated at 170W.\n\nThe cache configuration hasn't changed much with Zen 5 so you still get 144MB (9950X3D) and 140MB (9900X3D) of total cache on both chips. AMD claims the 9950X3D is 20% faster than Intel's flagship Core Ultra 9 285K and 8% faster than the last-gen Ryzen 9 7950X3D in 1080p gaming. It's best to wait for third-party results for a clearer picture.\n\nIn single-threaded performance, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D beats its predecessor by around 14%. Previously, the inclusion of an SRAM block limited the boost clocks and TDP of AMD's X3D processors. Since single-core benchmarks heavily depend on frequency along with other variables, there was a certain gap between a given CPU and its X3D equivalent. AMD has seemingly narrowed this gap to a great extent, as these benchmarks reveal no difference between the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and the 9950X.\n\nCPU Mark, which is a proprietary set of benchmarks used to gauge a processor's performance, sees the Ryzen 9 9950X3D lead the pack, boasting an 11% lead against the Ryzen 9 7950X3D. From the looks of it, CPU Mark can leverage the extra L3 cache, as a result of which the 9950X3D ends up 5% ahead of the 9950X. This ability to extract more performance from added cache is not code-agnostic, so don't expect a similar outcome in every scenario.\n\nThe Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D are set to hit shelves starting March 12, at $699 and $599 respectively. While AMD hasn't promised widespread availability, expanding the X3D lineup should help alleviate supply constraints on the popular Ryzen 7 9800X3D.",

(NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other stocks that will go to the moon according to Reddit.\n\nSaira Malik, Nuveen\u2019s Head of Equities and Fixed Income, recently joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Closing Bell\u2019 on February 18 to discuss opportunities outside the tech sector and her outlook for the markets. She began by addressing the two primary factors driving markets this year: technology and tariffs. Malik highlighted that while tech stocks have dominated the narrative, recent developments, such as DeepSeek\u2019s announcement, have raised concerns about the immense spending in AI and the uncertainty surrounding its monetization and returns. Malik emphasized looking beyond tech to areas like infrastructure. She mentioned utility companies as a promising investment. When asked about momentum stocks, Malik explained that the momentum trade has propelled markets over the past few years, with the S&P 500 delivering over 20% annual gains during that period. However, this growth was largely concentrated in the MAG7, which resulted in an S&P 500 valuation premium of 20% above historical averages entering this year. She noted that the momentum trade is now unwinding, partly due to inflated expectations around AI and the lack of productivity gains despite tens of billions of dollars spent in the space.\n\nMalik pointed out that international markets are outperforming US markets this year. European markets, in particular, entered 2025 with a 40% valuation discount compared to US markets and have a more cyclical bias. She stated that year-to-date returns suggest investors would benefit from owning international equities. While she expects the S&P 500 to post about 7% earnings growth for 2025 (following a strong Q4 with 12% year-over-year earnings growth), she believes international markets may continue to outperform due to their discounted valuations and cyclical exposure. Malik concluded by emphasizing the importance of being selective in this market environment. She recommended focusing on smaller mid-cap companies with profits, lower leverage, reduced refinancing risks, or economic sensitivity. Sectors like financials could thrive if deregulation or increased mergers and acquisitions activity materialize. She advised investing in stocks with upward earnings estimate revisions rather than those facing downward adjustments to capitalize on current market conditions.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe first sifted through threads and posts on WSB and similar subreddits to compile a list of the top trending stocks among retail investors. We then selected the 11 stocks that analysts were bullish on and had an average upside potential over 40% as of March 3. We also added the hedge fund sentiment for each stock, as of Q4 2024, which was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.

            "content": "AMD's next-generation Ryzen CPUs based on the Zen 6 core \"Medusa Ridge\" architecture will pack increased core and cache counts.\n\nAMD Zen 6 \"Medusa Ridge\" Line of Ryzen CPUs To Pack Increased Core & Cache Counts\n\nIt looks like we finally have some new information on the core and cache counts of the next-gen Zen 6-based Ryzen offerings. The company has already announced the continuation of its high-performance journey with new Zen 6 and Zen 6C cores, which will be heading out to server, laptop, and desktop platforms. These CPUs are also expected to land on the same AM5 socket, which will be great for those who have invested in the latest motherboards.\n\nPreviously, it was reported that AMD's Zen 6 CPUs would come in CCD configurations ranging from 8, 16 and up to 32 cores. This alone would mark a doubling of the max core count versus existing Zen lineups, but it looks like Chiphell's forum member and credible insider, Zhangzhonghao, is back with some new information regarding the cache count and core configurations that we can expect.\n\nImage Source: Chiphell Forums\n\nBased on his latest post, it looks like the AMD Ryzen \"Zen 6\" CPUs, which are codenamed under the \"Medusa Ridge\" series, will come in 12, 24 and 32 core parts. The user reported that the 12 and 24 core variants will feature a 96 MB cache, while the maximum cache will be 128 MB. It is hard to go by these numbers alone, so another user followed up with his thinking about the figures and the OP responded with an affirmative.\n\nThe user states that the 12-core Zen 6 CCD will feature a 48 MB L3 cache while the 32-core variant will pack a 128 MB L3 cache. The 32-core variant will come with Zen 6C cores instead of the vanilla Zen 6 cores. It is also said that Desktop Non-X3D CPUs will feature two 48 MB L3 cache clusters or 48 MB per CCD, which will round up to 96 MB. So, for easier explanation, we get something like the following:\n\nSingle Zen 6 CCD - 48 MB L3 Cache\n\n48 MB L3 Cache Dual Zen 6 CCDs - 96 MB L3 Cache\n\n96 MB L3 Cache Single Zen 6C CCD - 64 MB L3 Cache\n\n64 MB L3 Cache Dual Zen 6C CCDs - 128 MB L3 Cache\n\nThe standard AMD Zen 6 CCDs will offer a 50% increase in cache count over the Zen 5 cores, while the Zen 6C CCDs will offer double the cache count uplift versus Zen 5. Also, these are all non-X3D parts, so we can expect even higher caches with those models. AMD has already leveraged its 2nd Generation 3D V-Cache in Ryzen 9000 \"Zen 5\" CPUs so next-gen Ryzen can further boost the cache counts and even bring forth dual-X3D variants if there's a need for it though the company says that it all comes down to economics and the reason they haven't done dual X3D caches is not due to technical limitations.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 9000 and Ryzen 9000X3D CPUs are phenomenal solutions already, offering top-notch gaming and content creation performance with superior efficiency versus the Intel offerings. AMD is soon going to introduce its higher-end Ryzen 9000X3D CPUs, which will further take its lead, so we can expect AMD to continue pushing forward the high-end desktop momentum to new heights in the coming years.\n\nAMD Desktop Socket Families:",

The RDNA 4-powered graphics card is the second best-selling GPU on Amazon and has taken the first spot in Amazon Germany and Amazon UK. Remember that these standings are dynamic and are subject to change as consumers purchase more units of one graphics card than the other.\n\nDespite the supply issues with the GeForce RTX 50-series GPUs, the RTX 5070 Ti has remained on top of Amazon's best-selling list. The MSI GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16G Ventus 3X OC, launched at $829.99, appears to be the most popular model. The Asus TUF Gaming Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition is in second place.\n\nAmazon Germany lists the XFX Swift Radeon RX 9070 OC White as its best-selling GPU, despite being listed for \u20ac929.99 \u2014 this is way above its $549 MSRP (around \u20ac506), even if you include taxes. On the other hand, the U.K.\u2019s top bestseller is the Gigabyte Radeon RX 9070 XT Gaming OC, which is already unavailable at the time of this article.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nDespite seemingly launching with more stock than Nvidia and Intel, AMD\u2019s RX 9070 series GPUs quickly ran out within a few hours of its launch. Scalpers are now selling them for more than twice the MSRP, and it\u2019s apparent that people still buy these mid-range cards despite scalpers selling them at high-end prices. While we expect that some 9070 models will be sold at a premium, AMD\u2019s Frank Azor said that multiple cards from AIB partners will be sold at MSRP prices. However, the prices we see feel unreasonable, even for a more premium offering, especially as they now stray into RTX 5080 territory.\n\nHopefully, AMD will deliver more supplies in the coming weeks and help normalize the market. The GPU market has been fraught with shortages during the past few months. Intel launched its highly acclaimed Intel Arc B580 GPU late last year, but the graphics card stock is still hard to come by, even if you know where to buy it. Nvidia admitted a shortage of RTX 50-series GPUs, affecting everything from the RTX 5090 to its most affordable RTX 5070.\n\nAt the moment, we\u2019re unsure if AMD\u2019s shortage is temporary, having been caused by the pent-up demand for new GPUs caused by the wider community\u2019s frustration with Nvidia and Intel. This is a big opportunity for Team Red, allowing it to claw back some market share from Nvidia, which has long dominated the gaming GPU market. We will know in the next few weeks if AMD can cope with the situation and produce enough cards to cover its competitors' shortfall.",

It can be compiled for Windows 10+ only, and requires a GPU that supports Direct3D 12 and DXR 1.1.\n\nCompiling from source requires Visual Studio 2019+ and CMake 3.10+. Find instructions here.\n\nRead more about the new features in Capsaicin 1.2 on AMD\u2019s blog\n\nRead more about the Capsaicin framework on AMD\u2019s GPU Open website\n\n\n\nHave your say on this story by following CG Channel on Facebook, Instagram and X (formerly Twitter).

AMD has announced when its next two Zen 5 desktop chips with 3D V-Cache\u2014the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D\u2014will release to retail and how much they will cost. In keeping with its promise to release both chips in the first quarter of 2025 (which it announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this year), both processors will be available on(next Wednesday).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for pricing, the flagship Ryzen 9 9950X3D carries a $699 MSRP while the Ryzen 9 9900X3D is officially priced at $599.\n\n\n\n\n\nRyzen 7 9800X3D, which debuted at $479 and remains at the price, if you can find it in stock\u2014it's currently listed for They follow the retail launch of AMD's, which debuted atand remains at the price, if you can find it in stock\u2014it's currently listed for $549.99 at Amazon , but that's by way of a marketplace seller, and it's sold out at Best Buy and even AMD's own webstore.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's not super surprising, given the combination of AMD's more-than-capable Zen 5 architecture and gaming-friendly 3D V-Cache. In our Ryzen 7 9800X3D review , we called it an ideal CPU for PC gamers, and buyers seem to be in agreement\u2014it ranks high on Amazon's list of best selling CPUs (number three, at the time of this writing).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've already covered the unveiling of both new additions, but to quickly recap, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D offer higher core and thread counts, and bigger piles of cache. For the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, that translates into 16 cores and 32 threads clocked at 4.3GHz (base) to 5.7GHz (max boost), along with 128MB of L3 cache and 144MB of total cache (L3 + L2).\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Ryzen 9 9900X3D is a 12-core/24-thread chip with a 4.4GHz base clock, up to a 5.5GHz boost clock, the same 128MB of L3 cache, and 140MB of total cache.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor comparison, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is an 8-core/16-thread processor with a 4.7GHz base clock, up to a 5.2GHz boost clock, 96MB of L3 cache, and 104MB of total cache.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also worth reiterating that all of these chips employ AMD's second-generation 3D V-Cache. Unlike previous generation designs, for the Ryzen 9000X3D series, AMD relocated the 3D V-Cache to below the processor. The reason this matters is because shifts the core complex die (CCD) closer to the cooler, which in turn enabled AMD to crank the clocks and support overclocking.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the newest parts fare is something we'll dive into in our upcoming review coverage of both chips. So, stay tuned.",

            "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 4.17%) has been one of the worst stocks to own over the past year. While investors were excited about AMD potentially taking market share from rival Nvidia in the all-important data center market, that hasn't manifested. Furthermore, the rest of AMD's business has been rather ho-hum, which has caused the stock to decline over the past year.\n\nSince peaking last March, the stock is down over 50%, while most other stocks in the market are up. If you had invested in Nvidia, on the other hand, you'd be up over 50%. That's a huge mismatch in performance, but is it possible for AMD to turn it around? After all, a 50% decline could be a huge opportunity to profit from a turnaround play.\n\nAMD is losing ground to Nvidia in the data center sector\n\nWhile Nvidia focuses on one thing, graphics processing units (GPUs), AMD is much broader. It has offerings comparable to Nvidia's, but they haven't taken off in the data center market, and AMD continually underperforms Nvidia in this segment. The thesis last year was that AMD could take market share away from Nvidia as the focus in AI turned from training to inference, but that takeover never manifested.\n\nIn AMD's fiscal fourth quarter (ended Dec. 28), data center revenue rose 69% year over year to $3.86 billion. While that sounds like strong performance, it pales in comparison to what Nvidia did. Nvidia's data center division grew revenue at a 93% pace to $35.6 billion during its fiscal Q4 (ended Jan. 26) -- nearly 10 times that of AMD.\n\nThis part of AMD's investment thesis was clearly wrong, and it is a primary factor in the stock's downturn. However, AMD's other segments haven't helped out much either.\n\nClient revenue was its lone strong point, rising 58% year over year. This accounts for all of the CPUs and GPUs that AMD makes for laptops and PCs purchased by the general consumer. This is still an important market, but there is only so much money to make in a sector that has become fairly commoditized, as there isn't a massive performance boost going from one provider to another.\n\nThe rest of AMD's results were poor. Gaming revenue (GPUs dedicated to PC and console gaming) fell 59% year over year, and embedded processors (chips designed for specific, energy-efficient purposes) were down 13%.\n\nOverall, AMD's revenue growth was up 24% year over year, which isn't bad. However, expectations were far higher than that, which is why the stock is so unpopular with Wall Street right now.\n\nAMD's valuation looks attractive at these levels\n\nAMD has had some odd one-time charges hit its books over the past year, so using the trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio doesn't give investors much insight into the company. Instead, I'll use the forward P/E ratio, as it doesn't include these one-off charges that are difficult to project. From this standpoint, AMD's valuation has significantly decreased over the past year.\n\nAt 21.2 times forward earnings, AMD looks like a fairly cheap stock, and it is. Considering that the broader market (measured by the S&P 500) trades for 21.6 times forward earnings, it's priced at about a market average.\n\nHowever, Wall Street expects 23% revenue growth in 2025 and 21% in 2026, so it's clear that AMD could grow much faster than the broader market yet it trades at a discount. This disconnect is a perfect buying opportunity for investors, and although AMD won't be able to catch up to Nvidia, it still has a strong business in its own right.\n\nIf you remove the comparison, I think there's enough value here that AMD could be a strong stock pick and recover throughout the rest of 2025 to a more reasonable valuation level for the growth it's putting up.",

At 1080p, it\u2019s 6% to 15% better, with most cases around 9% to 11% for the games we tested.\n\nAs for the RTX 5070, it\u2019s not looking good for NVIDIA\u2019s card you shouldn\u2019t buy: At 4K and rasterized, the 9070 leads the 5070 by 0% to 18%, depending on game. It has one loss in Final Fantasy and it has losses in some ray tracing tests, but not all of them, which is interesting.\n\nThe 5070 is basically out of the conversation, so we\u2019re left with the 9070 XT or the 9070 at this price point -- which is what AMD probably wants, because the 9070 is priced in a way that the 9070 XT becomes an easy upsell. That might be to do with yields. If they\u2019re yielding enough XTs that they don\u2019t really want to sell non-XTs, maybe that\u2019s the strategy.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to spend much time on the specs and architecture today. We\u2019re also going to speedrun the charts and shorten the comparisons. If you want the full depth, check out our 9070 XT review. That contains some more discussion of results and some more architectural information. Our news video about the 9070 series has even more architecture background than that.\n\nAMD RX 9070 Overview & Specs\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RX 9070 has 56 Compute Units, with the 9070 XT running 64 CUs. Both are 16 GB cards with GDDR6 on a 256-bit bus. The GPUs have slightly different clocks. Both GPUs get the architectural overhauls of RDNA 4 and there\u2019s no difference there, so the same ray tracing changes apply to the 9070 as the XT. The only real main difference is the move to 56 CUs.\n\nAnd that\u2019s sort of it.\n\nWe\u2019ll save the pricing recap for post-launch -- we want to monitor launch for the next day or two to get an idea of availability of both the 5070 and 9070 series, plus the pricing they land at.\n\nLet\u2019s just get straight into the data.\n\nRX 9070 Game Benchmarks\n\nOur fully custom 3D Emblem Glasses celebrate our 15th Anniversary! We hand-assemble these on the East Coast in the US with a metal badge, strong adhesive, and high-quality pint glass. They pair excellently with our 3D 'Debug' Drink Coasters. Purchases keep us ad-free and directly support our consumer-focused reviews!\n\nDragon\u2019s Dogma 2 - 4K\n\nDragon\u2019s Dogma 2 is up first and at 4K initially.\n\nIn this test, the RX 9070 non-XT ran at 64 FPS AVG, with lows at 54 and 53. The 9070 XT\u2019s 70 FPS result positions it 9% ahead, which is exactly how much higher the base MSRP is.\n\nAgainst the equivalently priced RTX 5070, this is one of AMD\u2019s stronger titles: The 9070 Pulse leads the 5070 FE\u2019s 56 FPS AVG by 14% here, with 1% and 0.1% lows improved in-step with the average. The 9070 is achieving 87% of the performance of the 5070 Ti, but at 73% of the base MSRP.\n\nThe RX 9070 leads the RX 7800 XT (watch our review) by 37% here as well. We\u2019ll look at the 6700 XT elsewhere.\n\nDragon\u2019s Dogma 2 - 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the RX 9070 ran at 106 FPS AVG, with the 9070 XT leading it at 116 FPS (or 9.3%). The 5070 Ti is only a few FPS higher than the 9070 XT, with the 4080 Super (read our review) just beyond that. In short, the 9070 is achieving 88% of the 4080 Super\u2019s performance, which was a $1,000 card, but at 55% of the original MSRP. Despite our wishes that the 9070 were $50 cheaper, this at least helps to slowly reset the runaway pricing that NVIDIA set in motion. This gives everyone some perspective.\n\nFor some comparisons against prior generations: The 9070 improves on the 67 FPS result of the 7700 XT (watch our review) by 59%, the 53 FPS result of the 6700 XT by 100%, and the 42 FPS of the 6600 XT by 152%.\n\nDragon\u2019s Dogma 2 - 1080p\n\nHere\u2019s 1080p. The old GTX 1060 and 1070 also appear on this chart to give some insight into upgrades, though anything modern would be better. There\u2019s no point getting into percentages for those: They go from unplayable to playable.\n\nThe RX 9070 is about tied with the RX 7900 XT. The 9070 XT still leads by around 8%, with the 5070 Ti (read our review) ahead of the 9070 by 13%. The 9070 leads the RTX 5070 DOA edition by 6%. The lead over the 6700 XT is 96%, with the improvement on the 6600 non-XT\u2019s 49 FPS result at 173%.\n\nFFXIV 4K\n\nFinal Fantasy 14: Dawntrail is up now. We included this same disclaimer and disclosure in our RX 9070 XT review, but to recap: We\u2019ve noticed lower performance for the 9070 series specifically in Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail, including lower results than AMD\u2019s own claims. We\u2019ve had highly reliable results in this benchmark and our RX 9070 series data has been repeatable across multiple retests, so we\u2019re publishing it, but we just want to highlight that there is disproportionately low performance for the 9070s and that it is something we\u2019re investigating. It\u2019s possible it could be the specific scene, benchmark version, or just the architecture\u2019s behavior here. But the results are repeatable, so we\u2019re running them.\n\nAt 4K, the RX 9070 continues the scaling pattern set by the 9070 XT. The XT is again 9% ahead.\n\nThe 5070 FE leads both of the cards in this test, running at 78 FPS AVG and improving upon the 9070\u2019s result of 63 FPS by 24%. Against the prior generation, the 9070 XT sees a smaller improvement on the 6700 XT of 53%.\n\nFFXIV 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the 9070 ran at 126 FPS AVG. The 9070 XT is 10% ahead here, with the 5070 ahead by 21%. Improvement over last generation is non-existent, with the 7800 XT right next to the 9070.\n\nResident Evil 4 - 4K\n\nResident Evil 4 is up next, tested at 4K first.\n\nThe 9070 ran at 91 FPS AVG here, creating a 13% lead for the 9070 XT and its 103 FPS result. The 9070 XT was excitingly right next to the 4080 Super\u2019s 105 FPS in this game, meaning that the same $1,000 4080 Super result leads the $550 MSRP 9070 by only 16%. That\u2019s a paltry gain for such a huge price difference, especially given how new the 4080 Super is.\n\nAMD\u2019s 9070 exceeds the performance of the same-MSRP RTX 5070\u2019s 78 FPS by 16%. If NVIDIA would stop remaking 4070 Supers (read our review) and 4080s, they might actually make some progress here.\n\nResident Evil 4 - 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the RX 9070 ran at 172 FPS AVG and outperformed the 3090 Ti.\n\nThe 9070 XT outperforms the 9070 by 13%, with the 5070 Ti only slightly beyond that result.\n\nAgainst the 5070\u2019s 152 FPS AVG, the 9070 runs 13% ahead. The 5070 really does look even more DOA than previously in some of these tests. If it were a dead horse, it\u2019d be getting kicked right now.\n\nResident Evil 4 - 1080p\n\n1080p is up now. The 9070 ran at 247 FPS AVG here, which had it between the 4070 Ti (watch our review) and 4070 Ti Super. The 5070 still trails, now giving the 9070 a lead of 10%.\n\nThe XT model maintains about a 12% advantage over the non-XT.\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong - 4K\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong is a much more challenging title for AMD to run, but mostly with ray tracing. Either way, there should be some more favor for NVIDIA here. Even without RT, it\u2019s a heavy game. The ray tracing tests will come later.\n\nAt 4K and rasterized, the RX 9070 ran at 41 FPS AVG against the 9070 XT\u2019s 46, giving the latter a lead of 11%. The 7900 XTX sits ahead of the 9070 XT. The 9070 ends up still leading the RTX 5070, albeit on a technicality, which is actually a huge victory for AMD in this particular title. That\u2019ll change with RT, but this is a good position overall in raster.\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong - 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the RX 9070 held 75 FPS AVG with well-paced lows, sitting at 65 and 60 FPS for 1% and 0.1%. This is consistent (and good) frametime pacing, but it\u2019s about the same as all of its neighbors, so nothing exceptional.\n\nThe 5070 ran at 72.1 FPS AVG. The difference between the two cards is imperceptible and shows up in measurements, but would not be noticeable to an end user.\n\nThe 9070 XT\u2019s 83 FPS result has it again about 11% ahead of the 9070, so that\u2019s pretty predictable now.\n\nTo just highlight some landmarks: The 2060 ran at 25 FPS and tied the RX 6600, the 6600 XT ran at 29 FPS AVG, and the 3060 ran at 31 FPS AVG.\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong - 1080p\n\nAt 1080p, the 9070\u2019s 104 FPS AVG allowed it to finally start gaining some distance on the 5070. It\u2019s not a meaningful swing at 6% improved, but is in favor of the 9070. If AMD were $50 cheaper, it\u2019d be a clear victory. Unfortunately for AMD, a tie will often be decided in NVIDIA\u2019s favor by most buyers, especially with the complications of RT and software suites. But still, beating the 5070 in this game is an achievement for the 9070.\n\nStarfield - 4K\n\nStarfield is up now, tested at 4K. In this one, the RX 9070 ran at 63 FPS AVG and roughly tied the RTX 4070 Ti Super. The 9070 outperforms the RTX 5070\u2019s 54 FPS AVG by 17%, which is starting to be wide enough that NVIDIA needs to be concerned\u2026if they basically weren\u2019t a monopoly. The 5070 Ti falls below the 9070 XT in this one and only leads the non-XT by about 6 FPS. Hardly enough to spend $200 more for. The proximity to the 4080 (watch our review) and 4080 Super also isn\u2019t great news for NVIDIA.\n\nStarfield - 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the RX 9070 ran at 96 FPS AVG and nearly tied the 4070 Ti Super again. The 5070 Ti outperforms the 9070 by a lame 5.4%, with the 9070 XT outperforming the 9070 by 10%.\n\nAgainst the 5070\u2019s 83 FPS AVG, the 9070 leads by 15%. If the 5070 weren\u2019t already in the grave, we\u2019d pronounce its impending demise. We might want the 9070 to be a bit cheaper just to see that balance for the times it loses or is tied, but even without that, we can\u2019t deny that AMD is putting up its best fight against NVIDIA in years.\n\nStarfield - 1080p\n\nAt 1080p, the 9070 runs at 118 FPS AVG. The relative rank hasn\u2019t moved much. It leads the RTX 5070 by 14% here, so the lead has slightly reduced, but it\u2019s still ahead. The 9070 XT leads the 9070 by 8%.\n\nDying Light 2 - 4K\n\nIn Dying Light 2 at 4K, the RX 9070 ran at 56 FPS AVG and kept lows remarkably close by, at 50 and 41 -- but not in any more remarkable way than all of its neighbors. This game is just consistent.\n\nThe 9070 ends up tied with the 5070. There is no difference between these two and, in these situations, NVIDIA will generally be viewed more favorably by a mainstream audience. That\u2019s where the price would come in, or hopefully awareness of the other results.\n\nThe 9070 XT leads the 9070 by 11%, so you\u2019d be paying 9% more at MSRP for about 11% more performance.\n\nThis is one of the games where the 5070 Ti pulled ahead of the 9070 XT in a noteworthy way, so we see some of that apply to the 9070 and 5070.\n\nDying Light 2 - 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the 9070 runs at 106 FPS AVG and ties the 5070 again. They\u2019re within error of each other. The 9070 XT outperforms the 9070 by 11%, with the 5070 Ti still ahead of the XT. Generationally, we\u2019ll just briefly highlight the RX 6600 (watch our review), RTX 2060 (watch our review), and RTX 3060 (watch our review) as reference points to some of the most common GPUs of past generations. Those should give you an idea of the performance gains.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty - 4K\n\nCyberpunk is up now. This one has generally been tough for AMD in the past, but is harder for it with ray tracing. We\u2019ll start with rasterized testing and at 4K.\n\nThe results are thus far positive: We already knew that the 9070 XT outmatched the 5070 Ti, but now the 9070 is nearly tying the RTX 4080. That\u2019s just embarrassing for NVIDIA\u2019s last-gen mid-range-posed-as-a-flagship GPU as compared to a $550 card. The 9070 technically outperforms the 7900 XT as well, though is basically tied, and the lead over the 5070 is 15% again.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty - 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the 9070 now falls slightly below the 7900 XT, so they\u2019ve traded places as resolution came down, and the 5070 has also gotten closer. The 9070 is now about 11% ahead of the 5070 rather than 15% before. The 9070 XT leads the 9070 by 11% and the 5070 Ti slightly.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty - 1080p\n\nIn Phantom Liberty at 1080p now, the 9070 landed at 148 FPS AVG, allowing the 7900 XT (watch our review) to maintain its slight lead. The improvement in the 9070 over the 5070 is now down to 7% from 15% at 4K originally. If we dropped it down to 360p, based on this trend, NVIDIA might actually pull ahead. Great. Just like they\u2019ve wanted -- maybe that\u2019s the push for DLSS.\n\nRX 9070 Ray Tracing Benchmarks\n\nVisit our Patreon page to contribute a few dollars toward this website's operation (or consider a direct donation or buying something from our GN Store!) Additionally, when you purchase through links to retailers on our site, we may earn a small affiliate commission.\n\nRay tracing is up. This is where AMD has invested heavy effort with its architecture but all of it has been to try and catch up. NVIDIA was so far ahead in some games that AMD won\u2019t be able to catch them in all scenarios. The real question is how much closer do they get this time.\n\nRay Tracing - Black Myth: Wukong 4K\n\nWe\u2019ll start with AMD\u2019s worst case: Black Myth - Wukong, but now with ray tracing and at 4K with upscaling.\n\nThe 9070 ran at 26 FPS AVG here, so outdoing the 3070 Ti (watch our review) but below the 3080 (watch our review) from 2020. The 3080\u2019s original MSRP was around $700, although that really only held for a week or two before COVID-era scalping went crazy.\n\nThe 9070 XT outdoes the 9070 by 14% here. This is too low of a framerate to be playable, but we do the test for relative scaling and percent scaling.\n\nThe RTX 5070 crushes the 9070 here, holding a 57% lead over the AMD GPU. The 5070 Ti\u2019s scaling over the 9070 XT was better and nearly 80%, but 57% is still huge for the 5070 over the 9070. If you want to play Black Myth with ray tracing, like we said in the 9070 XT review, you basically only buy NVIDIA.\n\nLows are where NVIDIA will struggle the most for 5070 VRAM capacity. In this particular test, we aren\u2019t hitting VRAM saturation; however, we have shown instances where the 5070 hits saturation with heavy workloads and higher resolutions, leading to heavy stutter like in the Cyberpunk RT 4K scenario.\n\nRay Tracing - Black Myth: Wukong 1440p\n\nAt 1440p upscaled, the 9070 pushed 47 FPS. This gave the 9070 XT about a 6 FPS lead, nearly tied the 3080, and outperformed the 3070 Ti and 7900 XTX notably. The improvement over the 7900 XTX (watch our review) shows that AMD has actually executed on its RT performance uplifts.\n\nBut unfortunately for AMD, the 5070 remains superior with a 73 FPS AVG. It leads the 9070 by 55%.\n\nRay Tracing - Black Myth: Wukong 1080p\n\nAt 1080p, the 9070 measured at 67 FPS AVG and pushed past the 3080. The 9070 XT leads by 9%. The 5070 leads the 9070 by 46%, so it\u2019s slightly reduced, but still has an unbeatable lead.\n\nRay Tracing - Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 4K\n\nDragon\u2019s Dogma 2 with ray tracing is next, tested at 4K first. We measured the 9070 at 56 FPS AVG, giving the 9070 XT a lead of 9%. The 4080 isn\u2019t much past that, so for as close as these cards are, they\u2019re also very close to the 4080 and 4080 Super. The 5070 trails in this one, giving the 9070 a lead of 15%.\n\nRay Tracing - Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the 9070 gets dangerously close to NVIDIA\u2019s 5070 Ti, which failed to pass the 9070 XT in the previous review. The 5070 Ti leads the 9070 by 9%, the same lead as the 9070 XT has against it. The 5070 non-Ti is down at 83 FPS AVG, creating a 13% lead for the 9070.\n\nThis chart has entries for the 6700 XT (watch our review) and other prior GPUs.\n\nRay Tracing - Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 1080p\n\nAt 1080p, the 9070 ran at 119 FPS AVG and led the 7900 XT by a few frames per second. The lead over the 5070\u2019s 107 FPS AVG was 11%. The 9070 XT has a reduced lead over the non-XT at this resolution, now just 6% ahead of the cheaper card.\n\nRay Tracing - Dying Light 2 4K\n\nDying Light 2 with upscaling at 4K is up now, this time with ray tracing. The 9070 XT leads the 9070 by a higher-than-average lead of 16% here. The 9070 ends up below the 5070 in this one also, with the 5070 producing a lead of 9% over AMD\u2019s most relevant card.\n\nRay Tracing - Dying Light 2 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the 9070 runs at 78 FPS AVG and gives the 9070 XT a lead of about 10-11 FPS. The 9070 XT\u2019s prior 16% lead is now reduced to 14%. The 5070 is also reduced to a 4% lead from a 9% lead at 4K. The 9070 was really struggling with the 4K resolution.\n\nRay Tracing - Dying Light 2 1080p\n\nFinally for this game, 1080p puts the 5070 at just 1 FPS ahead now, so basically margin of error. The 9070 XT leads the 9070 by 13%.\n\nRay Tracing - Resident Evil 4 4K\n\nIn Resident Evil 4 with ray tracing and at 4K upscaled, the 9070 held a 104 FPS AVG and outperformed the 4070 Ti Super and 5070. The boost over the 5070 is 14% here. The 9070 XT ran 12% higher framerate than the non-XT, with the 5070 Ti basically tied with that.\n\nThis chart has a lot of cards lower down the stack, like the 2060 (watch our review), 3060 (watch our review), 2070 (watch our review), and 6700 XT for past generation comparisons.\n\nRay Tracing - Resident Evil 4 1440p\n\nAt 1440p upscaled, the 9070 ran at 162 FPS AVG and roughly tied the prior 7900 XT. The 9070 XT was 11% ahead of the non-XT here, with the non-XT ahead of the 5070 by 9%.\n\nRay Tracing - Cyberpunk 4K RT Ultra\n\nCyberpunk is up now, one of the two heavier titles we test for RT. We test this one at two groups of settings: Ultra and Medium, chosen because NVIDIA gains a disproportionate advantage at Ultra, while Medium pushes them closer together. That gives us the full picture.\n\nAt 4K and RT Ultra just to stress test it for relative scaling, the RX 9070 ran at 18 FPS AVG. Obviously this is unplayable, but this makes the point we made in our 5070 review: The 0.1% lows suffer on the 5070 in a big way. That\u2019s because they\u2019re indicating to us that underneath those lows, which really are just meant to be an indicator of a problem, there\u2019s spiky and erratic frametime performance. This is caused by exceeding VRAM limitations on the 5070, which simply isn\u2019t equipped enough to deal with these problems.\n\nRay Tracing - Cyberpunk 4K RT Medium\n\nAt 4K Medium, the 9070 boosted up to 24 FPS. No change in how playable it is, but even this lighter-weight workload is too much for the 5070 FE\u2019s capacity, which you can again see in its lows.\n\nThe 9070 XT leads the 9070 by 15% here, one of the higher percent increases.\n\nRay Tracing - Cyberpunk 1080p RT Ultra\n\nReducing the resolution helps reach playable framerates. At 1080p and RT Ultra, the 9070 held 61 FPS AVG against the 9070 XT\u2019s 71. That\u2019s a relatively large advantage of 16% for the 9070 XT.\n\nThe RTX 5070 ran at 64 FPS here, outdoing the 9070 by just 5.7%.\n\nRay Tracing - Cyberpunk 1080p RT Medium\n\nFinally for games, the Cyberpunk 1080p/Medium results put the 9070 at 81 FPS AVG, roughly tying the 7900 XTX. This also puts it above the 3080. The 5070 ran at 81.9 FPS AVG and lows were within error of the 9070. There is no distinct advantage in lows for the 9070 here. Average is the same, which is a major positive for AMD when considering its previous RT deficit.\n\nPower Efficiency Testing\n\nEfficiency: F1 24 4K\n\nWe\u2019re moving on to power and efficiency testing now, which looks at both the total power consumption of the device during the test and the frame rate. The end result is that we can calculate the efficiency in performance per Watt. It\u2019s actually a really exciting test for the 9070.\n\nIn F1 24 at 4K and with RT, AMD has exceptional performance. These are only showing two decimals, but more are processed for the bar width. The 9070 roughly tied with the 4080 Super and 5090 FE (beware of scalped prices) as the most efficient GPU in our test suite.\n\nThe 5070 was at 0.17 FPS/W, giving the 9070 an advantage of 24%. That\u2019s a huge swing in its favor. The 9070 XT was closer to the 5070.\n\nEfficiency: F1 24 1080p\n\nAt 1080p but with the same settings and game, the 9070 again ends up just behind first place. It\u2019s tied with the 5070 Ti and just behind the 0.64 result of the 5080 (read our review). The 9070 XT burns more power and, although its performance is better, the tradeoff favors the 9070 here. The 5070 ends up way down the ranks, at 0.55 here.\n\nEfficiency: FFXIV 4K\n\nFinal Fantasy 4K is up next. This is one of AMD\u2019s weaker showings given its limited performance scaling in Final Fantasy 14.\n\nThe 9070 pulled 224W during this test when measured at the PCIe cables and the slot. The 5070 pulled 10W more, but had better efficiency from its higher performance. The end result is that the 9070 outdid the 7900 XT for efficiency, but gave the 5070 a lead of about 18%. For reference, the 9070 XT pulled 310W here, roughly matching their TDPs.\n\nEfficiency: FFXIV 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the 9070 ranked at 0.56 FPS/W with a 224W draw. That has the 4060 as more efficient, the B570 slightly less efficient, and the 7900 XT also slightly less efficient. The NVIDIA 5070\u2019s 0.65 FPS/W result outdoes the 9070 again here, but we\u2019ll see if that persists outside of AMD\u2019s weakest rasterization title.\n\nEfficiency: Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 RT 1440p\n\nDragon\u2019s Dogma 2 with RT shows exceptional efficiency for the RX 9070, at 224W again and 0.42 FPS/W, it\u2019s looking pretty good overall. The performance is slightly lower than that of the 9070 XT, but the reduction in power really puts it in a better spot on the efficiency curve. It seems like this is more of the so-called \u201csweet spot\u201d for power to performance. The 5070 is down at 0.36 FPS/W, despite pulling 231W.\n\nEfficiency: Starfield 1440p\n\nIn Starfield at 1440p, the 9070 is less impressive than in F1 and Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2, but still overall good. Its result was 0.43 FPS/W, a large improvement on the 9070 XT\u2019s 0.34. The 9070 ties the RTX 5070, which is a problem for NVIDIA because efficiency was one of NVIDIA\u2019s main benefits with the 5070 Ti against the 9070 XT so if AMD is starting to chip that away, that\u2019s bad news for NVIDIA. That\u2019s kind of one of the key things the company has stood upon for being more expensive in the past.\n\nAMD RX 9070 Conclusion\n\nGrab a GN Soldering & Project Mat for a high-quality work surface with extreme heat resistance. These purchases directly fund our operation, including our build-out of the hemi-anechoic chamber for our acoustic testing! (or consider a direct donation or a Patreon contribution!)\n\nFirst, the 9070 gets credit for being relatively power efficient. It\u2019s basically tied at the top in a few of our charts, though not all of them, but it\u2019s looking better there. In our 9070 XT review, we said that AMD\u2019s decision to favor performance over cutting power was the right move for the company right now. We think that remains true for the card that\u2019s supposed to be its flagship, but for the 9070, the power cut helps create the difference between the cards to begin with, but the baseline performance is high enough that it ends up in a great efficiency position.\n\nThe 9070 XT ends up ahead of the 9070 by about 9-12% in most of the games we tested, with the 5070 generally giving the 9070 a lead in several games. Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 at 4K was playable on both, but the 9070 had about a 14% advantage over the 5070. The 9070 also led the 5070 by about 15% in Cyberpunk rasterized at 4K, with the 9070 XT ahead of the 9070 by 12%. There remains the one break-out for the 5070 in Final Fantasy, something we talked about in our 9070 XT review, but beyond that, for rasterization, the 9070 is ahead in basically every scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate 3 even showed a large benefit at 4K for the 9070 versus the 5070 since we\u2019re far enough away from the CPU bottleneck.\n\nIn ray tracing at 4K, the 9070 XT ended up around 9% to 19% higher framerate than the 9070, though that 19% number is based on low framerate, but even still, 17 is the next highest percentage. 1440p and 1080p weren\u2019t that different and can be found in the charts section earlier. As for the 5070 in RT and 4K, the 9070 beat it by 15% in Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2, 8% in F1 24, 6-7% in Cyberpunk, and 14% in Resident Evil 4. The 9070 lost in Black Myth and Dying Light 2 with RT. At 1440p and RT, the same losses exist. This points non XT and XT in a similar position to what we saw with the 7800 XT and the 7700 XT or the 7900 XT and 7900 XTX. The gap is small enough that most people will upsell themselves to the XT model.\n\nWeirdly, NVIDIA\u2019s own fumbles have sort of made the proximity of the two cards less of a problem than they otherwise might have been. Because from AMD\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s either AMD or AMD. They probably don\u2019t really care that much which version you buy, but the XT makes more sense than a 5070 does. The 5070 is already mostly irrelevant. NVIDIA\u2019s strengths like DLSS, ray reconstruction, and Reflex all remain, of course, but we don\u2019t think the bells and whistles are good enough on the 5070 to outweigh the 9070 or the 9070 XT. The biggest strength it probably has is CUDA, which we personally leverage for things like video editing. But for gaming, the 9070 and 9070 XT have really kicked the 5070\u2019s ass (though it really kicked its own ass).",

architecture.\n\nThe 16GB cards, which have recommended prices of $599 and $549, hit online stores yesterday, to strong reviews in the gaming press.\n\nBelow, we\u2019ve summarized their key specs, and rounded up what we know so far about how that gaming performance will translate to CG software like Blender, DaVinci Resolve and Premiere Pro.\n\nNew RDNA 4 architecture promises better AI, ray tracing and video encoding performance\n\nThe Radeon RX 9000 Series cards are the first GPUs to use AMD\u2019s new RDNA 4 GPU architecture.\n\nIt features improvements to all of the cards\u2019 hardware core types, including for general GPU compute, but particularly for AI operations and ray tracing, with AMD claiming that RDNA 4 provides \u201c2x the ray tracing throughput per compute unit\u201d compared to RDNA 3.\n\nFor video processing, a new dual media engine promises to double throughput for AV1 encoding, and to improve the quality of AV1, H.264 and H.265 encoding and decoding by \u201cup to 25%\u201d.\n\nAs with NVIDIA\u2019s current-gen GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, the Radeon RX 9000 Series cards support PCIe 5.0.\n\nThe new cards are also currently the only GPUs to support FSR 4 (FidelityFX Super Resolution 4), the latest version of AMD\u2019s AI-based viewport upscaling technology.\n\nFor more details, Tom\u2019s Hardware has a deeper dive into the RDNA 4

website.\n\nKey specifications\n\nAMD has changed its naming scheme since the previous-gen Radeon RX 7000 Series, but its launch materials position the new GPUs between the Radeon RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 GRE.\n\nThe new numbering convention suggests that the cards are being pitched against NVIDIA\u2019s mid-range consumer GPUs: the current-gen GeForce RTX 5070 and previous-gen GeForce RTX 4070.\n\nAbove, we\u2019ve rounded up the key specs of the new Radeon RX 9000 Series cards and their previous-gen counterparts, based on AMD\u2019s own figures and the TechPowerUp database.\n\nAll of the Radeon RX 9070 XT and 9070 GPUs are being manufactured by partner firms \u2013 there are no AMD reference cards \u2013 so clock speeds and power consumption will vary between models.\n\nHowever, their core specs are broadly comparable to the Radeon RX 7900 GRE \u2013 all are 16GB cards, and remain on GDDR6 memory \u2013 as are their recommended launch prices.\n\nProcessor core core counts are actually down on the previous generation, though AMD is promising overall performance improvements due to the advances in GPU architecture.\n\nStrong early reviews in the gaming press\n\nEarly reviews of the Radeon RX 9000 Series cards in the gaming press have been positive, with many contrasting the launch troubles and lukewarm reviews for NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 5070.\n\nTechRadar\u2019s review of the Radeon RX 9070 XT is fairly typical, describing it as a \u201cstunning release \u2026 delivering [GeForce] RTX 4080 levels of gaming performance at half that card\u2019s launch MSRP\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenchmark results in CG software\n\nBut how will that gaming performance translate to professional graphics work?\n\nAs you would expect, most of AMD\u2019s own published performance comparisons are for games, although its launch materials do include a few benchmarks for AI.\n\nThat includes both generative AI models and the AI tools in CG applications.\n\nThe slide above shows the Radeon RX 9070 XT outperforming the previous-gen Radeon RX 7900 GRE by 12-17% in AI-based tools in Adobe\u2019s Lightroom Classic photo editor and by 20-34% in DaVinci Resolve, Blackmagic Design\u2019s video editing, compositing and VFX software.\n\nThe figures are based on Puget Systems\u2019 standard PugetBench tests.\n\nIndependent reviews include scores for Blender and Premiere Pro\n\nSome early reviews also include benchmarks for CG apps, although their conclusions are mixed.\n\nTom\u2019s Hardware shows the Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 outperforming NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 5070 and 4070 in the synthetic SPECworkstation 4.0 benchmark, both in the HandBrake video transcoding test, and for average viewport performance across a range of apps, including Blender.\n\nHowever, for rendering, the GeForce RTX 5070 and 4070 outperformed both the Radeon RX 9000 Series GPUs in the Blender benchmark itself.\n\nPC World\u2019s review also notes that the GeForce RTX 5070 \u201cabsolutely stomped\u201d the Radeon RX 9000 Series cards in the PugetBench Premiere Pro benchmark.\n\nFor DCC work, it\u2019s also important to note that some GPU render engines, including Arnold GPU, OctaneRender and V-Ray GPU, use NVIDIA APIs, and are not accelerated on AMD graphics cards.\n\nPrice and availability\n\nAMD\u2019s Radeon RX 9000 Series GPUs became available on 6 March 2025 through partner firms including Acer, ASRock, ASUS, Gigabyte, PowerColor, Sapphire, Vastarmor, XFX and Yeston.\n\nThe Radeon RX 9070 XT has a MSRP of $599, and the Radeon RX 9070 has a MSRP of $549, but street prices are currently significantly higher for what remains of the initial stock.\n\nRead more about the Radeon RX 9000 Series GPUs AMD\u2019s website\n\n\n\nHave

You don't really need more CPU cores than this to play games, and most games benefit from the extra cache more than they do from a bit of extra clock speed.\n\nAMD announced today that it's following up the 9800X3D with two higher-end X3D processors next week. The 12-core Ryzen 9 9900X3D and 16-core Ryzen 9 9950X3D are both launching on March 12 for $599 and $699, respectively, the same as the launch pricing for the last-generation 7900X3D and 7950X3D but a couple hundred dollars more expensive than the current street pricing for the Ryzen 9900X and 9950X.\n\nAMD recommends the 9900X3D and 9950X3D to people whose gaming PCs also do other heavy-duty non-gaming work or for streamers whose gaming PCs are simultaneously running other apps. But they might also appeal to people who would normally just buy a 9800X3D because that processor has been difficult to find at its $479 MSRP since launching last fall. If a 9800X3D already costs nearly $600, why not spring for a faster chip if you can get one?",

(NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other big-cap stocks that are plunging so far in 2025.\n\nThe market has been reversing its gains earlier in the year, so much so that the S&P 500 is now down 1.5% year-to-date. The past two years have seen the same index post stellar gains back-to-back, and those gains were mostly spearheaded by big-cap stocks.\n\nHowever, historically speaking, the market delivering a third year of such returns would be unprecedented. Investors believe that 2025 will likely be a year when the market starts to cool off, and recent events have started a trend toward just that.\n\nBig-cap stocks are now leading the way down as tariff and AI-related fears hurt them the most. Many big-cap companies have invested significantly in these tech trends, which investors have now soured on.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a good idea to keep an eye on the big-cap losers year-to-date. Many of them have declined enough to open up buying opportunities.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, I screened the worst-performing big-cap stocks year-to-date.\n\nI will also mention the number of hedge fund investors in these stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nWhy Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) Is Plunging So Far in 2025?\n\nA close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 96\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the biggest semiconductor companies, and it also makes AI chips, though its tech trails that of Nvidia significantly.\n\nThe stock is down significantly so far in 2025 since Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has faced criticism for slower progress in AI chip sales compared to competitors like Nvidia. Investors were disappointed by AMD\u2019s inability to capitalize on the AI boom as effectively as Nvidia, particularly in training.\n\nOn top of that, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\u2019s data center segment fell short of analyst expectations and its other segments, like gaming and embedded, have also seen weak performance. The recent bout of fear surrounding AI stocks has caused AMD to decline further.",

AMD's new top-of-the-line CPUs will be sold for $699 and $599, respectively.\n\n\n\nAfter being announced at CES 2025, AMD's new flagships will arrive to an excited market that has not seen a new CPU release since the Ryzen 7 9800X3D arrived in November. The 9800X3D has suffered from inflated pricing since its launch, and the addition of new X3D models should help to broaden the availability of AMD's gaming-optimized tech, though these new premium models will come at a much higher price point\n\nThe $699 Ryzen 9 9950X3D will launch at the same price point as its predecessor, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D. We fully expect the 9950X3D to become among the best CPUs for gaming on the market, as the current top dog, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, already beats Intel in gaming workloads, and 9950X3D's 16 cores are likely to make it a solid productivity CPU as well.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D \u2014 Pricing and Specifications CPU Street (MSRP) Arch Cores / Threads (P+E) P-Core Base / Boost Clock (GHz) Cache (L2/L3) TDP / PBP or MTP Memory Ryzen 9 9950X3D $699 Zen 5 X3D 16 / 32 5.7 144 MB 170W DDR5-5600 Ryzen 9 9950X $559 ($599) Zen 5 16 / 32 4.3 / 5.7 80MB (16+64) 170W / 230W DDR5-5600 Ryzen 9 9900X3D $599 Zen 5 X3D 12 / 24 5.5 140 120W DDR5-5600 Ryzen 7 9800X3D $480 Zen 5 X3D 8 / 16 4.7 / 5.2 104MB (8+96) 120W / 162W DDR5-5600 Ryzen 9 9900X $429 ($469) Zen 5 12 / 24 4.4 / 5.6 76MB (12+64) 120W / 162W DDR5-5600 Ryzen 7 9700X $326 ($329) Zen 5 8 / 16 3.8 / 5.5 40MB (8+32) 65W / 88W / 105W DDR5-5600\n\nWhile we still don't know the base clocks of the two new releases, what we do know about their speeds and feeds is exciting, to say the least. The chips will be 16-core and 12-core parts, with the 9950X3D turboing up to 5.7 GHz. The \"X3D\" in the CPU names refers to the inclusion of 3D V-Cache technology, a game-boosting AMD invention that stacks a wicked-fast cache chiplet beneath the CPU dies to maximize gaming performance.\n\nThe 9950X3D will arrive with 144MB of total cache, dwarfing the 80MB found on the 9950, non-X3D. The 9900X3D's 12 cores will turbo up to 5.5 GHz and be aided by 140MB of total cache, almost double that of its non-X3D flavor. The chips will run mighty warm, with TDPs rated at 170W and 120W.\n\nAs far as getting your hands on a 9950X3D on release day, there are no promises to be made. The top-end CPUs and GPUs have been scarce lately; the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is currently out of stock via AMD and selling at inflated pricing at retailers, and not much needs to be said about the difficulty of obtaining Nvidia or AMD's newest GPU releases. So, while AMD's 9950X3D will be wonderful for gaming, if a CPU crushes frames with no one around to buy it, is it still the best number cruncher?\n\nRyzen 9 9950X3D Gaming and Content Creation Benchmarks\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD)\n\nWhile we don't have independent benchmarks just yet, AMD claims the gaming and productivity performance of the 9950X3D and 9900X3D are outstanding. Per AMD's own internal testing shown at CES, the 9950X3D is 20% faster than Intel's flagship Core Ultra 9 285K in 1080p high gaming tests. The chip also ekes out an 8% performance increase over the last-gen AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D, a nice generational improvement.\n\nAMD's CES panel also stated that 9950X3D's performance is within 1% of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which comes as little surprise as it matches the performance delta between last-gen's 7950X3D and 7800X3D. The 9900X3D didn't get nearly as much love in the panel, receiving no comparative tests, which is a bit worrying but not entirely surprising; last-gen's Ryzen 9 7900X3D was a 3-star chip at best playing in 7950X3D's shadow.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

The 3D V-Cache chiplet affixed to the die doesn't seem to be too much of an albatross around the neck of 9950X3D, with AMD claiming a 10% lead over the Core Ultra 9 285K in performance benchmarks. The testing suite shown off at CES seemed to be heavily weighted towards multi-core workloads, which the 16-core 9950X3D understandably run away with, but the 285K already leads over AMD's non-X3D SKUs in single-threaded performance testing, so those users with a productivity suite prioritizing single-core power may not fall in love with the 9950X3D.\n\nFor everything else we know about the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, be sure to check out our CES writeup on the chips. March 12th will likely bring with it a new chapter in AMD's gaming CPU dominance, though whether it also brings enough supply to keep up with rabid demand is entirely up in the air.

            "content": "Data Center revenues surged 69.1% year over year to $3.859 billion and accounted for 50.4% of total revenues. Sequentially, revenues increased 8.7%. AMD\u2019s top line benefited from strong Instinct GPU shipments and robust EPYC CPU sales. Exiting fourth-quarter 2024, Microsoft, Google, Amazon Web Services, Tencent and Alibaba launched more than 100 general purpose and AI instances. Microsoft launched new Azure instances powered by a custom-built EPYC processor with high bandwidth memory that delivers superior performance. EPYC sales grew double-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis, driven by high-volume deployments with Akamai, Hitachi, LG, ServiceNow, Verizon, Visa and others. In the Data Center AI business, MI300X deployment increased with cloud partners, including Meta Platforms, Microsoft, IBM, Digital Ocean and Dell Technologies, among others. Meta Platforms used MI300X to power its Llama 405B frontier model on meta.ai. It added instinct GPUs to its OCP-compliant Grand Teton platform, designed for deep learning recommendation models and large-scale AI inferencing workloads. Microsoft is using MI300X to power multiple GPT 4-based Copilot services. IBM announced plans to enable MI300X on its Watson X AI and data platform for training and deploying enterprise-ready generative AI applications. Dell Technologies started offering MI300X as part of its AI factory solution suite. DELL is providing multiple ready-to-deploy containers through its Dell Enterprise Hub on Hugging Face.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices reported fourth-quarter 2024 non-GAAP earnings of $1.09 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.10%. The figure surged 31.4% year over year. Revenues of $7.658 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.61% and increased 24.2% year over year, as well as 12% sequentially. The top-line growth benefited from robust Data Center and Client revenues that were partially offset by sluggishness in the Gaming and Embedded segments.\n\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Advanced Micro due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nA month has gone by since the last earnings report for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Shares have lost about 9.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAMD\u2019s Client Revenues Ride on Ryzen and Mobile Processors\n\nThe Client segment\u2019s revenues soared 58% year over year to $2.313 billion and accounted for 30.2% of total revenues. Sequentially, revenues increased 23%.\n\n\n\nHigher demand for both Ryzen desktop and mobile processors benefited the Client revenue growth in the reported quarter.\n\n\n\nAMD inked a collaboration with Dell Technologies, under which the latter will offer a full portfolio of commercial PCs powered by Ryzen Pro processors.\n\nAMD Suffers From Weak Gaming & Embedded Revenues\n\nThe Gaming segment revenues fell 58.8% year over year to $563 million and accounted for 7.4% of total revenues. Sequentially, revenues increased 21.9%.\n\n\n\nThe decline in semi-custom and Gaming graphics sales negatively impacted the Gaming segment\u2019s sales.\n\n\n\nThe Embedded segment revenues were $923 million, down 12.7% year over year and 0.4% sequentially. The segment accounted for 12.1% of total revenues.\n\n\n\nWeakness in the industrial and communications markets offset growth in aerospace and defense as well as test and emulation end markets.\n\nAMD\u2019s Margins Expand Y/Y in Q4\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin expanded 330 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 54.1%, driven by growth in the Data Center and Client segments revenues.\n\n\n\nNon-GAAP operating expenses increased 23% year over year to $2.125 billion.\n\n\n\nNon-GAAP operating margin expanded 360 bps on a year-over-year basis to 26.5% in the fourth quarter, driven by higher revenues and gross margin.\n\nAMD\u2019s Balance Sheet & Cash Flow Remains Strong\n\nAs of Dec. 28, 2024, AMD had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $5.132 billion compared with $4.544 billion as of Sept. 28, 2024.\n\n\n\nAs of Dec. 28, 2024, total debt was $1.72 billion, unchanged from the figure reported as of Sept. 28, 2024.\n\n\n\nOperating cash flow was reported at $1.299 billion compared with $628 million in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\nFree cash flow was $1.091 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared with $496 million in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, AMD repurchased 1.8 million shares and returned $256 million to shareholders. The company has $4.7 billion remaining under its current authorization.\n\nAMD\u2019s Q1 Guidance Unimpressive\n\nAMD expects first-quarter 2025 revenues to be $7.1 billion (+/-$300 million). At the mid-point of the revenue range, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 30% and a sequential decline of approximately 7%.\n\n\n\nFor the first quarter, AMD expects non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly 54%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be nearly $2.1 billion.\n\n\n\nFor 2025, AMD expects a strong demand environment to boost growth in the Data Center and Client businesses and a modest increase in the Gaming and Embedded businesses. The company believes a strong demand environment will help to deliver double-digit percentage revenue and earnings growth year over year.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nAt this time, Advanced Micro has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Advanced Micro has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.\n\nYesterday, reviewers agreed: AMD is finally beating Nvidia with its RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards, assuming they actually launch with sufficient stock at their $549 and $599 prices.\n\nBut this morning\u2019s launch, while better than recent Nvidia launches in terms of supply, may not have met that bar \u2014 and AMD would not deny reports that even the best-priced models of these GPUs are capped to specific quantities, after which they may be sold at higher than $549 or $599.\n\nWhen The Verge checked this morning, major US retailers Best Buy and Newegg listed as few as a single model of each GPU at their MSRP, which sold out quickly, of course. Most cards are listed for a $100 premium over that MSRP, if not more.\n\nMicro Center appears to be doing far better, with as many as five 9070s and five 9070 XTs at MSRP and a website that claims they\u2019re even still available for purchase if you visit one of its 28 US locations in person.\n\nWhat happens next? It\u2019s not unusual for each graphics card partner to sell a variety of fancier grades of the same GPU at higher prices with fancier cooling and overclocking \u2014 but retailers are now suggesting that even the prices of entry-level cards won\u2019t hold.\n\n\u201cWe have now learned how the recommended prices, also known as MSRP prices, work for the launch of the AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT [\u2026] they will apply to a limited number of cards,\u201d wrote Swedish retailer Inet.se, as documented by VideoCardz.\n\n\u201cMSRP is capped quantity of a few hundred, so prices will jump once those are sold through,\u201d UK retailer Overclockers UK also reportedly wrote.\n\nEven Best Buy seemed to suggest that $549 / $599 prices were only temporary. When we visited this morning, the Best Buy website described them like they were on sale, though the company has since removed the \u201csave $80\u201d and \u201csave $130\u201d you see below. AMD says the Best Buy listings were an error.\n\nWe asked AMD:\n\nCan you confirm or deny that the best prices on the best-priced cards are capped in this way?\n\nCan you confirm or deny that only a fraction of the best-priced models of 9070 and 9070 XT will be sold at their announced MSRP?\n\nCan you confirm or deny that AMD has okayed any board partners or retailers whatsoever to raise their prices beyond MSRP after selling through a certain quantity or certain number of shipments?\n\nAMD would not confirm or deny. It did address the larger question of MSRP availability with this statement from chief gaming solutions architect (and gaming marketing boss) Frank Azor, though:\n\nIt is inaccurate that $549 / $599 MSRP is launch-only pricing. We expect cards to be available from multiple vendors at $549 / $599 (excluding region specific tariffs and / or taxes) based on the work we have done with our AIB partners, and more are coming. At the same time, the AIBs have different premium configurations at higher price points and those will also continue.\n\nOn X, Azor tweeted that AMD is working to replenish stock \u201cin the coming days and weeks,\u201d adding, \u201cMSRP pricing (excluding region specific tariffs and/or taxes) will continue to be encouraged beyond today so don\u2019t despair.\u201d",

            "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\nIn ray tracing, it\u2019s all over the place. This is sort of the downside to the card. AMD has got some real strengths, but it\u2019s also got some real downsides. The 9070 XT improves massively on AMD\u2019s prior generation, but NVIDIA remains fiercely competitive still. AMD gets crushed in tests like Black Myth: Wukong with RT, but is actually competitive now in more mixed load RT games (AKA more medium-weight RT).\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s biggest strengths remain in its feature set generally, ray tracing, and efficiency in particular. Its power consumption is pretty effective for what\u2019s output. The features get difficult to measure. For example, do we measure MFG as multi-frame generation or as\u2026multi-failure generation\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s the fastest possible version of the recap. NVIDIA has had a busy 3 months destroying the hype it built for the 50 series. They\u2019ve had ups and downs -- actually, it\u2019s mostly been downs. Not that many, though. Just the 12VHPWR burning. And the paper launch. And the prices not being real, even from first-party partners. And the missing ROPs. And the missing ROPs on the card they didn\u2019t initially disclose them on. And the lying on stage about the 5070 vs. the 4090. And, well, we\u2019ll be here all day if we keep listing all of the issues.\n\nLet\u2019s just move on to the 9070 XT review.\n\nAMD RX 9070 XT Overview & Specs\n\nAMD\u2019s RX 9070 and 9070 XT launch the day after this story goes up. We already posted a video going into the specs and architecture of the cards, but the quick recap is this:\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD has made major changes architecturally for the RDNA 4 generation, which the 9070 XT uses. There are 2 cards: the 9070 and 9070 XT. There\u2019s probably going to be another card later that's at the lower end. The basic specs of the cards today might feel familiar to the Vega era, though: The cards are divided by a 56 compute unit (CU) model and 64 CU model with today\u2019s review focusing on the 64. No, not that one. We\u2019ll also have the 9070 review up shortly.\n\nFor TDP, AMD markets them at 220W and 304W, with board partners having room to scale higher. We\u2019ll test this in our review. AMD is using GDDR6 memory at 16GB capacity at 20 Gbps and on a 256-bit bus for both cards. The VRAM alone will be advantageous in heavier RT workloads, which is something we talked about in our 5070 review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe architecture\u2019s biggest overhaul that we\u2019re aware of has been in ray tracing. AMD has doubled the ray intersection rate, moved to two RT accelerator blocks with a shared 128KB memory, moved to BVH8, and introduced oriented bounding boxes to reduce or eliminate false positives in ray-triangle and ray-box intersections. AMD also introduced a dedicated ray transform block to help with transformation. This is all stuff that AMD needs to improve upon because NVIDIA has successfully sort of manufactured a category it\u2019s really good at, which is real-time ray tracing.\n\nAll of this helps with ray tracing performance, where AMD had fallen behind not only NVIDIA, but even Intel Arc in some situations last generation.\n\nAMD RX 9070 XT Pricing\n\nFor our review of the card built entirely on lies and bullshit, the RTX 5070, we showed that Newegg only had a single GPU model in stock, sold by Newegg, that wasn\u2019t refurbished when searching from $450 to $650. It was the 7800 XT.\n\nThis is madness.\n\nThere\u2019s just nothing there. The 9070 XT and 9070 both should be within this range, but they are also likely to get scalped. What may help is that there are rumors of greater supply than the 50-series, and likewise, they may be less desirable by the AI-at-home segment than the upper-end 50-series cards, like the 5090.\n\nBecause these reviews go up before the cards launch, we can\u2019t know where the pricing will land. We do intend on following it up immediately though with a report on how the launch shook-out.\n\nEither way, we\u2019d normally dedicate an entire section talking about all the various alternatives at the same price, but the reality is just that there aren\u2019t any other than used cards.\n\nWe\u2019re trying to keep this one simple today, so let\u2019s just get straight into the numbers.\n\nAMD RX 9070 XT Game Benchmarks\n\nOur fully custom 3D Emblem Glasses celebrate our 15th Anniversary! We hand-assemble these on the East Coast in the US with a metal badge, strong adhesive, and high-quality pint glass. They pair excellently with our 3D 'Debug' Drink Coasters. Purchases keep us ad-free and directly support our consumer-focused reviews!\n\nDragon\u2019s Dogma 2 - 4K\n\nDragon\u2019s Dogma 2 at 4K is a remarkably strong showing for the RX 9070 XT. In this benchmark, the 9070 XT ran at 70 FPS AVG, landing it between the RTX 4080 (read our review) and RTX 3090 Ti. That means that even taking MSRP at face value for both cards, the $600 9070 XT is achieving 95% of the performance of the $750 RTX 5070 Ti Prime, but at 80% of its MSRP. We want to caution that this result doesn\u2019t always happen -- sometimes a 9070 XT is worse than a 5070, so it depends on the game. But this is a great start.\n\nThe frametime pacing is also comparable, meaning that the frame-to-frame interval is not noticeably different to a human player.\n\nThe 9070 XT leads the 7900 XT by 14.8% here. The lead over the 5070 is 24%, at 70 FPS to 56 FPS.\n\nDragon\u2019s Dogma 2 - 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the RX 9070 XT nearly ties the NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti, the latter of which only leads by 3%. It\u2019s measurable, but you\u2019d never notice this difference. The lows are also within variance. Because a 5070 Ti is basically an RTX 4080 V3 or V4, that means the 9070 XT is also punching close to RTX 4080 Super levels. The 4080 Super was a $1,000 MSRP card that replaced a clinically insane $1,200 MSRP card before it, giving us some perspective.\n\nThe last-gen flagship makes us wish AMD had something one step higher as well: The 7900 XTX still leads the new 9070 XT, holding an 8% advantage here.\n\nAgainst the new RTX 5070, the 9070 XT leads by 21%. The 7900 GRE posts an even larger gap to the 9070 XT. As for owners on cards like the 2070 or 2070 Super here, this might be a good upgrade.\n\nDragon\u2019s Dogma 2 - 1080p\n\nAt 1080p, the RX 9070 XT maintained its relative positioning against the 5070 Ti. It\u2019s now at 145 FPS AVG to the 151 result on the $750 MSRP NVIDIA model, available on sale for only $150 more. We\u2019ve never seen an inverse sale where the price goes up\u2026\n\nThe 7900 XT ran at 134 FPS average in this benchmark at 1080p, giving the 9070 XT an uplift of 8%. As for the 7900 XTX, it\u2019s still technically ahead of the new flagship RDNA 4 card, but only by 8%.\n\nFFXIV 4K\n\nFFXIV is up now. A quick disclaimer: The results here appear to be outliers in our dataset. They are repeatable and we re-tested both cards multiple times, ultimately coming to the same data set. They are lower than AMD\u2019s own findings; however, we\u2019re not sure if AMD is using the Dawntrail test like we are, and it\u2019s also possible that the test area is different (as we capture a specific scene). Regardless, we\u2019ll continue looking into these and wanted to disclaim that they are outliers from the rest of the rasterized data set, but the results did repeat in our testing.\n\nAt 4K, the 9070 XT landed at 68 FPS AVG. Unfortunately for AMD, that means that the 9070 XT is worse than the RTX 5070 here. The 5070 leads the 9070 XT by 13.6% with its 78 FPS AVG; the 5070 Ti leads by a staggering 43%, at 97 FPS to 68. Whereas Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 was a strong position for AMD, it\u2019s weak in this game. It all depends on the game itself.\n\nFFXIV 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the 9070 XT ended up only 2 FPS above the 7900 GRE (read our review). Architecturally, the improvements just aren\u2019t helping it here. The 5070 Ti ends up at 187 FPS AVG, leading the 9070 XT by 34%. The 5070 leads it by 10%.\n\nResident Evil 4 - 4K\n\nLet\u2019s show how much of a tennis match this really is.\n\nResident Evil 4 swings it back the other way: At 4K, the RX 9070 XT now holds a 103 FPS AVG, landing it nearly tied with the RTX 4080 Super. That\u2019s a great spot for AMD\u2019s card, which it needs after that Final Fantasy showing we just saw.\n\nThe 9070 XT leads the 7900 XT marginally and leads the 5070 by 31%. The 5070 Ti leads the 9070 XT by 3.5%, with the 7900 XTX (read our review) 23% ahead.\n\nResident Evil 4 - 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the 9070 XT continues to rank alongside NVIDIA: The 9070 XT is about 5 FPS short of the 5070 Ti, making for a measurable but undetectable difference to a human; that is, assuming the 5070 Ti has all the ROPs. If it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019d see anywhere from 6-12% more of a performance swing.\n\nThe RTX 4080 Super leads the 9070 XT by 5% here. The 7900 XTX was also once a $1,000 card and itself leads the 9070 XT by 20% with its 232 FPS result.\n\nAgainst the new RTX 5070, the 9070 XT holds a 27% advantage.\n\nResident Evil 4 - 1080p\n\nAt 1080p, the RX 9070 XT clocked higher framerate than the 7900 XT and landed just below the 5070 Ti. The 5080 leads the 9070 XT by 15%, which isn\u2019t all that much when considering we\u2019ve all been gaslit into thinking a 5080 takes the place of a 1080 Ti or something.\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong - 4K\n\nSince we just alternated to a title where the XT looked better, let\u2019s bring it back maybe the other way.\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong tends to favor NVIDIA, both with and without RT enabled. We\u2019ll see if that remains true on the new architecture.\n\nAt 4K, the 5070 Ti leads the 9070 XT by 12% here. That\u2019s not as big of a gap as it could be. Against the 5070, the 9070 XT is at least ahead by 14%. Compared to the prior generation, the 9070 XT is about the same as a 4070 Ti Super. The 7900 XTX is a few percent higher framerate than the 9070 XT.\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong - 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the 9070 XT\u2019s 83 FPS AVG result is matched with good pacing on the 1% and 0.1% lows. It\u2019s not better than its neighbors in a meaningful way, but is keeping pace properly.\n\nThe 5070 Ti leads the 9070 XT by 5% and the 5080 (read our review) leads it by 17%, probably calling the 5080\u2019s existence into question more than anything -- and again, that\u2019s one with all the ROPs.\n\nThe 5070 ran at 72 FPS AVG, so the 9070 XT is about 10 FPS higher. That also had the 5070 above the 7900 XT, which the 9070 XT has now vaulted past.\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong - 1080p\n\nAt 1080p, the scaling shifts the 9070 XT closer to the 7900 XTX. The two are functionally equal in all 3 metrics. The 5070 Ti outranks the 9070 XT on a technicality, but not in an observable way. 1080p seems to squish all of these together.\n\nStarfield - 4K\n\nStarfield is up now. This one flips it again: At 4K, the 9070 XT leads the 5070 Ti by about 2 FPS. Just like we\u2019ve said elsewhere, this is a measurable but irrelevant difference. You wouldn\u2019t notice the 2 FPS. You probably would notice the cost difference, though.\n\nThe 9070 XT actually roughly equals the 4080 Super here and isn\u2019t that distant from the 5080. Both the 5070 Ti and the 9070 XT are a threat to the 5080\u2019s already questionable existence.\n\nStarfield - 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the 9070 XT is again between the 5070 Ti and 4080 Super, roughly tying the latter. The 7900 XTX has a 6% lead over the 9070 XT here. The 5070 non-Ti, which is still not equivalent to an RTX 4090, continues to not be equivalent to a 4090. Truly wondrous technology. We never could have predicted that\u2026\n\nStarfield - 1080p\n\nAt 1080p, the 9070 XT now holds a 127 FPS AVG with lows at 68 and 46. That plants it right between the 7900 XTX and 5070 Ti. There\u2019s not much difference between these three in this test. The 4080 Super isn\u2019t that different, either, and the 5090 (read our review) shows that we do have a little more CPU headroom.\n\nSo does the 4090, for that matter, which continues to not be a 5070.\n\nDying Light 2 - 4K\n\nDying Light 2 is up next. This is one of the heavier games in our test suite.\n\nAt 4K, the 9070 XT ran at 62 FPS AVG, which has it just ahead of the 3090 Ti. It\u2019s also 11% ahead of the 5070. The 5070 Ti leads the 9070 XT by 12% in this test, which matches its gain in other tests where it held an advantage.\n\nIn other words, the 9070 XT achieves 89% of the performance at 80% of the listed MSRP. We\u2019re reviewing this before the 9070 XTs go on sale, so we can\u2019t know how much to adjust for street price yet.\n\nDying Light 2 - 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the 5070 Ti beats the 9070 XT at 130 FPS to 118, or about a 10% uplift to the 5070 Ti. The 4080 Super is a few frames above that. The 5070 is down at 106 FPS AVG, resulting in an advantage for the 9070 XT of 11%. It\u2019s equidistant between them.\n\nAMD has also improved on its 7900 XT model. The 6700 XT is way down at 61 FPS AVG, so users on that tier of hardware could experience nearly a doubling in framerate in some tests.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty - 4K\n\nWe\u2019ve been rerunning Cyberpunk: Phantom Liberty on a newer version for all tests, so this chart is sparse.\n\nThe 9070 XT ran at 53 FPS AVG, giving it a lead over the 5070 Ti\u2019s 50 FPS result of 5.8%. Against the 5070, the 9070 XT is ahead by 29%. Maybe more noteworthy is that the 9070 XT technically is ahead of the 4080. The 7900 XTX remains about 9% higher framerate than the 9070 XT.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty - 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the 9070 XT climbs to a playable 109 FPS AVG. This is without upscaling or frame generation -- just organic, farm fresh frames. The 9070 XT ends up basically tied with the 5070 Ti, slightly leading the 4080, and notably leading the 5070. We haven\u2019t re-run AMD\u2019s older stuff in this one yet.\n\nAMD RX 9070 XT Ray Tracing Benchmarks\n\nVisit our Patreon page to contribute a few dollars toward this website's operation (or consider a direct donation or buying something from our GN Store!)

This is where AMD will really need to prove itself. AMD spent a lot of time talking about its improvements to ray tracing blocks in its recent press briefings, so they\u2019re clearly aware of the deficit.\n\nRay Tracing - Black Myth: Wukong 4K\n\nWe\u2019ll start with the worst-case scenario. Black Myth: Wukong has worked best on NVIDIA hardware since its launch, especially in ray tracing. At 4K with upscaling and ray traced, the 9070 XT ran, with our settings, at 29 FPS AVG. Playability doesn\u2019t matter right now, just the relative scaling. We\u2019ll get to lower resolutions down below.\n\nWith these settings, the RTX 5070 ends up ahead by a large 38% at 40 FPS to 29. The 5070 Ti is 78% ahead of the 9070 XT. This is AMD\u2019s absolute worst-case scenario. Against last generation, AMD is posting large gains: The 9070 XT outperforms the 7900 XTX by 45%, climbing from 20 FPS to 29. That is a substantial gain, especially considering the XTX was often slightly ahead of the 9070 XT in raster but obviously, there are situations like this where you\u2019ll have to just heavily weigh NVIDIA if RT and this type of game matters a lot to you. Against the 7900 XT, there was an enormous 84% uplift in performance. It\u2019s undeniable that AMD is improving in RT.\n\nRay Tracing - Black Myth: Wukong 1440p\n\nAt 1440p upscaled, the 9070 XT ran at about the levels of the RTX 3090. The 5070 now is 37% ahead, so about the same as the previous resolution, with the 5070 Ti 66% ahead, reduced from before. The gain in the 9070 XT over the 7900 XTX is 45%, so the same.\n\nRay Tracing - Black Myth: Wukong 1080p\n\nAt 1080p upscaled, the 9070 XT held 73 FPS AVG and climbed past the 3090. It\u2019s now approaching the 3090 Ti, which came out 3 years ago and had no formal MSRP at launch. It just sold for whatever in that period, which typically was close to $2,000, but occasionally $1,500.\n\nThe 5070 is now 33% ahead, down from 37% before. The 5070 Ti is down to 53% ahead -- still huge, but a gradual reduction from the 4K upscaled gains of 78%.\n\nRay Tracing - Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 4K\n\nLet\u2019s look at something more balanced. Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 is a game that we\u2019d play with ray tracing enabled, as we do think it looks better, but it\u2019s not nearly as heavy an implementation as Cyberpunk or Black Myth.\n\nIn Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 with ray tracing and at 4K, the RX 9070 XT ran at 61 FPS AVG. This has it ahead of the RTX 5070\u2019s 49 FPS result by 26%. The 5070 Ti leads the 9070 XT marginally and by 2 FPS, or 3.6%. The 7900 XTX is about 5 FPS ahead of the 9070 XT.\n\nDefinitely a healthier position than Black Myth, but also not as impressively heavy.\n\nRay Tracing - Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the 9070 XT ran at 103 FPS AVG and tied the 5070 Ti almost exactly. Again, this is heavier on raster than RT, but this is a better result than historically for AMD. Previously, the 7900 GRE was below the new 5070, with the 7900 XT about the same as a 4070 Ti Super (read our review).\n\nRay Tracing - Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 1080p\n\n1080p puts the 9070 XT as still right around the 5070 Ti and 4070 Ti Super.\n\nRay Tracing - Dying Light 2 4K\n\nDying Light 2 is up next, tested at 4K with upscaling as the game is relatively heavy.\n\nThe 9070 XT landed at 46 FPS AVG, which puts it tied with the 7900 XTX and just behind the 3090 Ti. AMD still has a deficit in RT as compared to its NVIDIA competition, with the 5070 Ti leading by 24%. That\u2019s not as obscene as the gap in Black Myth, but it\u2019s still an undeniable victory for NVIDIA. The RTX 5070 ran at 44 FPS AVG here, so the 9070 XT is about 6% ahead.\n\nRay Tracing - Dying Light 2 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the 9070 XT ran at 89 FPS AVG and tied the 4070 Ti Super and 3090 Ti. It\u2019s marginally ahead of the 7900 XTX, though they\u2019re functionally equal. The RTX 5070 Ti leads the 9070 XT by 16% now, down from 24% at the higher resolution. The 4080 Super and FE were tied with each other and aren\u2019t distant from the 5070 Ti.\n\nRay Tracing - Dying Light 2 1080p\n\nAt 1080p, the 9070 XT ran at 129 FPS AVG. The 5070 Ti maintains a lead here, but it\u2019s now reduced to 9.4%. Those are some huge reductions in its advantage as the resolution comes down. NVIDIA is still ahead but has lost significant ground here.\n\nRay Tracing - Resident Evil 4 4K\n\nResident Evil 4 is up now. At 4K with ray tracing and upscaling, the 9070 XT performs at parity with the 5070 Ti. This is another of the lighter-weight RT titles, so broadly speaking, thus far, games with fewer RT features implemented that lean more heavily on raster allow AMD to compete better.\n\nThe 9070 XT leads the 5070 by 27%, with the 7900 XTX leading the 9070 XT in this one by 16%.\n\nRay Tracing - Resident Evil 4 1440p\n\nAt 1440p upscaled, the RX 9070 XT ran at 180 FPS AVG and allowed the 5070 Ti a marginal victory. The 9070 XT improved upon the 7900 XT, but not the 7900 XTX.\n\nRay Tracing - Cyberpunk 4K RT Ultra\n\nCyberpunk is up next. We\u2019ll start with the heaviest workload and scale down from there.\n\n4K and RT Ultra tends to destroy cards with lower VRAM capacity, like the 5070 with its 0.1% lows. Cards like the 2070 (watch our review) and 2070 Super (watch our review) have been removed this time since they were unplayable and their results were just noise anyway. One could be better than the other just because neither can play the game.\n\nThe 9070 XT landed at 22 FPS AVG. In a relative sense, what matters is the 5070 Ti\u2019s lead of 23.5%. The 9070 XT leads the 5070 by 26% in average FPS, but the 5070 has massive stuttering problems due to insufficient VRAM as it depletes.\n\nRay Tracing - Cyberpunk 4K RT Medium\n\nBringing RT down to Medium but still at 4K, the 9070 XT runs at 28 FPS AVG and lands between the 7900 XTX and 4080. That\u2019s a much better spot to be in. This puts the 5070 Ti ahead by 10%, down from 24% at Ultra. You could then get to a playable framerate with upscaling or by dropping resolution.\n\nYou can see NVIDIA getting embarrassed by its own choices again: The 4070 Ti (read our revisit) and 5070 are both crumbling in the 0.1% lows, which is a direct result of the low VRAM capacity. This low 0.1% value manifests as stuttery frame delivery and inconsistent frametime pacing.\n\nRay Tracing - Cyberpunk 1080p RT Ultra\n\nAt 1080p but back to RT Ultra, the 9070 XT ran at 71 FPS AVG, 61 1% low, and 58 0.1% lows. The 5070 encroaches on this result at 64 FPS AVG, although the 9070 XT has a slight advantage in 0.1% lows.\n\nThe 5070 Ti leads the 9070 XT by 20%.\n\nRay Tracing - Cyberpunk 1080p RT Medium\n\nFinally for Cyberpunk, 1080p at RT Medium, the 9070 XT ran at 92 FPS AVG. That reduces the 5070 Ti\u2019s lead back down to 12% from the 20% we saw with RT Ultra and the same resolution.\n\nRX 9070 XT Power Efficiency Testing\n\nWe\u2019re getting into efficiency testing now. Efficiency benchmarks are a combination of power consumption and performance, so you\u2019ll get to see both in this testing. We perform the testing with a PMD2 sitting as an interposer between the PCIe slot and the power cables, capturing just GPU power consumption in isolation.\n\nEfficiency: FFXIV 4K\n\nWe\u2019ll start with Final Fantasy 14 as usual; however, this won\u2019t reflect well on the 9070 XT due to its overall low performance in this title. The 9070 XT ends up toward the bottom of this chart. Its power draw was 310W here, pulling less than the 430W of the 7900 XTX, but also producing a lower framerate. This drags down the efficiency, planting it between the XTX and the 3090 Ti. The 7900 XT was more efficient in this particular test, with the 5070 likewise significantly improved on the 9070 XT.\n\nNVIDIA remains advantaged in efficiency.\n\nEfficiency: FFXIV 1440p\n\n1440p has more cards on the chart. The 9070 XT ends up improved upon the efficiency of the 6600 XT and 6700 XT, up at 0.45 FPS/W, but still worse than the prior XTX, 7900 XT, and NVIDIA\u2019s entire modern lineup. The 5070 Ti is 62% more efficient than the 9070 XT here, up at 0.73 FPS/W. This is not a good result for AMD. It\u2019s burning a lot of power to produce the output.\n\nEfficiency: F1 24 4K\n\nHere\u2019s a better test for the 9070 XT. In F1 24 at 4K and with ray tracing, the 9070 XT ran at 0.18 FPS/W. These results round to the second place, so differing bar sizes for the same numbers is normal -- it just means the hidden digits are separating them.\n\nAnyway, the 9070 XT is more efficient than the 5070 and significantly more efficient than AMD\u2019s prior 7900 XT. This massive uplift and flip over the prior raster Final Fantasy charts comes as a combination of improved performance for the power with the large ray tracing uplift that AMD saw generationally. NVIDIA\u2019s 5070 Ti remains more efficient than the 9070 XT at 0.20 FPS/W, but this is much closer than it was previously and now only has an 11% uplift. That\u2019s more normal.\n\nEfficiency: F1 24 1080p\n\nAt 1080p but still in F1 24 with RT, the 9070 XT ran at 311W and scored 0.51 FPS/W. That puts it ahead of the RTX 4060, the Intel B580, and 42% improved on the prior 7900 XT. NVIDIA\u2019s 5070 Ti maintains an advantage at 266W and 0.62 FPS/W, or a 22% improvement in FPS/W. That benefit mostly comes from its lower power draw to produce comparable performance.\n\nEfficiency: Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 RT 1440p\n\nDragon\u2019s Dogma 2 with RT and at 1440p is up now.\n\nThe 9070 XT consumed 311W during the course of this testing and calculated to a 0.33 FPS/W result, which makes it better than the 7900 XT and worse than the 5070 Ti. Despite AMD\u2019s gains overall, NVIDIA retains its advantage in efficiency and output for the power used. AMD had to get performance before it could get efficiency though, as these two are part of the same formula. We think their focus should remain on pumping performance with the hope to balance-out the efficiency calculation on that side of the formula.\n\nEfficiency: Starfield 1440p\n\nStarfield at 1440p is up now. This is without ray tracing. The 9070 XT pulled 310W again here, landing at 0.34 FPS/W and just ahead of the B570 and 7800 XT. The 5070 and 5070 Ti are both more efficient, with the 5070 Ti in particular keeping a massive improvement at 0.48 FPS/W. The performance is comparable on the 9070 XT and the 5070 Ti here, meaning that most of that efficiency benefit comes from the NVIDIA card pulling just 209W to produce almost the same amount of work. This is a good comparison because they\u2019re effectively iso work, or controlled for a nearly fixed output, and so we\u2019ve eliminated the last variable of performance. NVIDIA is simply more effective per Watt consumed. Whether that matters is up to you.\n\nAMD RX 9070 XT Conclusion\n\nBuy a GN 4-Pack of PC-themed 3D Coasters!

Buy here.\n\nAMD is definitely winning in the cost per frame department -- but it has often done this, so now it\u2019s a question of whether it wins by enough.\n\nNVIDIA currently has 90% of the discrete GPU market share. AMD has 10% with Intel at around 0% still. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for consumers that AMD -- and one day Intel -- are able to really compete with NVIDIA. At the same time, AMD and Intel shouldn\u2019t get pity purchases if they haven\u2019t earned it.\n\nWe\u2019ll see how street prices shake-out for the 9070 XT. The 5070 Ti has a problem where its partners aren\u2019t even hitting MSRP, so consumers are getting scalped by the likes of MSI.\n\nAs a quick recap of performance:\n\nIn rasterization performance and at 4K, AMD's 9070 XT is commonly within the range of 5-6% of the 5070 Ti, with a few break-outs like Dying Light 2 and Black Myth non-RT where the 5070 Ti has a 12% advantage over the 9070 XT. As we said earlier, our Final Fantasy 14 results just don't match what AMD presented, but we also run the newest version of the benchmark. Across all resolutions, performance of the 9070 XT approaches levels of the 7900 XTX in some benchmarks and is commonly around 7900 XT levels, but often between them. Broadly speaking, the 9070 XT beats the 5070 non-Ti and these charts show the summary of some of the 4K and 1440p results we have against the 5070 Ti. These charts illustrate the percent improvement from a 9070 XT to a 5070 Ti. In other words, if the bar is positive and going to the right, then that\u2019s a 5070 Ti victory.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for ray tracing performance, NVIDIA is ahead almost universally in our testing. In Black Myth, it's not even a competition. If you really wanted to play this game and you decided you needed RT for it with heavy settings, you'd basically need NVIDIA. In Cyberpunk, AMD narrows the gap from previous generations, but NVIDIA maintains a large advantage. In games like Dragon's Dogma 2 with RT, the 9070 XT looks much more competitive. The extra VRAM is useful in some heavy situations, such as in Cyberpunk RT with ultra settings where the 5070 starts to struggle under VRAM load.\n\nIn our efficiency testing, NVIDIA maintains an advantage overall. This is derived from both FPS and power, and in many of these cases, the lower power draw serves as the stronger part of NVIDIA's side of the equation (rather than performance). We think AMD's focus on performance before power is the right move. Power is OK for them. It can obviously be better, but running lower power wouldn't be worth losing potentially everywhere on performance. We think they made the right decision on this balancing act and can refine it later.\n\nAnd this back-and-forth we\u2019re describing is why it\u2019s been so critical for AMD to get its pricing right. In situations where a purchasing decision between AMD and NVIDIA is unclear for the average consumer -- not most people reading this, but we\u2019re talking about the mass market who don\u2019t even know Gamers Nexus exists -- NVIDIA will remain the \u201cdefault\u201d choice in the minds of those consumers unless AMD really gives them a reason to pay attention to. For AMD to really get noticed, it has to either win in large ways or be much cheaper, but ideally both.\n\nWith the 9070 XT, we think the $600 MSRP is the minimum that AMD had to do to get some positive groundswell and attention. And it achieved that: there has been a lot of enthusiasm over the last few days, in no small part thanks to NVIDIA continually f***ing everything up. We wish AMD would have come in slightly cheaper on the 9070 XT to really kick in the doors to the mass market, even though that\u2019d hurt short-term margin, just to make sure it can generate some momentum and keep developers integrating its own technologies.",

Take Ryzen 9 9950X as a prime example, as the cost of AMD\u2019s most-powerful processor has steadily fallen since its launch last year. What once was a $649 chip is now available for considerably less cash, making it a high-performance and high-value buy if you\u2019re hankering to upgrade to a high-end CPU.\n\nOver on Amazon, you\u2019ll find Ryzen 9 9950X available for $538.99, netting you a 17% ($110.01) discount from its launch price. This is the most affordable the processor has ever been on the storefront, meaning there\u2019s never been a better time to pick one up.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with this particular chip, Ryzen 9 9950X is AMD\u2019s flagship processor boasting 16 Zen 5 cores and 32 threads. Out of the box, it runs at a 4.3GHz base clock but can push to 5.7GHz with adequate cooling and go even further than that with a touch of overclocking. Such qualities naturally demand a decent amount of power, but this chip\u2019s power requirements aren\u2019t egregious at 170W.\n\nRyzen 9 9950X is compatible with all AMD X800 and B800 motherboards, as well as some older models with X600 and B600 chipsets pending a BIOS update. Suffice to say, there are plenty of potential partners for this processor, whether you\u2019re aiming to upgrade your whole system or looking for a drop-in upgrade.\n\nFor the moment, there\u2019s no beating the overall package that this AMD CPU offers. Pitting Ryzen 9 9950X against Core Ultra 9 285K, the Zen 5 processor comes out on top in almost all workloads you\u2019d want to throw at a chip of its calibre.\n\nTempting as it is to wait-and-see how Ryzen 9 9950X3D fares against the current flagship, the benefits of 3D V-Cache technology aren\u2019t universal. In fact, it likely won\u2019t make any difference at all in certain workloads as predecessors and recent leaks demonstrate. Summarily, don\u2019t stress if you can\u2019t wait.\n\nAmazon Prime members can enjoy priority shipping on Ryzen 9 9950X, reducing the wait time to upgrade. If it\u2019s been a while since you subscribed to the service or haven\u2019t ever tried it, check out the Club386 guide on everything you get with an Amazon Prime subscription for all the details.

            "content": "The first wave of AMD's RDNA 4 GPUs are out in the wild, starting with the RX 9070 series featuring the $599 RX 9070 XT and its $549 sibling, the RX 9070. These GPUs land hot on the heels of Nvidia's latest strides into the more mainstream segment with the RTX 5070 series. AMD has scored some solid wins across the board in performance and pricing and now all eyes are on the availability.\n\nBoth GPUs in the RX 9070 family offer 16GB of memory, ample to power your 1440p and even 4K needs. The flagship RX 9070 XT packs 64 Compute Units, dropping to 56 for its non-XT counterpart. Given the shift in the Radeon nomenclature, both GPUs are positioned to rival Nvidia's RTX 5070 family. When sticking to rasterization at 1440p, the RX 9070 XT is within reach of the RTX 5070 Ti, while the RX 9070 comes out on top versus the RTX 5070, with an 8% lead. With base-level price tags of $599 and $549, let's hope AMD has enough inventory to match consumer demand.\n\nWe've compiled listings posted across major US retailers including Best Buy, Newegg, and B&H Photo. Despite the recommended MSRPs, most models are noticeably pricier, further exacerbated by the lack of an MBA (Made By AMD) model this generation. Unlike the RTX 50 series, RX 9070 series went live after the embargo lifted, likely as an effort to counter bots and scalpers.\n\nWhere to buy the AMD RX 9070 XT in the US\n\nMany GPUs instantly sold out within minutes of launch, but we expect a resupply soon. There is a lot of fluctuation in the listed prices, especially at B&H Photo with a handful of its RX 9070 XTs costing north of $1,000. Without that anomaly, the most expensive RX 9070 XT is XFX's Mercury Magnetic Air OC White edition, priced at $849.99. On the RX 9070's end of the ring, the Gigabyte Gaming RX 9070 shot up to $739.99 once the first batch (at MSRP) sold out.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Model Retailer Price Stock XFX Swift Black AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Best Buy $599.99 Row 0 - Cell 3 XFX Mercury Magnetic Air OC Black AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Best Buy $829.99 Row 1 - Cell 3 XFX Swift White AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Best Buy $749.99 Row 2 - Cell 3 XFX Mercury White OC AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Best Buy $819.99 Row 3 - Cell 3 XFX Mercury Magnetic Air OC White AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Best Buy $849.99 Row 4 - Cell 3 Asus Prime AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Newegg $719.99 Row 5 - Cell 3 ASRock Steel Legend AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Newegg $599.99 Row 6 - Cell 3 Gigabyte Gaming OC AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Newegg $729.99 Row 7 - Cell 3 Sapphire Pulse AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Newegg $599.99 Row 8 - Cell 3 PowerColor Hellhound OC AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Newegg $759.99 Row 9 - Cell 3 Gigabyte Aorus Radeon RX 9070 XT Newegg $759.99 Row 10 - Cell 3 Sapphire Pure AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Newegg $739.99 Row 11 - Cell 3 ASRock Taichi AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Newegg $729.99 Row 12 - Cell 3 XFX QuickSilver AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Newegg $749.99 Row 13 - Cell 3 PowerColor Reaper AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Newegg $599.99 Row 14 - Cell 3 Sapphire Nitro+ AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Newegg $779.99 Row 15 - Cell 3 PowerColor Red Devil OC AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Newegg $799.99 Row 16 - Cell 3 XFX Mercury OC AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Newegg $799.99 Row 17 - Cell 3 Gigabyte Gaming AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Newegg $599.99 Row 18 - Cell 3 Asus TUF OC AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT B&H Photo $1,049.99 Row 19 - Cell 3 Asus TUF Gaming AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT B&H Photo $1,099.99 Row 20 - Cell 3 Asus TUF Gaming OC AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT B&H Photo $899.99 Row 21 - Cell 3 Gigabyte Gaming OC AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT B&H Photo $899.99 Row 22 - Cell 3 Gigabyte Aorus Elite AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT B&H Photo $949.99 Row 23 - Cell 3\n\nWhere to buy the AMD RX 9070 non-XT in the US\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Model Retailer Price Stock XFX Swift Black OC AMD Radeon RX 9070 Best Buy $549.99 Row 0 - Cell 3 XFX QuickSilver Black OC AMD Radeon RX 9070 Best Buy $649.99 Row 1 - Cell 3 XFX Swift White OC AMD Radeon RX 9070 Best Buy $649.99 Row 2 - Cell 3 XFX QuickSilver White OC AMD Radeon RX 9070 Best Buy $669.99 Row 3 - Cell 3 Sapphire Pure AMD Radeon RX 9070 Newegg $679.99 Row 4 - Cell 3 PowerColor Reaper AMD Radeon RX 9070 Newegg $549.99 Row 5 - Cell 3 Sapphire Nitro+ AMD Radeon RX 9070 Newegg $709.99 Row 6 - Cell 3 Gigabyte Gaming AMD Radeon RX 9070 Newegg $739.99 Row 7 - Cell 3 Sapphire Pulse AMD Radeon RX 9070 Newegg $549.99 Row 8 - Cell 3 ASRock Challenger AMD Radeon RX 9070 Newegg $549.99 Row 9 - Cell 3 ASRock Steel Legend AMD Radeon RX 9070 Newegg $639.99 Row 10 - Cell 3 Asus TUF Gaming AMD Radeon RX 9070 Newegg $709.99 Row 11 - Cell 3 PowerColor Hellhound AMD Radeon RX 9070 Newegg $629.99 Row 12 - Cell 3 PowerColor Red Devil AMD Radeon RX 9070 Newegg $659.99 Row 13 - Cell 3 XFX Swift OC AMD Radeon RX 9070 Newegg $549.99 Row 14 - Cell 3 Asus TUF Gaming OC AMD Radeon RX 9070 B&H Photo $899.99 Row 15 - Cell 3 Asus Prime OC AMD Radeon RX 9070 B&H Photo $849.99 Row 16 - Cell 3 Gigabyte Gaming OC AMD Radeon RX 9070 B&H Photo $739.99 Row 17 - Cell 3\n\nInventory was expected to be high at launch, and many hoped we wouldn't see widespread stockouts like with Nvidia's RTX 50-series GPUs. The reality was basically a repeat of what we saw with every recent GPU launch. From the U.S. to the U.K. and Europe to Asia, there are numerous reports of immediate sold out cards.\n\n\n\nFor those in the US seeking a more hands-on experience, physical stores like Micro Center supposedly had a reasonable number of cards, but you'd need a local store to even try this approach. And by reasonable we mean perhaps dozens of cards, which are no doubt sold out by now.\n\n\n\nGiven the demand for silicon wafers from the AI sector and the significantly higher prices such products can command, there's real concern that the supply of consumer GPUs could be as bad or worse than what was experienced during the 2020\u20132022 cryptocurrency mining induced GPU shortages. Let's hope it's not that bad, but at present things aren't looking good.",

            "content": "AMD\u2019s latest $550 graphics card is a strange beast, and that\u2019s the fault of AMD. The Radeon RX 9070 is a solid brick of gaming potential that can hold up in some 4K scenarios for your desktop PC, though it truly shines for gamers who plan to play at 1440p. Despite that, the RX 9070\u2019s main competition isn\u2019t Nvidia. AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 9070 XT at $600 offers a major performance bump above the slightly cheaper card. Unless the XT\u2019s prices inflate wildly post launch on March 6, you should opt for the $600 graphics card without hesitation.\n\nOn its own, the Radeon RX 9070 is a relatively solid GPU for sub-4K resolution gaming or other intensive graphics rendering tasks. You may have read the same line from reviews of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 that launched on Tuesday. These cards are already equivalent in manufacturer-suggested price. However, in our tests, the RX 9070 has the edge in synthetic benchmarks and in some games. If you want to upgrade your PC and avoid Nvidia\u2019s woeful stock situation, that may sound like music to beleaguered PC gamers\u2019 ears.\n\nDespite those gains over Nvidia, pushing the RX 9070 to 4K with the highest in-game settings will result in too much settings fiddling to be worth the hassle. If your choice is between Nvidia and AMD, you then have to decide if you really want DLSS 4 and multi-frame gen capabilities. If you\u2019re into single-player games and you have a high-refresh rate monitor, it\u2019s a real consideration despite the significant improvements to AMD\u2019s own FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 upscaling software.\n\nThe Radeon RX 9070 XT plays ball with the RTX 5070 Ti, but for $150 less MSRP. The RX 9070 performs above Nvidia\u2019s latest RTX 5070 GPU in several benchmarks and games while sharing the $550 price point, and yet it still may not be the one you want if you\u2019re looking to spend less on a GPU. Read on, and I\u2019ll explain more.\n\nAMD\u2019s RDNA 4 Architecture on the Radeon RX 9070 Offers a Solid Baseline for 1440p Performance\n\nAMD\u2019s new graphics cards, or GPUs, run on the company\u2019s recently revealed RDNA 4 architecture. It\u2019s an upgrade over RDNA 3 with new pipelines to improve the speed and performance of the cards\u2019 ray tracing capabilities. Unlike Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell architecture, which itself is passed down from the company\u2019s AI training chips, AMD\u2019s RDNA architecture operates on \u201ccomputing units.\u201d AMD claims its latest computing units are more efficient than previous generations, meaning it doesn\u2019t need as many inside each package to increase overall performance over the previous generation.\n\nThe RX 9070 has the same VRAM specs as the 9070 XT, including 16 GB of GDDR6 VRAM with a 644.6 GB/s memory bandwidth. Compare that to the 12 GB of GDDR7 on the RTX 5070, AMD\u2019s card has more headroom for higher resolutions, though that\u2019s brought down by the other specs. The RX 9070 has 56 compute units compared to the RX 9070 XT\u2019s 64. The RX 9070 includes 112 AI accelerators, whereas its more expensive sibling has an additional 16. For $50 less, you get a drop in boost clock speeds from the 9070 XT\u2019s 2.97 to the regular 9070\u2019s 2.51.\n\nAt least, the Radeon RX 9070 draws less power at 220 W than the XT\u2019s 304 W. AMD recommends a 550 W minimum PSU for the RX 9070, but if you\u2019re building your desktop from scratch, you may as well go for a 700 W power supply for the sake of future usability and upgrading. That\u2019s also what the Radeon RX 9070 XT suggests you get (as if you needed another hint to aim for the XT instead).\n\nFor review, AMD sent us the Acer Nitro Radeon RX 9070 16 GB graphics card. It\u2019s a two-slot, three-fan GPU configuration that looks as common as any other card on the market. It gets the job done, though. The card was grave-silent inside my PC tower, the Origin PC Neuron 3500X. The card includes three DisplayPort 2.1 ports and a single HDMI 2.1 port. You certainly don\u2019t need any bloatware like Acer Intelligence Space, but luckily the card did not automatically install any unwanted software on my PC once I slotted it in.\n\nUnlike Nvidia, AMD doesn\u2019t offer any first party Founders Edition graphics cards, so thermals, layout, and other technical details will vary from card to card. Also unlike Nvidia, AMD sticks with the dual 8-pin power connectors to power the GPU. At least you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about all that hullabaloo surrounding claims of melted power connectors on the RTX 5090. Anyway, you shouldn\u2019t really complain too much about plugging in two power connectors rather than a single 12VHPWR cable.\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 Manages Performance Gains Over Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5070\n\nWe ran our AMD and Nvidia benchmarks all on the same PC. Our specs included an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K CPU and 32 GB of DDR5, 6400 MT/s RAM. It\u2019s what managed to power the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080, so it was more than up to the job of AMD\u2019s $550 graphics card.\n\nBenchmarks love AMD\u2019s cards. 3D Mark and Geekbench AI shows the lower-level RX 9070 beating Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5070 in several scenarios, including those that stress ray tracing capabilities. In 3D Mark Port Royal, the RX 9070 scored 17819 compared to 13835 on the RTX 5070. It also managed to equal the 5070 in 3D Mark Speed Way tests and run 900 points above Nvidia\u2019s latest, low-level GPU in 3D Mark Steel Nomad.\n\nAs for AI performance, benchmarks show AMD\u2019s cards hold a strong edge over Nvidia. That\u2019s ironic, considering AI is Nvidia\u2019s whole bread and butter, and is what Blackwell was initially supposed to support. The Radeon RX 9070 issued a 25961 quantified score in Geekbench AI. That\u2019s just 684 points short of the RX 9070 XT, though it\u2019s close to 4,000 points higher than the $750 RTX 5070 Ti.\n\nFor gaming, how well each AI processing unit performs is far less important than how graphics card makers use them. We\u2019ll talk about AMD\u2019s improvements to its FSR upscaler later, but what you really want to know is how the RX 9070 performs in game. In our tests, the Radeon RX 9070 managed to beat the RTX 5070 in some games like Horizon Zero Dawn: Remastered, netting 89 FPS at 4K without any help from upscaling and 116 with FSR on balanced settings. This also beat the RTX 5070 Ti.\n\nAs for Cyberpunk 2077, the RX 9070 sat at around 18 FPS at 4K, which was only 1 or 2 FPS below the RTX 5070. Even when the game was using AMD\u2019s last-gen upscaling tech FSR 3, the 9070 was able to hit 44 FPS in benchmarks, just above 43 FPS on the RTX 5070 with the game running on Nvidia\u2019s latest version of its upscaler. The Radeon card was also a beast at 1080p compared to the RTX 5070, managing 120 FPS to Nvidia\u2019s 110 FPS with upscaling on balanced settings.\n\nI already mentioned in my RX 9070 XT review that Black Myth Wukong doesn\u2019t like AMD cards nearly as much as it does Nvidia\u2019s. There will still be games that won\u2019t meet or beat Nvidia\u2019s similarly-priced GPU. Other games may struggle slightly compared to Nvidia\u2019s RTX 50-series. For instance, Alan Wake II with FSR 2 enabled and all ray tracing settings turned off won\u2019t even get to 60 FPS at 4K. With ray tracing turned on, I saw framerates in the mid to low 30s.\n\nThere are some games, especially those few with FSR 4 support, that truly excel on AMD\u2019s latest. Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2 was managing over 60 FPS even with ray tracing settings on high. In Star Wars Outlaws, with FSR 3 settings enabled, I could hit 80 to 90 FPS average and only take a minor hit when trying out ray tracing.\n\nI also need to mention I experienced hitching and other issues in some games that I can only assume are an issue with pre-release drivers, though AMD didn\u2019t offer clarification on that score before publication. There was frame hitching in Dragon Age: The Veilguard and excessive frame drops in Hogwarts Legacy. I already went into detail with these issues in my RX 9070 XT review, so I won\u2019t stress about them here. Just know AMD\u2019s Adrenalin software is still working out the kinks. That\u2019s fair enough, and Nvidia still hasn\u2019t fully fixed all the issues with black screens on its RTX 50-series cards.\n\nThe Radeon RX 9070 Relies More on FSR 4 Than the 9070 XT\n\nI\u2019m happy there are more, slightly cheaper options for GPUs nowadays. Let\u2019s not forget Intel\u2019s Battlemage lineup from last year, which offered a true budget GPU for playing at 1080p or up to 1440p resolutions. Everybody likes options, and the RX 9070 is certainly a contender at its price point. Still, I can\u2019t say it should be your first choice.\n\nAMD gets a reputation for championing hardware while letting its software struggle, at least compared to Nvidia. Well, Nvidia\u2019s an AI company before it was a gaming hardware company, so that\u2019s not too surprising. It\u2019s also an unfair comparison. Both AMD and Nvidia have long competed to sponsor games and shove their exclusive graphics tech into the latest and greatest titles. AMD\u2019s FSR 4, now enabled by the AI accelerators on RDNA 4, is an improvement over the last generation of software. It\u2019s certainly not as flashy as all the talk of a transformer model DLSS 4 and multi-frame gen. For the sake of stable framerates on these mid-range GPUs, FSR 4 is more than enough.\n\nThe only issue is there are so few games that currently support it. It\u2019s available in all of Sony\u2019s PlayStation 5 to PC ports, along with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Monster Hunter Wilds, Kingdom Come Deliverance II, and Civilization VII. That may sound like a full slate until you compare it to the 75+ games that support DLSS 4 at launch, and Nvidia\u2019s only been adding more support over the last two months. AMD has a lot of catching up to do.\n\nBut what does that mean for the RX 9070? A lower-level GPU depends more on AI upscaling to hit the highs you need it to. Even with that support, we doubt that 4K will always be within your grasp on this $550. In that way, it\u2019s great for 1440p, just as much as the RTX 5070 was. Only, in that case, there are more games to choose from that support upscaling. The growing number of games that support multi-frame gen make Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5070 a slightly more compelling target for this price point. As disappointing as Nvidia\u2019s performance gains were, there\u2019s a compelling reason to get that card instead of the RX 9070 at that price point.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t matter, since the RX 9070 XT exists for just $50 more. With the stock situation still uncertain before the next-gen Radeon launch on March 6, I suggest you don\u2019t opt for the RX 9070 unless you can find it at its lowest price. If you can find the RX 9070 XT at or close to $600, there\u2019s no question that it should be the card you grab first.",

            "content": "New Video Cards From A Variety Of Vendors\n\nWe\u2019ve been waiting to see actual benchmarks for the AMD Radeon RX 9700 and RX 9700 XT and surprisingly it is today that they\u2019ve been revealed; traditionally releases have been happening the day after the PCPer Podcast goes live on YouTube. RDNA 4 uses third generation hardware to handle ray tracing and the benchmarks confirm the superiority of hardware over software. You will also see the effectiveness of FSR 4, which will let you crank up graphics options at 1440p with quality upscaling and retain decent performance. There are a number of reviews to go through, since AMD doesn\u2019t have the equivalent of a Founders Edition you\u2019ll have to see how each vendor implements their own tweaks to the RX 9700 and RX 9700 XT.\n\nSebastian had a chance to review the Sapphire NITRO+ versions of both cards, and the XT version uses a 12VHPWR connector, one of the best he has ever seen even, while The FPS Review tried the XFX Quicksilver RX 9700XT which uses two PCIe 8-pin power connectors. This is worth paying attention to as you can avoid the less than popular new PCIe power connector if you want. Josh also tried out the Quicksilver variant in his review. The variety of designs also means the prices will vary depending on which model you go with.\n\nThe performance is reassuring, with the RX 9700 XT performing noticeably better than the previous 7900 XT and while it doesn\u2019t quite reach a performance level where it is competing with the RTX 5070 Ti it is certainly closing the gap. The RX 9700 XT is a bit less expensive than the NVIDIA alternative, but that depends on the model you pick up. The base price of $599 is quite attractive, however the XFX Quicksilver RX 9070XT Magnetic Air Edition will be at least $709 and the SAPPHIRE NITRO+ RX 9070 XT will be at least $730. That is a huge price variation and comes dangerously close to the MSRP of the RTX 5070 Ti.\n\nThe price comparison is hard to predict however, as availability of Blackwell borders on the pathetic and what is available is nowhere near the $749 MSRP. If AMD can actually provide a solid supply of cards at close to MSRP then they could claim a fair amount of market share for this generation.\n\nOne thing to take note of while you are going through reviews, when the The FPS Review tested the SAPPHIRE NITRO+ Radeon RX 9070 XT in Cyberpunk 2077 with Ray Tracing Overdrive, aka Path Tracing, the RX 9070 XT beat the 5070 Ti and tied it in Ultra Ray Tracing. That\u2019s not to say any of these cards provided a solid 60FPS but it is an interesting blip in the results. There were also interesting results with Alan Wake 2, so it could be that we will see the performance gap close as AMD\u2019s drivers mature for RDNA4.",

            "content": "AMD stock is trading at a 52-week low.\n\nFor the most part, chip stocks have fared well over the last couple of years. The main tailwind fueling semiconductor stocks to new highs is, of course, rising interest in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nOne of the core pillars of the AI movement is data centers, which are equipped with chipsets known as graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs are important pieces of hardware for generative AI development. Companies such as Nvidia (NVDA 6.43%), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, and Broadcom have all witnessed significant climbs in market value thanks to their respective roles in the GPU realm.\n\nOne name in the chip industry that hasn't captivated investors, however, is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 4.17%). Over the last 12 months, shares of AMD have fallen by 44%. And as of this writing (Feb. 28), the stock is trading at a 52-week low.\n\nIs now an opportunity to buy the dip in AMD stock? Read on to find out.\n\nAMD stock is cratering, but...\n\nAt the time of this writing, AMD boasts a market capitalization of $162 billion. To put that into context, consider that Broadcom and TSMC are both closing in on trillion-dollar valuations, and Nvidia's market cap of $2.9 trillion makes it one of the most valuable companies in the world.\n\nAs the graph above illustrates, AMD's share price of roughly $100 is its lowest point in about a year. Moreover, the company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.1 represents a two-year low.\n\nWith such a lackluster chart, investors might think it's time to run for the hills. However, smart investors understand that sometimes sell-offs are tied more to emotion than the actual operations at a company.\n\n... the business is stronger than you think\n\nI'll admit that analyzing AMD's business is a challenging exercise. In terms of revenue and profitability, the company isn't anywhere near Nvidia. On the surface, this might suggest that AMD simply has no place in the data center GPU landscape -- a market absolutely dominated by Nvidia.\n\nIn my eyes, the figures above are slightly misleading. In 2024, AMD's gaming and embedded operating segments experienced noticeable declines in terms of sales and operating profits. On the flip side, however, the company's client and data center businesses experienced meaningful growth. What's happening with AMD is that the decelerating gaming and embedded businesses are eating into the growth experienced by its more AI-centered operations -- namely, the data center GPU segment.\n\nPatience is key\n\nI think AMD's sell-off is driven by a few factors. First, many investors seem to be making a generalized assumption that AMD will never be able to catch up to Nvidia. Given Nvidia is on the precipice of yet another record-defining growth phase underscored by its new Blackwell architecture, I can see why some investors may not be so hot on AMD.\n\nWith that said, AMD's pace of innovation shouldn't be ignored. The company's data center GPU business grew by 94% year over year in 2024, while operating profits in that business soared by 175%. These impressive unit economics are helping AMD reinvest into successor GPU chipware -- primarily GPUs set to compete with Blackwell.\n\nThis leads to a second important point. During AMD's fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings call, management's guidance wasn't exactly stellar. My suspicion is that investors took the light guidance the wrong way and became even more fearful that AMD is losing momentum. While the company's new chipware is releasing after Blackwell, I don't necessarily see this as a bad thing.\n\nCompanies that are seeking alternative solutions to Nvidia -- primarily for pricing reasons -- could very well flock to AMD once its new architecture is released. Of note, AMD has already seen demand from existing Nvidia customers such as Meta Platforms and Microsoft.\n\nI think AMD is going to have an inflection point whereby revenue and profit growth become more pronounced as the data center business scales. But until that happens, I wouldn't be surprised to see investors continue souring on the stock.\n\nTo me, these dips are compelling opportunities for long-term investors to buy AMD stock at historic bargain valuations.",

            "content": "The AMD Radeon RX 9070 arrives in a weird time for graphics cards. We\u2019re fresh off the launch of Nvidia\u2019s latest generation of cards, which places AMD\u2019s new $549 card in direct competition with the disappointing GeForce RTX 5070. That\u2019s a competition that AMD has no problem winning right now, which would usually make the Radeon RX 9070 the graphics card to buy for 1440p gaming.\n\nOf course it\u2019s a little more complicated than that, and AMD has nothing to blame but itself. The Radeon RX 9070 is only $50 cheaper than the excellent Radeon RX 9070 XT. That price difference makes sense in sheer mathematical terms \u2013 the 9070 is about 8% slower and 9% cheaper than the 9070 XT \u2013 but it\u2019s hard to justify not just spending the extra 50 bucks to get even better performance. Either way, when it comes down to choosing between two AMD graphics cards, things are looking pretty good for Team Red.\n\nPurchasing Guide The AMD Radeon RX 9070 launches March 6, starting at $549. However, this is just the starting price, and there will likely be many models that are more expensive. If you are going to get a 9070, my advice would be to get one as close to the starting price as possible, just because it's priced so closely to the Radeon RX 9070 XT.\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 \u2013 Photos 4 Images\n\nSpecs and Features\n\nJust like the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT, the RX 9070 is based on the new RDNA 4 graphics architecture. This new graphics tech brings huge improvements to performance, to the point where the 9070 drastically outperforms the Radeon RX 7900 GRE from last generation, despite having 30% fewer compute units.\n\nThe Radeon RX 9070 has 56 Compute Units, each with 64 Streaming Multiprocessors, or SMs, making for a total amount of 3,584 shaders. Each compute unit also has one Ray Accelerator and two AI Accelerators, making for 56 and 112 total, respectively. While the SMs do a bulk of the heavy lifting, the improvements to the Ray and AI Accelerators finally make this AMD graphics card able to hold its own in games with ray tracing. Plus, the AI Accelerators have improved enough that AMD was able to introduce FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 4, bringing AI upscaling to AMD graphics cards for the first time.\n\nJust like the 9070 XT, the RX 9070 is paired with 16GB of GDDR6 VRAM on a 256-bit bus. That\u2019s pretty much the exact same memory configuration as the 7900 GRE, and should be enough for 1440p gaming for years. However, it would have been nice to see AMD adopt GDDR7, like Nvidia did, but that probably would have brought up the price.\n\nAMD recommends at least a 550W power supply to run the RX 9070, as it has a power budget of 220W. In my testing, though, power consumption peaked at 249W, which is a bit over its budget. That\u2019s not enough to make it require better cooling, per se, but I\u2019d recommend going with at least a 600W PSU, just to be on the safe side.\n\nAs for cooling, though, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that AMD is not releasing a reference design of the RX 9070, for the first time in a few generations. That means every version of the Radeon RX 9070 will be manufactured by a third-party board manufacturer. AMD sent me the Gigabyte Radeon RX 9070 Gaming OC 16G. It\u2019s a beefy triple-slot card with a slight factory overclock, so keep that in mind.\n\nFSR4\n\nSince DLSS blew up in 2018, AI upscaling has been one of the best ways to get better performance without losing too much in the way of image quality. This used to be a solution that was essentially exclusive to Nvidia graphics cards, but the times have changed and FSR 4 brings AI upscaling to AMD GPUs for the first time.\n\nJust like any other similar solution, FSR 4 takes previous frames, along with in-game data, and runs them through an AI model to accurately upscale a lower resolution image back up to your native resolution. This is slightly different from the Temporal upscaling found in previous versions of FSR 3, which didn\u2019t have an AI algorithm to tighten up the details, resulting in artifacts like ghosting.\n\nThe downside is that because of the performance costs of running an AI model, FSR 4 has a slight performance loss compared to FSR 3. For instance, in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 at 1440p on the Extreme preset, FSR 3 gets me a frame rate of 165 fps, but switching it over to FSR 4 drops that to 159. Likewise, in Monster Hunter Wilds, the Radeon RX 9070 got 81 fps at 4K max settings with ray tracing enabled, but went down to 76 fps when I switched to FSR 4.\n\nBut because there\u2019s a toggle in the Adrenalin software that essentially lets you \u2018opt-in\u2019 to FSR 4, you can choose whether you want the better image quality of FSR 4 or the slightly better performance of FSR 3. I mostly play single player games, so I\u2019d go for FSR 4 every day of the week, but you may prefer sticking to FSR 3 for fast-paced online games like Marvel Rivals.\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 XT & 9070 \u2013 Benchmarks 11 Images\n\nPerformance\n\nAt $549, the AMD Radeon RX 9070 goes head-to-head with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070, and comes out ahead more often than not. At 1440p, this mid-range GPU is on average 12% faster than the RTX 5070, with a 22% lead over its AMD predecessor, the RX 7900 GRE, which launched for the same $549 in 2024. That\u2019s a significant improvement, especially with the 9070 having 30% fewer cores.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that AMD sent me a factory overclocked version of the RX 9070. The exact specs of the Gigabyte Radeon RX 9070 Gaming OC haven\u2019t been released at the time of writing, but GPU-Z reports a boost clock of 2,700Mhz, which is about a 7% clock speed boost. That won\u2019t quite be a 7% performance boost, but it should increase frame rates by about 4-5%.\n\nI tested every graphics card on their current public drivers at the time of writing. That means all Nvidia cards were tested on Game Ready driver 572.60, and all AMD graphics cards on Adrenalin 24.12.1. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT were tested on review drivers provided by AMD, as was the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 with Nvidia\u2019s review drivers.\n\nThe 9070 gets off to a strong start in 3DMark, which gives more of an impression of potential performance, rather than real-world gaming frame rates. In the Speed Way test, which has ray tracing enabled, the 9070 gets 5,828 points, compared to 5,845 points from the RTX 5070, which is essentially a tie. But in Steel Nomad which doesn\u2019t have ray tracing enabled, the 9070 beats Nvidia\u2019s card 6,050 to 5,034 \u2013 a 20% difference at the same price.\n\nTest System CPU AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Motherboard Asus ROG Crosshair X870E Hero RAM 32GB G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo @ 6,000MHz SSD 4TB Samsung 990 Pro CPU Cooler Asus ROG Ryujin III 360\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 is literally the game AMD used to preview the 9070 at CES 2025 \u2013 I even snuck in an early benchmark in at AMD\u2019s booth \u2013 so it\u2019s no surprise that it soars here. At 1440p with FSR 3 set to Balanced, the 9070 gets 165 fps, compared to 131 from the 5070 and 143 from the 7900 GRE. That\u2019s a 26% and 15% lead, respectively.\n\nThe result in Cyberpunk 2077 is wild, as it\u2019s a game that\u2019s always favored Nvidia hardware, especially with ray tracing enabled. However, at 1440p with the Ray Tracing Ultra preset, the AMD Radeon RX 9070 outperforms the RTX 5070 by 3%. That\u2019s not much of a lead, but any AMD lead in this game is huge. Especially at the same price.\n\nWhen I test Metro Exodus, I run it without any kind of upscaling, because it only supports DLSS, and not FSR or XeSS. So instead it\u2019s just raw ray tracing performance. But even here, the Radeon RX 9070 wins the day, getting an average of 71 fps, compared to 64 fps from the RTX 5070. That\u2019s an 11% lead in another game that throws Nvidia\u2019s logo at you as you load into it.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 gives the RX 9070 another huge lead, this time using Vulkan. At 1440p with everything maxed out, the 9070 gets 142 fps, compared to just 115 from the RTX 5070, making for an incredible 23% performance lead in favor of Team Red. Though, keep in mind that the 7900 GRE also gets 113 fps with the same settings, so this could be another case of the engine favoring AMD hardware.\n\nIn Total War: Warhammer 3, the RX 9070 only has a huge lead at 4K, likely due to the higher frame buffer. Moving down to 1440p, the RTX 5070 catches up, getting 134 fps to the 9070\u2019s 135. That\u2019s within the margin of error.\n\nIn Assassin's Creed Mirage, the RX 9070 gets 193 fps at 1440p with the Ultra preset and FSR set to Balanced. Nvidia has a hard time keeping up, only getting 163 fps in the same test. That\u2019s an 18% lead for the AMD card, though this is another game that has traditionally favored AMD GPUs.\n\nBlack Myth Wukong, however, is another game that loves Nvidia hardware, and it ends up being a wash between the Radeon 9070 and the RTX 5070. At 1440p, the RX 9070 gets 67 fps to Nvidia\u2019s 66, and that\u2019s with the hard-to-run Cinematic preset.\n\nForza Horizon 5 is getting up there in years, but it's one of those games where high framerates are rewarded. At 1440p, the Radeon RX 9070 averages 185 fps, compared to 168 from the 5070 and 152 from the RX 7900 GRE, making for a 12% and 25% difference, respectively.\n\nComing out hot on the heels of the GeForce RTX 5070 only works in AMD\u2019s favor. The Radeon RX 9070 and the GeForce RTX 5070 both cost $549, so the fact that AMD is able to pull ahead in so many of the tests is incredibly impressive. What\u2019s more, the Radeon RX 9070 will better stand the test of time, thanks to having 16GB of VRAM, even if it is a little slower than the RTX 5070\u2019s GDDR7. Even if these two graphics cards were perfectly tied \u2013 which they\u2019re not \u2013 AMD having 33% more VRAM would have made the RX 9070 the better value. Combine that with better performance, and it\u2019s a no-brainer.\n\nJackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen. You can follow her @Jackiecobra",

Today the review embargo is lifted so we can now share Linux performance benchmarks and more details on the open-source Linux driver support for these first AMD RDNA4 graphics cards.\n\nThe review embargo is now up and we are free to share the performance figures and other Linux driver information for the Radeon RX 9070 series. This first article today is looking at the Linux gaming/graphics performance while there is a second article focusing on the GPU compute performance (AMD Radeon RX 9070 Series Linux GPU Compute Performance). There will be follow-up articles over the coming weeks as the Radeon RX 9070 series Linux driver support matures with new performance optimizations and other improvements.\n\nWhat you're probably wanting to know first up as a Linux gamer/enthusiast... All of the Radeon RX 9070 series support is upstream in the Linux kernel and Mesa. For my pre-launch testing I have been successfully using the upstream code within the Linux kernel and Mesa -- no yet-to-be-merged code or any experimental branches or anything along those lines.\n\nOn the kernel side, Linux 6.12 LTS and newer is what's recommended for the Radeon RX 9070 series. Linux 6.12 is last year's Long Term Support kernel version and fortunately the RX 9070 series support should be \"good enough\" for those using that version. But as is typically the case with new hardware support at launch, the newer the kernel the better. So if able to, using Linux 6.13 stable is recommended and the Linux 6.14 kernel will be out later this month. For my testing I was using Linux 6.14 Git to enjoy the most up-to-date AMD open-source driver support available.\n\nAMD has tested the Radeon RX 9070 series to be working out-of-the-box on the likes of Fedora 41 or with Ubuntu 25.10 as well when fetching the latest AMDGPU firmware files. The needed RX 9070 / RDNA4 firmware files are all upstream in linux-firmware.git, so make sure you have those bits as well if planning to buy a Radeon RX 9070 series graphics card.\n\nOn the Mesa driver side, Mesa 25.0 or Mesa 25.1-devel is what's needed. Mesa 25.0 stable is available for a few weeks now whole using Mesa 24.3 stable with the AMDGPU LLVM back-end may work but with some bugs. For those wanting the latest and greatest RadeonSI Gallium3D/OpenGL and RADV Vulkan driver support, Mesa 25.1-devel Git continues to see new optimizations and features enabled. For my testing I was using a Mesa 25.1-devel snapshot from last week using the Oibaf PPA on Ubuntu 24.10.\n\nAMD will presumably be releasing a new AMDVLK driver soon for those wanting to use that official AMD Vulkan Linux driver with RDNA4 GPUs. As of writing no AMDVLK release for RDNA4 is yet available but most Linux enthusiasts/gamers tend to be using the Mesa RADV driver.\n\nFor those wondering about ROCm / OpenCL compute support, that is covered separately in the other article today (AMD Radeon RX 9070 Series Linux GPU Compute Performance).\n\nFor my Linux graphics/gaming tests of the Radeon RX 9070 and Radeon RX 9070 XT, it's all based on using the upstream linux-firmware.git, Linux 6.14 Git as of last month, and Mesa 25.1-devel via the Oibaf PPA. This was very easy to get going on Ubuntu 24.10 using this upstream open-source graphics driver stack and the first RDNA4 GPUs.\n\nThe Radeon RX 9070 series Linux experience was stable (I didn't encounter a single hang / kernel oops or any other problems like that!) and was smooth from desktop to gaming. It was a very pleasant initial AMD RDNA4 experience on Linux. This was a great at-launch experience using the upstream and open-source driver support from AMD. The one thing though... There's room left for performance optimizations. The main downside of my initial Linux testing was that the performance wasn't as great as what's been reported under Windows 11 with the official Radeon Windows driver. Relative to the Radeon RX 7900 series on Windows, the RX 9070 performance on Linux was less enticing right now. Similarly, the NVIDIA Linux performance was tougher competition.\n\nNo doubt over the coming weeks there will be more AMD Linux performance optimizations from the AMDGPU kernel driver to the Mesa RadeonSI and RADV drivers to further enhance the performance... Just as it's routinely been for years with the open-source AMD Linux graphics driver code.\n\nThanks to AMD for supplying the Radeon RX 9070 / RX 9070 XT review samples for launch-day Linux testing at Phoronix. AMD supplied the Gigabyte Radeon RX 9070 and PowerColor Radeon RX 9070 XT \"Reaper\" graphics cards as the review models.",

In lieu of those, I\u2019ve settled on RX 7900 GRE and RX 6800 as comparison points given how close their MSRPs are.\n\nRadeon RX 9070 RX 7900 GRE RX 6800 Released March 2025 Jul 2023* Nov 2020 Codename RDNA 4 RDNA 3 RDNA 2 GPU Navi 48 Navi 31 Navi 21 Process TSMC N4P (4nm) TSMC N5/6 (5/6nm) TSMC N7 (7nm) Transistors 53.9bn 57.7bn 26.8bn Die size 357mm2 522mm\u00b2 520mm\u00b2 Stream processors 3,584 5,120 3,840 Game clock 2,070MHz 1,880MHz 1,815MHz Boost clock 2,520MHz 2,245MHz 2,105MHz Compute units 56 of 64 80 of 96 60 of 80 RT accelerators 56 (3rd Gen) 80 (2nd Gen) 60 (1st Gen) AI accelerators 112 (2nd Gen) 160 (1st Gen) \u2013 Peak FP32 TFLOPS 36 46 16 Peak FP16 TFLOPS 72 92 32 ROPS 128 192 96 Memory 16GB 16GB 16GB Mem. type GDDR6 GDDR6 GDDR6 Mem. clock 20Gb/s 18Gb/s 16Gb/s Mem. interface 256-bit (PCIe Gen 5) 256-bit (PCIe Gen 4) 256-bit (PCIe Gen 4) Mem. bandwidth 640GB/s 576GB/s 512GB/s Board power 220W 260W 250W Launch MSRP $549 $549 $579 *Initial China release, global launch Feb 2024.\n\nRadeon RX 9070 rocks a cutdown Navi 48 GPU, forgoing eight of the chips maximum compute units for a total of 56. This naturally has knock-on effects for its AI and ray tracing accelerators, which fall to 112 and 56 apiece. Stream processors also take a hit too, shrinking to 3,584, making for a 12% hit across the board.\n\nThough fewer in number, each of Radeon RX 9070\u2019s subcomponents are more performant per unit than prior generations. This is of course thanks to architectural improvements. In addition to newer accelerator designs, the transistor density of RDNA 4 GPUs is much greater.\n\nBoth reference boost and game clocks are higher on Radeon RX 9070 than the likes of RX 7900 GRE or RX 6800, at 2,070MHz and 2,520MHz, respectively. Board power is lower to boot, at 220W. You\u2019ll find plenty of partner designs on the market that take both of these specifications up a notch, though.\n\nPacking 16GB of GDDR6 VRAM, Radeon RX 9070 doesn\u2019t push the boat out in terms of buffer size and even rides on the same 256-bit bus as its forebears. Its memory is faster, though, running at 20Gb/s for a total bandwidth of 640GB/s. Taken as a whole, it\u2019s a well-rounded setup.\n\nRound the back of Radeon RX 9070 you\u2019ll find an equal distribution of DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b ports, ensuring the graphics card will pair nicely with modern displays.\n\nRadeon RX RX 9070 RX 9070 XT Ratio Released March 2025 March 2025 \u2013 Codename RDNA 4 RDNA 4 \u2013 GPU Navi 48 Navi 48 \u2013 Process TSMC N4P (4nm) TSMC N4P (4nm) \u2013 Transistors 53.9bn 53.9bn 1.00 Die size 357mm2 357mm2 1.00 Stream processors 3,584 4,096 0.88 Game clock 2,070MHz 2,400MHz 0.86 Boost clock 2,520MHz 2,970MHz 0.85 Compute units 56 (RDNA 4) 64 (RDNA 4) 0.88 RT accelerators 56 (3rd Gen) 64 (3rd Gen) 0.88 AI accelerators 112 (2nd Gen) 128 (2nd Gen) 0.88 Peak FP32 TFLOPS 36.1 48.7 0.74 Peak FP16 TFLOPS 72.3 97.3 0.74 ROPS 128 128 1.00 Memory 16GB 16GB 1.00 Mem. type GDDR6 GDDR6 \u2013 Mem. clock 20Gb/s 20Gb/s 1.00 Mem. interface 256-bit (PCIe Gen 5) 256-bit (PCIe Gen 5) 1.00 Mem. bandwidth 640GB/s 640GB/s 1.00 Board power 220W 304W 0.72 Launch MSRP $549 $599 0.92\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to discuss Radeon RX 9070\u2019s specs without the shadow of RX 9070 XT looming large over the conversation. AMD only has itself to blame for this given how closely it prices the two together, unfortunately to the detriment of the more affordable card.\n\nRadeon RX 9070 is $50 cheaper than RX 9070 XT, translating into an 8% saving. Unfortunately, this short-term gain comes with losses in specifications that are puzzling in their extent. In addition to trading in 12% of Navi 48\u2019s maximum compute units, clock speeds are 14-15% slower, while FP16 and FP32 performance tumbles down by 26%.\n\nI feel as though AMD learned little if anything from its prior pricing gaffes, namely Radeon RX 7900 XT and 7700 XT. Even a small discount to \u00a3499 / $524 would help RX 9070 better differentiate itself from its sibling, not to mention make for an even cheekier response to GeForce RTX 5070.\n\nIf your budget absolutely cannot stretch beyond \u00a3524 / $549, though, don\u2019t sweat about picking up this graphics card. It\u2019s a solid option, and with availability proving problematic for rival offerings, a safe bet if you can find it in stock at the quoted MSRP. Speaking of which, let\u2019s look at one now. Meet Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 9070.\n\nDesign\n\nThose familiar with Pulse coolers will recognise the black-and-red colour scheme present on this Radeon RX 9070. Though the manufacturer doesn\u2019t stray far from prior iterations, it does make several changes to the aesthetics and build of the cooler which result in an attractive final finish typical of Sapphire.\n\nBlack plastic makes up the majority of this graphics card\u2019s shroud, save for its metal backplate which colour matches perfectly to the rest of the body. Together they create a rigid frame that feels reassuringly premium and heavy in the hand, weighing just over 1kg. It\u2019s fairly slim too, measuring in 280mm (L) x 120.25mm (W) x 51.5mm (H), making for a a dual-slot design that will fit in almost every rig.\n\nStylistically, Sapphire puts a new spin on familiar elements. For instance, the brand\u2019s trademark red ECG iconography makes a return but this time angles up towards the PCIe interface rather than across the backplate. While I prefer the older approach, there\u2019s no way it could work here owing to the GPU die\u2019s shift away from the centre of the PCB so it\u2019s a fair compromise.\n\nThis generation of Pulse rocks a sparse side profile, showing off almost all of the card\u2019s heatsink save for small wedges of plastic at either end and one in the centre that masks a support column behind it. Sapphire keeps brand representation low-key here, adorning the lower-half of the cooler with a Radeon logo as well as its own in red, sans any RGB.\n\nUnlike its Nitro+ sibling, Pulse opts for dual 8-pin PCIe headers instead of a single 12V2x6 port. I\u2019ve grown accustomed to the convenience of the latter cable but there\u2019s no issue opting for tried and tested methods. Sapphire has recessed the connectors on this card, which can make installation a bit more fiddly but does help with clearance.\n\nPulse has a pretty face, sporting abstract red lines spread across the frontplate in a manner pleasing to the eye. They evoke thoughts of veins, which seems wholly appropriate given the name of the cooler. The silver centre of its two fans provides a welcome spot of contrast against the black body, whose various ridges provide definition to its surface.\n\nI also much prefer the smoother stylings of Sapphire\u2019s new \u2018AeroCurve\u2019 fan blades compared to the ridged designs of yore. The company claims this new approach reduces air friction and increases RPM range while maintaining a low noise profile and solid cooling efficiency. These blowers also mark the first time a Pulse card\u2019s fans come with dual-ball bearings, a welcome upgrade that should improve their lifespan.\n\nRadeon RX 9070 is broadly comparable to GeForce RTX 5070 in terms of power consumption, pulling 350W from the wall under load and 91W while idle. It\u2019s one of the reasons the card can run so exceptionally cool in the face of strenuous tasks, peaking at just 48\u00b0C in my tests.\n\nPulse provides everything Radeon RX 9070 needs and does so to a high standard. This is Sapphire\u2019s most affordable cooler, hitting that all-important MSRP. The company does offer more premium models too, namely its pearlescent Pure series alongside its top-of-the-line Nitro+ designs which are worth a look if you\u2019ve got some extra cash to spend.\n\nPerformance\n\nRadeon RX 9070 joins RX 9070 XT in becoming the latest entry to the parade of graphics cards to demonstrate their worth in the proving grounds that are the Club386 test benches. As a reminder, these rigs feature Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPUs which packs plenty of processing power to keep GPU bottlenecks at bay.\n\nAMD advertises its Radeon RX 9070 Series as \u201cbuilt for 4K gaming\u201d so I\u2019ll be putting that claim to the test in the benchmarks below. Of course, you\u2019ll also find frame rates for other resolutions, namely FHD (1080p) and QHD (1440p) alongside other performance tests.\n\nApplication & AI\n\nRadeon RX 9070 trades blows with GeForce RTX 5070 across 3DMark, breathing down its rival\u2019s neck in Speed Way and claiming a confident victory in Steel Nomad. These results suggest the card is a dab hand at rasterised rendering and keeps pace when you want to call on its ray tracing capabilites.\n\nA promising baseline from these synthetic benchmarks but it\u2019s frame rates in real-world tests that\u2019ll truly test the mettle of Radeon RX 9070 and its competitors.\n\nRadeon RX 9070 manages an admirable half precision score of 46,282, creating healthy distance between it and GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super. Nonetheless, Blackwell claims victory in Geekbench AI.\n\nEven with a win under its belt, RTX 5070\u2019s lead of 2,161 should raise eyebrows at Team Green HQ. Don\u2019t forget, these are the results of AMD\u2019s second generation AI accelerators going up against Nvidia\u2019s fifth generation Tensor cores.\n\nWhile AMD has clearly made strides in the realms of AI elsewhere, the company still has plenty of work left to do to improve its performance in LLMs (Large Language Models). Radeon RX 9070 is considerably better at running Llama 3.1 locally than RX 7800 XT, demonstrating a decent generational uplift, but it\u2019s still miles behind GeForce RTX 5070.\n\nGaming\n\nImpressively, Radeon RX 9070 offers performance similar to RX 7900 XT and even bests GeForce RTX 5070 Ti across all three resolutions in Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage.\n\nWeighing it up against GeForce RTX 5070, it enjoys a decent lead of 8% at FHD. Turn up the resolution though and you\u2019re looking at 16% uplifts at QHD, rising to 18% at UHD. Radeon RX 9070 is expectedly slower than its XT sibling, to the tune of ~10%.\n\nFour frames per second at most separate Radeon RX 9070 and GeForce RTX 5070 in Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail. Regardless of resolution, though, Nvidia\u2019s contender emerges the faster of the two cards however slightly. Compared to Radeon RX 9070 XT, it\u2019s only 8-10% behind.\n\nRadeon RX 9070 makes GeForce RTX 5070 sweat in Forza Motorsport, as the gap between the two pixel pushers is once again made up of four frames at FHD and QHD. At UHD, it narrows further to a single frame.\n\nGiven Nvidia\u2019s track record of ray tracing superiority this is an uncomfortable result for Team Green. So far, Radeon RX 9070 has largely kept pace if not exceeded GeForce RTX 5070. If ever there was a place where the midrange Blackwell GPU could secure a lead it was here.\n\nBloodied but not beaten, Radeon RX 9070 digs deep and pulls out some clear wins in Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord. Its ability to keep GeForce RTX 5070 at bay diminishes as resolutions increase but the card never allows its rival to exceed it.\n\nRadeon RX 9070 XT similarly declines in splendour as the battle shifts from FHD through to UHD. As the two fatigue in parallel, RX 9070 finds itself 7-15% behind its fellow RDNA 4 GPU.\n\nMaking short work of Rainbow Six Extraction, Radeon RX 9070 is one smooth operator for its price point. It leaves GeForce RTX 5070 in the dust at FHD, charging ahead with an 11% advantage in average frame rates. There\u2019s no respite for its rival at QHD or UHD either, besting it at these resolutions too by 11-14%.\n\nIn this final shootout, Radeon RX 9070 trails RX 9070 XT by 16% at QHD and UHD. Performance differences shrink to 4% at FHD but this is less in part to due differences in graphical grunt and more indicative of a bottleneck elsewhere.\n\nAverage QHD performance RX 7800 XT to RX 9070 +22% RTX 3090 to RX 9070 +14% RTX 4070 Super to RX 9070 +9% RTX 5070 to RX 9070 +6% RTX 4070 Ti Super to RX 9070 -1% RX 7900 XT to RX 9070 -6% RX 9070 XT to RX 9070 -12% RTX 5070 Ti to RX 9070 -13% RTX 4080 Super to RX 9070 -17% RX 7900 XTX to RX 9070 -18% RTX 5080 to RX 9070 -23%\n\nAveraging out performance at QHD, Radeon RX 9070 manages some surprising feats. Most pertinent and important among them is a 6% lead over GeForce RTX 5070. Coming 13% behind RTX 5070 Ti is nothing to scoff at given the price differences between them.\n\nLooking to prior generation offerings, Radeon RX 9070 is a healthy 22% ahead of RX 7800 XT. It\u2019s not quite a 1:1 replacement for RX 7900 XT but it\u2019s not far off at just 6% behind the previously $900 graphics card.\n\nFinally, falling 12% behind Radeon RX 9070 XT is right in line with RX 9070\u2019s shortfall in compute units. This sort of linear scaling is fine in of itself but price puts a dampener on this comparison as highlighted earlier. To reiterate, a price cut to \u00a3499 / $524 would do wonders here.\n\nFrame Generation\n\nThere are no new additions or tweaks to FSR Frame Generation following the launch of Radeon RX 9000 Series. AMD is launching FSR 4 in tandem with its new cards but its improvements exclusively concern upscaling. It currently isn\u2019t possible to use this new version in Cyberpunk 2077 but performance differences between it and FSR 3.0 are minor. Without further ado, let\u2019s get to drag racing RX 9070 in a path traced Night City.\n\nRadeon RX 9070 joins RX 9070 XT and GeForce RTX 5070 in mustering the rendering might to punch north of 30fps on average at native FHD. However, all three cards crumble under the weight of QHD and UHD with Nvidia\u2019s offering fairing particularly badly at the latter resolution likely due to its 12GB buffer.\n\nEngaging DLSS and FSR nets healthier frame rates, as Radeon RX 9070 pushes beyond 60fps at FHD while its competitors push past 70fps. The upscalers, running in their highest quality preset, also create enough breathing room to facilitate a 30fps at QHD. Meanwhile, UHD remains off limits but dropping to a less-demanding base resolution could fix this.\n\nCoupling upscaling with frame generation, Radeon RX 9070 XT pulls ahead of the other two cards. It\u2019s a close call for second place but an additional five frames per second secures silver for GeForce RTX 5070 over RX 9070. Of course, Multi Frame Generation sees Nvidia\u2019s champion rush ahead with no ready response from AMD\u2019s camp.\n\nFSR 4\n\nAMD finally embraces the power of AI via FSR 4, following in the footsteps of Nvidia and Intel. This latest version of Team Red\u2019s offers a host of improvements over prior iterations, all in the service of improving visual fidelity. In short, it\u2019s a necessary upgrade that gives Nvidia DLSS a run for its money.\n\nYou\u2019ll find my FSR 4 explainer and examination of the feature in action in my Radeon RX 9070 XT review. For the sake of brevity, I\u2019ll now touch on its performance footprint running on RX 9070 versus FSR 3.1.\n\nSettings FSR 4 (Avg.) FSR 3.1 (Avg.) 4K Quality 61fps 64fps 4K Quality + FG 93fps 99fps 4K Performance 85fps 88fps 4K Performance + FG 120fps 123fps\n\nBenchmarking the opening cutscene in Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart using both FSR 4 and 3.1 indicates the newer upscaler is heavier on Radeon RX 9070 albeit only slightly. A 3-6fps penalty seems a reasonable trade-off for a vastly superior final image. Of course, this will vary game-to-game, but I don\u2019t foresee its footprint growing much beyond this example.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite the uphill battle Radeon RX 9070 faces in sharing its cost category with a competitor and a sibling, it still manages to leave a mark on the midrange market. It packs enough rasterisation performance to either outperform GeForce RTX 5070 at best or be a handful of frames behind at worst. Combine this with a larger 16GB frame buffer and it becomes an attractive mainstream option\n\nI still maintain that it\u2019s worth saving up for Radeon RX 9070 XT to maximise value but there\u2019s no harm in settling for the more affordable alternative. Should AMD drop the cost of RX 9070 to \u00a3499 / $524, if not lower, then this minor dilemma will evaporate. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll see post-launch price cuts similar to prior launches simply because I expect demand to remain healthy, particularly when it\u2019s nigh on impossible to get a GeForce RTX 5070.\n\nFor those with no more than \u00a3529 / $550 to spend, Radeon RX 9070 comes heartily recommended, particularly the Sapphire Pulse model I\u2019ve gone hands-on with here. Here\u2019s hoping AMD can continue this momentum with its RX 9060 Series, keeping Nvidia on its toes and providing vital value to the market through cracking competition.",

Find out more about how we test.\n\nIntroducing the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070\n\nThe AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 are here, ushering in the RDNA 4 GPU architecture and RX 9000 series of graphics cards. AMD spilled the beans on the hardware and specs last week, and we've already done a deeper dive into what makes these new GPUs tick, but now it's time to see how the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 stand up to the best graphics cards \u2014 all while we wait to see what happens with the retail launch tomorrow and how quickly the supply disappears.\n\n\n\nRDNA 4 represents a throwback to AMD architectures of years past, as the company is once again targeting mainstream performance and maybe even budget performance further down the road. But today, we're getting the $599 RX 9070 XT and $549 RX 9070 cards. And while some might feel cards at up to $600 don't qualify as \"mainstream,\" in today's market, we'd say mainstream stretches from around $400 up to $600, while anything below about $300 is clearly in the budget range. The PC graphics card market has become much more expensive in the past decade.\n\n\n\nThe one question we can't answer is what retail availability will look like. It seems like the AIBs have been stockpiling cards for about two or three months now, but how quickly were they being supplied the requisite GPUs? We don't know. Maybe there are tens of thousands of 9070 series cards just waiting to go on sale tomorrow; maybe there are only a few thousand. What we do know is that if there aren't enough to meet demand, prices are going to head north, just as they did with the RTX 50-series launches of the past two months.\n\nAdditional Reading If you want to know more about the AMD RDNA 4 architecture and Radeon RX 9000-series GPUs, start with our \"everything you need to know\" primer that goes into a lot more detail about the design and architectural changes that power these graphics cards.\n\nSpeaking of which, the Nvidia RTX 5070 officially goes on sale this morning. Of course we knew the performance of the RX 9070 XT and 9070 when we posted that review yesterday. What we don't know \u2014 what no one outside of Nvidia and its distributors and retail partners knows \u2014 is how many 5070 cards will be available today. The RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5080, and RTX 5090 have all sold out almost immediately, and we've seen prices shoot up by 50% or more relative to the MSRPs.\n\n\n\nWill the AMD graphics cards buck that trend or join the \"party?\" We'll find out in the coming days, but considering what happened with Intel's Arc B580, it's obvious that lower-priced cards aren't immune from the potential supply and demand problems. Our default assumption right now, based on nearly all prior generation graphics cards already being sold out and/or overpriced \u2014 with only the RTX 4060 and RX 7600 still available at or near MSRP \u2014 is that RDNA 4 isn't going to be a magic bullet to solve the availability issues plaguing the graphics card market right now.\n\n\n\nLet's also clear the air on the comparison GPUs in our charts. We've (or at least I've) been testing GPUs more or less constantly since the beginning of 2025. Drivers keep changing, certain tests that failed to run in the past have been fixed, bugs come and go, and we have a new GPU testbed and test suite. Ideally, we'd love to have every reasonable comparison present in the charts, but it will be a while before we have all the data compiled at a rate of a few GPUs getting tested per week.\n\n\n\nSo, the RTX 4070 Super wasn't tested for the 5070 review, not because we don't think it's important but because of time. Similarly, the RX 7900 GRE won't be in this review because we don't have time. Eventually, we'll get those tested, and all the data will be available in our GPU benchmarks hierarchy. You should be able to reasonably estimate where those 'missing' cards would land, and as both of those were later additions to their respective GPU families, it seemed to make more sense to leave those out rather than some other GPUs.\n\n\n\nAll good?

For example, Intel's Arc B580 as an example has \"worse\" compute performance than the Arc A770: 14.6 TFLOPS versus 19.7 TFLOPS. But in actual benchmarks, the B580 is up to 17% faster across our gaming test suite at 1440p. Both AMD and Nvidia have also updated their core architectures to improve performance, and today we find out just how much.\n\n\n\nThe RX 9070 XT offers theoretical peak compute of 48.7 TFLOPS for FP32, which is used for graphics, and up to 1557 TOPS of INT4 AI compute (with sparsity). The previous generation RX 7900 XTX offers 61.4 TFLOPS of FP32, but only 122.8 TFLOPS of FP16 for AI workloads \u2014 or alternative 122.8 TOPS of INT8 compute. We'll spoil the surprise a bit by saying that, for a lot of games, the 7900 XTX is still faster... but in AI tasks and RT games, the tables can turn.\n\n\n\nIt's not just compute performance that matters, of course. Memory bandwidth and capacity are also factors. The 7900 XTX had a 384-bit interface and 24GB of VRAM, compared to the 9070 XT and 9070 with 256-bit interfaces and 16GB of VRAM. In all cases the memory is GDDR6 clocked at 20 Gbps, so the prior generation halo card had 50% more bandwidth and capacity.\n\n\n\nThere's also the RT accelerators. AMD's RDNA 4 has doubled the ray/triangle and ray/box intersection rates with RDNA 4 compared to RDNA 3, which means the 64 RT units in the 9070 XT should be the performance equivalent of 128 RDNA 3 RT units, but the 7900 XTX only has 96 RT accelerators. So that's potentially 33% higher ray tracing performance from the new generation.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nAs already noted, the prices on paper look good. What we don't know is whether prices will stay close to what AMD recommends, or if they'll get jacked up by the retail outlets and AIBs. Because AMD isn't making any graphics cards itself this round, it will be up to the add-in board (AIB) partners to determine prices on the various models. There are probably requirements for each company to have an MSRP priced GPU, but we've seen those disappear in the past \u2014 or things like Asus's \"special launch pricing\" on some of its RTX 50-series cards.\n\n\n\nWe can also look at what graphics cards are available at retail. Last November, during the holiday shopping season, most graphics cards went on sale at prices below MSRP. And then they were gone. Now, virtually everything at the usual places for the U.S. \u2014 Newegg, Amazon, B&H, Best Buy, etc. \u2014 is either out of stock or seriously overpriced. RX 7900 XTX was selling for as little as $819, now the best price we can find is $1,094 for a PSU and GPU combo, and after that the price jumps to $1,283 at Amazon.\n\n\n\nThe same pattern applies to pretty much every other GPU. Outside of the RTX 4060, RX 7600, and Arc B570, we can't find anything at MSRP, never mind below MSRP. If you want a mainstream or higher performance GPU, it's currently overpriced compared to just a month or two back. Given the scarcity of any graphics card with an MSRP above $400, then, it's hard to imagine the 9070 XT and 9070 will stay at MSRPs in the near term. But we'll wait and see.",

With NVIDIA\u2019s first wave of desktop GeForce RTX 50 series launches mostly in the rearview mirror, gamers have been waiting with bated breath to see what AMD had in store. As such, AMD\u2019s presentation last week seemed to get lots of folks excited, especially after seeing the top-end Radeon RX 9070 XT\u2019s $599 MSRP. Of course, slick demos and a well-produced unveiling don\u2019t mean much if the actual product doesn\u2019t deliver. Thankfully, the wait is over, and we can finally show you what the Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT are all about. We\u2019ve had a few cards in hand for a little while and have put them through a battery of tests, alongside an array of competitive offerings. So, without further delay, let\u2019s get right to it...We have already covered the finer details of AMD\u2019s RDNA 4 GPU architecture, its new features and updates coming with the latest Adrenalin Edition Radeon software, so we won\u2019t rehash too much of that again here. Suffice it to say, if you want to understand what makes the new Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT tick, you should read this now To quickly summarize, AMD is claiming a significant generational performance uplift per Compute Unit with RDNA 4, for better rasterization, ray tracing, and machine learning performance. The Radeon RX 9070 series also features a new media engine for faster, higher-quality transcoding. AMD is introducing FSR 4 with ML-enhanced upscaling and acceleration on the Radeon RX 9070 series. And numerous AI-infused tools and apps are making their way into AMD\u2019s Adrenalin Edition Radeon software, to not only enhance its quality, but give users the ability to more quickly and comprehensively report any issues.We got our hands on an array of Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT cards in preparation for this article. XFX sent over its Quicksilver Magnetic Air Edition Radeon RX 9070 XT and white Quicksilver Gaming Edition Radeon RX 9070, and we also scored a PowerColor Reaper Radeon RX 9070 XT and Gigabyte Radeon RX 9070.In terms of their max boost clocks and memory configurations, all of the cards were similar. Game clocks should hover around the 2,400MHz mark, with boost clocks as high at 2,970MHz. And all of the cards are outfitted with 16GB of GDDR6 memory operating at an effective data rate of 20Gbps (connecter over a 256-bit interface) and dual 8-pin PCIe power connectors.Where all of the cards differ is in terms of their designs and form factors.The PowerColor Reaper Radeon RX 9070 XT is actually the smallest card of the bunch. Although it\u2019s packing a triple-fan cooler, the card measures only 304mm x 127mm x 42mm and is only two-slots wide. The PowerColor Reaper\u2019s physical dimensions are much more in-line with smaller, dual-slot cards of the past.The Reaper is packing a 14-phase VRM (8+1+3+2) design with DrMOS power modules and IMON real-time digital. The cooler features triple 90mm and the underlying fin-stack is equipped with 5 x 6mm heat pipes to help wick heat away from the GPU and power circuitry. Honeywell PTM7950 thermal pads are also used were applicable, for better thermal conductivity and heat dissipation.The Quicksilver Magnetic Air Edition Radeon RX 9070 XT goes in a completely different direction. This card is absolutely massive...Underneath its massive cooling system, the Quicksilver Magnetic Air Edition Radeon RX 9070 XT has similar specs to the PowerColor Reaper, but as you'll see on the next few pages, the huge cooler keeps the GPU and memory operative at somewhat lower temps, which helps maintain higher game clocks in the real-world and slightly increase performance.Both of the XFX cards you\u2019ll see here measure in at 360mm x 150.5 x 70.2, and are 3.5 slots wide. As much as we love the idea of high-performance coolers on today\u2019s GPU, which typically allow for slower RPM fans, and hence less noise, the increased girth of these cards relative to something like the PowerColor Reaper is stark. These XFX cards are some of the largest we\u2019ve tested.XFX is doing some interesting stuff, though. The XFX Quicksilver cards are packing all digital PWM, also feature 14-phase designs. And the coolers are outfitted with 5 x 6mm heat pipes and massive thin-fin heatsinks, with nickel plated copper cold plates. The Quicksilver Magnetic Air Edition Radeon RX 9070 XT also sports some really cool, easily removable fans.As the \u201cMagnetic Air\u201d signifies, the fans are held in place magnetically and literally be pulled out with a slight tug for easy cleaning. We should also note that the glossy, angled wing pieces on the top and bottom of the Magnetic Air 9070 XT are removable as well, and XFX plans to release the 3D files for those parts so that enthusiasts can 3D print their own.The white Quicksilver Gaming Edition Radeon RX 9070 has similar dimensions, but its fans are fixed in place. The massive cooler on the scaled down RX 9070, which has significantly lower power consumption, means this card operates particularly cool and quiet. If a Radeon RX 9070 is in your future, and you dig the large form factor and white colorway of this card, it will most assuredly keep temps in check. We saw GPU temps peak in the mid 50\u00b0C range on this card.Similar to all of the other cards shown here, the Gigabyte Radeon RX 9070 also features a triple-fan cooler, with a very dense heatsink affixed to the GPU and memory. Its overall dimensions fall somewhere in between the PowerColor and XFX cards, though. It\u2019s about .5\u201d shorter than the Reaper, but thicker at 2.5 slots wide. The XFX cards dwarf the Gigabyte card, though.Time constraints prevented us from completing a full suite of benchmark runs on this card, but it is in the test rig \u201cas we speak\u201d and performance is right in-line with the XFX Radeon RX 9070.The outputs on all of these Radeons is also similar and consists of a trio of DisplayPorts (2.1b) and a single HDMI port (2.1b). And with that, what do you say we get to some benchmarks? We know that's what you've been waiting for...",

            "content": "AMD has finally done it. For years it's tried to undercut NVIDIA with slightly cheaper, but less capable, video cards like the Radeon 6700 XT and 7900 XT. And sure, it's still following that same strategy with the new Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT. This time around, though, AMD has produced far more capable hardware, especially when it comes to 4K and ray tracing performance. And there's hope that it could finally catch up to NVIDIA's DLSS AI upscaling with its new FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR4) technology.\n\nThese aren't perfect video cards, to be clear. But for $549 and $599, the Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT are far more compelling than AMD's previous lineup. That's particularly true since the 9070 XT is $150 less than NVIDIA's RTX 5070 Ti, and in our testing it's sometimes faster than that card.\n\nAMD still has to prove that it can catch up to NVIDIA's DLSS, which has had several years to steadily improve its AI upscaling capabilities. In particular, AMD needs to match the performance of NVIDIA's multi-frame generation in DLSS 4, which has led to some surprisingly high fps figures while testing the RTX 50-series GPUs. AMD's Fluid Motion Frames technology is a start, but it's not nearly enough at this point.\n\nAMD 82 100 Expert Score Radeon RX 9070 AMD\u2019s Radeon 9070 is a solid midrange GPU with excellent support for 1440p gaming and a bit of 4K.

It has better ray tracing support than before, it's faster than the plain Radeon 9070 and it finally has AI upscaling to compete with NVIDIA\u2019s DLSS. Pros Affordable\n\nExcellent 1440p performance\n\nFSR 3 and 4 are a big help\n\nOccasionally faster than the 5070 Ti\n\nBetter ray tracing\n\nQuiet and cool performance Cons FSR 4 needs more support\n\nComplex upscaling configuration\n\nNeeds better multi-frame gen $549 at XFX\n\nHardware\n\nThe Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT are AMD's first RDNA 4 GPUs, a new platform sporting more powerful and efficient compute units, third-generation ray tracing accelerators and second-generation AI accelerators. There isn't a huge technical difference between the two cards: The RX 9070 features 56 compute units, 56 ray accelerators and 112 AI accelerators, whereas the 9070 XT has eight more compute accelerators and 16 additional AI processors. The XT model is clocked slightly higher, as you'd expect, and it also draws more power (304W vs 220W). Notably, both cards also ship with 16GB of GDDR6 VRAM, whereas NVIDIA skimped a bit and only put 12GB of RAM in the $549 RTX 5070.\n\nDevindra Hardawar for Engadget\n\nAs I was comparing our XFX-built review units, though, it was practically impossible to tell the RX 9070 and 9070 XT apart without reading the fine print on their labels. This is fairly typical for AMD cards with XT variants, and it makes sense since they're technically so similar. The XFX Swift GPUs I tested came in an elegant frost white case, with three large fans and surprisingly massive heatsinks. They're both 3.5-slot cards, so they also take up more room than the RTX 5090, which is a dense two-slot beast.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\nThanks to AMD's efficient RDNA design, you also don't need to rely on complex power dongles to drive these cards. They both take two PSU connections directly, and XFX recommends 800-watt power supplies at a minimum. That's significantly higher than AMD's minimum 650W spec though, so it could be that XFX is just trying to play it safe with its massive cooling setup. (If you're planning to overclock these cards, though, you'll likely want more than a mere 650W PSU.)\n\nDevindra Hardawar for Engadget\n\nIn use: A big step up for AMD\n\nI knew AMD was onto something special when I learned the Radeon RX 9070 averaged 60 fps in Cyberpunk 2077 in 4K Ray Tracing Overdrive mode. Sure, it needed FSR 3 upscaling to get there, but it was still better than the 50 fps I saw on the Radeon 7900XT a few years ago. The game occasionally dipped below 60 fps, but it was still very playable. 1440p was much smoother overall, averaging 117 fps. The Radeon 9070 XT, meanwhile, averaged 68 fps in 4K and 130 fps in 1440p.\n\nSure, these numbers are far behind the raw figures from NVIDIA's RTX 5070, which used the magic of multi-frame generation to deliver 115 fps in 4K with ray tracing and maxed out graphics. That card also hit 205 fps in 1440p. But as impressed as I was by the 5070, most of those frames were just meant to deliver the illusion of smoothness. During actual gameplay, I had a hard time seeing much slowdown with either Radeon card in 4K, and the difference between the NVIDIA card was practically erased in 1440p. Remember, fps figures aren't the entire story, even though NVIDIA wants you to believe otherwise.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\nI kept that idea in mind as I tested FSR 4, which surprised me when it averaged around 20 fps less than FSR 3 in Call of Duty: Warzone on both GPUs. The Radeon 9070 XT reached 250 fps in 4K with FSR 3, cranked up graphics and frame generation, whereas it hit 229 fps in FSR 4. AMD tells me that\u2019s no error, it\u2019s to be expected since FSR 4\u2019s AI upscaling is more focused on delivering higher quality graphics rather than a pure frame boost. I couldn\u2019t really see a huge difference while dodging bullets in CoD, but I did notice that finer textures like chain-link fences looked a bit clearer in FSR 4. (I also saw a few random glitched textures, something that was common in DLSS upscaled games early on. They weren\u2019t a major problem, but AMD clearly has to refine its upscaling model further.)\n\nAt the moment, enabling FSR 4 is a bit counter-intuitive as well. You have to turn it on in AMD\u2019s driver software, and then flip on FSR 3.1 in a compatible game. Warzone also required a reboot to fully enable the feature, but the game didn\u2019t prompt me to do so. And if you want frame generation, that\u2019s another option that has to be toggled on outside of the game. Hopefully this process will be smoothed out over time, along with wider availability for FSR 4. In addition to Black Ops 6, it\u2019s supported in the newly launched FragPunk, Civilization 7, Marvel Rivals and a handful of PlayStation 5 ports like the Spider-Man games. But it\u2019s nowhere to be found in Avowed or Dragon Age: The Veilguard, where you\u2019ll be stuck with FSR 3.\n\nDevindra Hardawar for Engadget\n\nFor games that don\u2019t work with FSR at all, AMD\u2019s Adrenaline software also has a \u201cHYPR-RX\u201d mode that enables features like Radeon Super Resolution upscaling (a separate driver-level technology) and AMD\u2019s Fluid Motion Frames generation. Altogether, they led to me seeing 200 fps in Forza Horizon 5 using the RX 9070 XT in 4K with maxed out graphics settings, up from 85 fps natively. But again, those are just fps figures \u2013 AMD points out Radeon Super Resolution may not look as clear as FSR alternatives. (I didn\u2019t notice any weirdness in Forza, but I may have been distracted by the beautiful racing vistas in Mexico.)\n\nGPU 3DMark TimeSpy Extreme Geekbench 6 GPU Cyberpunk (4K RT Overdrive DLSS) Port Royal ray tracing AMD Radeon 9070 10,997 113,012 60 fps (DLSS 3 w/ frame gen) 15,888 AMD Radeon 9070 XT 13,060 130,474 68fps (DLSS 3 w/ frame gen) 17,959 NVIDIA RTX 5070 10,343 178,795 115 fps (4x frame gen) 13,920 NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti 12,675 238,417 153 fps (4X frame gen) 19,309 AMD Radeon 7900XTX 12,969 N/A 55 fps (DLSS 3) 14,696\n\nWhen it comes to benchmarks, the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT hold their own against NVIDIA\u2019s 5070 and 5070 Ti in most of 3DMark\u2019s tests. In the Steel Nomad benchmark, the 9070 scored 1,100 points higher than the 5070, and the 9070 XT beat out the more expensive 5070 Ti by almost 3,000 points in Timespy Extreme. I was also surprised to see the RX 9070 scoring almost 2,000 points higher than the RTX 5070 in the Port Royal ray tracing benchmark. Previously, ray tracing of any kind was AMD\u2019s Achilles heel.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\nBoth of our XFX cards also stayed surprisingly cool during benchmarks and extended gaming sessions. They never went beyond 65C under load, and they typically idled below 40C. And since they never got very hot, I could barely hear their fans spinning up.\n\nDevindra Hardawar for Engadget\n\nShould you buy the Radeon RX 9070 or RX 9070 XT?\n\nOn paper, both of AMD\u2019s new GPUs are compelling alternatives to NVIDIA\u2019s midrange cards for 1440p gamers who occasionally dabble in 4K. The RX 9070 XT is particularly interesting, since it\u2019s noticeably faster and still comes in $150 less than the RTX 5070 Ti. But we\u2019re also dealing with a chaotic time in the PC gaming world, where GPU stock can disappear quickly and prices can rocket up quickly.\n\nIf you can nab either Radeon card at their listed prices, they\u2019ll be good deals. But it\u2019s not worth overpaying by too much for now. It also remains to be seen how the Trump administration\u2019s combative tariffs will affect pricing for PC hardware and electronics. Prices could easily jump by 20 percent or more to cover those costs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\nWhile NVIDIA\u2019s DLSS 4 technology is more mature and leads to higher interpolated frame rates, there\u2019s also a good argument for going with AMD\u2019s cards since they have 16GB of VRAM. They\u2019ll be better suited to handling larger textures in games down the line, and there\u2019s also the potential for FSR 4 to improve as well.\n\nDevindra Hardawar for Engadget\n\nWrap-up\n\nIt\u2019s clear now why AMD was focused on upgrading its mid-range Radeon cards first. There\u2019s not much point competing with NVIDIA at the extreme high end, like it did with Radeon RX 7900 XT and XTX. It makes more sense to focus on cards people can actually buy. The Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT also solve many of the problems I\u2019ve had with AMD\u2019s GPUs in the past. They can go toe-to-toe with NVIDIA's cards, they have better ray tracing support and finally, they have AI upscaling. It remains to be seen if AMD will actually build on the promise of those features, but these cards are a hopeful start.",

But finally, today we're taking an in-depth look at AMD's top RDNA 4 GPU to see what it's truly capable of.\n\nAMD is releasing the standard Radeon RX 9070, which is a binned version of the 9070 XT, and the full-fledged XT version we're testing today. Both are based on the same 357mm\u00b2 die, manufactured using TSMC's N5 process \u2013 the same process used for RDNA's graphics compute die.\n\nThe Radeon 9070 XT features 4,096 cores, while the 9070 has a reduced core count of 3,584 \u2013 a 13% decrease. The 9070 operates at 2,070 MHz, which is 14% lower than the XT version, though actual clock speeds under load will vary. Both models share the same memory configuration: 16GB of 20Gbps GDDR6 memory on a 256-bit memory bus, delivering 640GB/s of bandwidth.\n\nRadeon RX 9070 XT Radeon RX 9070 Radeon RX 7900 XTX Radeon RX 7900 XT Radeon RX 7900 GRE Price MSRP [$US] $600 $550 $1000 $900 $550 Release Date Mar 2025 Dec 2022 Feb 2024 Process TSMC N4P TSMC N5 (GCD) / TSMC N6 (MCD) Die Size (mm2) 357 mm2 529 mm2 Core Config 4096 : 256 : 128 3584 : 224 : 128 6144 : 384 : 192 5376 : 336 : 192 5120 : 320 : 192 L2 Cache (MB) 64 MB 96 MB 80 MB 64 MB GPU Boost Clock 2400 MHz 2070 MHz 2500 MHz 2400 MHz 2245 MHz Memory Capacity 16 GB 24 GB 20 GB 16 GB Memory Speed 20 Gbps 18 Gbps Memory Type GDDR6 Bus Type / Bandwidth 256-bit, 640 GB/s 384-bit, 960 GB/s 320-bit, 800 GB/s 256-bit, 576 GB/s Total Board Power 304W 220W 355W 315W 260W\n\nThis design suggests that the 9070 series should be cost-effective to produce, given its die size is similar to that of the 7800 XT, and the memory subsystem remains unchanged. AMD managed to sell the 7800 XT for $500 or less, so even the cut-down 9070 should be profitable. The 9070 has an MSRP of $550, while the full 9070 XT is set at $600.\n\nOn paper, the comparison between the previous-gen 7900 XT and the 9070 XT is intriguing. The 9070 XT has 24% fewer cores, a 33% smaller die, 20% less cache, 20% less VRAM, and 20% lower memory bandwidth \u2013 yet it's expected to deliver similar or better performance. That will be very interesting to test.\n\nThe Cards\n\nFor testing, we have several Radeon 9070 XT graphics cards on hand. All benchmark results were obtained using the Sapphire Pure, but we also have the Nitro+, XFX Mercury, Asus TUF Gaming, and Asrock Taichi models.\n\nUnder load, hotspot GPU temperatures ranged from 75\u00b0C (XFX Mercury) to 87\u00b0C (Nitro+). Interestingly, the Sapphire Pure maxed out at 81\u00b0C, which is lower than expected given the Nitro+ result. The Asus TUF Gaming ran at 80\u00b0C, while the Asrock Taichi peaked at 85\u00b0C. However, since these are hotspot temperatures, all models ran relatively cool overall.\n\nThe GDDR6 memory operated at 85\u00b0C on the Asus and XFX models, while the rest reached 90\u00b0C.\n\nFor GPU VRM temperatures, there was a significant range. The Asrock Taichi and Sapphire Nitro+ peaked just above 80\u00b0C, while the Sapphire Pure reached 79\u00b0C. Meanwhile, the XFX Mercury and Asus TUF Gaming managed to keep their VRM temperatures comfortably below 70\u00b0C.\n\nWhen it came to noise levels, the Asrock Taichi, Sapphire Pure, and Nitro+ were virtually silent, producing less noise than our case fans. The XFX Mercury was also very quiet, only barely audible over the case fans. The Asus TUF Gaming, however, was noticeably louder but still reasonably quiet.\n\nAs for core clock speeds, all models performed similarly, with no more than a 3% variance out of the box. Now, let's get into the blue bar graphs\u2026\n\nTest System Specs\n\nCPU AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Motherboard MSI MPG X870E Carbon WiFi\n\n(BIOS 7E49v1A23 - ReBAR enabled) Memory G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB DDR5-6000\n\n[CL30-38-38-96] Graphics Cards GeForce RTX 4070\n\nGeForce RTX 4070 Super\n\nGeForce RTX 4070 Ti\n\nGeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super\n\nGeForce RTX 4080\n\nGeForce RTX 4080 Super\n\nGeForce RTX 4090\n\nGeForce RTX 5070\n\nGeForce RTX 5080\n\nGeForce RTX 5090\n\nRadeon RX 7700 XT\n\nRadeon RX 7800 XT\n\nRadeon RX 7900 GRE\n\nRadeon RX 7900 XT\n\nRadeon RX 7900 XTX\n\nRadeon RX 9070\n\nRadeon RX 9070 XT ATX Case MSI MEG Maestro 700L PZ Power Supply MSI MPG A 1000G ATX 3.0 80 Plus Gold 1000W Storage MSI Spatium 1TB M470 PCIe 4.0 NVMe M.2 Operating System Windows 11 24H2 Display Driver Nvidia GeForce Game Ready 572.60\n\nAMD Radeon Adrenalin 24.12.1 / 24.30.31.03\n\nBenchmarks\n\nMarvel Rivals\n\nFirst up, we have Marvel Rivals at 1440p, where the 9070 XT averaged 88 fps. This made it 7% slower than the 5070 Ti and just 6% faster than the 7900 XT \u2013 not a bad result, but not an outstanding one either.\n\nAt 4K, the gap widened, with the 9070 XT trailing the 5070 Ti by an 11% margin, delivering an average of 51 fps.\n\nStalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl\n\nMoving on to Stalker 2, the 9070 XT once again lagged behind the 5070 Ti at 1440p, this time by a 9% margin, making it 2% slower than the 7900 XT \u2013 a disappointing outcome.\n\nIncreasing the resolution to 4K helped slightly, narrowing the gap to 5% behind the 5070 Ti while still managing to be 5% faster than the 7900 XT. However, with just 39 fps on average, the performance remains underwhelming.\n\nCounter-Strike 2\n\nWhen testing Counter-Strike 2, the 9070 XT was 10% slower than the 5070 Ti, a significant margin. In fact, it only managed to match the 7900 GRE, making this a very weak result. Unfortunately, AMD did not benchmark this game in their review guide, so we cannot confirm if they observed the same poor performance. It is also surprising that they did not test the most-played game on Steam.\n\nAt 4K, things got even worse. Here, the new Radeon GPU trailed the 5070 Ti by 16%, performing roughly on par with the RTX 5070.\n\nGod of War Ragnar\u00f6k\n\nGod of War Ragnar\u00f6k was the first game where the 9070 XT was able to match the 5070 Ti. While it was technically 1% faster at 1440p, this is within the margin of error. However, achieving RTX 4080-like performance here was impressive.\n\nThe 4K results followed a similar trend, with the 9070 XT just 1% slower than the 5070 Ti, again delivering performance comparable to the 7900 XTX and RTX 4080.\n\nDelta Force\n\nThe Delta Force performance was underwhelming. The 9070 XT averaged 160 fps, making it 8% slower than the 5070 Ti and 10% slower than the 7900 XT, putting it in line with the 4070 Super.\n\nAt 4K, results improved significantly, with the 9070 XT matching the 7900 XT. However, it was still 6% slower than the 5070 Ti.\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2\n\nThe 9070 XT performed exceptionally well in Space Marine 2, even surpassing the 7900 XTX. It was 17% faster than the 5070 Ti at 1440p.\n\nAt 4K, the gap widened significantly, with the 9070 XT outperforming the 5070 Ti by 36%. The reason for the poor performance of the new GeForce 50 series in this game remains unclear, and Nvidia has yet to address the issue.\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor\n\nIn Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, the 9070 XT was actually slower than the 7900 XT at 1440p \u2013 albeit by just 2 fps. More importantly, this made it 12% slower than the 5070 Ti.\n\nAt 4K, the gap narrowed slightly to 8%, but with an average of just 53 fps, the 9070 XT was only marginally faster than the 4070 Ti Super and 7900 XT.\n\nA Plague Tale: Requiem\n\nThe 9070 XT performs well in A Plague Tale: Requiem, coming in just behind the 7900 XTX at 1440p. However, this makes it 7% slower than the 5070 Ti. Still, it's a solid result overall.\n\nAt 4K, the 9070 XT is 4% slower than the 5070 Ti, averaging 65 fps. This puts it at the same performance level as the RTX 4080, which is impressive.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty\n\nRadeon GPUs have always performed well in Cyberpunk 2077, and the 9070 XT is no exception. At 1440p, it rendered 125 fps, matching the 5070 Ti and outperforming the 7900 XT by 11%.\n\nAt 4K, it pulled slightly ahead of the 5070 Ti, though only by a 3% margin. More notably, this put it 17% ahead of the 7900 XT \u2013 an excellent result overall.\n\nDying Light 2 Stay Human\n\nUnfortunately, the 9070 XT struggles in Dying Light 2, only barely beating the 7900 XT and coming in 12% slower than the 5070 Ti.\n\nThe 4K results tell a similar story, with the 9070 XT once again trailing the 5070 Ti by 12%, though it was also 12% faster than the 7900 XT.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6\n\nCall of Duty has always favored AMD, and Black Ops 6 is no exception. The 9070 XT delivered an impressive 118 fps at 1440p, roughly matching the 7900 XTX and beating the 5070 Ti by a significant 22% margin.\n\nAt 4K, it maintained a 19% lead over the 5070 Ti, once again delivering performance comparable to the 7900 XTX \u2013 an excellent result for the new 9070 XT.\n\nDragon Age: The Veilguard\n\nNext, we have Dragon Age: The Veilguard. This game utilizes some ray tracing with the ultra preset, but even so, the 9070 XT performed decently, coming in 4% slower than the 5070 Ti. However, we are essentially looking at 7900 XT-level performance in this case.\n\nAt 4K, the 9070 XT matched the 4070 Ti Super, making it 10% faster than the 7900 XT but also 10% slower than the 5070 Ti.\n\nWar Thunder\n\nThe Radeon GPU struggles against the GeForce competition in War Thunder when using the default DX11 mode. At 1440p, the 9070 XT could only match the 7900 XT, making it a massive 31% slower than the 5070 Ti.\n\nHowever, increasing the resolution to 4K changed things dramatically. Here, the 9070 XT delivered an impressive 227 fps, matching both the 7900 XTX and 5070 Ti.\n\nMarvel's Spider-Man Remastered\n\nPerformance in Spider-Man Remastered was disappointing. At 1440p, the 9070 XT was slower than the 7900 XT and trailed the 5070 Ti by 8%.\n\nAs seen in many cases, the 4K results were more favorable. Here, the 9070 XT matched the 5070 Ti, delivering 118 fps.\n\nHogwarts Legacy\n\nThe Hogwarts Legacy performance looks promising \u2013 until we consider that, despite being 4% faster than the 5070 Ti at 1440p, the 9070 XT is still slower than both the 7900 XT and XTX.\n\nHowever, things change at 4K. Here, the 9070 XT outperformed not only the 5070 Ti but also the 7900 XTX, delivering an impressive 87 fps on average.\n\nThe Last of Us Part I\n\nIn The Last of Us Part I, the 9070 XT was 5% slower than the 5070 Ti, averaging 106 fps. This also made it a few frames slower than the 7900 XT.\n\nAt 4K, it was 3% slower than the 5070 Ti but at least 9% faster than the 7900 XT.\n\nStar Wars Outlaws\n\nPerformance in Star Wars Outlaws was solid. At 1440p, the 9070 XT was 5% slower than the 5070 Ti but 13% faster than the 7900 XT.\n\nAt 4K, it essentially matched both the 5070 Ti and 7900 XTX, making it 21% faster than the 7900 XT.\n\nStarfield\n\nFinally, we have Starfield, where the 9070 XT was 7% slower than the 5070 Ti at 1440p, delivering performance comparable to the 7900 XT.\n\nThe 4K results were more favorable, but even then, it only managed to roughly match the 5070 Ti while slightly outperforming Nvidia's RTX 4070 Ti Super.\n\nPerformance Summary\n\n1440p\n\nAcross the 18 games tested, the 9070 XT averaged 119 fps at 1440p, making it 6% slower than the 5070 Ti. AMD likely expected parity here, and while it's not far off, the Radeon GPU was still slower overall.\n\nMore concerning is AMD's claim that the 9070 XT offers a 35% improvement over the 7900 GRE in raster performance, whereas our testing found only a 20% increase in mostly rasterized workloads. Additionally, the 9070 XT is only 2% faster than the 7900 XT and 13% slower than the 7900 XTX, which is not an ideal position to be at.\n\n4K\n\nAt 4K, the 9070 XT fares slightly better, trailing the 5070 Ti by just 1% while outperforming the 7900 XT by 9%. While not an outstanding result, at a price of $600, it could still offer good value \u2013 something we will examine shortly.\n\nPower Consumption\n\nIn terms of power consumption, the Radeon 9070 XT is neither exceptional nor disappointing, but compared to RDNA 3, there is little improvement. As seen in testing, it delivers performance similar to the 7900 XT while consuming about the same amount of power.\n\nIn many cases, the 9070 XT uses around 20% more power than the 5070 Ti while delivering slightly weaker performance.\n\nRay Tracing Benchmarks\n\nRT - Metro Exodus Enhanced\n\nWhen it comes to ray tracing performance, the 9070 XT is significantly better than RDNA 3 GPUs such as the 7900 XT and even the 7900 XTX. In Metro Exodus at 1440p, the 9070 XT was 9% slower than the 5070 Ti but also 34% faster than the 7900 XT and 12% faster than the XTX.\n\nAt 4K, it trailed the 5070 Ti by a 12% margin, yet outperformed the 7900 XTX by 18% and the 7900 XT by a massive 44%.\n\nRT - Alan Wake II\n\nPerformance in Alan Wake II isn't great, but this is the first Radeon GPU capable of exceeding 30 fps at 1440p with upscaling while using high ray tracing settings. That's a notable achievement. The 9070 XT delivered a 44% uplift over the 7900 XTX, but despite this, it remained 36% slower than the 5070 Ti.\n\nAt 4K, the demands are extreme, with even the 5070 Ti managing only 31 fps on average.\n\nRT - Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty\n\nThe 9070 XT's ultra ray tracing performance in Cyberpunk 2077 is quite impressive. At 1440p with upscaling, it rendered 68 fps, making it just 8% slower than the 5070 Ti \u2013 an outstanding result for a Radeon GPU. This also meant it was 24% faster than the 7900 XTX and 51% faster than the 7900 XT.\n\nAs expected, performance at 4K with upscaling is more challenging, but even then, the 9070 XT was only 12% slower than the 5070 Ti while still outperforming the 7900 XTX by 29%.\n\nRT - Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered\n\nDespite encountering a CPU bottleneck in Spider-Man Remastered, the 9070 XT was still 22% faster than the 7900 XTX at 1440p.\n\nAt 4K, the 9070 XT trailed the 5070 Ti by just 7%, though it was a few frames slower than the XTX.\n\nRT - Dying Light 2 Stay Human\n\nNext, we have Dying Light 2, where the 9070 XT was 14% slower than the 5070 Ti at 1440p, but still slightly faster than the 7900 XTX \u2013 another strong result.\n\nAt 4K, it once again edged out the XTX, though it remained 29% slower than the 5070 Ti.\n\nRT - Black Myth: Wukong\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong remains a tough challenge for Radeon GPUs. The 9070 XT managed just 30 fps at 1440p, which is an almost 60% improvement over the 7900 XTX but still only half the performance of the 5070 Ti.\n\nGiven that, there's little need to discuss the 4K results \u2013 but for completeness, they are included.\n\nRT - Indiana Jones and the Great Circle\n\nFinally, in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, the 9070 XT struggled, delivering just 17 fps at 1440p with upscaling.\n\nThe 4K results were even worse, though at this point, none of these GPUs provided what could be considered playable performance.\n\nRay Tracing Performance Summary\n\n1440p\n\nHere's a look at the average ray tracing performance at 1440p. The 9070 XT was 21% slower than the 5070 Ti but an impressive 26% faster than the 7900 XTX. With RDNA 4, AMD has made significant strides in ray tracing performance.\n\n4K\n\nMany of the 4K results were disappointing for the Radeon 9070 XT, though the 5070 Ti also struggled in several titles. Even so, based on the data, the 9070 XT was, on average, 25% slower than the 5070 Ti.\n\nCost per Frame\n\nMSRP\n\nNow, it's time for the all-important cost-per-frame analysis, starting with MSRP. However, MSRP is often misleading, particularly for Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs, which are difficult to find at their suggested prices.\n\nIf the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti was readily available at $750 \u2013 which it currently isn't \u2013 the 9070 XT would offer just 15% better value. While that is reasonable, AMD has historically (in our opinion) needed to provide at least 20% better value to secure a strong recommendation in reviews.\n\nWith RDNA 4, however, AMD has improved ray tracing performance and introduced FSR 4, which we are in the process of analyzing and will have a dedicated feature with tons of details very soon. Given these advancements, a 15% value advantage might be enough to earn a recommendation. We'll discuss this more shortly, but first, let's examine the \"real\" MSRP situation.\n\nReal MSRP\n\nIf AMD can launch the 9070 XT at $600 \u2013 which multiple reliable sources indicate they can and will \u2013 then the card would offer 29% better value than the 5070 Ti.\n\nThis is a key factor because, based on sales data, AMD typically needs to deliver at least 30% greater value than the nearest GeForce competitor to convince GeForce owners to switch to Radeon.\n\nRetail\n\nComparing the Radeon 9070 XT to the best retail prices from mid-2024, it still presents a strong value proposition. It delivers nearly 20% better value than the discounted 7900 XT, which has been AMD's best value offering in this performance segment. Additionally, it offers 26% better value than the 4070 Ti Super.\n\nWhat We Learned\n\nSo there you have it \u2013 the new Radeon RX 9070 XT. On one hand, we feel some people will be disappointed with its performance, even considering the price. Perhaps that's on AMD and their performance claims, which we'll address soon. However, in the current market, the Radeon 9070 XT offers solid value and is worthy of recommendation.\n\nThere are two main conclusions to draw here:\n\nIf the RTX 5070 Ti remains well above MSRP \u2013 typically around $900, with poor availability \u2013 then at $600, the 9070 XT is a no-brainer. It offers nearly 30% better value, making it the obvious choice.\n\nIf the RTX 5070 Ti drops to its $750 MSRP, then the 9070 XT becomes 20% cheaper to purchase and offers only 15% better cost-per-frame value. It is also over 20% slower on average in ray tracing, meaning buyers would have to weigh the trade-offs. Saving $150 by choosing the 9070 XT seems like the logical decision for most, but whether AMD can convince most gamers is another question. Based on past data, this may not be enough to convert GeForce owners.\n\nIt's also worth noting that while we've compared the Radeon 9070 XT's performance to the GeForce 5070 Ti, its pricing is much closer to the standard RTX 5070. However, the RTX 5070 is a poor-value option, offering just 12GB of VRAM, which means we won't recommend it. Comparing the 9070 XT to a GPU we already advise against seems like a waste of time.\n\nCost-Per-Frame and Upscaling Quality Considerations\n\nInternally, when we evaluated the Radeon 7000 vs. GeForce RTX 40 series, we agreed that AMD needed to offer at least 20% better cost-per-frame value for a Radeon GPU to earn our recommendation.\n\nHowever, with the Radeon 9000 vs. GeForce RTX 50 series we believe this threshold can be adjusted downward to 15% thanks to the improved ray tracing performance and because AMD's upscaling technology has improved dramatically, closing the gap to DLSS.\n\nFull disclosure: we are still busy investigating FSR 4, so it's a little to early to call right now, but what we can say is FSR4 is worlds better than FSR3. Whether gamers at large will feel the same remains to be seen, and AMD may still need to aim for a 30% discount to truly attract buyers.\n\nA Question of Value\n\nIn a world where the 9070 XT can be purchased for $600 and the 5070 Ti for $750, it's difficult to recommend one over the other, there are pros and cons both ways, which is why we felt for AMD to really crush Nvidia's mid-range this generation the 9070 XT would have to hit $550... but, if supply of the 5070 Ti remains weak, and therefore prices remain sky high, the 9070 XT should still come out on top.\n\nIf AMD can maintain a 20% cost-per-frame advantage over the 5070 Ti, then the 9070 XT becomes the obvious choice \u2013 no debate necessary. Just buy the Radeon GPU and enjoy the savings.\n\nAMD's Performance Claims: Overly Inflated?\n\nNow to change gears for a moment, one concern is that AMD may have set unrealistic expectations for the 9070 XT. Comparing it to the 7900 GRE while citing heavily inflated performance figures \u2013 at least relative to our independent testing \u2013 doesn't help its case.\n\nAMD claimed the 9070 XT was, on average, 35% faster than the GRE in raster performance. However, our testing found only a 20% improvement.\n\nFor example, AMD's claims vs. our actual results:\n\nDragon Age \u2192 AMD: 39% | Our result: 25%\n\nStarfield \u2192 AMD: 32% | Our result: 20%\n\nStalker 2 \u2192 AMD: 29% | Our result: 16%\n\nPerhaps in games without built-in benchmarks, AMD is testing in areas with lighter loads. Regardless, AMD's numbers make the GRE appear much slower than it actually is. If the 9070 XT was truly 35% faster than the GRE, it would match the 7900 XTX and RTX 4080 Super, and many people expected that based on AMD's first-party benchmarks.\n\n\"Real\" Pricing, Again\n\nFinally, we have some concerns about how \"real\" the $600 MSRP actually is. After some investigation, it appears that AMD is providing retailers with a $50 rebate to achieve the $600 pricing. This strongly suggests the intended MSRP was actually $650, and AMD is temporarily subsidizing models to hit the lower price point.\n\nFor example, XFX confirmed that the 9070 XT Mercury \u2013 a model featured in this review \u2013 will not cost $650. In fact, it won't even cost $700. Instead, the official MSRP is $770, and due to tariffs, its on-shelf price is expected to be $850 \u2013 which would be tragic if true.\n\nFrom what we've gathered, it seems AMD is starting to play Nvidia's pricing game. This means that while some 9070 XT models may be available at $600 initially, most will likely be priced higher, and restocks at that price may be limited or infrequent. A lot will depend on how sales perform. AMD has a large stock of Radeon 9070 GPUs, so if demand slows after launch, we expect them to continue offering rebates to keep pricing competitive. However, we will have to wait and see how that plays out.\n\nAs things stand, the Radeon RX 9070 XT is a strong offering that we expect will sell extremely well at $600. However, whether that price holds long-term is questionable. We've also heard from multiple sources that supply is excellent. If that's the case, then AMD may end up selling more 9070 XT units than Nvidia has sold 5090, 5080, 5070, and 5070 Ti units combined \u2013 which would be crazy, and on that bombshell, we'll end this review right here.\n\nShopping Shortcuts:",

The gaming and AI powerhouse has a 90% unit market share, according to Jon Peddie Research, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 4.17%) in a distant second place. While Nvidia's market share fluctuates, the company has held an enormous lead over AMD for years.\n\nOver the past few years, Nvidia's data center business has exploded as demand for AI accelerators boomed. In the fourth quarter of Nvidia's fiscal 2025, data center revenue was nearly 14 times larger than gaming revenue, and gaming revenue hit its lowest level in more than a year. Nvidia relies on TSMC for manufacturing, and it's prioritizing its pricey artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators over its gaming graphics cards.\n\nThe launch of Nvidia's RX 50 series graphics cards earlier this year put the company's priorities on display. Supply was far below demand, leading to availability issues and retail pricing far above manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP). There were also a variety of issues, including quality control shortfalls that led to some graphics cards shipping with defective hardware and software driver bugs.\n\nAMD is also focusing on AI accelerators, but the company's forecast for AI sales this year fell short of expectations. With Nvidia seemingly checked out of the gaming graphics processing unit (GPU) market as AI chip sales soar, AMD has an opportunity to win over gamers with its RX 9000 series graphics cards.\n\nPlaying catch-up\n\nAMD will launch its RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards later this week, priced at $549 and $599, respectively. If AMD can manage to muster enough supply and keep retail prices close to MSRP, these cards should be a hit.\n\nWhile third-party reviews aren't yet available as of this writing, AMD is promising up to 40% higher gaming performance compared to its last-generation graphics cards. The company will ship both models with 16 GB of graphics memory, while Nvidia's RTX 5070 comes with just 12 GB. The RTX 5070 launches this week as well, at an MSRP of $549, but snagging one at that price may be impossible depending on demand.\n\nRay tracing and AI-powered features are two reasons why gamers have flocked to Nvidia's graphics cards, and in both areas, AMD is claiming to have made some serious progress. AMD is promising more than double the ray tracing throughput per compute unit for its new graphics cards, which should help close the ray tracing gap with Nvidia. Ray tracing has long been an Achilles' heel for AMD's graphics cards, but the company appears to finally be taking the technology seriously\n\nAMD also touted a new version of its FidelityFX Super Resolution feature, which uses machine learning to upscale images while reducing visual artifacts. Combined with frame generation and anti-lag features, AMD is pushing ahead in an area where Nvidia has historically been in the lead. A new generation of AI accelerators built into the RX 9000 series graphics cards enable these new features.\n\nLater this year, AMD plans to extend the RX 9000 series lineup with RX 9060 products that target lower price points. While Nvidia has been untouchable at the high-end of the market, AMD has generally been far more competitive in the mid-range.\n\nAMD's time to shine\n\nIf there was ever a time for AMD to claw back market share from Nvidia, it's right now. With the AI boom still in full force, consuming Nvidia's manufacturing allocation at TSMC and forcing the company to treat gaming GPUs as second-class citizens, AMD has an opportunity to swoop in and provide gamers with an alternative.\n\nWhile Nvidia's ultrahigh-end graphics cards get a lot of attention, most of the volume in the graphics card market occurs at lower price points. The most used graphics cards, according to Steam's hardware and software survey, are mid-range cards: Nvidia's RTX 4060, RTX 3060, and RTX 4060 TI. Even the GTX 1060, which is nearly 9 years old, is still in wider use on Steam than any AMD graphics card. If AMD can provide an upgrade path, along with enough supply to keep a lid on retail prices, the RX 9000 series could be its biggest seller in years.",

            "content": "AMD Exec: Dell Commercial PC Deal To Cover Broad Customer Base\n\nIn an interview with CRN, Rahul Tikoo, the head of AMD\u2019s client business unit, says the chip designer is supplying Ryzen AI chips for 10 commercial PC designs from Dell Technologies and outlines how the company plans to win in this year\u2019s Windows 11 PC refresh.\n\nThe head of AMD\u2019s client CPU business said the chip designer is supplying Ryzen AI chips for 10 laptops and desktops from Dell Technologies to cover a broad range of customers as part of a landmark commercial PC deal the two firms announced in January.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re bringing together to the market [are] 10 different products, all commercial PCs across notebooks and desktops, with a variety of price points and a variety of screen sizes and a variety of form factors,\u201d said Rahul Tikoo, vice president and general manager of AMD\u2019s client business unit, in an interview with CRN last month.\n\n[Related: How Arm Is Winning Over AWS, Google, Microsoft And Nvidia In Data Centers]\n\nThose products will start to appear in March, according to Tikoo, who returned to AMD last year after spending 12 years in leadership positions at Dell.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very broad portfolio covering 75 [percent], 80 percent of the commercial PC marketplace, in a way meeting the customer where they are in their journey,\u201d he said.\n\nTikoo provided the details after AMD revealed in January that the company won its first deal to supply Ryzen AI Pro chips to commercial PCs made by Dell after the OEM previously held off from expanding its CPU options beyond rival Intel for the segment.\n\nThe PC vendor\u2019s new Dell Pro portfolio of notebooks and desktops will come with options for AMD\u2019s Ryzen AI 300 Pro series that debuted for AI PCs last year and expanded with midrange options in January. These chips, like the latest Intel Core Ultra processors, come with a CPU, GPU and neural processing unit (NPU), which is designed to handle sustained AI workloads such as Microsoft\u2019s Copilot+ PC features.\n\nThe Dell Pro PCs are among the more than 100 Ryzen Pro-based enterprise platforms OEMs plan to introduce this year, according to AMD. Other supporting vendors include HP Inc. and Lenovo, which have offered AMD-based commercial PCs for years.\n\nEven without Dell\u2019s help in the commercial PC space, AMD managed to grow its x86 CPU market share in the segment by 4.5 points year over year to 24.6 percent against Intel in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, according to data from Mercury Research that was provided by AMD.\n\nDisty Exec: Dell Could Give AMD Boost With Fed Customers\n\nA senior executive at U.S. distribution giant D&H Distributing told CRN that while he thinks AMD\u2019s commercial PC deal with Dell could help the chip designer make further inroads with enterprise and SMB customers, the agreement could allow AMD to make an even greater impact among federal government customers.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s an area where they would have an opportunity to gain a lot of market share, and Dell could definitely help them get into the fed space much faster,\u201d said Marty Bauerlein, D&H\u2019s chief consumer and commercial officer who previously led North America VAR channels and commercial distribution at AMD.\n\nBauerlein said he doesn\u2019t think the sweeping cuts to the U.S. government\u2014enacted by billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency team and faced with multiple legal challenges\u2014will stymie AMD\u2019s prospects or overall IT spending in the space.\n\n\u201cI don't think fed business will slow down at all. IT is a weapon at the end of the day, and whoever has the best IT wins, so the federal government will continue to spend a disproportionate amount of the budget on IT products,\u201d he said.\n\nTikoo Calls Windows 11 Refresh \u2018Massive\u2019 Opportunity For AMD\n\nTikoo called the Windows 11 refresh, driven by Microsoft\u2019s end of support for Windows 10 this October, a \u201cmassive\u201d opportunity for AMD, for which the company has deployed programs to win deals with channel partners by market and by segment.\n\n\u201cThere are about 900 million PCs out there that require a Windows 11 refresh. Of those 900 million PCs, [roughly] half of them cannot be upgraded to a Windows 11. So they need a modern PC to be able to run Windows 11. And so if you look at that stat, that's larger than the entire PC market, right?\u201d he said.\n\nTikoo said he has received strong indications from customers that they are considering the purchase of AI PCs to replace devices that are not eligible for Windows 11 or were hastily purchased during the COVID-19 pandemic roughly four to five years ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not heard a single customer that I had talked to directly that are not thinking about an AI PC as they refresh, because again, as they're refreshing, they\u2019re thinking about the next three to five years and they\u2019re future proofing their purchases,\u201d he said.\n\nThis puts AMD in an enviable position, according to Tikoo, because its Ryzen AI processors are the \u201cbest ones\u201d in the market for AI PC capabilities and multitasking on top of providing the AMD Pro Technologies platform for deploying, securing and managing PCs.\n\n\u201cOur opportunity is we want to win in the refresh. But as customers are deciding what to buy in the refresh, they're deciding to buy AI PCs, and we're leading in AI PCs from a technology standpoint. And so the choice becomes very easy for them,\u201d he said.\n\nTikoo said one unique aspect of AMD\u2019s commercial PC chip portfolio is that the Ryzen AI 300 Pro series use the same image platform as the company\u2019s Ryzen 200 Pro series, which comes with a slower NPU at lower price points.\n\nThis means customers can more easily deploy and manage PC fleets running a mix of Ryzen AI 300 Pro and Ryzen 200 Pro processors, according to Tikoo. It also gives customers greater flexibility in allocating PCs with Ryzen AI 300 Pro chips for employees with higher performance needs and giving everyone else computers with Ryzen 200 Pro chips.\n\n\u201cThat's exactly what that enables us to do with Dell,\u201d he said.\n\nTikoo On Ryzen AI 300 Pro PC ASPs, Tariffs Impact\n\nGiven the choice between the Ryzen AI 300 Pro and Ryzen 200 Pro processors, Tikoo said he thinks enterprises will lean into the former because of their leadership capabilities, which, unlike the latter, makes them eligible to run Microsoft\u2019s Copilot+ PCs.\n\nWith the Ryzen AI 300 Pro series expanding to mid-range Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 options in January after launching with high-end Ryzen 9 models last year, the lineup will support PCs ranging in price from $600 to more than $1,000, according to Tikoo.\n\n\u201cThere's a lot of assortment in the broad mainstream space that is available for our customers,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked about how U.S. tariffs could impact demand for AMD processors, Tikoo said he doesn\u2019t expect the company to \u201chave any challenges around that\u201d because of its \u201cdiverse supply chain\u201d and the technology needs of its customers.\n\nTikoo made the remarks on Feb. 21, more than a week after President Donald Trump enacted 25 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada on Tuesday, which is when he also doubled tariffs on Chinese products to 20 percent.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, I\u2019m sure as our customers think through business continuity planning and what they need to do, we\u2019re supporting them through their needs,\u201d he said.",

The motherboard comes in an ITX form factor and is powered by a Dragon Range AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX3D; it will also have two SODIMM slots that accept DDR5-5200 RAM up to 96GB and two M.2 2280 PCIe 5.0 x4 NVMe SSD that can give it a total capacity of 4TB. More importantly, it seems that the motherboard also comes equipped with a PCIe 5.0 x16 slot, similar to what you find on the Minisforum BD770i, although the Minisforum website does not specifically say that. This opens the door to using powerful desktop graphics cards.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Motherboard BD790i X3D Form Factor ITX CPU AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX3D, 16C/32T TDP 100W GPU Integrated AMD Radeon 610M Memory DDR5-5200 Dual Channel 2x SODIMM up to 96GB Storage 2x M.2 2280 PCIe 5.0 x4 NVMe SSD up to 4TB Wireless Connectivity Wi-Fi 6E + Bluetooth 5.3 Headers and Connectors 1x 24-pin main power connector, 1x 8-pin +12V CPU power connector, 1x 4-pin CPU fan header, 2x 4-pin SYS fan header, 1x system panel header, 1x front panel audio header (F_AUDIO), 1x USB 3.2 Gen1 header Video Output 1x HDMI 2.1 FRL x1 (Up to 8K@60/4K@120), 1x DP1.4 (Up to 8K@60/4K@120) Audio Output 1x HDMI, 1x Line Out Audio Input 1x Line In, 1x Mic In I/O Ports 1x RJ45 2.5 Gigabit LAN, 2x USB 2.0 Type-A, 2x USB 3.2 Gen1 Type-A, 1x USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-C (Alt DP), 1x CLR COMS Recommended Power Supply ATX Power (>200W) OS Support Windows 11\n\nAnother interesting thing we found with the BD790i X3D is the massive heatsink that comes with it, which covers nearly 80% of the motherboard surface. The heatsink is topped a single 12cm fan, which should provide better, quieter cooling than in laptops specced with this processor. It also has a smaller active SSD cooler, ensuring your system can maintain PCIe 5.0 transfer speeds even after hours of using it. This cooling configuration could help the entire motherboard run at a lower temperature even while under heavy load, and even help reduce fan noise.\n\nIf you choose to skip putting a discrete GPU on the motherboard, the 7945HX3D CPU has an integrated Radeon 610M GPU. While this is no powerhouse, it should be more than enough for you to run older retro titles and competitive games that focus on system performance over image quality. It\u2019s also equipped with DP 1.4, HDMI 2.1, and USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C (Alt DP) ports, allowing you to have a triple-monitor setup for the ultimate in productivity even if you don\u2019t have dedicated graphics yet.\n\n(Image credit: Minisforum)\n\nAlthough you\u2019re not getting the latest Fire Range 9955HX3D CPU with the BD790i X3D, the 7945HX3D is still a respectably fast processor. It might feel a bit expensive, though, at $599, especially as you could get an AM5 motherboard for about $150 and the 7800X3D for around $450. Still, the smaller profile of Minisforum\u2019s custom-designed heatsink and the lower TDP of the mobile X3D chip should be enough to entice users who prefer a more compact system over raw horsepower and the desktop footprint that usually means.",

The Toyshop tech demo is truly not reflective of the version of FSR 4 that will be available in 30 games upon launch on March 6th and is more of a sneak peek into how the technology will continue to evolve.\"\n\nSo, it's mostly about path tracing, which is why you can see the same sort of tell-tale ghosting effects you will have seen from Nvidia's path tracing in Cyberpunk 2077 with its own Ray Reconstruction denoiser. Looks like it's got the same issues right now.\n\nKinda feel like maybe AMD should have been a little more clear about what the demo was from the start, or even maybe held it back from a reveal of specific GPUs.\n\nOriginal story March 3, 2025: The dust has begun to settle on AMD's RX 9000-series announcement, and I've finally had the chance to sit back and look over some of the footage in more detail, rather than scrambling to write about the impressive pricing of the new cards.\n\nAnd while I'm definitely jubilant about the idea of serious competition in the mid-range GPU market, I can't help but notice that AMD's Toyshop tech demo showed some artifacting that makes me more than a little concerned about some of AMD's image quality-enhancing tech.\n\nToyshop Realtime Path Tracing Neural Rendering Tech Demo - YouTube Watch On\n\nAMD says Toyshop is stuffed with cutting-edge graphics tech, including path tracing, neural super sampling denoising, and ReStir lighting computation techniques. It follows a little robot in its journey around, what else, a toy shop, before it makes its way out into a futuristic street filled with fast-moving flying cars. It should be an impressive tech demo of just how far AMD has come with graphics technology in order to compete with Nvidia's offerings\u2014but in parts, I have to admit it made me wince.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFor a start, there's a lot of ghosting. In the fast moving car section, it's tempting to write off some visible artifacts as egregious use of motion blur, but zooming in on screenshots from the footage reveals some serious visual errors.\n\nIn the shot below, take a close look at the red building in the background. There's a lot of blurry pixel smearing on an object that is otherwise supposed to be static. Then allow your eyes to move towards the green car in the foreground, with speckled, noisy artifacts on the interior and indistinct, edge-smeared headlights, before finally coming to rest on the green car in the top right quarter of the shot\u2014which appears to be, err, glitching through time.\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\nI would assume that FSR 4 was involved in the running of this particular demonstration, given that all the visual doohickeys have been turned up to 11. Seeing all the artifacting introduced here I can only hope that it was perhaps running in some sort of Performance mode as a potential explanation for some of the issues, although that's pure guesswork on my part.\n\nNevertheless, I happened to be glancing at the YouTube chat window when this demo was unveiled, and it was full of people noticing the very same things I did\u2014it's simply full of visual errors, and even streaming compression can't hide them.\n\nThe scene with the robot staring (briefly) into the mirror at around 0:34 reveals some shimmering in the reflection as it turns and flies towards the camera, making me wonder if it was deliberately scripted to block the shot to prevent more ray tracing nasties from making an appearance. And, at the end of the video, there's a very, very brief shot of some foliage surrounding a gate. Apologies all, but I'm very quick with the screenshot capture button:\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\nEeesh. Ignore the ticker-tape like effect and the black elements on the right hand side of the screenshot, as that's a transition towards the AMD logo at the end. Look to the left, and you get a clear idea why AMD might want to quickly move on.\n\nAll in all, for something that was supposed to be a triumphant demonstration of AMD's prowess with graphical rendering, it really didn't impress me in the way I might have hoped. You don't need me to analyse it frame by frame to know that there are artifacts here that don't bode well for image quality with the new cards.\n\nAnd that makes me wonder. While price to performance ratios are very important in deciding which graphics card to go for in a new generation, Nvidia has traditionally been able to beat AMD over the head with its superior image quality, especially thanks to DLSS.\n\nAnd now DLSS 4 is here, with impressive visuals, relatively minimal artifacting and Multi Frame Generation, I wonder how many people will favour Nvidia once more if AMD loses out when it comes to image quality. Especially now they can potentially quadruple their frame rate with minimal quality loss if they pick an RTX 50-series card.\n\nStill, this is merely a short demo. I'll be testing out DLSS 4 versus FSR 4 (and all the new AMD image quality upgrades) myself at the earliest opportunity to perform a more in-depth analysis, and I'm very intrigued to see what AMD has been cooking. By the looks of this demo, however, my expectations in general have been tempered\u2014and that might be cause for concern for potential buyers of the otherwise-impressive looking RX 9070-series cards.",

            "content": "We\u2019re at T-minus eight months before Microsoft officially gives Windows 10 the boot. PC gamers in particular seem unready to let go of the operating system, which might start causing headaches if they intend to upgrade their hardware. For example, AMD\u2019s new Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT graphics cards will require UEFI instead of ye olde BIOS.\n\nUnified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is an upgrade to the pre-boot BIOS setup that most people are used to, and odds are good that you already have it if your desktop PC \u2014 or the motherboard inside \u2014 is less than 10 years old. (In fact, lots of people use the terms UEFI and BIOS interchangeably. Even some technology journalists\u2026 ahem.)\n\nAMD just announced that all its graphics cards starting with the 9000 series and onward will have \u201cUEFI-only support,\u201d in a document spotted by VideoCardz.com.\n\nAs I said, most PC users are already on a UEFI system at this point, since Windows 11 requires UEFI for Secure Boot and other security features. But \u201cmost\u201d is a long way from \u201call\u201d \u2014 in fact, more than 40 percent of Steam users are still on Windows 10, which boots just fine on older BIOS setups. (It\u2019s impossible to know which Windows 10 users are still running an older motherboard with BIOS instead of UEFI based on Steam data alone.)\n\nGet Windows 11 Pro for cheap Windows 11 Pro\n\nAs VideoCardz points out, AMD\u2019s announcement doesn\u2019t flat-out declare that the new 9000-series cards won\u2019t work on a motherboard running BIOS, or on a UEFI board with the more forgiving CSM (Compatibility Support Module) enabled. But support and performance won\u2019t be guaranteed for these older boards, even with CSM turned on.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, even if you decide to keep running Windows 10 on your desktop past Microsoft\u2019s self-imposed end-of-service date, there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t upgrade your motherboard and install Windows 10 instead of Windows 11. But as we reach and move beyond that date, these kinds of issues are likely to pop up more frequently.",

Although it is specially crafted for X3D processors, Colorful says that the \"X3D Gaming Mode\" can be used on non-X3D processors as well.\n\nThis includes all the Ryzen 7000 and Ryzen 9000 processors that are installed on Colorful's AM5 motherboards. Colorful published a short video on Weibo illustrating the operation of X3D Gaming Mode on its AM5 motherboards, such as the B650 chipset. The feature can be found inside the BIOS, and once it is turned on, it turns off the SMT (Simultaneous Multi-Threading) on processors, and depending on whether the CPU has one CCD or two CCDs, it disables the other for transferring the gaming workload totally on one CCD.\n\nThis helps the X3D processors immensely, as the CCD with an extra L3 cache will perform better and, with the second CCD disabled, the latency is reduced, which affects performance. On the other hand, the feature will also help elevate the performance of non-X3D processors, as in some scenarios, switching off SMT does improve performance, but this varies with scenarios.\n\nOverall, for processors like Ryzen 9 9900X3D and Ryzen 9 9950X3D, the X3D Gaming Mode is more ideal than on the single CCD non-X3D processors. Keep in mind that the performance of the Ryzen 9 9900X3D may be affected noticeably when one of its CCDs gets disabled. Since the processor brings only six cores on each CCD, it may not be ideal for a lot of users.\n\nHowever, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D will totally behave like a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is currently the fastest gaming processor on the planet. The Colorful X3D Gaming Mode reminds us of Gigabyte's X3D Turbo Mode, but the latter works a bit differently and doesn't disable SMT or CCD but tweaks some CPU parameters.\n\nBoth of these technologies are accessed from the BIOS and one has to experiment with them to find out what works for them the best and what does not. As far as Colorful's claims are concerned, it showed an improvement of 17% performance in PUBG when the X3D Gaming Mode was turned on, which is defintely impressive.",

The move, which could come as soon as this month, will be made to reduce the country\u2019s dependence on Western-owned technology. It comes only a matter of hours after President Trump confirmed a further $100 billion investment in the U.S. by chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM).\n\nRISC-V is used to design a range of less-sophisticated chips, from those in smartphones to CPUs for artificial intelligence servers. As reported by Reuters it competes globally with proprietary and more commonly used chip architecture technology including x86, dominated by U.S. firms Intel (INTC), AMD and Arm Holdings (ARM). AMD shares were down slightly in pre-market trading, as were Intel and Nvidia.\n\nReuters reported that the policy is being drafted jointly by eight government bodies including the Cyberspace Administration of China, China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Science and Technology, and the China National Intellectual Property Administration.\n\nMore Headaches for U.S. Tech\n\nThe move is likely to boost Chinese chip design firms and tech firms such as Alibaba (BABA) which is a for-profit RISC-V intellectual property provider.\n\nIt would mark a further blow to U.S. tech firms which were left reeling after the emergence of Chinese AI group DeepSeek earlier this year. It offers AI models with similar capabilities to those of its American rivals and at a lower cost. It is understood that DeepSeek could boost adoption of RISC-V because it runs on those less powerful chips.

            "content": "All You Need for Gaming \u2013 AMD RDNA\u2122 4 and RX 9000 Series Reveal - YouTube Watch On\n\nJames Bentley, hardware writer (Image credit: Future) This week: I've been keeping an eye on launching Nvidia cards and furiously typing away on the most gorgeously retro C64-themed keyboard.\n\nI've been a fan of AMD's CPUs for some time, but I've never made the move over to its graphics cards. With Nvidia being the market leader, some system requirements don't even list its competitors, and this has led me to (perhaps unfairly) looking over them in favour of Nvidia.\n\nI've always felt like the number of devs creating games with Nvidia's technologies in mind has been a bit higher, and I have never really had the time to fully dig into if that's true. As shameless as it may be to admit, Nvidia cards have always been just fine for me, and I've never felt the need for my eyes to wander elsewhere.\n\nHowever, that might have just changed for me. The RTX 50-series is in a very strange spot, with some cards missing ROPs, and some cards facing black screen issues. The RTX 5090 coming in at $2,000, with the next most expensive card launching at $999, is an awful lot of money for an upgrade that, while impressive, may not feel all that much bigger to those on 40-series cards. This is especially true if you don't plan on using Multi Frame Gen. This is all at MSRP as well, which many of these cards are unlikely to sell at for a few months.\n\nAMD itself had made a few blunders in the GPU department, too. We were anticipating details on the Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT launch way back at CES 2025 and didn't really get that. Nvidia sort of stole the show with performance figures, pricing, and launch windows and left AMD scrabbling around for another date to spill the beans.\n\nFollowing the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 immediately selling out, AMD announced it would have a wide assortment of cards available for its launch in March, but it needed to actually convince prospective buyers to get their order in. There was plenty of ground for AMD to crawl back market share, and its presentation would be its chance of doing so. Within just 30 minutes of showing its new cards, I was more convinced than I'd ever been.\n\nAfter some technical figures on RDNA 4, AMD's latest GPU architecture, it gave real information on how much better it performs rasterisation and ray tracing than previous cards. Crucially, it showed how this advanced GPU tech makes the cards perform better and how FSR 4, AMD's answer to Nvidia's DLSS 4, is being implemented. Like FSR 3, it can upscale frames and implement frame generation for higher fps, and this is all finished off with AMD's anti-lag software, so all those 'fake frames' don't add too much latency.\n\nImage 1 of 4 (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD)\n\nThe acknowledgement of FSR 4 is a necessary part of the presentation, given Multi Frame Gen is one of the biggest new upgrades in the Nvidia RTX 50-series. However, none of this is what convinced me.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe thing that really sold me on the potential of the RX 9070 and 9070 XT cards isn't these upgraded software techniques, it's how well worded and precisely antagonistic the presentation felt. The RX 9070 XT outperforms the RX 7900 GRE at 4K by anywhere between 20% to 60%, but it also shows a 2% bump above the RTX 5070 Ti with overclocked cards of its 9070 XT card. Where AMD could have just compared performance to previous AMD cards, it instead directly references the 5070 Ti and says, \"The 9070 XT, powered by RDNA 4, is able to deliver fantastic performance for $150 less\".\n\nThis is followed up by saying, \"Across some of the most popular titles, the 9070 XT is the best choice for your next gaming PC when looking at raw gaming performance\".\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD)\n\nThis comparison isn't fully straightforward as overclocked cards are being pushed beyond the normal limits and, therefore, offer better performance at the expense of thermals and power demands, neither of which are noted here. It is also comparing 'native' performance, so this is presumably without upscaling\u2014something Nvidia cards perform well. But beating out a $749-going-on-$999 card that many can't even get their hands on for $599 is one hell of a selling point.\n\nNow, we're still waiting for performance to come out for both AMD's cards and Nvidia's upcoming $549 card (the RTX 5070), but AMD has made hay while the sun shines. This feels like one of the best chances it's had in some time to bring the fight to Nvidia, and it has really grasped the opportunity. AMD ignoring the high-end but focusing on these specific price points could be what wins out for it in the long-term.\n\nAs someone who only recently upgraded to the RTX 4070 Super, I'm not currently in the market for an upgrade, but if I were, I think this is the most I'd ever be tempted to go for that full Team Red build.",

Since we have reviewed many Tiny systems previously, this one felt interesting enough to revive the series because it introduces a number of fundamental changes. We also managed to add a lot more RAM than the official specs list. Let us get into it.\n\nLenovo ThinkCentre M75q Tiny Gen5 Overview\n\nFor this one, we have a video:\n\nAs always, we suggest watching the video in its own tab, browser, or app for the best viewing experience.\n\nWe purchased this unit for just over $800 with mediocre discounts a few weeks ago. Lenovo pricing is discount-heavy, and sometimes, promotions and deals can make prices vary wildly. Our unit had 16GB of RAM, 512GB NVMe SSD, and an AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 8700GE. We also got Windows 11 Pro with the system.\n\nGiven where we are at in the product cycle, this system is still mostly found new, but we should start to see the used platforms increasingly hit the market over the next 6 to 36 months which will lower prices. That is why we are doing this one now.\n\nLenovo ThinkCentre M75q Tiny Gen5 External Hardware Overview\n\nThe system itself looks like several generations of Lenovo Tiny ~1L systems before it.\n\nLenovo has a headset jack, the power button and three USB ports on the front. Something nice is that Lenovo labels its ports well showing all are USB 3.2 Gen2 10Gbps ports. Two are Type-A with one being an always on port. The third is a USB Type-C port. Unfortunately, this seems to only be a USB port.\n\nOn the side, we get vents.\n\nOn the other side, we get more vents.\n\nOn the rear, we get a standard Lenovo rectangle power input, a DisplayPort, USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A port, HDMI port, then three USB Type-A ports.\n\nNetworking is still Realtek 1GbE. Unlike some of the other 1L PCs, Lenovo has one external antenna for its WiFi 6E.\n\nThere are also two optional ports. Our system came with an extra DisplayPort and there is an option for the second port then to be a serial port. Lenovo has a few different options on what can go into this system.\n\nFor many, this is going to lack the display outputs for a multi-display workstation which is a bummer. It feels like Lenovo could have pushed to have more display connectivity than they have in this system.\n\nA fun one is that since Lenovo is a big company, we get big warnings that we do not see on systems from smaller vendors. We will have a fun story about the \u201cbutton cell or coin battery\u201d when we get inside the system.\n\nNext, let us get inside the system.",

Thankfully for the prospective high-end builder, one of AMD's best CPUs has dropped to a low, low price, allowing more room in your budget to combo with one of Nvidia and AMD's newest GPU releases.\n\nThe 8-core AMD Ryzen 7 9700X is currently available for $289 at Amazon, dropping well below its recent price trend of $315-330 and MSRP of $360. The card also comes along with a free copy of Monster Hunter Wilds, the most popular new video game this month. No indication is made as to when this sale will end, but for now, it stands as one of the best ways to get near the peak performance that Zen 5 has to offer.\n\nAMD AMD Ryzen 7 9700X CPU + Monster Hunter Wilds Bundle: was $430 now $289 at Amazon Our second pick for the best overall CPU for gaming, the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X stands tall in the enthusiast CPU market. With 8 cores and 16 threads clocked at 3.8 GHz, boost clocks reaching 5.5 GHz, and a TDP of only 65 W, the 9700X is one of the most attractive picks for Zen 5 gaming. Get it alongside one of the most exciting video game releases of 2025 as a bundle.\n\nThe Ryzen 7 9700X is perhaps the best 8-core CPU of the current generation. The chip edges ahead of Intel's i7-14700K in most tests, and at half of the power draw. AMD's 9700X is an 8-core, 16-thread CPU, which is clocked at 3.8 GHz. Of course, the chip will boost up to 5.5 GHz, and has headroom for plenty of overclocking. It also offers 32MB of L3 cache, and supports up to 192GB of RAM. The chip sits at a low 65W TDP, but the BIOS includes an optional 105W mode for those looking to push performance even higher.\n\nOur initial review of the Ryzen 7 9700X gave it a 3.5 out of 5 star rating, but in the months since its release, the 9700X has grown immensely more attractive. After firmware updates, better OS optimization, and a gradual price decline, the 9700X now stands as our second pick for the best overall CPU for gaming, and is one of the top dogs in our full CPU hierarchy. It's only beaten by AMD's X3D chips with 3D V-Cache and a few of the current gen's $400+ offerings.\n\nMonster Hunter Wild, also comes bundled with the CPU for free as part of AMD's current hardware bundle. Wilds has sold $150 million in units since releasing on February 28th, with $69 million of that coming on day one. Capcom's biggest PC launch ever has already hit 1,300,000 concurrent players and offers sprawling, half-hour-long boss fights; though with its bad performance on all hardware, you will likely need the 9700X to reach acceptable framerates.\n\nThe 9700X, as its name would suggest, is part of AMD's Ryzen 9000-series, the first processors to launch on AMD's Zen 5 platform back in July. The Granite Ridge family slots into the AM5 socket, which AMD promises to support until 2027 and beyond, and is compatible with DDR5 memory and PCIe Gen5. Zen 5 is as future-proofed as a CPU architecture can be, especially when paired with an A-series motherboard (though we might suggest sticking with B850 for the 9700X).\n\nFor more savings on the rest of your PC build, keep your eyes on our list of the best GPU deals this month, as stock continues to phase in and out and AMD's RX 9000-series GPUs release very soon.",

This is the stage after training that involves trained AI models making predictions or performing tasks, such as through chatbots.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Dominating Headlines and 10 AI Stocks Gaining Momentum Right Now\n\nIn a GitHub post published on Saturday, DeepSeek revealed that if we assume that the cost of renting one H800 chip is $2 per hour, the total daily inference cost for its V3 and R1 models is $87,072.\n\nIn comparison, the theoretical daily revenue generated by these models is $562,027, leading to a cost-profit ratio of 545%. In a year, this would add up to just over $200 million in revenue.\n\nHowever, DeepSeek has cautioned that its \"actual revenue is substantially lower\" because the cost of using its V3 model is lower than the R1 model. Moreover, only some services are monetized as web and app access is free and developers pay less during off-peak hours.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s AI models are notably a product of what is known as \u201cdistillation\u201d. Distillation, now a buzz word in the tech world, is a technique used to make cheaper and more efficient AI models. This process involves taking a large AI model, called the \u2018teacher,\u2019 and allowing it to train a smaller, more efficient \u2018student\u2019 model.\n\nEventually, this helps companies transfer knowledge from big AI systems into smaller, faster, and cheaper versions. Companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft, and even Meta are joining in on the bandwagon to develop such models. Thanks to this model, AI models can be made cheaply and efficiently, allowing businesses to save money while keeping their AI performances high.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

            "content": "AMD has officially stated that there is an RX 9060 series and that it will be arriving in Q2 of this year. That means an AMD Radeon RX 9060 and potentially an AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT will be available by the end of June, with the cards even potentially breaking cover as early as April 2025.\n\nWith AMD\u2018s hugely anticipated RX 9070 series gaming GPUs going on sale later this week, and Nvidia also primed to unleash its RTX 5070 in the next few days, the fight for the best graphics card that doesn\u2019t cost over $1,000 is wide open. However, while the RX 9070 XT, as well as the RX 9070 could potentially offer great calue, they\u2019re still going to cost at least $549. As such, the RX 9060 series is really going to be the one to watch for gamers on a budget.\n\nThe official reveal of the RX 9060 name and its release date window was made during AMD\u2019s RX 9000 series reveal, shown in the video below. With the bulk of the 32-minute video dedicated to detailing the company\u2019s new RDNA 4 architecture for GPUs, revealing the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics card specs and prices, and teasing what FSR 4 has in store, the company snuck in the new RX 9060 information right at the end.\n\nAMD corporate vice president and GM, David McAfee, proclaimed that \u201cin the second quarter of this year we\u2019ll broaden the [GPU] family even further with the RX 9060 products, which we\u2019ll tell you more about later.\u201d\n\nAs the above quote suggests, AMD provided no further details on what we can expect from the GPU(s), with no hint at pricing or specs. However, other recent rumors provide more details of what we could expect.\n\nRegular tech leaker and speculator, Moore\u2019s Law Is Dead posted a new video recently (below), which suggests the RX 9060 XT could be \u201cjust a little weaker than a 4070\u201d if the clock speed of the card is pushed hard. Otherwise, the channel claims the new AMD GPU would sit between the RTX 4060 Ti and RX 7700 XT for performance, which would still be a solid upgrade over the company\u2019s current-generation \u201c60 series\u201d card, the RX 7600 XT.\n\nOther speculation by tech rumor site Videocardz.com suggests there will be both an RX 9060 and RX 9060 XT, and that both will use a Navi 44 GPU with a 128-bit memory interface connected to 20Gbps VRAM.\n\nAs for pricing, given the naming convention AMD is now using, we\u2019d expect the RX 9060 range to be a replacement for the RX 7600 series, and those cards have MSRPs of $249 for the RX 7600 and $329 for the RX 7600 XT. As such, we would expect the RX 9060 series to demand similar prices, but it\u2019s also possible that AMD could choose to position the RX 9060 prices higher or lower than these figures.\n\nWhatever the exact specs and price of the new GPUs, we can expect them to support the improved ray tracing performance of RDNA 4 along with the improved image quality of FSR 4. When combined, this could make these new GPUs transformative for gamers on a budget.\n\nCheck out our RX 7600 review, as well as our RX 7600 XT review, for more of a sense of what sort of performance AMD\u2019s current budget GPUs offer.

(Nasdaq: ADVM), a clinical-stage company pioneering the use of gene therapy to preserve sight for life in highly prevalent ocular diseases, today announced the initiation of the ARTEMIS Phase 3 study. This pivotal trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ixo-vec (ixoberogene soroparvovec) as a one-time intravitreal (IVT) injection for patients with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\n\nARTEMIS is a US-based study evaluating a single administration of Ixo-vec (6E10 vg/eye) compared to aflibercept (2mg) every 8 weeks in approximately 284 patients with wet AMD, including both treatment-na\u00efve and previously treated patients. The primary endpoint is mean change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at one year (average of weeks 52 and 56) with a non-inferiority (NI) margin of -4.5 letters. Per FDA guidance, all patients will receive three loading doses of aflibercept prior to receiving Ixo-vec. Patients in both arms will be eligible for supplemental injections of aflibercept and will receive prophylactic steroid eye drops.\n\nARTEMIS is the first of two planned Phase 3 registrational trials to evaluate Ixo-vec in patients with wet AMD. Details on the second study, named AQUARIUS and to be conducted globally, will be forthcoming.\n\n\u201cGene therapy is recognized as the most exciting modality on the horizon for the treatment of wet AMD. Initiation of the Phase 3 ARTEMIS trial demonstrates our commitment to transforming the landscape with a one-time IVT injection to help restore vision and prevent blindness,\u201d stated Laurent Fischer, M.D., president and chief executive officer of Adverum Biotechnologies. \u201cWith over 4 years of experience, we are at the forefront and believe Ixo-vec is positioned as a best-in-class therapy to provide potentially lifelong benefit to patients who depend on frequent injections to preserve their sight. Huge kudos to my colleagues at Adverum who have worked expeditiously to initiate ARTEMIS, a pioneering effort, and who have consistently outperformed our ambitious timelines.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeveraging our robust data for Ixo-vec, the ARTEMIS Phase 3 trial was designed to enhance the potential for clinical, regulatory and commercial success,\u201d stated Rabia Gurses Ozden, MD, Chief Medical Officer at Adverum. \u201cWe have been thrilled by the enthusiasm of retina specialists for this design, including studying Ixo-vec in both treatment-na\u00efve and previously treated patients, which we expect will increase the speed of enrollment and generate a registrational dataset representative of real-world patient demographics. We are eager to generate the data necessary to seek regulatory approval and ultimately establish Ixo-vec as a transformative treatment option for a broad spectrum of wet AMD patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere continues to be tremendous unmet need for longer-acting anti-VEGF therapies. Underscoring the unmet need, recent data indicate that up to 42% of patients stop treatment for wet AMD after 2 years, which results in poor long-term vision outcomes. Ixo-vec\u2019s potential to dramatically reduce treatment burden, provide lifelong injection freedom and enhance long-term vision outcomes could deliver a compelling benefit for a large proportion of wet AMD patients,\u201d said Dr. Dante Pieramici, Medical Director of Research, California Retina Consultants and an investigator for ARTEMIS. \u201cConsistent with the strong patient preference for Ixo-vec indicated by LUNA patients, there is great interest from my patients when they hear about a therapy like Ixo-vec that has the potential to treat their disease with a single injection. I\u2019m delighted to have served as an investigator for both OPTIC and LUNA, and I look forward to working with the Adverum team on the ARTEMIS pivotal study.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen designing registrational trials for patients with wet AMD, it\u2019s not always feasible to study the therapeutic agent in a patient population that closely represents the real-world. Adverum\u2019s inclusion in ARTEMIS of both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients is intended to address a broad patient population, including those with the highest treatment burden,\u201d said Dr. Sean Adrean, Partner, Retina Consultants of Orange County and an investigator for ARTEMIS. \u201cBased on its design, I expect the data coming out of the ARTEMIS trial will be highly informative and answer the key question of how Ixo-vec is expected to perform in those patients with high injection burdens and would most benefit from gene therapy. Looking back over 2 years ago, it was a pleasure to kick-off enrollment in LUNA, Ixo-vec's Phase 2 clinical trial, and be part of that successful trial. Now today, it\u2019s a thrill to be one of the first sites to begin screening patients and contribute to Ixo-vec's Phase 3 clinical trial.\u201d\n\n\u201cDelivering continuous levels of aflibercept to reduce treatment burden and improve visual outcomes may be even more profound in treatment na\u00efve patients,\u201d said Dr. Carl Danzig, Rand Eye Institute and an investigator for ARTEMIS. \u201cIn OPTIC and LUNA, Ixo-vec has demonstrated the ability to durably produce therapeutic levels of aflibercept with an acceptable long-term safety profile, suggesting a potential lifelong benefit with a therapy that is well tolerated. It\u2019s a great pleasure to be a part of this registrational program, and I look forward to working with the Adverum team to generate data to more fully elucidate Ixo-vec\u2019s therapeutical potential for my patients.\u201d\n\nAbout the ARTEMIS Phase 3 Study\n\nThe Phase 3 ARTEMIS trial (NCT06856577) is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ixo-vec in a randomized (1:1), double-masked, sham-controlled, two-arm study. The US-based trial is intended to randomize approximately 284 patients, including both patients who are treatment na\u00efve and patients who have been previously treated.\n\nThe primary endpoint, measured at an average of weeks 52 and 56, is NI in mean BCVA change from baseline with a NI margin of -4.5 letters. The key secondary endpoint is reduction of injection burden as measured by mean number of injections received. All patients will receive three monthly loading doses of aflibercept prior to receiving Ixo-vec. Patients in both arms will be eligible for supplemental injections of aflibercept and will receive topical steroid eye drops.\n\nAbout Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration\n\nWet AMD, also known as neovascular AMD or nAMD, is a VEGF driven advanced form of AMD affecting approximately 10% of patients living with AMD associated with the build-up of fluid in the macula and the retina. Wet AMD is a leading cause of blindness in people over 65 years of age, with approximately 20 million individuals worldwide living with this condition. New cases of wet AMD are expected to grow significantly worldwide as populations age. AMD is expected to impact 288 million people worldwide by 2040, with wet AMD accounting for approximately 10% of those cases. Additionally, wet AMD is a bilateral disease, and incidence of nAMD in the second eye is up to 42% in the first two to three years. The current standard of care requires frequent life-long repeated bolus injections of anti-VEGF in the eye. IVT gene therapy has the promise to preserve vision and reduce most or all injections for the life of the patient by delivering stable therapeutic levels of anti-VEGF to control macular fluid.\n\nAbout Ixo-vec in Wet AMD\n\nAdverum is developing ixoberogene soroparvovec (Ixo-vec, formerly referred to as ADVM-022), its clinical-stage gene therapy product candidate, for the treatment of wet AMD. Ixo-vec utilizes a proprietary vector capsid, AAV.7m8, carrying an aflibercept coding sequence under the control of a proprietary expression cassette. Unlike other ophthalmic gene therapies that require surgery to administer the gene therapy under the retina (sub-retinal approach), Ixo-vec is designed to be administered as a one-time IVT injection in the physician\u2019s office, deliver long-term efficacy, reduce the burden of frequent anti-VEGF, optimize patient compliance and improve vision outcomes for patients with wet AMD. In recognition of the need for new treatment options for wet AMD, FDA granted Fast Track and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designations for Ixo-vec for the treatment of wet AMD. Ixo-vec has also received PRIME designation from the EMA and the Innovation Passport from the United Kingdom\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency for the treatment of wet AMD.\n\nAbout Adverum Biotechnologies\n\nAdverum Biotechnologies (NASDAQ: ADVM) is a clinical-stage company that aims to establish gene therapy as a new standard of care for highly prevalent ocular diseases with the aspiration of developing functional cures to restore vision and prevent blindness. Leveraging the capabilities of its proprietary IVT platform, Adverum is developing durable, single-administration therapies, designed to be delivered in physicians\u2019 offices, to eliminate the need for frequent ocular injections to treat these diseases. Adverum is evaluating its novel gene therapy candidate, ixoberogene soroparvovec (Ixo-vec, formerly referred to as ADVM-022), as a one-time, IVT injection for patients with neovascular or wet age-related macular degeneration. Additionally, by overcoming the challenges associated with current treatment paradigms for debilitating ocular diseases, Adverum aspires to transform the standard of care, preserve vision, and create a profound societal impact around the globe.

The last time we reported about Zen 6 was roughly three months ago, and it was mostly about the desktop SKUs. As far as the laptop series is concerned, AMD is expected to debut the \"Medusa Point\" processors, and it is going to be in the APU lineup, succeeding the current Strix Point/Strix Halo/Krackan Point series.\n\nIf you remember, last year, the Medusa was reported to feature RDNA 5-based iGPU, skipping even the RDNA 4. While that was about the desktop lineup, which is codenamed Medusa Ridge, a new report suggests that the laptop lineup, Medusa Point, is going to stick with the RDNA 3.X architecture. The report comes from the prominent leaker, Golden Pig Upgrade on Weibo.\n\nImage Source: Weibo\n\nAccording to his statement, it looks like while Medusa Point will feature Zen 6 architecture for its CPU cores, the GPU cores will be based on the RDNA 3.X architecture. We don't know if it's RDNA 3.5 or an upgraded version, but, likely, Medusa Point won't even switch to RDNA 4.\n\nSome reports did indicate that AMD would be continuing the RDNA 3.5 architecture for a long time. Currently, the RDNA 3.5 architecture is deployed on multiple mobile Zen 5 series, including the Strix Point, which debuted in 2024, and then in both Krackan Point and Strix Halo. RDNA 3.5 architecture has proved itself to be quite competent for modern laptops, eliminating the need for an entry-level or budget discrete GPU.\n\nAMD's Strix APUs use a mix of Zen 5, RDNA 3.5 and XDNA 2 IPs. (Image Source: AMD)\n\nWith up to 40 Compute Units on Strix Halo chips, RDNA 3.5 is quite successful in competing with RTX 4060/4070 laptop GPUs in gaming, but RDNA 4 is surely a much more advanced and powerful architecture that could make an even bigger difference to the upcoming chips.\n\nRegardless of what AMD decides for the Zen 6 series, performance is what dictates the success of the lineup at the end of the day. With Panther Lake arriving in the second half, bringing the Xe3 architecture, AMD will need to ensure that it can take a bigger lead than it did with the RDNA 3.5. Meanwhile, do keep in mind that Medusa Point's iGPU architecture information is yet to be announced officially, and we might not see much regarding it before the second half of 2025.\n\nNews Source: Weibo",

            "content": "AMD\u2019s Ryzen AI Max \u201cStrix Halo\u201d processors are high-performance mobile chips with integrated graphics that can rival recent mid-range discrete GPUs, support for up to 16 Zen 5 CPU cores, and an NPU that offers up to 50 TOPS of hardware-accelerated AI performance.\n\nSo far only a couple of companies have announced PCs that will actually use the chips though. There\u2019s the Asus ROG Flow Z13 gaming tablet and HP ZBook Ultra 14 G1a mobile workstation (laptop). And on the desktop side of things there\u2019s the HP Z2 Mini G1a and Framework Desktop. But soon we could see more small form factor desktop computers with Strix Halo chips.\n\nEarlier this year rumors started making the rounds that Asus was working on an NUC-branded mini PC with support for up to a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip. That\u2019s be kind of weird since Asus inherited the NUC brand from Intel and doesn\u2019t typically use it to describe mini PCs with AMD chips. But it would hardly be out of character for Asus to launch some sort of mini PC with the most powerful AMD mobile chips available. Asus hasn\u2019t confirmed the rumors though.\n\nNow Chinese mini PC maker GMK say it is planning to launch products with Strix Halo chips. What they\u2019ll be called, when they\u2019ll be available, how much they\u2019ll cost, or even what they\u2019ll look like are all still up in the air. So in some ways this isn\u2019t much of an announcement. But the company says the upcoming GMK EVO-X2 will be available with up to a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip.\n\nAnd GMK was also one of the first companies to announce plans for a mini PC with an AMD Strix Point processor. And while it wasn\u2019t the first to bring one of those mini PCs to market, the GMK Evo-X1 is a real computer that you can buy now, so I believe it when GMK says it\u2019ll eventually launch Strix Halo models. I also expect that if GMK is planning to bring Strix Halo mini PCs to market, it\u2019s safe to say that other Chinese brands (like GEEKOM, MINISFORUM, ACEMAGIC, and AOOSTAR) will probably follow suit in the coming months. What remains to be seen is how long it will take any of those companies to bring products to market.\n\nFor the most part Strix Point and Strix Halo architecture are similar: both feature Zen 5 CPU cores, RDNA 3.5 graphics, and up to a 50 TOPS Ryzen AI NPU. But Strix Halo has a higher TDP and support far more CPU and GPU cores. It also leverages unified memory to allocate up to 96GB of LPDDR5x memory to the GPU with up to 256 GB/sec bandwidth.\n\nWhile GMK doesn\u2019t explicitly state which Strix Halo processors it will offer, the most exciting is clearly the Ryzen AI Max+ 395, which is a 16-core, 32-thread processor with Radeon 8060S integrated graphics featuring 40 compute units. But even a Ryzen AI Max 390 would be a significant upgrade over the Ryzen AI 9 370 HX Strix Point chip, which is designed to consume less power and has far less graphics power.\n\nCores / Threads Freq Cache GPU TDP Ryzen AI Max+ 395 16 / 32 Up to 5.1 GHz 80MB Radeon 8060S (40 CUs, up to 2.9 GHz) 45 \u2013 120W Ryzen AI Max 390 12 / 24 Up to 5 GHz 76MB Radeon 8050S (32 CUs, up to 2.8 GHz) 45 \u2013 120W Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 12 / 24 Up to 5.1 GHz 36MB Radeon 890M (16 CUs, up to 2.9 GHz) 15 \u2013 54W\n\nvia VideoCardz\n\nSupport Liliputing Liliputing's primary sources of revenue are advertising and affiliate links (if you click the \"Shop\" button at the top of the page and buy something on Amazon, for example, we'll get a small commission).

            "content": "As you may have already seen, AMD officially showcased its upcoming Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT earlier this week, including pricing details that were an extremely welcome sight. Now, I\u2019m starting to wonder about the Radeon RX 9060 - a GPU that, if priced correctly, could be an extremely attractive value proposition for PC gamers.\n\nNaturally, I\u2019m not going to get too excited until we see some real-world performance figures for the new AMD cards. Team Red made some bold claims in its RX 9070 XT performance showcase, placing the GPU just slightly above the Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti in terms of native 4K gaming performance despite it being $150 cheaper (and let\u2019s be honest, you can\u2019t get a 5070 Ti at retail price right now anyway).\n\nI suspect that\u2019s a load of baloney, since AMD used an overclocked RX 9070 XT for their testing and their comparison 5070 Ti was most likely fished out of a crypto miner\u2019s dumpster and then spat on for good measure (AMD: this is a joke, please don\u2019t sue me). AMD also only showcased raw native 4K framerates, while Nvidia is keen to push the effectiveness of its new DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation features, which - for all the debate surrounding them - do significantly improve your in-game fps.\n\nStill, it\u2019s very impressive stuff - but at $549 (around \u00a3520 / AU$880), even the non-XT version of the RX 9070 can\u2019t exactly be called a budget GPU. It\u2019s more of a midrange card, and while it looks like a great midrange card, I\u2019d still argue that the best choice right now for PC builders on a budget is the Intel Arc B580, which scored a rare five stars in our review for its solid 1440p gaming performance and extremely reasonable $249.99 / \u00a3249.99 / AU$449 price tag.\n\nFiguring it out\n\nSo, as things stand right now, it looks like AMD might be taking the midrange GPU space by storm, while Intel holds onto the budget market and Nvidia remains the undisputed king of the high-end. But with more RX 9000-series cards yet to come, it\u2019s entirely possible that AMD could descend on Intel with some fiery (but affordable) wrath - after all, AMD made it clear last year that it would no longer be targeting the premium space, with a greater focus on midrange and budget GPUs.\n\nSo, the RX 9060. We know very little about it right now, but we can make some reasonable extrapolations about it based on previous leaks and our existing knowledge of the RX 9070 cards.\n\nAMD's RX 9000 series is a bold step forward for the perpetual underdog of the GPU world. (Image credit: AMD)\n\nFor starters, some leaks from back in December proved to be mostly accurate regarding the 9070 and 9070 XT, correctly predicting the name change from RX 8000 and the upgrade to RDNA 4 as well as AMD\u2019s new FSR 4 upscaling tech. Those leaks claimed that pricing for the two new GPUs would be in the $449 to $649 range, which has also proven accurate, although it was admittedly a fairly wide net being cast there. The same leaker claimed that upcoming Navi 44 GPUs (the 9070 cards are Navi 48) would sit in the $179 to $349 price range, presumably with the RX 9060 XT - or perhaps just a plain old RX 9060 - at the top.\n\nThis is where I start to doubt the leaks a little; a price of $349 would be a $200 gap between that card and the RX 9060, which feels like a fairly wide spacing when it comes to pricing. $399 feels a bit more reasonable to me, especially if we do get an RX 9060 XT - and as PC Gamer reports, we can apparently expect \u201cmultiple RX 9060 products\u201d to land in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nPerformance without the price\n\nBut if the leaks are accurate and AMD does produce an RX 9060 XT for $349 or less in a few months\u2019 time, I\u2019ll absolutely lose my merde (pardon my French). The Radeon RX 7600 XT was a decent enough GPU, but it failed to measure up to Nvidia\u2019s competing RTX 4060 when it came to bang for your buck.\n\nAMD looks to be making major strides in that department, though. Even if the RX 9070 XT is 10% behind the RTX 5070 Ti in terms of raw performance - and I suspect the average might be a lot closer than that - it\u2019s a full 20% cheaper, and there\u2019s still no sign of a desktop RTX 5060 from Nvidia. While I do imagine that card will eventually surface, AMD has the gloves off in the affordable GPU arena right now - and there\u2019s frankly not a hope in hell we\u2019ll see a desktop RTX 5050, so anything below that performance level that AMD decides to offer could absolutely dominate that price point. Yes, I know Intel\u2019s new budget GPUs are good. No, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll outclass new Radeon cards.\n\nLook at this thing. It costs less than two hundred bucks. Perfection. (Image credit: XFX)\n\nThe fact is that AMD has had skin in the budget game for a long time. My partner, who admittedly mostly plays Stardew Valley, is still rocking a Radeon RX 570 that runs perfectly well for 1080p gaming - a graphics card that retailed at just $179 in the US when it was released back in 2017. I've offered to replace it with something a bit more current, but he says \"Why? It still works fine.\"\n\nThe affordable to midrange space is where Team Red excels, and after some small missteps in the previous desktop generation, I reckon it\u2019s ready to take back its crown. With Nvidia focused on AI and ridiculously high performance GPUs, there\u2019s no time like the present.",

            "content": "AMD is on the brink of a major AI-driven expansion, projecting double-digit growth in 2025 as it ramps up data center dominance and AI accelerator adoption.\n\nAMD's Record-Breaking AI Surge: Data Center Dominance & the Road to MI350\n\nAMD delivered a record-breaking 2024 with $25.8B in revenues, a 14% year-over-year growth. The Data Center segment took the spotlight with nearly doubling at $12.6 billion in annual revenues, as a testament to accelerating cloud adoption, AI accelerator growth, and EPYC CPU market-share expansion.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the Client segment grew 52% year-over-year at $7.1 billion with the support of AI-driven Ryzen processors as well as the recovery of PCs. Meanwhile, the Gaming as well as Embedded segments took a hit with gaming revenues falling 58% year-over-year at $2.6 billion as a result of cyclical declines in the sale of consoles, as well as Embedded revenues falling 33% at $3.6 billion largely because of normalization of inventories in the industrials. Amidst these headwinds, the rising margins at AMD as well as disciplined capital allocation saw the operating efficiency continue.\n\nIn Q4 2024, revenues at AMD amounted to $7.7B, 24% year-over-year growth, 12% sequential growth. $3.9 billion in revenues came from the Data Center segment, 69% year-over-year growth, reinforcing the dominance of AMD in the realm of AI as well as cloud computing. MI300X was installed at Meta (META, Financial) for inference workloads successfully, a breakthrough in the AI GPU roadmap of AMD, as ROCm adoption sped up in the hyperscalers, reinforcing the position of the AMD GPUs as a viable alternative to the CUDA ecosystem of NVIDIA (NVDA, Financial).\n\nClient delivered strong results at $2.3 billion, indicating the adoption of AI PCs as well as continuing market-share growth in the CPU market, while revenues from the Gaming sector down 59% YoY, as well as Embedded revenues down 13% YoY due to weak industrial demand. Despite these results, the stock market reacted cautiously when the $7.1 billion revenues (+30% YoY but -7% sequentially) guidance for Q1 2025 from AMD arrived.\n\nAnalysts expressed worry regarding the lumpy second-half revenues from the data center, but investors took reassurance from the second-half ramp-up in AI accelerators, notably with the introduction of the MI350 later in the year. CEO Lisa Su cleverly postponed the introduction of the MI350 from the end of 2025 to the middle of the year, setting the stage for a fierce growth in the AI accelerator market, targeted at $120 billion in 2030.\n\nAMD's AI Expansion: The Road to Billions & The Battle for Market Share\n\nLooking ahead, AMD is projecting double-digit growth in 2025 revenues as well as EPS, with AI being the growth driver. Its long-term data center AI roadmap is impressive, with Lisa Su indicating the company is poised to scale AI accelerator revenues from $5 billion in 2024 levels to \u201ctens of billions\u201d per annum in the next few years.\n\nGrowing AI GPU market share is a priority area, with the aim of taking down NVIDIA's market dominance in the AI GPU market through competitive AI training capabilities, ROCm adoption growth, as well as prices. In enterprise AI workloads as well as inference computing beyond cloud hyperscalers, the sustainability of the market penetration is going to be dictated.\n\nAI-powered Ryzen CPUs also power the AI PC revolution, cementing the diversity of revenues at AMD. With investments in AI infrastructure, core cloud partnerships, as well as a maturing software ecosystem, the long-term upside is set at AMD even as there is near-term uncertainty. Growth in the MI350 launch, ROCm advancement, as well as the growth in AI chip demand is going to be the drivers shaping the long-term trajectory at AMD.\n\nOn the margin side, the 54% non-GAAP margin at AMD is a considerable expansion from the 30%-plus margins of the early 2010s, indicating improved pricing power as well as a more valuable mix of data center. Finally, the $2.4 billion free cash flow let the company continue its aggressive R&D spend as well as engage in repurchases. But the $1 billion repurchases at AMD fall considerably short of the $15 billion repurchase program at NVIDIA, indicating a more conservative capital allocation approach.\n\nValuation Analysis: An In-Depth Look at Its Position in the Market and Future Outlook\n\nAMD is currently trading at $110.84, with a market capitalization of $179.61 billion. Despite its 3,463.99% surge over the past decade, the stock remains 47.56% below its all-time high, signaling a potential mispricing of its AI-driven growth.\n\nOne of the most telling valuation indicators is the forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.92, significantly lower than its trailing P/E of 111.96. This sharp compression suggests that Wall Street is still underestimating AMD's future earnings potential, despite its accelerating AI expansion. AMD's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 8.65 also lags behind NVIDIA's premium multiple, reflecting an opportunity for a market re-rating as AI revenue scales.\n\nFrom a cash flow perspective, AMD is demonstrating improving efficiency. The company generated $2.4 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in 2024, marking a 35% YoY increase. However, its EV/FCF ratio of 73.47 suggests that investors have yet to fully price in the AI-led margin expansion that will come with MI350's rollout and data center acceleration.\n\nLastly, the GF Value estimate of $129.61 implies that AMD is currently ~17% undervalued. This model considers earnings growth, profitability, and industry trends, reinforcing the notion that AI tailwinds and expanding hyperscaler partnerships are not yet fully priced into AMD's stock price.\n\nTakeaway\n\nAMD's AI-driven growth is accelerating, yet the market hasn't fully priced in its long-term potential. With Meta deploying MI300X for inference, ROCm adoption expanding, and the MI350 launch pulled forward, AMD is rapidly closing the gap with NVIDIA. Despite short-term concerns over cyclical headwinds, its AI accelerator revenue is set to scale from $5 billion to \u201ctens of billions,\u201d reinforcing its position as a long-term AI powerhouse.",

            "content": "One of my tech dilemmas is that I\u2019ve somehow accumulated a disparate group of laptops with integrated GPUs. That means they\u2019re great to write on but when it comes to graphics processing power \u2014 without using expletives \u2014 let\u2019s just say they can\u2019t play any big-name PC games.\n\nMy work laptop, for example, can handle just about any work app or program I need to run and is as compact and portable as heck, but will it let me potter for even a minute in Bethesda\u2019s Starfield? Nope \u2014 not a chance.\n\nThat just means swapping hats on articles from tech pieces to gaming pieces for PCWorld is a little more cumbersome than it needs be. I need to also swap devices, or else I\u2019m relegated to testing only pixilated indie games (not that I don\u2019t love playing pixilated indie games \u2014 I\u2019m really looking forward to the release of Cattle Country on Steam, by the way). But it would be nice to have a laptop that can do it all.\n\nAlas, Asus has thrown me a lifeline with the 2025 Asus ROG Flow Z13, which will, when I get my mitts on one, conveniently make that problem go away. Its specs, when they were revealed at CES 2025, really surprised me for one reason: It didn\u2019t have a dedicated GPU listed.\n\nThat makes it very different. To be honest, previous year\u2019s ROG Flow Z13 iterations haven\u2019t blown me away. Not because they weren\u2019t well-built, but because they have occupied a dubious gray area of performance, being less powerful than most fully fledged gaming laptops.\n\nThat\u2019s despite the configurations having their own dGPUs and being fairly expensive. But the 2025 ROG Flow Z13 is inexorably more powerful than any model that has come before it, and that\u2019s with no dGPU.\n\nWhat makes it so special is its AMD Ryzen AI Max processor, the top model of which integrates a Radeon 8060S GPU consisting of 40 \u2014 yes, 40! \u2014 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores. This APU comes under the banner of AMD\u2019s Strix Halo laptop hardware, which includes the AMD Ryzen AI Max platform announced earlier this year and shown off by AMD at CES 2025.\n\nIn case you missed it, AMD Ryzen AI Max is designed to be a unified computing solution for both CPU power and integrated graphics performance. In the top-tier 2025 ROG Flow Z13 model, that power is obvious \u2014 along with a huge iGPU, its Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chiplet boasts 16 AMD Zen 5 cores and 32 threads with a maximum boost clock of 5.1GHz. So there\u2019s serious compute power there for the taking. The chip feeds an impressive 128GB of LPDDR5X RAM running at 8,000Hz too.\n\nThe fact that there\u2019s no dGPU means it has killer portability. Yes, it\u2019s a compact 13-inch size, which isn\u2019t anything to rave about in itself, but Asus has also managed to keep the weight down to just 2.65 pounds (1.2kg) and achieved a maximum thickness of just 0.47 inches (12mm). It makes any alternative gaming laptop look like a chunky, heavy, overwrought beast.\n\nSounds great, but what\u2019s the catch?\n\nSo, what\u2019s the catch? Surely it must compromise on GPU power, considering it has no dGPU, right? No, in fact it doesn\u2019t. Graphically it\u2019s more than a match for most rivals, poised to shred in triple-A games.\n\nGraphics folks are already comparing its chip\u2019s graphics performance to mid-range Nvidia RTX 4070 GPUs and claiming it has a 2.5- to 3x boost in performance over Nivida dGPUs paired with AMD Strix Point processors, which is very solid performance for a processor/laptop with only an iGPU, if you ask me.\n\nFurthermore, AMD claims it has demonstrated 1.4x faster gaming performance than Intel\u2019s flagship Lunar Lake Core Ultra 9 288V processor, and 84 percent quicker rendering than the Apple MacBook M4 Pro.\n\nOn the power side the ROG Flow Z13 can draw to a maximum 120W TDP, so there\u2019s more than enough grunt available too.\n\nAsus\n\nIndeed, at the Asus booth at CES 2025, the ROG Flow Z13 had no issues playing Black Myth: Wukong, on its 2.5K, 180Hz display, which is a very promising sign.\n\nOkay, so granted it can shred in games and is portable, there must be something else we can catch this laptop out on, right? Admittedly, I do have a few lingering questions\u2026 Being a unified CPU / graphics solution, Strix Halo represents a kind of U-turn from previous AMD mobile processor platforms not just because the AMD Ryzen AI Max has an integrated GPU.\n\nLooking at the stats charts it has a noticeable CPU processing advantage over AMD Strix Point, but it\u2019s likely less power efficient (since it lacks scaled-down AMD Zen5c cores). That did get me thinking about the Z13\u2019s battery life and also performance when power levels are lowered; Strix Point holds its own very well at lower power levels.\n\nStill, initial reviews say the ROG Flow Z13\u2019s battery life, in the very least, is quite good, lasting more than 10 hours (for lighter tasks. Battery life for gaming will be less than that.).\n\nAsus\n\nI\u2019ve had slight concerns about its cooling too, considering the 120W maximum TDP (that\u2019s a lot of power in a thin and lightweight laptop). But those too, for now at least, have mostly been abated, based on the list of the Z13\u2019s cooling apparatus.\n\nAsus has incorporated a specially designed vapor chamber and air vents that direct air behind the touchscreen. It also sports second-generation Arc Flow fans with 0.1mm fins to circulate air.\n\nSo, trusting that those things work as they should, this laptop sounds like quite the package. Not only is it extremely lightweight and thin and therefore portable, but it\u2019s stacked with CPU power and, more importantly, GPU power (sans a dGPU), and without the chunkiness of a gaming laptop.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m looking forward to reading more reviews when they become available to get a better handle on the points I made about cooling and efficiency. Right now, though, my intention to get one of these laptops is unshakable.\n\nFurther reading: The best gaming laptops",

            "content": "The past five years have been fruitful for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 4.17%) investors, as an investment of $1,000 made in the stock half a decade ago is now worth almost $2,200 as of this writing.\n\nHowever, to put things in perspective, the 118% jump in AMD's shares in the last five years is lower than the 178% jump clocked by the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index over the same period. The past year has been especially difficult for AMD investors, as the stock has shed 41% of its value during this period. This big drop can be attributed to AMD's inability to capitalize on the booming demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips, a market where arch-rival Nvidia has established a dominant position.\n\nBut then, AMD's recent results have been solid, and the company has more than one catalyst that could help revive its stock market fortunes over the next five years. We are going to take a closer look at AMD's potential growth drivers and check why it may be a good idea to buy and hold this stock for the next five years.\n\nWhy the past five years have been a mixed one for AMD\n\nAMD's financial performance over the past five years has been mixed. While the company's revenue and earnings increased in 2020, 2021, and 2022 on account of strong sales of its central processing units (CPUs) and graphics cards used in personal computers (PCs), its bottom line growth fizzled after a strong start.\n\nThat's because the demand for PCs waned following strong sales in the years of the novel coronavirus pandemic. AMD was left with excess inventory on its hands, and it had to write it down, leading to a sharp decline in the company's earnings. Meanwhile, the company's data center business was in fine shape throughout this period as it continued gaining server CPU share from Intel.\n\nBut then, sales of gaming consoles from Sony and Microsoft, which are powered by AMD's semi-custom processors, started maturing and led those tech giants to place fewer orders. Throw in the fact that AMD is way behind Nvidia in the market for gaming graphics cards, with a share of just 10%; it is easy to see why the company's gaming business has been struggling for traction.\n\nSo, the mixed performance of AMD's various businesses has weighed on the stock's performance over the past five years. However, the good news is that all the segments discussed above are likely to enjoy solid growth over the next five years, paving the way for more upside in AMD stock.\n\nThese growth drivers could send this chipmaker higher in the next five years\n\nAMD's performance over the next five years will depend on the health of key segments such as gaming, data centers, and PCs. The good part is that all these business segments are likely to enjoy secular growth thanks to varied catalysts.\n\nThe company's gaming business, for instance, should benefit from the arrival of new gaming consoles from Microsoft and Sony. The current console generation is close to five years old. A new one is likely to arrive within the next two to three years as both Sony and Microsoft have historically released a new generation of consoles every seven to eight years.\n\nBoth Sony and Microsoft are expected to release their next-generation consoles in 2026 or 2027. That could give AMD's semi-custom chip business a nice boost as it has reportedly been selected by the console makers to supply the processors for their next-gen consoles.\n\nMoving from gaming to PCs, AMD has already started witnessing solid traction in this market. The company's client segment revenue increased by an impressive 52% in 2024 to a record $7.1 billion, thanks to \"strong demand for AMD Ryzen processors in desktop and mobile.\" The prospects of the PC market for the next five years appear to be bright due to the advent of generative AI.\n\nAccording to one estimate, the AI PC market's revenue is expected to jump by almost 5x between 2024 and 2030. This bodes well for AMD's long-term prospects, especially because the company has gained a larger PC processor market share. The chipmaker ended 2024 with almost 25% of the client CPU market under its control, up by almost five percentage points from the prior-year period, according to Mercury Research.\n\nIts revenue share of the client PC market grew at a faster rate, jumping 8.4 percentage points year over year. This points toward AMD's improving pricing power in the PC processor market, as its revenue share is improving at a faster pace than the unit share. Moreover, it won't be surprising to see AMD gaining more market share as arch-rival Intel isn't expected to launch a new desktop CPU until next year.\n\nAs such, the stage seems set for healthy growth in AMD's gaming and PC segments over the next five years. At the same time, the company's data center business is also getting better, even though it is playing second fiddle to Nvidia in the AI GPU (graphics processing unit) market. AMD's data center revenue nearly doubled last year to a record $12.6 billion, driven by strong sales of both its server CPUs and GPUs.\n\nThe company sold at least $5 billion worth of data center GPUs in 2024. AMD forecasts that its data center GPU business could grow to \"tens of billions, as we go through the next couple of years.\" In fact, AMD could clock solid revenue in data center GPUs over the long run, even if it manages to corner a small portion of this market for itself.\n\nIn the end, it can be concluded that AMD seems set for outstanding earnings growth over the next five years. That's why buying this stock seems like a no-brainer right now, especially considering its price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of just 0.42 based on its five-year projected earnings growth, according to Yahoo! Finance.\n\nA PEG ratio of less than 1 means that a stock is undervalued in light of the growth it is expected to deliver, and AMD is trading well below that threshold. So, investors looking to buy a growth stock that's trading at attractive levels can consider adding AMD to their portfolios. This stock looks positioned for impressive long-term upside.",

            "content": "This week, along with the AMD Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT announcement AMD also shared more about the underlying RDNA 4 architecture. Since we expect the architecture to be used in more products than just the Radeon RX 9070 XT and Radeon RX 9070, we wanted to pull those slides out. AMD has fairly good slides here to read through if you are interested in the architecture so we figured we would post them for weekend reading..\n\nAMD RDNA 4 Architecture Update\n\nThis is the big overview slide with the key features of the AMD RDNA 4 architecture. Using the RX 9070 XT.\n\nSomething that one might not immediately think about when a new GPU is announced is the media engine. These days, the media offloads get used in so many applciations that they are an important part of a new architecture.\n\nThis is the RDNA 4 compute engine with the dual SIMD32 vector units, better matrix operations, and so forth.\n\nThe ray tracing side is interesting because that has become a big part of games.\n\nOn the bounding boxes side, AMD has new oriented bounding boxes feature that helps improve performance.\n\nOn the out-of-order memory side, RDNA 4 allows memory requests from different shaders to be handled out-of-order. With RDNA 3 these returns were ordered.\n\nAMD claims its new compute units offer around twice the ray traversal performance.\n\nRDNA 4 shaders can allocate registers dynamically while RDNA 3 allocated for the worst case.\n\nAMD focused on its gaming performance, but of course, a big feature these days is AI performance. AMD is pushing an updated AI engine in RDNA 4 to offer big performance gains.\n\nOn a per-CU basis, AMD cays it can get around 2x the FP16 performance.\n\nAMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 or FSR 4 is the upscaling solution for games.\n\nWith that upscaling, AMD can get more performance.\n\nThis actually might be a bit less exciting for the higher-end gaming GPUs, but you certainly feel it when these architectures hit iGPUs.\n\nFinal Words\n\nRDNA 4 is an exciting one for two reasons. First, it is a nice generational leap for AMD\u2019s GPUs. Second, it is important for AMD to do well to keep some pressure on NVIDIA. NVIDIA, of course, has a massive data center GPU business that is making its consumer business look tiny in comparison. We shall see how the new architectures play out in the market.",

The flagship Radeon RX 9070 XT, launched at $599, is said to compete with NVIDIA's RTX 5070 Ti, which means that the GPU is targeted towards the mid-to-high-end consumer segment. But for those who are on a tight budget, AMD doesn't offer many options at the moment. However, with the RX 9060 series, things look to change, as initial details of the lineup have now been revealed.\n\nAMD China has confirmed (via MyDrivers) that the Radeon RX 9060 GPUs are expected to launch by Q2 2025, which means they'll directly target NVIDIA's upcoming 60-class GPUs. While details surrounding the lineup are confined for now, the RX 9060 series is expected to employ Navi 44, a budget-oriented GPU silicon, with a VRAM count of around 8 GB, depending upon how AMD decides to position these models.\n\nImage Credits: AMD China (Automated Translation)\n\nWith the RX 9070 release, Team Red essentially diverted the focus of mainstream GPU consumers towards itself, which means that NVIDIA will have a tough time marketing its upcoming launches unless it decides to do something unexpected. With the RX 9060 series, we expected AMD to target the $400-$500 price segment since that is a sweet spot for budget gamers and will definitely help compete with the GeForce RTX 5060 and its \"Ti\" counterpart.\n\nGiven that AMD employs a strategy similar to what it did with the RX 9070 series, we expect the RX 9060 to debut somewhere in April, after the launch of NVIDIA's 60-class GPUs. However, for now, nothing is officially confirmed, but things are turning out interestingly for the GPU segment.",

A search on eBay for 100-000000976, the OEM SKU (stock keeping unit) code for the 9965, brings up 10 results, all of them US-based and brand new.\n\nThis is the first of several articles based on data I\u2019ve compiled on 41 AMD Zen 4 and Zen 5 CPUs (socketed, OEM). In the rest of the series, I will be looking at the cost per core, performance per core, AMD CPUs that are getting more expensive, all this with the new Ryzen 9 9900/9950 X3D CPUs in the backdrop.\n\nSome sellers offered the 9965 for as little as $8,250 when buying a pair; individual pricing started from $8,369. Oddly enough, searching for EPYC 9965 brought up several entries from mainland China. I estimate at 100 the total number of EPYC 9965 currently on sale on eBay.\n\nOn the open web, Wiredzone, a popular online US-based retailer stocks the EPYC 9965 for just over $10,000, a fair bit more expensive than eBay but it\u2019s a recognized business. It has been at this price for more than three months now. About a dozen other retailers worldwide sell AMD\u2019s flagship server processor for less than $11,000, a clear sign that supply is relatively abundant.\n\nThe EPYC 9965 requires a special motherboard if you plan to run a pair of them (because, why not). Experiencing 768 threads on one motherboard such as the Gigabyte MZ73-LM2 with up to 24 DIMM slots is something few of us will ever need, especially when such a dual-socket motherboard retails for about $2500 and requires a special casing. But if you want the best workstation out there, that\u2019s a very good place to start.\n\nThis Comino Grande server is an example of the type of device that could accommodate the 9965 (Image credit: Comino)\n\nSo, why such a drop?\n\nDemand for this particular type of processor, one which focusses on hyperscalers such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, has been one of the drivers of AMD\u2019s success in the server market. AMD\u2019s market share rose from nearly zero a decade or so ago to about 25% in 2024.\n\nAre you a pro?

Could excess inventory be a reason as to why prices have gone down so quickly on such a recent CPU?\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing, during my research, I was shocked to see that the 9965 was not the only one to have such a big discount: the 9655P (up to 47%), the EPYC 9655 (up to 57%) and so on, and so forth all experienced big price drops.\n\nIndeed, my snapshot survey of AMD\u2019s 5th gen socketed CPUs (with a sprinkle of Threadripper), 41 CPUs in all, reveals that the majority of models have a discount of 20% or more once they hit retail.\n\nHistory repeating itself\n\nI began tracking this odd scenario back two years ago when I noticed that US retailers were selling the then-three month old EPYC 9954 processor with a massive 30% discount. A month later, in March 2023, I found that hundreds of used 64-core 3rd gen EPYC CPUs were being as Chinese hyperscalers rushed to upgrade their servers.\n\nIt looked like someone in the supply chain tried to make a quick buck off the \u2018obsolete\u2019 hardware with prices tumbling down to just over $1000 in June 2023. The same happened with the 128-core EPYC 9754 server processor which saw significant discounts but nothing on the scale I am seeing today.",

(Image credit: AMD)\n\nMany people, including myself, want a reasonably priced mid-range GPU that can handle modern gaming demands.\n\nHowever, NVIDIA's RTX 5000 \"Blackwell\" generation effectively decimated the mid-range GPU market despite launching with a mid-range MSRP.\n\nA combination of severe stock shortages, high third-party prices, and scalpers has caused the RTX 5070 Ti to approach $1,000 despite the $749 MSRP, putting it out of reach of many PC gamers.\n\nThere is still, of course, the $549 RTX 5070 that's expected to launch on March 5 following a delay. Will it be more readily available? No one knows.\n\nThe same can be said for the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 that are set to launch on March 6; will there be plenty of stock to sell?\n\nConsidering there have been rumors of retailers receiving RDNA 4 GPUs to sell as far back as December 2024 \u2014 as well as AMD's claims of \"wide availability\" in its RDNA 4 presentation \u2014 it's looking good.\n\nHaving two more next-gen GPUs sitting in the mid-range tier is nothing but a positive for PC enthusiasts, and NVIDIA has received the competition it so desperately needs.\n\nThe 9070 XT's raw performance roughly matches that of NVIDIA's RTX 5070 Ti, and that's despite a $150 price difference. As AMD points out, that's a 23% better performance-per-dollar ratio.\n\nIf you've been waiting for a mid-range GPU to slot into your gaming PC, the RX 9070 XT appears to be the new superstar.\n\nNVIDIA is still the best for ray tracing, but AMD is no longer as far behind\n\nA look at the RX 9070 XT's performance compared to the RTX 5070 Ti at 4K ultra settings. (Image credit: AMD)\n\nI'm not someone who needs to have ray tracing enabled in everything I play, and I know I'm not the only one.\n\nAs it stands now, I'm happy with a GPU that can meet ray tracing requirements in games where it's not an option to turn off. The RX 9070 XT appears to meet those demands.\n\nAMD's ray tracing performance continues to lag behind NVIDIA's capabilities, but it's clear that AMD wasn't sitting back and ignoring the tech in between RDNA 3 and RDNA 4 architectures.\n\nAMD shared some 4K RT performance metrics in its presentation, putting the 9070 XT lower than all but two games \u2014 Spider-Man 2 and Far Cry 6 \u2014 compared to the 5070 Ti.\n\nCompared to the last-gen RX 7900 GRE, on the other hand, the RX 9070 XT offers up to 66% better ray tracing performance at 4K ultra settings.\n\nAt 1440p, the resolution I use to game, the numbers look even better, with the 9070 XT offering up to 68% improved ray tracing performance compared to the 7900 GRE.\n\nI'm eager to see real-world RT results once RDNA 4 reviews go live, but I don't foresee there being enough of a discrepancy between AMD's claims and reviewer results to scrap my buying plans.\n\nFSR 4 is the generational change I was hoping for\n\nA look at FSR 4 performance in popular games with the RX 9070 XT. (Image credit: AMD)\n\nFidelityFX Super Resoltution (FSR) is AMD's answer to NVIDIA DLSS, and it's about to receive the most significant upgrade in its history.\n\nAMD made the switch to machine learning for FSR 4 \u2014 older FSR versions use spatial algorithms \u2014 bringing it more in line with NVIDIA's DLSS that has, from the start, used AI to upscale.\n\nIn tandem with RDNA 4's improved hardware, FSR 4 appears to be the generational improvement I was hoping for.\n\nWith FSR 4 enabled on the RX 9070 XT, AMD claims up to 4.4x better performance at a 4K resolution.\n\nIn Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, for example, frame rates jump from 43 FPS to 191 FPS with FSR 4 enabled. Spider-Man 2 is almost as good, jumping 4x from 48 FPS to 192 FPS at 4K.\n\nEven the newly-released Monster Hunter Wilds picks up a 3.5x improvement with FSR 4, going from 42 FPS to 147 FPS at 4K.\n\nHands-On With AMD FSR 4 - It Looks... Great? - YouTube Watch On\n\nAs discovered by Hardware Unboxed shortly after AMD's pulled CES 2025 presentation, FSR 4 isn't just about boosting frame rates.\n\nFSR 3.1 notably struggles with small but high-quality details, especially as you raise the resolution. That issue appears to have been smoothed out with FSR 4.\n\nQuality frames and lots of 'em? I'm sold, even if DLSS 4 remains the premier upscaling technology.\n\nNVIDIA finally gets some real competition\n\nNVIDIA's RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 remain the best options for high-performance enthusiasts, but AMD is set to reclaim the mid-range market. (Image credit: Windows Central | Ben Wilson)\n\nAMD's RX 9070 XT reveal couldn't come at a better time despite nearly a two-month delay.\n\nIn that time, I've gone from being enthused about the RTX 5070 to firmly siding with AMD regarding my next PC upgrade. The jump from an RX 6800 to an RX 9070 XT will be a massive change, and it'll pair well with my Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU.\n\nNVIDIA has been busy harming itself since the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 launched on January 30, and there are plenty of good reasons why you shouldn't buy an RTX 5000 GPU.\n\nFrom melting RTX 5090 power cables to missing ROPs in all RTX 5000 cards to outrageous prices and unavailable hardware, NVIDIA has undoubtedly tarnished its reputation in the eyes of many PC gamers.\n\nWhile Team Green continues to offer the most powerful GPUs on the market, AMD's re-entry with RDNA 4 is shaping up to be a massive win for anyone who wants to spend around $600.\n\nAre you on board for the RX 9070 XT?

Unsurprisingly, this upset many developers who were planning to upgrade their setups and hoped for a seamless transition. However, ROCm support might not be far behind the launch, as AMD's Vice President of AI Software has teased what appears to be an AMD GPU from the RX 9070 series running in a dedicated ROCm environment.\n\nROCm is an open-source software stack for GPU programming, enabling graphics cards to be used for much more than rendering graphics. ROCm enables select GPUs to power HPC and AI applications, including professional Instinct Accelerators, prosumer Radeon PRO GPUs, and a handful of consumer-grade Radeon GPUs as well.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt seemed lacking for AMD to miss out on the opportunity of providing day-one support to developers. Ironically, the initial traces of Navi 48, the chip beneath RX 9070 GPUs, surfaced in ROCm updates last year. Anush Elangovan reported that RDNA 4 is \"ROCm'ing on just fine,\" demonstrating a potential RX 9070 series GPU under rocm-smi (ROCm System Management Interface).\n\nDevelopers have repeatedly bemoaned AMD's slow adoption of new ROCm features and support on mainstream hardware. As of writing, AMD officially supports the RX 7000 and RX 6000 families of GPUs and the Radeon VII on Windows. Select RDNA 2 GPUs can only use the HIP runtime and don't have access to the full HIP SDK. Linux support, which is notably better and more consistent, only extends to the RX 7900 series and the Radeon VII. There are a few workarounds to get unsupported hardware up and running with ROCm, which is reportedly more successful in Linux environments.\n\nNvidia's CUDA, on the contrary, can be run using GPUs dating back to 2006. Of course, newer architectures offer updated feature sets and fancier instructions. Given the recent advances in AI, 90% of Nvidia's revenue is a result of its data-center accelerators, driven by CUDA at their heart. This shows how critical ROCm is for AMD if it wants to compete against the mammoth that Nvidia has become in the AI space.\n\nTo broaden ROCm support, the next addition will likely be Strix Halo, or the Ryzen AI MAX 300 series. With as much as 128GB of unified memory, Strix Halo is much more than a gaming laptop; it's more tailored for LLM inference and development, tackling Apple's M-series silicon.",

Despite these innovations, the company's stock saw a decline of 9.91% over the same period. One factor could be the broader downturn in the tech sector, as indicated by the Nasdaq's 3.5% loss for the week. The market was still reeling from a tech sell-off sparked by Nvidia's earnings report, which heightened concerns about AI sector investments. Additionally, ongoing trade uncertainties related to tariffs announced by President Trump have added to the cautious investor sentiment. While AMD's partnership with Kalyani Powertrain in India signifies strategic expansion, these broader market challenges have overshadowed its recent product announcements, aligning with the general tech market's retreat.\n\nNasdaqGS:AMD Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025\n\nThe past five years have seen AMD's total shareholder return reach 105.52%, reflecting significant growth in both share price and dividends. This impressive performance contrasts with a backdrop of fluctuating earnings, where AMD experienced periods of high growth alongside some profitability challenges. Despite its earnings declining by an average of 6.2% annually over this period, AMD made impactful product launches like the RDNA 4 and notable partnerships, such as the collaboration with Ocient to enhance AI applications and initiatives with TSMC on 3D chiplet technology, which contributed to its strengthened market position.\n\nAdditionally, AMD's ongoing stock repurchase program, authorizing up to US$4 billion in share buybacks, has played a role in boosting shareholder returns. However, over the past year, the company's returns lagged behind both the U.S. market and semiconductor industry, which posted returns of 15.3% and 19.3% respectively, reflecting broader industry and market challenges. As AMD continues to innovate and expand, these developments are shaping its long-term performance landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

            "content": "How did AMD\u2019s graphics get so bad? SemiAccurate wanted to find something to like about the new 9070 series GPUs but AMD made that impossible.\n\nLets *SIGH* once again start out with the stupid, AMD itself. We actually really hate doing this but AMD keeps pulling out the footgun and it is getting painful to watch. No not on the hardware, they do that too, more later. This time it is about the launch itself, again. We keep telling AMD that when you make it impossible to cover the product, the story becomes about you, not the product. Guess what?\n\nAMD has this idiotic cycle of self-harm where they do a big dog and pony show to kiss up to the influencers, Youtubers, and others in the small word set. They get horrific feedback on the launch from anyone with two brain cells to rub together and dutifully explain why it is not their fault, why we are overstating things, and other transparently wrong excuses. The next time around they \u2018learn\u2019 and do a really awful phone brief like the one for the 9070. Following the universally bad feedback on that, they go back to the other bad way, rinse and repeat but never fix the problem.\n\nThis is OK, crappy briefings that waste otherwise useful oxygen are part of the game but there is one thing missing, the data we need to do the job. AMD consistently and intentionally does NOT do technical briefings on consumer products anymore, and there is NO excuse for this. The last time was a two day event with a 30 minute \u2018tech\u2019 session, including Q&A, that kinda listed the bullet points for a real briefing. This time around was a 52 minute overview, including Q&A time, plus three ~30 minute videos on specific topics.\n\nOne of these topics was a technical \u2018deep dive\u2019 on RDNA4 which concluded with the phrase, \u201cbrief overview\u201d. Worse yet there was NO ability to ask questions on this one, only a canned video. Last Friday I asked the first set of easy questions, basically what works with Linux for every \u2018technology\u2019 mentioned. Normally in a real briefing I ask this during or immediately afterwards and it takes all of five seconds to get an answer. Two days ago I got my first woefully incomplete answer to this question, my followup has yet to be responded to. This is a joke.\n\nThe real questions that should have followed once I had the baselines answered haven\u2019t been asked because I couldn\u2019t. Come on AMD, you used to be better than this, note the past tense. Because of this we really can\u2019t tell you anything useful about the things AMD wants you to hear about. Worse yet is their idiotic stance on disclosing pricing, basically they won\u2019t until it is public. This is wrong on many levels.\n\nThe problem here is I have never seen one of these cards. I have never used one of these cards and the review/numbers embargo is not today so there is no information publicly available. AMD wants us to write good things about a device that we have never seen, (spoiler alert) is _SLOWER_ than the previous generation by their own admission, is actually less efficient than before, and costs how much? See the problem? This is a self-inflicted wound but that seems to be the intent of AMD messaging so who am I to criticize?\n\nOK lets get on to those technical-ish claims, slower and less efficient. The slower is obvious, they literally said it is slower than the previous card in traditional workloads but faster in things like fake \u2018AI\u2019 frames and AI itself. Which do you think is relevant, slower in real workloads or faster in made up numbers? Since those fake frame generators and AI BS don\u2019t work in Linux, that seems to be the take home of the \u2018answer\u2019 to the earlier question I submitted, it is unquestionably slower.\n\nSpeaking of Linux, AMD promised to have a driver at launch this time so it may actually work. The last two generations sort of had a launch driver but it did not go so smoothly. I don\u2019t have a card to test so I can\u2019t say how it will break this time around but I am not hopeful it will install right once again.\n\nWhere the Radeon 9070 fits in\n\nNow we come to the key bit, efficiency. The new cards are between the older 7900XT and the 7900GRE which lines up with the slower bit AMD begrudgingly admitted to. Comparisons in the briefing deck include a lot of BS about AI performance, TOPS, and comparisons to such relevant devices as the Radeon 6800XT and the Nvidia RTX3080. Then AMD compares the 9070XT to the crippled 7900GRE which it beats by a claimed 42% at 4K and 38% at 1440p. The same tests for the 9070 non-XT are a claimed 21/20% faster at 4K/1440p respectively. Sounds good until you see that the largest increases come from raytracing performance, an area which AMD claims to have doubled performance. If you only look at the games, take 10%+ off those claims.\n\nBut is the performance real? AMD won\u2019t say.\n\nAMD also says they significantly improved the fake frames performance, something which we actually believe. That said the benchmark pages do not list whether fake frames are turned on for the presented benchmarks or not, and this is also omitted in the footnotes. AMD usually includes this, why backpedal this time? Oh wait we just answered that. Speaking of which AMD once again omits the system specifications on everything so the numbers they include should not be taken as honest in any way. Come on AMD, you were once better than this.\n\nThe spec for the new cards\n\nBack to the first real problem, efficiency. The TDP of the 9070XT is 304W and the 9070 is 220W, nothing unusual there. The older 7900XT pulled 300W, 7900XTX 355W, and the 7900GRE 260W. So far so good. Then you can look at the memory, 7900XT 20GB, 7900XTX 24GB, 7900GRE 16GB, and both of the 9070s are only at 16GB. The 9070s use faster GDDR6 but the bus is 50% narrower so it is a net loss.\n\nWhen you add it all up you have a slower card with less memory THAT TAKES MORE POWER. Let me repeat that, the 7900XT which AMD says is FASTER than the 9700XT, has 50% more GDDR6, pulls 4W more than the 9070XT! The 9070 fares much better at 220W but given that it has 7/8ths the shaders, ~5/6th the clock speed and likely slower memory, you see why AMD didn\u2019t include a single benchmark with it in the slides? It does take a lot less power than the others though so win? For the pedantic the numbers are 56/64 * 2.54/2.97 or a hair under 75%.\n\nThis is the first hallmark of a failed architecture, you are both slower AND take more power to do so than the older generation. Sure you can claim fake frames, better AI performance, and better media encode but I can\u2019t say if any of these things are true. Given how AMD pulled their usual disclosure about the setup, I will go out on a limb and say they aren\u2019t close to the real word actual performance AMD claims but you have to wait a week for independent reviews. Slimy PR tactics here.\n\nThe second problem that points to a failed architecture is which tier of cards are launching. You may have noticed that AMD did not launch a high end card this time around. The current die is ~350mm^2 on TSMC 4nm and has about 350B transistors compared to the older 7900XT/XTX which had a main die of 300mm^2 on TSMC 5nm and 6x37mm^2 memory controllers on TSMC 6nm, a true chiplet GPU. This time around the high end chiplet device is AWOL, we first heard about this at Computex and confirmed it at CES. Before you ask, ODMs at both shows were a bit peeved that there was no high end part this generation so don\u2019t hold your breath waiting.\n\nWhy would you not make a (likely) cheaper to manufacture device that competes in a market with vastly greater ASPs and margins? Could it be because the architecture didn\u2019t work? By that we mean it was either far higher power than tolerable as intoned above or it literally didn\u2019t work right. Or both. We will go with both for now, it is something SemiAccurate would have asked about but AMD precluded us from doing so. Pretty smart on their part actually, unless word gets out despite their best efforts.\n\nIt would be remiss of us not to talk about the software efforts. AMD claims that they have revamped the driver UI but as we keep pointing out, we have never actually seen much less used the new version. What did they add? AI of course, the bane of people that can read at a basic level or higher everywhere. Instead of making a usable UI that isn\u2019t painful to use, AMD took the crappy one and added AI. Voice recognition works so well in all circumstances, right? And more AI crap included too but we won\u2019t bore you any more other than to say the drivers now include a chatbot. This is one time I am tankful that AMD didn\u2019t include a feature in their Linux drivers.\n\nSimilarly the fake frames get a boost, maybe, with large 3-4x \u2018performance\u2019 improvements. Upscaling is easier than doing the work so lets \u2018improve\u2019 things that way! The media engine is also said to be improved both in quality and speed but who knows what it really does? Lots more improvements that may or may not be real but as we keep harping on, we couldn\u2019t ask questions so we won\u2019t contribute to the echo chamber and fake news by pimping them.\n\nSo what do we have in the end? An obviously failed architecture topped off with a self-inflicted wound on the messaging side. AMD really didn\u2019t want you to know that these new cards are both slower and less efficient than their 2+ year old predecessors. The expected high end devices failed and AMD graphics are lost. Lets hope it is not a permanent problem and AMD gets their act together. Again.S|A\n\nUpdate: AMD released pricing after this story was written with the 9070 coming in at $549 and the 9070XTX at $599. Currently at Newegg the slower 7900GRE costs $569, a faster 7900XT runs $679, and the cheapest XTXs is way overpriced at $979. Based on this it is understandable why AMD kept pricing from journalists until AFTER their stories were written and went live, the older cards are a better buy. If your offering was this bad, wouldn\u2019t you take the low road too?",

            "content": "After an endless stream of leaks, rumors, and wild guesses, AMD has now officially announced its new RDNA 4-based Radeon RX 9070 series graphics cards, the Radeon RX 9070 XT and the Radeon RX 9070. Both cards will launch on March 6th, coming from usual AMD AIB partners like Acer, Asus, ASRock, Powercolor, Sapphire, XFX, and others. In addition, AMD has provided a bit more details about its FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR 4).\n\nBased on 4nm Navi 48 GPU and AMD's new RDNA 4 architecture, both the Radeon RX 9070 XT and the Radeon RX 9070 will pack 16GB of 20 Gbps GDDR6 memory on a 256-bit memory interface. The Radeon RX 9070 XT packs 64 RDNA 4 Compute Units (CUs), with 64 hardware ray tracing accelerators and 128 hardware AI accelerators, 4,096 Stream Processors, boost clock of 2.97GHz, and a TBP of 304W. The Radeon RX 9070 has a cut down GPU with 56 CUs (56 HW RT and 112 HW AI accelerators) or 3,584 Stream Processors, works at 2.52GHz boost clock, and has a TBP of 220W. Both cards also support PCIe 5.0 x16 and come with DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b outputs.\n\nAMD also provided some performance figures, which compares both of these graphics cards against the Radeon RX 7900 GRE, or now aging Radeon RX 6900 XT, GeForce RTX 3090, and the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti. According to AMD, you can expect up to a 42 percent and 21 percent increase when RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 are compared to the RX 7900 GRE at 4K resolution, and \"2 percent lower performance at MSRP\" compared to the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti. Of course, we will wait for some reviews to start showing up.\n\nAMD also revealed a few more and much-awaited details about the AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 4, most commonly referred to as FSR 4. In short, AMD has confirmed that the FSR 4 will only work on Radeon RX 9000 series RDNA 4 GPUs, and it is launching with 30+ games, with 75+ coming this year. The big titles on the list are Kingdom Come Deliverance II, Horizon Forbidden West, Call of Duty Warzone, and Warhammer 40k: Space Marine II, among others.\n\nIn terms of performance, the FSR 4 promises anywhere between 2.1x and 3.4x performance gain compared to native resolution at 4K, with upscaling and Frame Generation.\n\nAs said, AMD is promising wide availability on March 6th, with plenty of SKUs coming from the usual suspects like Acer, Asus, ASRock, Gigabyte, Powercolor, Sapphire, XFX, and others. The price is a bit of a surprise as AMD is launching at $549 for the RX 9070 and $599 for the RX 9070 XT. This means it will fit between the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 and the RTX 5070 Ti.",

            "content": "The RX 9070 is positioned to fight the RTX 5070, with the 9070 XT up against the 5070 Ti. AMD has decided to steal NVIDIA\u2019s naming this time, growing tired of the naming scheme that brought us the R9 270, R7 370, RX 480 (watch our review), Fury, Fury X (watch our review), RX 580 (watch our review), Vega Frontier Edition (watch our review), Vega 56, Vega 64 (watch our revisit), back to RX 590 (watch our review), Radeon VII (watch our review), RX 5700 XT (watch our review), RX 6950 XT (watch our review), and RX 7900 XTX.\n\nMaybe leaving the old names behind is for the best. We look forward to seeing what they do when they hit the dreaded \u201c10.\u201d Maybe AMD will be the first to bring us the 10,080 Ti\u2026XT.\n\nOverview\n\nFirst up, the price: At $50 apart, it seems like these cards will smother each other. Until we can publish test data, we won\u2019t know which one will cannibalize the other -- but it seems likely, as happened with the 7900 XT and 7900 XTX when they were about $100 apart at launch.\n\nA quick pricing recap:\n\nAMD\u2019s RX 7800 XT is currently priced at around $500 to $530 depending on where or if you can get it. The RX 7900 GRE has been around $550 (though has been mostly out of stock lately). The RX 7900 XT is basically gone, but was around $630 to $640 at the end of last year and more commonly around $680. The 7900 XTX was as low as $800 to $820 in November and was commonly $930 in January. It launched at $1,000.\n\nThe 7900 XT received a review from us entitled \u201cAMD\u2019s Greedy Upsell\u201d in December of 2022, knocking it for the $900 price point. We revisited it in October of 2023, so less than a year later, because you could get some models for $720. AMD dropped the price by 20% or so in less than a year.\n\nThe 7900 XT became an awesome value after the price drops at least for a window there, especially in raster performance.\n\nWe\u2019ll talk more about the pricing once we have benchmark numbers in. That\u2019ll include NVIDIA\u2019s lineup.\n\nWith that context, let\u2019s get into the specs of the 9070 and 9070 XT.\n\nSpecs\n\nAMD provided this spec sheet for its RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT. The RX 9070 will have 56 Compute Units, or CUs, against the 64 on the 9070 XT (a 14% increase in CUs). AMD has done splits like this before, like Vega 56 and 64, but the architecture has changed dramatically since then.\n\nIn a call with the press, AMD claimed that the reason it didn\u2019t go up to something like 80 CUs is because it didn\u2019t want to make something super expensive. That definitely would have been very expensive. It would have been a larger die so that is accurate that the costs would go up. We also think that the architecture might just struggle to compete with a 5090 at the cost they would need to hit to do so and that\u2019s probably a large reason for this as well. AMD is focusing on the mid-range, where the architecture is perhaps better tuned to compete.\n\nThe hardware ray tracing accelerators match the CU count at 56 and 64, with AMD\u2019s so-called \u201cAI accelerators\u201d at 112 and 128 units.\n\nBoost clocks are significantly different between them: The 9070 XT is able to make more use of its extra 84W of power budget to hit an advertised boost of 2.97 GHz, with the RX 9070 non-XT at 2.52 GHz (the original slides said 2.54, but AMD brought that down before announcement). Memory capacity is identical between them at 16 GB. Both cards will utilize GDDR6 at 20 Gbps. Board power is advertised at 220W and 304W, hopefully with room for board partners to scale up with overclocking support. NVIDIA\u2019s OC support has been relatively lackluster this generation, despite what the company claimed. Hopefully AMD can make it exciting.\n\nFinally, the cards technically are on PCIe 5.0 x16 slots, but we already showed that there\u2019s no real impact to performance here in regards to the 5090. There almost certainly won\u2019t be any impact with the 90 series either with the exception if they were to cut down the slot on a lower-end model or something, but for this, it won\u2019t matter. DisplayPort is up to 2.1a and HDMI at 2.1b.\n\nBlock Diagram\n\nHere\u2019s the block diagram for the RDNA 4 die and architecture. AMD noted that this same die will be used for the 9070 and 9070 XT. The company says this will be 356.5mm^2, contain 53.9 billion transistors at most, and run on a 4nm process node. And then the 9070 would have some of the CUs basically turned off. AMD says that this is monolithic silicon and not a chiplet design.\n\nThis variation of the GPU has 4 Shader Engines, within each is contained 8 dual-compute units. L2 Cache is centralized and located towards the middle of the logical block, totaling 8MB max of L2, with 64MB of infinity cache at the outer edges and closer to the memory controllers.\n\nAMD\u2019s big claim here is a renewed focus on ray tracing performance, where it says it has doubled ray intersection rates and improved ray traversal, alongside changes to how it\u2019s handling bounding boxes for BVH probing. This is a big focus for AMD this generation and it is somewhere the company needs to focus because they\u2019re pretty competitive in raster compared to NVIDIA a lot of the time, but there\u2019s instances where they get completely crushed in ray tracing.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look internally. The area we\u2019ll focus is on RT. Within what AMD calls the compute engine, AMD now has 2x ray accelerators to handle box and triangle intersections. AMD noted that the second intersection engine within the accelerator \u201cdoubles the performance for both ray-box and ray-triangle testing\u201d over RDNA 3, although remember that this doesn\u2019t mean a clean doubling in performance in an actual ray tracing game scenario. AMD noted that RT processing takes advantage of a 128KB shared memory block, also shown here.\n\nThis slide was dedicated to RT improvements specifically and highlights the addition of AMD\u2019s dedicated ray transform block, which it says will \u201coffload transformation as you transition from the top-level RT structure to the bottom level, where there may be many instances of a particular geometry.\u201d Previously, shader instructions handled this task and, AMD says, added overhead to ray traversal which it claims to now have eliminated.\n\nThe ray accelerators have the ray transform block and two intersection engines, which themselves required changes to BVH handling to be fully leveraged.\n\nAMD said it is moving to an 8-wide BVH solution from a 4-wide option on earlier hardware, which it couples with its new oriented bounding box approach that attempts to reduce wasted, empty space in bounding boxes by better conforming to the geometry in the scene, theoretically reducing false positives and also reducing performance overhead and loss during geometry intersection probing.\n\nThe slide claims that traversal performance improves by 10%. Again, this is not a literal 10% gain in the final framerate in an RT game, but is a building block in a series of others to contribute to AMD\u2019s claimed uplift.\n\nThis slide above was pretty cool. The right side shows AMD\u2019s register allocation, with the top-right showing RDNA 3 and the bottom-right showing RDNA 4. Between the two, there\u2019s a change from static allocation in RDNA 3 to dynamic in RDNA 4. AMD highlights that RDNA 3 would reserve registers which may not be put to work, so it\u2019d hold them in case they were needed, potentially not need them, and end up with inefficiency and unavailable resources. RDNA 4 is trying to resolve this. The bullets on the left make all of this pretty clear, stating that the improvement is in efficient utilization, largely because registers can be released or requested as needed.\n\nAMD is claiming that its RDNA 4 CUs improve traversal by 2x over RDNA 3 when iso clock and bandwidth. The 3D block in the image is supposed to roughly illustrate where AMD thinks it\u2019s finding most of its performance: It appears that the 2x intersectors and BVH8 change (from 4) are the largest contributions.\n\nRDNA 4 also introduces more out-of-order queuing and aims to reduce latency of memory requests, which AMD claims further benefit RT performance. Further out of order execution allows work to complete even while longer latency requests are processing or queuing. AMD makes an example out of an uncached leaf node on the slide above, which would contain the lowest level of detail in an RT workload and could otherwise hold up a scene.\n\nFirst-Party Claims\n\nGrab a GN15 Large Anti-Static Modmat to celebrate our 15th Anniversary and for a high-quality PC building work surface.

We won\u2019t spend a ton of time on these since you\u2019ll be able to find plenty of third-party reviews soon enough, but it will help set expectations for what AMD is targeting.\n\nAMD\u2019s quick reference slide shows a claimed 26% uplift against the RTX 3080 and 38% uplift against the 6800 XT. AMD didn\u2019t show anything from NVIDIA\u2019s 40 or 50 series here.\n\nAt 4K/Ultra and without upscaling, AMD is marketing the RX 9070 non-XT as an average of 21% improved over the RX 7900 GRE. The 7900 GRE was originally a $550 card. AMD is showing non-RT performance as improving up to 28% on baseline 100%, with the ray tracing performance showing a disproportionately favorable gain to the new architecture at up to 34%. This is good for AMD, as it was weakest in ray tracing historically. This disproportionate gain won\u2019t wipe-out AMD\u2019s deficit in something like Cyberpunk 2077 or possibly Black Myth: Wukong, but the key will be whether it can close the gap with better value.\n\nAt 1440p/Ultra and native, AMD claims the 9070 will be 20% faster on average, with the peak at 38% improved for ray tracing and 26% improved for raster. AMD observed a slightly larger improvement in RT at 1440p for F1, which is interesting, despite overall losses in scaling in raster. 4K diverging from 1440p isn\u2019t abnormal, though. One thing we do want to call attention to and give AMD credit for here though is that they\u2019re showing native performance. Even if they show FSR, that\u2019s fine if they kept it locked to the same FSR options between their older and newer gen cards if they\u2019re comparing their own products to each other; showing native is a better step than that. This is a massive improvement over what we\u2019ve been complaining about NVIDIA doing, which was comparing its 50 series to its 40 series and enabling MFG 4X on the 50 series but not the 40 series and then just making it look like they are wildly better than they actually are. So we do want to call attention to and give AMD credit for making a more fair head-to-head comparison between its own products here rather than enabling some special multiplier on one and not the other.\n\nFirst-Party Claims: RX 9070 XT\n\nAs for the RX 9070 XT, AMD compared it against its 6900 XT and NVIDIA\u2019s RTX 3090, again lacking in any 40 or 50 series comparisons here. It claims a 51% uplift over the 6900 XT and 26% average uplift over the RTX 3090.\n\nAgainst the same 7900 GRE, AMD claims an average uplift of 42%, or 66% in F1 24 with ray tracing at the high end. AMD claims it saw the same uplift in Cyberpunk with RT. In raster performance, the gains max-out at 48% over baseline.\n\nAt 1440p, AMD is seeing lower overall average uplift, with a slight uptick in F1 24 with ray tracing.\n\nConclusion\n\nVisit our Patreon page to contribute a few dollars toward this website's operation (or consider a direct donation or buying something from our GN Store!)

Launch is only a few days away though, and we\u2019d rather test the cards than extrapolate on data that we have no control over or insight into. We\u2019ll have third-party numbers in our own reviews soon enough.\n\nPricing is going to remain the key concern for these cards. AMD is doing some interesting things architecturally. We\u2019ve covered a bit of that in this article. AMD has plenty of opportunities to have\u2026ROPs and cables that\u2026are not going to burn. The field is set for AMD to have a victory here. It is up to the company to execute on it. We just made a video called \u201cAMD, Don\u2019t Screw This Up\u201d that talks primarily about the pricing, but the reason AMD has this amazing opportunity is because of NVIDIA\u2019s screw-ups.\n\nPricing is the key concern, but we\u2019ll withhold judgment on it until we review it about a week from now.\n\nFrom what we understand, it sounds like supply will be okay, but it\u2019s hard to know what that really means.\n\nAMD really needs to gain market share. According to Jon Peddie Research, AMD is close to the lowest they\u2019ve ever been in the GPU market at around 10 percent while NVIDIA is down in terms of reputation and trust in their brand, so now is the time for AMD to strike. We\u2019ll let you know if they execute on that soon.",

            "content": "AMD\u2019s answer to Nvidia\u2019s RTX 50-series GPUs is arriving next week \u2014 and its new graphics cards are aggressively priced against Nvidia\u2019s $749 GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and $549 RTX 5070. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT ship on March 6th for $549 and $599, respectively, one day after the RTX 5070 arrives.\n\nAMD says they both offer \u201c4K gaming at a 1440p price,\u201d though it\u2019s making some unusual comparisons to do so \u2014 according to AMD, the 9070 XT is 51 percent faster on average than a four-year-old RX 6900 XT at 4K and max settings and 26 percent faster than a four-year-old RTX 3090 at the same settings, cards that filled a pricey niche two generations ago.\n\nWhile leaks had suggested the pricing of AMD\u2019s 9070 could start at $649, AMD surprised everyone today with suggested retail prices at $549 for this card \u2014 putting it head-to-head with Nvidia\u2019s $549 RTX 5070. The $599 9700 XT could even challenge Nvidia\u2019s $749 pricing for its RTX 5070 Ti, as long as AMD has managed to deliver performance that can challenge both of these RTX 50-series cards.\n\nWe won\u2019t know the full answer to that until reviews for AMD\u2019s cards appear next week, as well as reviews for Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5070. AMD is dropping some performance hints about where its 9070 series cards might fit in, though. It says the RX 9700 XT should be just behind RTX 5070 Ti performance, without ray tracing enabled. If accurate, that could put a lot of pressure on Nvidia\u2019s $749 pricing if AMD has good retail stock of its $599 GPU.\n\nAMD is making some big performance claims against Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5070 Ti. Image: AMD\n\nAMD also says the 9070 XT is 42 percent more potent at 4K Ultra (and 38 percent at 1440p Ultra) than AMD\u2019s RX 7900 GRE, a card that challenged the RTX 4070 at $549 but vanished after less than a year. And it\u2019s \u201cjust barely slightly slower\u201d than a 7900 XTX, AMD\u2019s 2022 flagship, we heard on a call.\n\nThe vanilla RX 9070, meanwhile, is 21 percent faster than the same 7900 GRE at 4K, suggesting it\u2019s not far off the XT in performance: 38 percent faster than the AMD 6800 XT and 26 percent faster than the Nvidia RTX 3080, according to AMD. At 220 watts of board power, AMD\u2019s director of graphics product management, Scott Olschewsky, says the 4nm monolithic chip is \u201cthe most efficient GPU we\u2019ve ever built.\u201d\n\nEach card also offers 16GB of GDDR6 memory, DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b ports, and are PCIe 5.0 cards \u2014 not that your motherboard needs a 5.0 new slot or would necessarily benefit from one. They will use standard 8-pin PCIe power connectors.\n\nImage: AMD\n\nWhile both the 9070 and 9070 XT have far fewer graphics compute units than the 7900 GRE (55, 64, and 80, respectively), they don\u2019t need as many because they\u2019re the first cards to ship with RDNA 4, which AMD says offers twice the rasterization (read: non-ray traced) graphics performance per compute unit as RDNA 2. (RDNA 3 was closer to 1.4x that of RDNA 2.)\n\nAMD says it\u2019s taken larger steps than that in ray tracing, too, and almost fully doubled its FP16 machine learning performance since RDNA 3, and up to 779 TOPS, though performance will differ from app to app: AMD\u2019s only seeing 12 percent more performance in Adobe Lightroom super resolution over the 7900 GRE, as one example.\n\nBut even if you\u2019re not playing with AI very intentionally, AMD will put that hardware to use in gaming with FSR 4, which comes with a new AI upscaling algorithm for its super resolution tech that\u2019ll exclusively run on these RDNA 4 and newer cards.\n\nOlschewsky says FSR 4 can increase frame rates \u201cwhile looking just as good as native rendering\u201d at 4K resolution. AMD used some images from Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 \u2014 a title that averages just 53fps at 4K Ultra settings \u2014 to show more fine detail in the distant background of an image while averaging at 182fps with FSR 4 and frame generation turned on.\n\nAnd while AMD didn\u2019t share expected performance for that game without the fake frames added, it did break out the differences for a handful of other games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Ratchet & Clank:\n\nAMD says it\u2019ll have 30 FSR4 games at launch and over 75 by the end of the year \u2014 one obvious theme is a lot of PS5 games, making us wonder how closely the PS5 Pro\u2019s \u201cPlayStation Spectral Super Resolution,\u201d an AI upscaler powered by AMD hardware, might be related to it. But AMD also says FSR 3.1 games can be updated to FSR 4 \u201cwith a simple toggle.\u201d\n\nThe new cards also have an enhanced media engine with higher image quality for gameplay recording, as the last one \u201cdid not meet quality expectations from the gamers trying to record and stream.\u201d AMD says its Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF), its generic fake frame generation you can apply to any game yourself, is being upgraded to AFMF 2.1, with less ghosting and smearing of details.\n\nAs with any graphics card these days, the actual amount you pay will be determined by whether AMD can actually make enough of the things, and if AMD\u2019s board partners don\u2019t jack up the price. Olschewsky had some fighting words for Nvidia there, though: \u201cWe believe that our 9070 XT will be going toe-to-toe with what you\u2019ve seen from the 5070 Ti that users may or may not be able to buy,\u201d adding that the 9070 \u201cis going to look very strong against their upcoming 5070.\u201d\n\nSome of the actual board partner cards on offer; AMD won\u2019t sell a reference board or \u201cFounders Edition.\u201d Image: AMD\n\nUnlike Nvidia, which warned of shortages with its new cards, he says AMD expects \u201cstrong availability at launch.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are working with all of our partners to go and deliver the most competitive prices on GPUs around the world; our focus is ensuring cards hit target price points around the world. It\u2019s difficult to predict what\u2019s going to happen, but we\u2019ll be working with partners as we see pricing show up.\u201d\n\nAt the end of AMD\u2019s event today the company also teased that its RX 9060 series cards will arrive in the second quarter to \u201cbroaden the family even further.\u201d AMD plans to disclose more information about these cards \u201clater,\u201d but it certainly looks like it\u2019s getting ready to challenge Nvidia\u2019s unannounced RTX 5060 cards.",

            "content": "AMD has announced the Radeon RX 9070 at $549 and the RX 9070 XT at $599, both of which ship on March 6. The AMD RDNA 4 architecture and Radeon RX 9000-series GPUs were partially revealed at CES 2025, except they weren't part of AMD's keynote. Very little was known (officially) other than the names of the first two graphics cards for the family. That changes today, with AMD detailing many of the architectural upgrades, specifications, and more, during a video presentation. These will go up against the Nvidia Blackwell RTX 50-series GPUs and the Intel Battlemage Arc B-series GPUs and will likely join the ranks of the best graphics cards in the coming days.\n\n\n\nLike Nvidia's RTX 50-series graphics cards, AMD's RDNA 4 launch seems to have been delayed, though perhaps for different reasons. There were rumors that the cards would be revealed at CES 2025 and launched in January, then February, and finally March. That last is no longer a rumor, with the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 set to go on sale on March 6 \u2014 and in typical fashion, the \"MSRP\" or base model cards will have reviews go up the day before, followed by the overclocked non-MSRP models on the launch date. Nvidia's RTX 5070 will likely land right around the same time, just to make things even more exciting.\n\nImage 1 of 44 (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD)\n\nBut if you look at graphics card availability right now, what becomes immediately clear is that virtually everything is sold out or, at the very least, seriously overpriced. AMD has had difficulties with GPU transitions in the past, with the prior generation hanging around for too long and competing with the new parts. This time, it seems to have gone the opposite way, with RX 7000-series GPUs mostly having disappeared from retail shelves in December and January. Only the lower tier RX 7600 and RX 7600 XT are still in stock at MSRP (or close to it).\n\n\n\nThe result has been dramatically increased demand for everything from mainstream to high-end graphics cards, and Nvidia's RTX 5090, RTX 5080, and RTX 5070 Ti all sold out almost instantly at launch. Will AMD's 9070 XT and 9070 fare better? We can hope so, but we suspect there's so much pent-up demand that even with another two months' worth of production and supply, it will still be insufficient. Hopefully, things will settle down later this year, but in the near term, we expect inadequate supplies and increased retail prices \u2014 and, yes, scalping.\n\n\n\nNo doubt Nvidia's record profits driven by AI are a big contributor, and while AMD isn't selling quite as many data center GPUs, a lot of its wafer allocation from TSMC is likely going to data center CPUs and GPUs as well. Gamers are no longer the top priority for either company, in other words; for the time being, they just get the scraps that fall from the AI table.\n\n\n\nBut enough sad talk. Let's check out the specifications for AMD's RDNA 4 GPUs, talk about architectural updates, and dig into all the other details. We even have pricing information, though as you can guess, that's worth about as much as the paper this is printed on. We'll continue updating this article as additional details become available, but for now, here's everything you need to know about the AMD RDNA 4 and Radeon RX 9000-series GPUs.\n\nRDNA 4 GPU specifications\n\nHere are the known specifications for the RX 9070 series GPUs, along with placeholder information on the RX 9060 series. AMD did share the 9060 name at CES 2025, but no other details have been shared. There are rumors, however, which we've used to flesh out the table \u2014 these are indicated by question marks in the various cells.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Graphics Card RX 9070 XT RX 9070 RX 9060 XT?

We're reasonably sure there will be a trimmed-down RX 9060 XT using the same Navi 48 die as the 9070 cards, just with fewer CUs (Compute Units) and memory controllers enabled. Below that, things get murky.\n\n\n\nThe RX 9060 could use a further binned Navi 48, or it could use Navi 44. Most of the details on Navi 44 are questionable at best, but we'll certainly find out more in the coming months. There might even be RX 9050-class GPUs at some point, but we've avoided listing those for the time being.\n\n\n\nLooking at the RX 9070 XT, it uses a fully enabled Navi 48 die that includes 64 RDNA 4 CUs. Combined with a 2.97 GHz boost clock and a 256-bit memory interface with 20 Gbps GDDR6 VRAM, the other specifications mostly come from straight mathematical calculations. The RX 9070 is mostly the same configuration, just with 56 CUs and a 2.52 GHz boost clock \u2014 substantially lower than its bigger sibling, though we'll have to wait and see what real-world clocks actually look like.\n\n\n\nPower targets also play a role in the final clock speeds, and where the 9070 XT has a 304W TBP (Total Board Power), the 9070 cuts that all the way down to 220W. That's probably a big factor in the 450 MHz difference in boost clocks.\n\n\n\nRaw compute works out to 48.7 TFLOPS FP32 on the 9070 XT and 36.1 TFLOPS on the 9070. On paper, that makes the XT up to 35% faster. In practice, we suspect the two chips will be quite a bit closer and that the actual clocks in most games may only be a couple hundred MHz apart, despite what the specs suggest.\n\n\n\nAMD has also given the Ray Accelerators and AI Accelerators in the CUs a massive overhaul compared to RDNA 3. For AI, each can do twice as many FP16 operations per cycle and they now support sparse operations. Sparsity can skip up to half of the zero multiply operations to potentially double performance, and it's a feature Nvidia has supported since its second-generation RTX 30-series GPUs. (AMD has also supported sparse operations on its CDNA family of GPUs for several years.)\n\n\n\nMoreover, the AI units also support FP8, INT8, BF8, and INT4 operations, with the 8-bit calculations being twice as fast as 16-bit, and 4-bit integers double that again. Put it all together, and you get 389 TFLOPS of sparse FP16 compute and up to 1557 TOPS of sparse INT4 compute.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that the previous generation RDNA 3 architecture featured GPUs with up to 96 CUs and a 384-bit memory interface on the RX 7900 XTX, so while RDNA 4 GPUs are faster on a per-CU basis, AMD doesn't expect the RX 9070 XT to beat the RX 7900 XTX in all workloads.\n\n\n\nThere's a lot more going on than the raw specs will tell you. First, let's cover the pricing and launch date, then move on to the architectural deep dive.\n\nRX 9070 XT and RX 9070 Performance\n\nImage 1 of 6 (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD)\n\nHow fast are the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 graphics cards? We can't share our own internal benchmarks yet, but AMD provided comparisons against its previous generation RX 7900 GRE. In it's testing of 11 rasterization games and nine ray tracing games, the 9070 XT was on average 42% faster at 4K and 38% faster at 1440p, while the 9070 was 21% faster at 4K and 20% faster at 1440p.\n\n\n\nBreaking things down into pure rasterization and pure ray tracing performance, the 9070 XT delivered 37% and 33% improvements in performance at 4K and 1440p in rasterization mode. In ray tracing games, it was 53% and 49% faster on average, again at 4K and 1440p, respectively. The RX 9070 meanwhile provided 18% and 17% higher rasterization performance at 4K and 1440p, while in ray tracing it was 22% and 20% faster on average.\n\n\n\nThese are AMD's own numbers, so we can't fully vouch for them, but we can use them to get a reasonable idea of where the new AMD cards might land relative to the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 4070 Ti Super (both 16GB cards).\n\n\n\nIn our GPU benchmarks hierarchy, at 4K in our rasterization test suite the RTX 4070 Ti Super beats the 7900 GRE by 13% at 4K and 7% at 1440p. The RTX 5070 Ti on the other hand was 14% faster than the 4070 Ti Super at 4K and 11% faster at 1440p. Taken together, our existing test results indicate the 5070 Ti would be around 29% faster than the 7900 GRE for 4K rasterization and 19% faster at 1440p.\n\n\n\nFlip over to ray tracing and our data has the 4070 Ti Super beating the 7900 GRE by 64% at 4K and 60% at 1440p. The new RTX 5070 Ti leads the 4070 Ti Super by 12% at both 4K and 1440p. That would thus put the 5070 Ti potentially 84% and 79% ahead of the 9070 XT.\n\n\n\nClear as mud? Let's put it this way: Our existing data combined with AMD's data suggests the 9070 XT will beat the 5070 Ti by perhaps 6% at 4K for rasterization and 12% at 1440p. In ray tracing, however, Nvidia would appear to still have the edge and be around 20% faster at 4K and 1440p. We can't be precise just because there are other factors in play \u2014 different testing suites, different platforms, and two levels of extrapolation (because we haven't tested the 7900 GRE on our new test suite yet), but overall it appears the 9070 XT will land reasonably close to the 5070 Ti in perforamnce.\n\n\n\nDoing the same calculations for the vanilla RX 9070, it would be a decent 12 to 17 percent slower than the 9070 XT, which would be about where the RTX 4070 Ti sits in our testing. But we don't know precisely where the RTX 5070 will land yet, so we can't really come to any conclusion. With only 12GB of VRAM on the Nvidia 5070, however, it seems more likely that the 9070 will take an overall lead. We'll find out for certain next week, so stay tuned.\n\nRX 9000-Series Pricing\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nHow much will the RX 9000-series GPUs cost? AMD has announced the Radeon RX 9070 will start at $549 and the RX 9070 XT will start at $599, placing them firmly in the \"mainstream\" segment. Given the current market conditions, however, it probably doesn't matter what AMD has given as the MSRP. Short-term, certainly, we expect the cards will all sell out and end up costing much more than the MSRP.\n\n\n\nAs we said in the Nvidia Blackwell overview, for dedicated desktop graphics cards, we're now living in a world where \"budget\" means around $250\u2013$300, \"mainstream\" means $400\u2013$700, \"high-end\" is for GPUs costing $800 to $1,000, and the \"enthusiast\" segment targets $1,500 or more. AMD is going after the mainstream segment with the 9070 series, and possibly the lower mainstream and upper budget segments with future 9060 series parts.\n\n\n\nDepending on supply, as well as performance, the RDNA 4 series should be worth the price AMD is asking. More likely is that there simply won't be enough cards to satisfy the current demand, not for many months. Given the reasonably low-ish prices, don't be surprised if scalpers and retail markups step in and push the prices up.\n\n\n\nIt's basically a repeat of the cryptocurrency GPU mining shortages, only this time it's caused by AI and demand from that sector may not go away for many years. Let's hope we're wrong, but the RTX 50-series launches so far have not been promising.\n\nWe listed the March 6, 2025 release date for the RX 9070 cards already, but AMD has also at least partially teased an RX 9060 family of GPUs. Will there be multiple cards or only one? Will there be lower-tier RX 9050 cards as well? The short answer: We don't know. The nebulous answer: Sometime between April and the end of the year, hopefully sooner than later.\n\n\n\nWe've seen rumored die sizes for Navi 44 that suggest it's a much smaller chip, like more of a replacement for the current Navi 33 (RX 7600 series). If that's correct, it may not come out any time soon. There still appear to be plenty of RX 7600 and RX 7600 XT GPUs floating around, and that's because when those launched there were still a lot of similar performing Navi 23 (RX 6650 XT / RX 6600 XT / RX 6600) cards still available, at lower prices.\n\n\n\nThe naming scheme from AMD suggests that the RX 9060 will compete with the RTX 5060 family. That would perhaps require a larger chip than what's indicated. But RX 7600 does technically compete with the RTX 4060, and there's no RTX 4050 and probably won't be an RTX 5050.\n\n\n\nWill AMD be making a \"true budget\" RDNA 4 chip? Again, rumors suggest that's at least possible, perhaps even likely. At less than half the size of Navi 48, AMD may try to create a $200~$250 graphics card to go after budget-minded gamers \u2014 and OEMs. Certainly it could get a lot more chips per wafer with the rumored 150~160 mm^2 die size.\n\n\n\nBut if the cards then only sell for $250 or less? That hardly seems worth the effort, not when companies can charge tens of thousands for data center GPUs.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

AMD worked to refine the underlying architecture to improve per-CU performance in all major workloads: rasterization, ray tracing, and AI.\n\n\n\nRasterization performance sees the smallest generational gains, but it's still about 40% faster than RDNA 3 according to AMD. Ray tracing performance is basically doubled, and AI performance is doubled for dense FP16 compute, with lower precision formats delivering even higher performance.\n\n\n\nThe specific details of the rasterization improvements are a bit nebulous. RDNA 4 supports out of order memory requests, which AMD specifically notes as being helpful for ray tracing, but it can help rasterization tasks as well \u2014 we just don't have any details on how much. The other major change involves dynamic register allocation. RDNA 3 (and earlier) allocated registers for the worst case for shaders. By dynamically allocating extra registers only when needed, AMD provides an example use case where it could have an extra wave in flight. The slides show three waves versus four waves, which would be a 33% increase, but we don't know if that's representative of real workloads or just for illustrative purposes.\n\n\n\nMoving on to ray tracing, this is where AMD spent a significant amount of effort. It doubled the ray/triangle and ray/box intersection rates per RT unit as a start. Then it offers some enhancements including hardware instance transforms (rather than doing a lot of the work via GPU shaders), oriented bounding boxes, an improved BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) structure and traversal, the above-mentioned out of order memory returns, and better ray hardware stack management.\n\n\n\nMost of the improvements come from the doubling of intersection rates and BVH compression, but the other aspects combine to deliver a solid improvement as well. How does RDNA 4 compare with Nvidia's latest hardware? That's not fully clear, but certainly it's going to do better per CU than what we saw with RDNA 3 and RDNA 2. It likely won't match Blackwell, but it might be better than Ampere and at least closer to Ada levels of performance.\n\n\n\nAI, as already noted, sees the biggest changes. Nvidia has been iterating on its AI tensor cores since the RTX 20-series, and even before that the Volta data center GPU had tensor cores. So Nvidia is on its fifth generation of AI matrix cores while AMD is mostly on its second generation \u2014 mostly because it looks like AMD took a lot of the work that's been happening in its CDNA GPUs and brought it over to RDNA 4.\n\n\n\nRDNA 3 CUs could do 512 FP16 operations per cycle, with no sparsity support, or 1024 INT4 operations per cycle. With RDNA 4, AMD doubles the baseline FP16 throughput for dense operations, doubles that again for sparse operations, and doubles that again for FP8 workloads \u2014 which are proving useful in the AI space. That's up to 8X higher AI throughput for FP8 on RDNA 4 compared to FP16 on RDNA 3, and the INT4 throughput sees a similar up to 8X improvement.\n\n\n\nAMD gave a real-world example of how this affects AI performance using Stable Diffusion XL. The RX 9070 XT with 64 CUs took on the RX 7900 XT with 84 CUs. That gives the older GPU a 31% advantage in compute units, but the 9070 XT ended up delivering very close to 2X the performance. That will prove very helpful for other AI and machine learning workloads, including ML-based upscaling and frame generation (see FSR 4 below).\n\n\n\nAlongside these changes, AMD has reworked some of the cache and memory hierarchy with RDNA 4. It didn't provide any clear details on what has changed, but it notes that this is the third generation of Infinity Cache. The capacity remains 64MB, the same as what was present on the 256-bit 7900 GRE and 7800 XT, but now the cache is again part of the monolithic chip, so it likely has better latencies and throughput.\n\nRDNA 4 Other Architectural Improvements\n\nRDNA 4 isn't just about core architecture upgrades. Along with the above rasterization, ray tracing, and AI enhancements, AMD has also upgraded a few other areas. One of the big changes is with the media encoding hardware. Last time we checked video encoding performance and quality, AMD came in last place, clearly behind Nvidia and Intel. It looks like RDNA 4 will close the gap.\n\n\n\nAMD says it has improved H.264 (AVC) quality by up to 25%, H.265 (HEVC) by 11%, and improved the AV1 encoding efficiency. It also has better support for AV1 and VP9 decoding and reduced memory accesses.\n\n\n\nBesides the quality improvements, RDNA 4 adds a dual media engine. Nvidia did this with its Ada architecture, and AMD seems to be taking a similar approach. It likely doesn't help all workloads equally, but AMD says it doubles the AV1 encoding throughput.\n\n\n\nRealistically, there's only so far you can go with improving video encoding quality, particularly with hardware encoders. Intel and Nvidia are pretty comparable, but AMD was behind on quality while being ahead on performance with RDNA 3. It sounds like RDNA 4 will continue to be faster while offering similar quality to the competition, which is a good thing.\n\n\n\nAnother change with RDNA 4 is that AMD has added hardware flip queue support, which offloads video frame scheduling to the GPU. While Nvidia discussed something similar for MFG (Multi Frame Generation), it sounds like AMD's solution is focused on improving video playback by reducing CPU load, as opposed to being something to improve the scheduling of generated frames.\n\n\n\nRadeon Image Sharpening (RIS) has also been updated, to RIS2. This is a driver level sharpening solution that's based on AMD's CAS algorithm (Contrast Aware Sharpening), only now the quality is supposed to be better. It's a single click toggle to apply RIS2 across all APIs.\n\n\n\nFinally, RDNA 4 GPUs will support PCIe 5.0 interfaces. That doubles the throughput over the x16 link, though in practice most workloads likely won't see much benefit. Gaming in particular doesn't tend to need more than PCIe 3.0, or perhaps 4.0, when using a full x16 connection. However, AI and certain content creation tasks can benefit from the added bandwidth. Don't be surprised if the future Navi 48 chips and possibly even the RX 9060 XT cut the interface down to x8 or even x4 widths.\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\nSticking with GDDR6 VRAM\n\nOne thing that isn't changing from RDNA 3 is the memory support. While Nvidia has moved all of the announced Blackwell RTX 50-series solutions to GDDR7 memory, AMD will continue to use GDDR6 memory, clocked at up to 20 Gbps. Coupled with a 256-bit interface on the 9070 XT and 9070 GPUs, that results in 640 GB/s of memory bandwidth. That's the same VRAM capacity as the RX 7900 GRE and RX 7800 XT, and also the same as Nvidia's RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 4070 Ti Super.\n\n\n\nThe 64MB Infinity Cache will improve the effective bandwidth, though AMD didn't elect to provide any estimates of cache hit rates so far. The RX 7900 GRE and RX 7800 XT both had 64MB Infinity Caches, and AMD provided effective bandwidth rates that were about 4X the base memory bandwidth with those GPUs, so we'd anticipate the Navi 48 GPUs will see similar results.\n\n\n\nIt's also possible that further improvements to the Infinity Cache have made it less critical for AMD to move to GDDR7 at present. Considering that Nvidia gets a 40% improvement in raw bandwidth from 28 Gbps GDDR7 compared to AMD's 20 Gbps GDDR6, that might seem like a sizeable advantage. However, effective bandwidth after factoring in the large caches may not be all that different.\n\n\n\nPlus, there's only so much bandwidth needed to drive a 64 CU GPU. Nvidia's RTX 5070 Ti for example has 70 SMs (Streaming Multiprocessors), which are roughly analogous to AMD's CUs, and the 5070 Ti has a 48MB L2 cache. Putting a larger 64MB L3 cache with fewer GPU processing clusters could reduce the need for higher memory speeds.\n\n\n\nAMD continues to use 16Gb (2GB) GDDR6 modules, and we're unaware of any companies currently pursuing 24Gb (3GB) capacities. That's one area where GDDR7 support could prove beneficial for Nvidia in the future, though so far only the RTX 5090 Laptop GPU is using the higher capacity chips.\n\nMonolithic GPUs, Built on TSMC N4P\n\nOne of the interesting changes with RDNA 4 is that AMD is, at least for now, ditching the GPU chiplets approach. It may come back to that in the future, but the Navi 48 and presumably the rumored Navi 44 will be monolithic chips. Along with that design choice, AMD is also upgrading from TSMC's N5 process node used on RDNA 3 to the N4P node for RDNA 4.\n\n\n\nN4P provides for modest improvements in performance and efficiency compared to the N4 node, which in turn refines the base N5 node. Our understanding is that N4P may introduce some additional metal layers, and N4 used more EUV than N5. What's not entirely clear is how N4P compares to 4N and 4NP \u2014 the \"for Nvidia\" variants that are used with Hopper, Ada, and Blackwell. It's probably pretty similar in most respects, which means that AMD will be on node parity with Nvidia this round.\n\n\n\nBut AMD isn't really trying to take down Nvidia's top GPUs. The lack of GDDR7 memory and the lack of a larger design prove this. The Navi 48 chip will house 53.9 billion transistors in a 356.5 mm^2 die. Nvidia's GB203 used in the RTX 5080 and 5070 Ti contains 45.6 billion transistors in a 378 mm^2 die... which might suggest AMD actually has a superior process node and/or design. But we can't really conclude that.\n\n\n\nWhile die sizes are pretty straightforward, transistor counts are not. They're more of a mathematical estimate, and there are different ways of counting what constitutes a \"transistor.\" Perhaps AMD does have a denser design with more transistors, perhaps not. Ultimately, we'll have to see how the various GPUs perform.\n\n\n\nOne interesting side note here is that Navi 31, the top solution from the RDNA 3 family, had a 300 mm^2 GCD (Graphics Compute Die) with six 37.5 mm^2 MCDs (Memory Cache Dies). I wondered when AMD revealed the specs just how much it was actually saving by going the chiplet route. The GCD had 45.6 billion transistors, which means the overall transistor density \u2014 looking at the RDNA 3 GCD compared to the RDNA 4 monolithic design \u2014 is basically identical (152 MTrans/mm^2 on Navi 31 GCD compared to 151.2 Mtrans/mm^2 on Navi 48).\n\n\n\nBut let's not get too carried away. It's known that scaling on external interfaces \u2014 like the GDDR6 memory controllers \u2014 is quite poor with newer process nodes. Navi 31 used twelve 32-bit controllers while Navi 48 has eight 32-bit controllers. If AMD had attempted to make a 384-bit interface on a monolithic design, it would have certainly required a larger chip. Putting that on an older process node for the prior generation did make financial sense at the time, and may yet prove a smart approach for a future AMD product.\n\nNo \"Made By AMD\" Reference Cards\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\nIf it wasn't clear yet, AMD will not be making or selling its own reference model RX 9070 series graphics cards. Despite providing some slides of what appear to be MBA (Made By AMD) cards, these are merely graphical renders rather than photos of actual hardware. There were certainly prototype cards created during the design, testing, and validation process, but what those looked like isn't really important.\n\n\n\nAll of the RX 9070 series graphics cards will be made by AMD's add-in board (AIB) partners. That means two things. First, we'll see a lot of variation in final clock speeds and power draw, not to mention things like the number of fans and RGB lighting. But more importantly, it means AMD has a lot less say in the actual retail graphics card prices.\n\n\n\nVery likely AMD has a requirement that all of the AIBs have at least one model for each GPU that will be nominally priced at the stated MSRP. Beyond that, however, all bets are off. \"Here's our RX 9070 XT Red Herring for $599... and we sold all of those. Sorry! But you can pick up our Redder Herring OC model for $799!\" We saw something like this with the RTX 5070 Ti cards, where there also isn't a reference model from Nvidia.\n\n\n\nLong-term, if there's insufficient supply to meet the demand, most AIBs are going to produce higher tier models with a few minor extras and drastically inflated prices. If on the other hand the supply catches up to demand, then it's easy enough to drop prices as needed.\n\nFSR 4 and HYPR-RX\n\nImage 1 of 28 (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD)\n\nBesides the hardware, AMD has been working on a variety of feature improvements. The biggest one is undoubtedly FSR 4. The fourth iteration of AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) algorithm, it will break with tradition in a couple of key ways.\n\n\n\nFirst, FSR 4 will leverage the more potent AI accelerators in the RDNA 4 GPUs. At launch, it will require an RDNA 4 GPU. Down the road a few months, AMD may try back-porting the algorithm so that it can run on RDNA 3 and maybe even RDNA 2 GPUs... but it seems unlikely.\n\n\n\nInstead, FSR 4 will basically co-exist with FSR 3.1, or rather, the non-AI upscaling will continue to be offered. It's not entirely clear exactly how this will play out, but keeping everything unified under one name makes more sense. What we do know is that AMD plans to allow gamers to use the more potent FSR 4 algorithm on games that have FSR 3.1 support. Will that happen automatically or require a driver settings toggle? It seems like the latter but we'll have to wait and see.\n\n\n\nFSR 4 isn't just for upscaling, either; it also has frame generation. From our understanding, both upscaling and framegen will use the AI accelerators of the RX 9000-series GPUs. AMD also says RDNA 4 is \"neural rendering ready\" without really going into further detail. Presumably that's related to Microsoft's new Cooperative Vectors feature, which is something Nvidia also talked about with Blackwell.\n\n\n\nWe've asked for additional details on how FSR 4 works, in terms of the computations. AMD hasn't responded, but one slide does note that the RX 9070 XT offers \"up to 779 TOPS AI Acceleration\" while talking about FSR 4. Now, that's either dense INT4 operations or sparse INT8 operations, as the 9070 XT hits double that figure for sparse INT4, but we don't have a direct answer on whether the algorithms are using INT4 or INT8 yet. Either way, that's a lot more theoretical compute than what you can get from prior generation AMD GPUs, which is why we don't anticipate the AI upscaling and framegen models getting backported.\n\n\n\nWe also asked if FSR 4 was using a transformers-based network or a convolutional neural network. DLSS 4 offers better image fidelity than DLSS 3 by using transformers, and AMD may have skipped the CNN approach since it's late to the AI-powered upscaling and framegen party. However, we don't have a direct answer yet. We do have some image quality comparisons from AMD, in the slides above, and FSR 4 definitely looks better than FSR 3.1.\n\n\n\nAs with Nvidia's use of performance mode upscaling with framegen, we don't generally focus on the promised performance after all these extras. Framegen in particular is very heavy on marketing in our experience. It's less problematic when you already have a high base framerate, but then it's also less necessary when you're already getting 100+ FPS.\n\n\n\nAMD says it will have over 30 games with FSR 4 enabled for the RX 9070 series launch, with 75+ games coming in 2025.\n\n\n\nAMD also talked about HYPR-RX, which combines a variety of driver-level performance boosting features and can be enabled with a single click. We've poked at it a bit in the past, and it can be useful in some cases, but we prefer sticking with apples to apples comparisons. If you're just playing games, however, enabling HYPR-RX to apply all of the features including FSR/RSR, Anti-Lag, Radeon Boost, and AFMF 2 could be useful.\n\n\n\nAMD also has a new AFMF 2.1 release that imprves the quality of the algorithm, reducing ghosting, improving fine features, and detecting and handling overlays better.\n\nDrivers and Software\n\nImage 1 of 27 (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD)\n\nThe last item AMD discussed is its new Adrenalin 25.3.1 drivers along with some new software. While most of the driver interface will be familiar to AMD GPU users, there are some new additions along with some behind the scenes changes. AI plays a role in both areas. We've already discussed FSR 4 upscaling and framegen, so let's talk about the other AI uses.\n\n\n\nFirst, AMD is using AI to help find rendering errors and to detect instability and other issues. AMD claims its new 25.3.1 drivers will be perhaps the best and most stable drivers it has ever released, with fewer rendering errors. We'll have to wait and see how that goes...\n\n\n\nMoving on, similar to Nvidia's Chat RTX and other tools, AMD is providing some easy to access AI-powered features. These are all managed by a new AMD Install Manager that sits alongside the usual AMD Software in your system tray. Besides your GPU drivers, it can also detect if you have an AMD platform and keep your chipset drivers updated. And then there are some new extras: AMD Chat, AMD Image Inspector, and the AI Apps Manager (among others).\n\n\n\nAMD Chat is a chatbot designed to answer questions specifically about your PC hardware and GPU. You can ask it about GPU temperatures, performance, and more. It's a hefty 25GB download, though, so you might not want to install if it you're low on space \u2014 or if chatting with your PC isn't something you plan on doing.\n\n\n\nThe AI Apps Manager provides a list of software and utilities that can use AI that are installed or available to install. So if you have Adobe CC, some of those apps might show up. Or you can use it to install Amuse, AMD's tuned AI image and video generation tool.\n\n\n\nFinally, the Image Inspector is a feature to help with finding and reporting rendering errors and bugs. AMD is already using AI to help it find issues internally, and the Image Inspector is an opt-in feature that allows you to participate. Using spare GPU resources (so it won't go crazy and use all your GPU power if you're in a demanding game), it can automatically capture rendering errors and submit them to AMD, should you enable the feature. It sounds interesting, but we suspect there might be a performance hit still, even if it's small.\n\nThe GPU landscape\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nFrankly, RDNA 4 feels like what AMD should have been doing with RDNA 3 rather than pursuing the abandoned-for-now GPU chiplets approach. AMD has finally decided to put serious effort into ray tracing hardware and AI in its consumer product line. We can understand why RDNA 2 was lacking in these areas \u2014 Nvidia's GeForce RTX feature set probably caught the company off guard \u2014 but when RDNA 3 arrived in 2022, it really needed to do more and be more.\n\n\n\nWhat's interesting is that all of these new hardware features haven't caused a massive bloat in the die size. Navi 48 is 357 mm^2 on a 5nm-class node (N4P). Navi 31 was 300 mm^2 on a 5nm-class node (N5), with Infinity Fabric links to the external memory and cache chiplets. Rip out those links, rework the cores, and this was all possible several years ago. Which is obvious, since Nvidia already did that, but it felt like RDNA 3 doubled down on the \"ray tracing and AI aren't really that important\" marketing and got left behind. RDNA 4 finally rights that misstep, or at least attempts to. Now we just need to see how the actual hardware performs in a variety of tasks.\n\n\n\nAMD's RDNA 4 GPUs will have to compete with Nvidia Blackwell RTX and Intel Arc Battlemage solutions. As we discussed already, supply and availability of all graphics cards has become quite poor of late. (Yes, that's a sarcastic understatement.) Every recently launched GPU has sold out quickly, with many cards then selling at prices far above the original MSRP. It started with the Arc B580 and became especially painful with Nvidia's Blackwell launches.\n\n\n\nThings aren't going to get better in the near term. The big issue is that there are a lot of companies competing for a limited supply of silicon manufacturing. TSMC only has the ability to process so many wafers in a month. Right now, AMD, Apple, Intel, and Nvidia are all using TSMC for various chips, and there are plenty of other companies as well \u2014 Broadcom, Facebook, Google, Amazon... the list can get quite large.\n\n\n\nEven if a company pays for a certain number of wafers in a given month, what to do with those wafers is still up for debate. Just looking at the main PC companies, AMD could make RDNA 4 GPUs on TSMC's N4P node, sure. Or it could make Zen 5 CPU chiplets for both Ryzen and EPYC CPUs, CDNA 3 data center GPUs (MI300X), other Ryzen APU designs for laptops and handhelds, or the future CDNA 4 GPUs that are likely coming this year. Nvidia has Grace CPUs, Hopper and Blackwell data center GPUs, NVLink processors, Ada Lovelace previous generation GPUs, and the new Blackwell RTX GPUs that are all using variants of TSMC's 5nm-class nodes. And Intel has leveraged TSMC for all or part of its Arrow Lake, Lunar Lake, and Battlemage product lines.\n\n\n\nNvidia made record profits last year of $130 billion, primarily driven by AI. Its consumer gaming division only accounted for $11.35 billion, 8.7% of the total. And going forward, Nvidia will likely invest even more heavily in data center GPUs. That will eat up a lot of wafers, needless to say, and gaming will have to compete for its share.\n\n\n\nThe good news is that more manufacturing capacity is coming online. A lot of that will likely go to create more AI processors, but the more capacity that exists, the more likely it is for other, less profitable chips \u2014 like consumer GPUs \u2014 to get made. And maybe AMD and Intel will try to grow their gaming GPU divisions while Nvidia is otherwise occupied. Or maybe Nvidia will treat gaming as a passion project that started the company and so it will try to ensure at least a reasonable number of chips get made. Maybe, maybe...\n\n\n\nWhatever happens, what's clear right now is that, as long as AI continues to grow as an industry, gaming GPUs are now a lower priority item for most of the biggest players in the graphics space. Let's hope that, like cyptocurrency mining, this turns out to be just a passing phase. But we wouldn't bet the farm on that.",

At least, we won\u2019t have to wait long before we see how well these new cards stack up, as the cards are set to launch on March 6 through a range of OEMs.\n\nAMD claims gamers prefer GPUs at mid-range prices, but they want to play their games at 4K anyway. The big news is the price. The RX 9070 costs $550, the same price as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070. The RX 9070 XT starts at $600, $150 less than Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5070 Ti. Both are set to launch on March 6.\n\nSkipping any mention of a RX 8000 series (to better align with the GPU nomenclature with the latest Ryzen 9 series CPUs) doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s fully two generations ahead, though it is built with 4K and 1440p gaming in mind for more recent games. The lower-level GPU, the RX 9070, comes in at 56 of the company\u2019s RDNA 4 compute units with 16 GB of VRAM (GDDR6 running at 20 Gbps) on a 256-bit memory bus and a boost clock of 2.54 GHz. The RX 9070 XT stands taller with 64 compute units, more AI accelerators, and a 2.97 GHz boost clock. The higher-end GPU also maintains 16 GB VRAM, equivalent to Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5070 Ti.\n\nMoreover, AMD claims it can hit native framerates at or above the RTX 5070 Ti at 4K. Of course, that\u2019s all before unpacking the difference between AMD\u2019s and Nvidia\u2019s upscaling software. It\u2019s up to our tests to see who comes out on top, though that $600 price point looks very attractive amid all the current RTX 50-series stock woes.\n\nWhat\u2019s Going On Under the Hood with RX 9000 Series GPUs?\n\nThe RX 9070 has 53.9 billion transistors versus 55.8 billion on the RX 7900 XT. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was more than ready to proclaim, \u201cMoore\u2019s law is dead,\u201d but there\u2019s still something interesting going on, considering the 7900 XT contained 84 RDNA 3 compute units at launch in 2022. Each RDNA 4 CU is supposed to support higher clock speeds than RDNA 3. AMD also claims its new GPUs are more power efficient than the past or current generation, meaning it should get more done than the RX 7900 series with fewer total compute units.\n\nThe RX 9070 demands 220W of board power compared to 250W on the RTX 5070. Meanwhile, the RX 9070 XT has 304W of total board power compared to 300W on the RTX 5070 Ti. However, the RX 9070 will still recommend a 650W PSU, while the 9070 XT will ask for a 750W power supply, like the equivalent Nvidia cards.\n\nRDNA 4 sports a new structure with an extra computing unit designed with ray tracing in mind. According to AMD, the compute unit is 40% faster than RDNA 3, and there\u2019s a promised two times increase in ray tracing performances per compute unit versus the past-gen architecture thanks to a reconfigured, more-optimized raytracing pipeline. The new architecture supports PCIe Gen 5 along with HDMI 2.1b and DisplayPort 2.1a. Team Red also promoted its second-gen AI accelerators. The RX 9070 should be able to hit 1,165 peak TOPS of AI performance versus the RX 9070 XT at 1,557 TOPS.\n\nIgnoring all the talk about AI, AMD purports more gamers are looking to upgrade off the RX 6800 XT or the Nvidia RTX 3080 and RTX 3090. For gen-on-gen performance, Team Red claims you\u2019ll get 33% better performance in a Cyberpunk 2077 at 1440p with ray tracing enabled on the RX 9070 compared to last year\u2019s RX 7900 GRE. The XT will get over 66% better in the same game at 4K ultra-performance versus the RX 7900 GRE. The frames aren\u2019t as significant in a game like F1 24 or Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, but there\u2019s still a bigger uplift in native gaming performance.\n\nHow Much Will the Radeon RX 9000 GPUs Cost?\n\nAMD waited until its full announcement to drop its final pricing on the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT, knowing its the big consideration for most gamers. It\u2019s a tough market, and Nvidia\u2019s latest issues with RTX 50-series availability have made customers nervous about the cost of upgrading. AMD said it was working with the companies making its AIBs to have enough stock at launch, but time will tell.\n\nAMD said it doesn\u2019t have to play in the same exclusive, ultra-expensive pool as the big dogs at Nvidia. Instead, it\u2019s focusing on the mid-range GPUs that, perhaps, a few more gamers can afford. That doesn\u2019t mean these cards are cheap.\n\nAMD may have focused on running cards for under $700, though Nvidia still holds an edge in gaming software. The company now has to bet more gamers would prefer to save some bucks (and, depending on availability, actually be able to buy one) rather than relying on tricks like multi-frame gen. However, AMD is still promoting how its next generation of FSR provides better framerates than the last generation.\n\nAMD\u2019s FSR 4 Is Looking to Take On DLSS 4 for AI Upscaling\n\nAMD\u2019s FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 for the RDNA 4 architecture is supposed to improve the upscaling tech trying to take on DLSS 4 by reducing regular complaints of ghosting or anti-aliasing artifacts. Just like always, FSR takes a lower-resolution image and upscales it to a higher-resolution image, all while keeping the performance of the lower end. AMD said FSR-4 can create \u201cnear-native results\u201d for its supported games on the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT.\n\nWhether that\u2019s true will be up to the eagle-eyed players keen to point out any issue with a non-native frame, especially when you throw frame generation into the mix. AMD compared native 4K to FSR 3.1 and FSR 4, claiming the latter seems closer to native with fine details and far-away images. As for performance, AMD claimed a larger uplift in FPS on a 9070 XT in a game like Warhammer 40K: Space Marine II, going from 53 FPS to 102 FPS at 4K. Increased frames are slightly lower on games like Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. That\u2019s all before frame gen, as well. As for multi-frame gen, that\u2019s still off the table. AMD indicated it has worked on prototypes for that AI capability but is mostly there to encourage benchmarking rather than improve the user experience.\n\nNo matter what card you choose, upscaling is a boon for gamers who can\u2019t spend $2,000 on an RTX 5090. The question will be how it compares to DLSS 4. AMD also has a new AMF 2.1 model to make generated frames look smoother than before. Nvidia made a big deal about the transformer model of DLSS. AMD\u2019s widening software gulf is nowhere clearer than with 3x or 4x multi-frame gen, a capability exclusive to the RTX 50 series of GPUs. The more frames you generate with AI, the more likely you find odd artifacts (and in our tests, we certainly have). But when comparing mid-range GPUs, those extra frames may be worth the drawbacks to some budget-conscious gamers.\n\nAMD said it\u2019s supporting more than 30 games with FSR 4 at launch, including recent games like Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2 and Kingdom Come Deliverance II. The chipmaker said it planned to have over 75 games support the technology going into 2025. FSR 4 will only be supported on RDNA 4, while the company promised more games will support FSR 3.1 throughout the year.",

These new cards, priced at $549 and $599, respectively, lead the charge on AMD\u2019s latest strategy to compete in the midrange graphics card market.\n\nWith claims of improved ray-tracing performance over the previous generation, as well as enhanced super-scaling and frame generation via FSR 4, these new cards show potential. Here's a look over AMD's new RDNA 4 graphics architecture and the first graphics cards in the Radeon RX 9000 lineup.\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9000: Recalling a Golden Era in GPUs\n\nAMD cleverly named its new graphics cards the Radeon RX 9000 series, paralleling an early family of ATI cards known as the Radeon 9000 series. These graphics cards landed way back in 2002 and marked a golden era for ATI, the creator and manufacturer of the Radeon series, before AMD acquired the company in 2006.\n\nBack then, the original Radeon 9000 series dominated the graphics card market against Nvidia's GeForce 4 series and GeForce FX 5000 cards that replaced them. This time around, the Radeon RX 9000 series won\u2019t try to stand up to Nvidia's top-end cards, as AMD has yielded the high end to the enormous Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090. Instead, AMD aims to conquer the space between the ultra-high-end GeForce RTX 5090 and the budget market. (The latter is typically dominated by last-generation graphics cards nowadays.)\n\nRDNA 4 Improves Ray Tracing\n\nAMD's new graphics architecture, RDNA 4, powers the Radeon RX 9000 series. It's an evolution of the RDNA 3 architecture that anchored the Radeon RX 7000-series graphics cards. The key focus of this new architecture, according to AMD, is on improving ray-tracing performance, so most of AMD's changes were made to the ray-tracing hardware.\n\n(Credit: AMD)\n\nThe new RDNA 4 ray accelerators have eight Ray/Box units and two Ray/Triangle units each, a twofold increase over the ray accelerators in RDNA 3. These processing units carry out the ray-tracing work and help determine which items in a scene the ray accelerators need to work on. AMD also added dedicated hardware for instance-transform functions and reduced the latency associated with what it refers to as \"bounding volume box hierarchy\" (BVH8) traversal operations. This will increase the number of in-scene objects that the ray-tracing units can analyze and prioritize at once, which should improve ray-accelerator performance.\n\n(Credit: AMD)\n\nAnother feature change, which AMD refers to as \"oriented bounding boxes,\" further helps ray accelerator performance by reducing false-positive intersections. When determining what is touched by a light source, BVH bounding boxes that are traditionally axis-aligned are used. This creates blocky, stair-step patches that are processed by the ray accelerators; these would include areas of empty space, essentially wasting some of the hardware\u2019s time. With oriented bounding boxes, this issue is significantly reduced, resulting in up to a 10% improvement in traversal performance.\n\n(Credit: AMD)\n\nAMD also says it is improving its memory system architecture with RDNA 4. The queues for memory requests by resources were extended to allow more data to be in motion at once. AMD also shifted to an out-of-order access design, whereas RDNA 3 took memory requests strictly in order, creating delays and work stalls when a piece of data loaded slowly.\n\n(Credit: AMD)\n\nThis new approach overcomes that limitation by enabling other memory requests to be fulfilled while others are loading. This change will help memory-bandwidth usage throughout the GPU, but AMD says this should have a more pronounced impact on ray-tracing workloads.\n\nFSR 4 Leverages More AI for Graphics Rendering\n\nAI performance has been a massively hot topic in the graphics card industry, so AMD introduced more AI throughput boosts in its RDNA 4 architecture.\n\nFor one, AMD improved wave matrix multiply-accumulate (WMMA) performance and efficiency, and it has added support for new 8-bit floating point operations to equip its AI accelerators for new workloads and models. WMMA operations are processing instructions that enable GPU cores to process mathematical tensors in higher-precision formats. This unlocks more advanced AI operations and graphical features, with greater energy efficiency than standard shading hardware.\n\n(Credit: AMD)\n\nThe applications of AI are growing and changing constantly, but AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 9000-series GPUs will leverage it to boost resolution-scaling and frame-generation performance in the latest version of its signature FSR graphics-enhancement technology, FSR 4. A key change in FSR 4 is the switch to using ML-powered upscaling, which runs on the AI accelerators inside of AMD Radeon graphics cards. Initially, this feature will only be available on Radeon RX 9000-series cards, but it will later be supported on previous generations of AMD graphics cards like the Radeon RX 7000 series.\n\n(Credit: AMD)\n\nFSR 4 is similar to Nvidia\u2019s new DLSS 4 technology and aims to do much the same thing. FSR 3 and FSR 3.1 used resolution super-scaling, which renders frames at a lower resolution and uses supporting processing units to artificially reproduce the scene at a sharper resolution. Like DLSS, FSR 3 also introduced frame generation to its mix, which uses supporting processing units to artificially generate a new frame and stitch it between two raw-rendered frames, thus increasing effective frame rates.\n\nThe fourth generation of FSR picks up where FSR 3 left off, working to generate even more artificial frames between each originally rendered frame to drive even higher frame rates, though this still comes with trade-offs in terms of image quality and latency. The new ML-powered FSR 4 will also reportedly help to sharpen image quality compared with FSR 3 and FSR 3.1, but we'll have to see how that works out in practice.\n\n(Credit: AMD)\n\nAdding generated frames between rendered ones can lead to more perceived latency relative to the frame rate, however. To help with this greater latency, AMD is also introducing Anti-Lag 2, an updated variant of an existing AMD technology, a latency-reduction tech that might be key to enjoying high-speed gameplay under FSR 4.\n\nAt launch, AMD says it will have more than 30 FSR 4 titles ready, and that list is expected to grow to include more than 75 titles in 2025.\n\nDetailing the Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT\n\nAMD's first two cards in the Radeon RX 9000 series, the Radeon RX 9070 and the faster Radeon RX 9070 XT, use the same graphics chip, with a die area of 357mm2 that consists of 53.9 billion transistors. This makes the GPU die roughly similar to Nvidia\u2019s GB203 GPU die that powers the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080. (It covers 378mm2 and contains 45.6 billion transistors.) Both fabricate the chips using similar TSMC manufacturing processes, too, with the Nvidia GB203 created on TSMC\u2019s 4N process and the new RX 9070 GPUs created on its N4P process node.\n\n(Credit: AMD)\n\nIn total, AMD\u2019s new GPU die has 64 compute units with 64 shaders each, adding up to a total of 4,096. These are accompanied by 256 texture mapping units (TMUs), 128 raster operation processors (ROPs), 128 AI accelerators, and 64 ray accelerators. All of these resources are active and available on the Radeon RX 9070 XT, but eight of the 64 compute units are disabled on the Radeon RX 9070, reducing its core counts to 3,584 shaders, 224 TMUs, 112 AI accelerators, and 56 ray accelerators.\n\nThe number of ROPs does not change from the Radeon RX 9070 XT to the RX 9070. AMD also added 64MB of its Infinity Cache, which it has previously said drives up to 3.25 times the bandwidth of 256-bit 16Gbps GDDR6, increasing memory resources within the same memory interface. Both graphics cards work on this enhanced 256-bit-wide memory interface, connecting to 16GB of 20Gbps GDDR6 video memory.\n\nOther than the difference in core counts, the most significant differences between the two cards come from clock speeds and power draw. The Radeon RX 9070 XT will be clocked at 2.97GHz and require 304 watts of power, while the RX 9070 will be clocked at 2.52GHz and require 220W.\n\nThe RX 9070 cards will be available via AMD's usual slate of board partners, including Acer, ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte, PowerColor, Sapphire, and XFX. Most cards will employ the usual 8-pin power connectors, and all should support DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b ports to power the latest high-refresh-rate gaming monitors.\n\nPerformance and Pricing for Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT: Launching March 6\n\nDue to the new architectural changes, projecting the latest Radeon RX 9000-series cards' performance is difficult at this time. AMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT clearly has fewer hardware resources than the older AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX, but this doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate it will be slower. AMD says that, in ray-tracing workloads, the Radeon RX 9070 XT should be about 10% faster than the RX 7900 XTX, but we will need to test this in the lab before we can say for sure.\n\n(Credit: AMD)\n\nThe fact that improving ray tracing performance was a key focus for AMD in developing the new RDNA 4 architecture is promising, as that was the weakest link in the RDNA 3 architecture. However, less seems to have been done to the shaders, and AMD says that in games that don\u2019t support ray tracing, we may see the older Radeon RX 7900 XTX hold the upper hand over the RX 9070. That, coupled with Nvidia's comparable cards (read: the GeForce RTX 5070) close on the horizon and prices in flux as AMD's new cards hit the market, will make for murky waters for customers buying their next GPU.\n\nThough we don't know exactly how well these cards will perform quite yet, if AMD is able to ship enough of these new graphics cards at MSRP, or close to it, it may steal some of the GeForce RTX 50-series spotlight from Nvidia. Its prices put the Radeon RX 9070 XT and the Radeon RX 9070 in direct competition with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070. Nvidia has struggled to ship enough of its new RTX 50-series graphics cards to meet demand so far, with the already-released models constantly out of stock and selling for inflated prices. If AMD can avoid supply shortages of its own, and 9070 prices stay in check, it could get an upper hand in this middle part of the graphics card market while Nvidia works to improve its supply issues.",

            "content": "With the launch of AMD's RX 9070-series graphics cards, AMD is going back to its roots. Rather than trying to compete with Nvidia on raw performance with another flagship GPU beyond the means of most gamers, the House of Zen aims to undercut its competitor by delivering more frames per dollar.\n\nAMD has employed various versions of this strategy over the years \u2013 its core-packed Ryzen processors come to mind \u2013 and by focusing on the mid-tier segment, AMD clearly aims to capitalize on growing discontent with Nvidia's sky-high prices this generation.\n\nThe House of Zen is billing its $549 RX 9070 and $599 9070 XT graphics cards as delivering 4K performance at 1440P pricing. But, while the cards are certainly capable of 4K gaming, especially with AMD's AI upscaling and frame gen tech enabled \u2013 more on those in a bit \u2013 it's clear these cards are designed primarily with high-refresh rate 1440p gaming in mind.\n\nThis is reflected in AMD's positioning of the cards, which slot in behind its now two-year-old RX 7900 XT and XTX graphics cards designed for 4K gaming, and ahead of its previous 1440p power house the 7900 GRE.\n\nAs you can see the new chips slot in somewhere between its last-gen flagships and its previous 1440p champion the RX 7900 GRE - click to enlarge\n\nIt also makes sense when you consider just how few folks are actually gaming at 4K. According to Steam's latest hardware survey, more than three-quarters of PC gamers are running monitors at 1440p or lower, and just 4 percent are running at 4k or higher.\n\nIn terms of performance, AMD says the RX 9070 will deliver between 20 and 21 percent higher frame rates on average compared to its prior-gen RX 7900 GRE at 1440p and 4K respectively. The XT variant, meanwhile, promises an average uplift of 38 to 42 percent at those same resolutions.\n\nAs for how they compare to Nvidia's chips, AMD is going after Nvidia's RTX 5070 and 5070 TI graphics cards. During AMD's launch event, David McAfee, VP and GM of AMD's client business claimed the RX 9070 XT would deliver average performance just 2 percent shy of the 5070 TI. But, as always, we recommend taking vendor supplied benchmarks and claims with a hefty dose of salt. Case in point, as you can see from the chart below, Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and Ghost of Tsushima are doing a lot to lift that average.\n\nHere's how AMD says the RX 9070 XT compares to Nvidia's $150 more expensive 5070 TI - click to enlarge\n\nRDNA 4 makes its debut\n\nUnderpinning these performance gains is AMD's all-new RDNA 4 graphics architecture. Without getting too deep in the weeds, it boasts an improved memory subsystem, upgraded compute, RT, and AI compute engines, along with higher overall clock speeds.\n\nAMD is particularly proud of the architecture's new RT cores, an area where it's historically lagged Nvidia by a pretty wide margin. RDNA 4's Gen 3 RT accelerators promise twice the throughput per compute unit versus RDNA 3, which should help as more games begin to list ray-tracing capabilities on their minimum requirements.\n\nAs for the actual silicon powering the 9070-series, AMD has ditched the chiplet architecture used by its 7000-series parts in favor of a more traditional monolithic die this time around.\n\nThe chips are each complemented by 16 GB of GDDR6 memory. The main differentiator between the two is that the non-XT variant has about 13 percent fewer compute, RT, and AI units, and roughly 15 percent lower clock speeds.\n\nSpecs Here's a quick rundown of how they compare for your reference: RX 9070 RX 9070 XT Compute units 56 64 RT accelerators 56 64 AI accelerators 112 128 AI TOPS (Sparse INT4) 1,165 TOPS 1,557 TOPS Boost clock 2.52 GHz 2.97 GHz vRAM 16 GB 16 GB TDP 220 W 304 W Connectivity PCIe 5.0 x16 PCIe 5.0 x16 Display output DisplayPort 2.1a, HDMI 2.1b DisplayPort 2.1a, HDMI 2.1b\n\nNo escaping the AI PC\n\nAlong with gaming, AMD didn't miss an opportunity to talk up the cards in the context of the emerging AI PC segment. However, for those excited about running LLMs, image gen, or some other AI-augmented workflow, the 9070 series is a mixed bag.\n\nOn one hand, the card's second-gen AI accelerators promise significant gains for the kinds of fuzzy math endemic to machine learning workloads. AMD claims up to 1,557 TOPS for the XT and 1,165 for the standard RX 9070. That's sparse INT4 performance, putting it just ahead of Nvidia's recently launched RTX 5070 TI, which boasts 1,406 TOPS.\n\nCompared to the 7900 GRE, AMD expects the 9070 XT to deliver a 12-34 percent uplift in performance for content creation-based machine learning tasks in software like Adobe Lightroom and DaVinci Resolve. For GenAI workloads, AMD suggests the gains will be even greater for image generation in Amuse and Procyon.\n\nHowever, as we've previously discussed, AI compute bottlenecks differ from one workload to another. Image generation benchmarks, for instance, are often compute-bound, while large language models (LLM) like Llama 3 tend to be more constrained by memory bandwidth.\n\nWith a 256-bit memory bus, AMD's 9070-series cards top out at 640 GBps of bandwidth compared to the 7900 XT's 800 GBps and the XTX's 960 GBps. On paper, this means the 9070-series cards should be about 22 to 40 percent slower in memory-bound workloads.\n\nNot even gaming can escape the AI hype\n\nIf you'd rather spend your time gaming than playing with AI models on your PC, the 9070s' AI compute units won't necessarily be wasted.\n\nJust like Nvidia, AMD is leaning hard on AI upscaling techniques to juice performance figures this generation. This technology works by initially rendering games at lower resolutions, say 1080p, and then taking advantage of the AI accelerators to upscale those frames to 4K. Nvidia calls this tech Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), while AMD calls its equivalent FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR).\n\nWith FSR4 enabled, AMD claims the 9070 XT is capable of more than doubling frame rates versus 4K, but again, that's because, with FSR enabled, the graphics cores aren't actually rendering those frames at 4K.\n\nAlongside FSR, the cards will also support frame generation, which, rather than using its AI accelerators to upscale lower resolution frames, boosts frame rates by generating intermediate frames.\n\nRemember when MSRP meant something?\n\nAs for pricing, AMD's RX 9070 will hit shelves beginning March 6 with a manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP) of $549, while the more powerful XT variant has an MSRP of $599. This puts the RX 9070 directly in contention with Nv's similarly priced RTX 5070, while the 9070 XT undercuts the RTX 5070 TI by $150 while claiming to deliver similar performance.\n\nHowever, that assumes you can actually get one at that price.\n\nAs we've seen with Nvidia's 50-series cards, MSRP doesn't count for much if board partners and retailers don't take the suggestion. Looking on Newegg and BestBuy, we see that multiple 5070 TIs \u2013 a part with an MSRP of $749 \u2013 listed at closer to $900 or even $1,000.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia's $2,000 flagship 5090 can be found listed for anywhere from $400 to $1,000 over sticker. But even if you're willing to pay the markup for Nvidia's 50-series cards, your next challenge will be finding one in stock.\n\nThus, the success of AMD's RX 9070 and 9070 XT will likely end up having less to do with how well they stack up against Nvidia in gaming than whether you can actually buy the cards at anything resembling their launch pricing. \u00ae",

            "content": "Modular, Open, Repairable \u2013 The Framework Desktop Teardown! - YouTube Watch On\n\nModular laptop maker Framework recently unveiled its new mini PC, the Framework Desktop. This cutesy computer is powered by AMD's Strix Halo line-up, including the beefy Ryzen AI Max+ 395, which is a chip I've longed to see inside a mini PC since at least last week. Now, Framework has ripped one apart (gently) to see what it's made of.\n\nYou can see the iFixit video teardown above, but a couple of highlights worth shouting about include the two easily accessible NVMe SSDs, lack of tools required to peel it open, and expansion cards taken from its laptops, like the Framework 13 our Dave loves to pieces (literally). The Noctua fan you can fit inside it is a bonus, if a user chooses to fit it, though it's possible to add a Cooler Master fan or most other off-the-shelf 120 mm fans instead.\n\nThe other big plus for this Framework device, as noted by iFixit, is that it's intended to come apart with only a single tool. That's likely a Philips-head screwdriver bit on one side, and a Torx screwdriver on the other. Yeah, I guess that's two tools, but if Darth Maul's double-sided schtick was okay, so is this. I can already hear the older Star Wars fans getting annoyed at me for that one.\n\nMy point is, one tool for such a compact desktop PC with the CPU power of a larger desktop tower and the graphics power of a decent gaming laptop\u2014that's pretty great. My recent mini PC build went rather smoothly, I should say, and though it's not quite as compact as Framework's machine, it is plenty powerful for gaming. So, there are other options if this approach from Framework doesn't appeal.\n\nOne downside we've known about since the announcement, though also shown up-close and personal in the video, is the use of soldered memory. I mean, I say downside. Soldered memory can be an issue if memory chips malfunction or you want to upgrade down the line, but the Framework comes with 32 GB, 8000 MT/s LPDDR5X as standard, and these Strix Halo chips come with a chunky 256-bit memory bus to feed the (up to) 16-core CPU and the (up to) 40 CU iGPU, so it shouldn't be a huge issue.\n\nI recently reviewed the ROG Flow Z13, which was mine and many others' first look at Strix Halo in action. It's an impressive chip, but I found the odd 'gaming tablet' form factor, limited storage, and high price a little offputting. I suggested a better solution for this chip would be something akin to a Mac Mini, \"Call it the Zen Mini. Or the Strix Mini, since Asus owns the NUC design now. Now that sounds interesting. In a gaming tablet, eh, not so much.\"\n\nWell, I wouldn't have to wait too long for something along those lines. Turns out Framework were working on it already, and since it's Framework, it's even more impressive than a PC crammed into a tiny case. It's shaping up to be a surprisingly upgradeable, repairable and outright lovely little thing.",

            "content": "The semiconductor sector is a great market for investors thanks to its strong growth opportunities. Computer chips are increasingly in demand in a wide range of industries, such as robotics, automotive, and artificial intelligence.\n\nTwo prominent semiconductor companies to consider investing in now are Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 4.17%) and Arm Holdings (ARM 1.08%). AMD produces hardware that makes AI systems possible. Arm is known for its chip designs, particularly for smartphones, where it holds an estimated 99% market share.\n\nBoth companies offer reasons to invest, but if you had to choose between them, which comes out on top? Here's a breakdown of AMD and Arm to help determine the better investment for the long haul.\n\nReasons to consider AMD stock\n\nAMD is an appealing investment because its products enable an advanced computer architecture called accelerated computing. This approach uses dedicated hardware to speed up data processing. AI systems crunch through a deluge of data, making accelerated computing a necessity.\n\nOnce AI took off, AMD experienced massive sales gains. In 2024's fourth quarter, the company's sales to data centers ballooned 69% year over year to $3.9 billion. Data centers house AI systems, so this part of AMD's business was key to the company's total Q4 revenue growing 24% to $7.7 billion.\n\nData center customers aren't the only ones hungry for AMD's hardware. The company also saw strong demand from the PC market as AI expands beyond the cloud to personal devices. This part of AMD's business achieved 58% year-over-year growth in Q4 revenue to a record $2.3 billion.\n\nAMD's sales success led to excellent financials. For instance, its Q4 gross margin increased to 51%, compared to 47% in the prior year. This indicates improved cost management and profitability in its business.\n\nAMD's Q4 balance sheet boasted total assets of $69.2 billion compared to total liabilities of $11.7 billion. Its assets included $5.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, a 13% improvement from the third quarter.\n\nThe case for Arm Holdings stock\n\nArm Holdings dominates the market for smartphone semiconductor chips because its designs are energy-efficient. Now, the company is using its mobile device strengths to capture a share of the lucrative AI market. This is a smart move because AI tech consumes tremendous amounts of power.\n\nLast year, Arm introduced a new integrated circuit to support the use of AI for consumer devices, which it calls the Arm compute subsystems (CSS) for clients. This product uses three-nanometer process technology, which shrinks circuitry down to about the size of human DNA, This allows more components to fit on a chip, and makes the device more powerful.\n\nAccording to Arm's management, CSS demand has been strong, resulting in record royalty revenue of $580 million -- a 23% year-over-year increase -- in its fiscal Q3, ended Dec. 31, 2024. This contributed to the company's 19% year-over-year growth in total Q3 sales to $983 million.\n\nAlong with growing revenue, Arm's financials are strong. Its fiscal Q3 gross margin was an impressive 97.2%, an increase from the prior year's 95.6%. The company's Q3 balance sheet included total assets of $8.5 billion, with cash and equivalents of $2 billion. That cash pile alone nearly exceeded total liabilities of $2.1 billion.\n\nArm generates income by licensing its chip designs and collecting royalties, but it may be expanding into other revenue streams. According to recent news reports, Arm is producing the actual hardware its designs facilitate, and has secured Facebook parent Meta Platforms as a customer.\n\nMeta would be a key customer since the social media giant is building a data center the size of a city. If the news reports are correct, this move would put Arm in direct competition with AMD, which currently provides hardware to Meta.\n\nDeciding between AMD and Arm stock\n\nGiven AMD's and Arm's success with their AI businesses, both are worthwhile semiconductor companies to invest in. But in choosing between the two, a key factor to consider is stock valuation.\n\nTo assess this, let's look at each company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This metric tells you how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar's worth of earnings based on estimates for the next 12 months. Arm's forward P/E ratio is substantially higher than AMD's at the time of writing. This suggests that AMD stock is the better value.\n\nAMD's forward P/E multiple has dropped in 2025 as its stock price declined. Its shares fell due to a combination of factors. AMD's valuation was high, so its stock was due for a correction. Then in January, Wall Street's optimism toward American AI companies was shaken after Chinese start-up DeepSeek unveiled a low-cost AI product. Lastly, while AMD's Q4 results were excellent, they didn't meet Wall Street's elevated expectations.\n\nNow, AMD's share price is looking more reasonable while Arm stock is looking expensive. While both have strong businesses with future growth potential, because AMD stock is the better value, it's the more attractive investment for the long term.",

            "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock has declined 13.3% so far this year and plunged more than 40% over the past year, as investors and analysts wait for the semiconductor company\u2019s AI (artificial intelligence) growth story to materialize. AMD reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings for Q4 2024, but its data center segment, which includes advanced AI chips, failed to impress with its 69% revenue growth. Moreover, a weak first-half outlook for the data center segment further weighed on investor sentiment.\n\nAMD\u2019s data center revenue jumped 94% to $12.6 billion in the full year 2024, fueled by the demand for AMD Instinct and EPYC processors. However, this growth dwarfs rival Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) performance, which generated a 142% rise in its data center revenue to $115.2 billion in the comparable full year.\n\nAnalysts Seek More Visibility on AI Tailwinds\n\nRecently, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari reiterated a Hold rating on AMD stock but lowered the price target to $125 from $129. The five-star analyst stated that while the company posted upbeat Q4 earnings and continues to gain market share in the Client and Server CPU space, investors were disappointed with the data center unit\u2019s outlook.\n\nHari added that AMD\u2019s guidance was in contrast to the constructive commentary on AI capital spending by tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), and Alphabet (GOOGL). The analyst remains on the sidelines as he looks for signs of a re-acceleration in AMD\u2019s growth before turning more constructive on the stock.\n\nRecently, Daiwa analyst Louis Miscioscia revised the rating on AMD stock to Outperform from Buy but slashed his price target to $130 from $170, citing a weaker-than-expected Q1 2025 outlook. The analyst said that the material disappointment in GPU sales is holding AMD stock back from scoring an \u201cAI premium.\u201d Miscioscia noted that the weaker-than-anticipated performance in GPUs seems to be related to a slower-than-expected ramp in MI325 GPUs. Nonetheless, he expects a strong second half, as the MI350 GPU adoption picks pace.\n\nLikewise, TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter lowered his price target for AMD stock to $135 from $150 and reaffirmed a Buy rating. The analyst thinks that the \u201cAI Story Will Need to Be Proven.\u201d Buchalter contends that while currently AMD\u2019s data center GPU upside seems to be a show-me story, he expects it to eventually prove out. He believes that given the progress in building its software ecosystem and the large AI compute TAM (total addressable market), AMD is on the right track to strengthen its position and emerge as \u201cthe de facto merchant alternative to NVIDIA\u2019s leadership position.\u201d\n\nIs AMD Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nOverall, Wall Street is cautiously optimistic on Advanced Micro Devices stock, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, 11 Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average AMD stock price target of $147.88 implies 41.2% upside potential.\n\nSee more AMD analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

Fast-forward to almost two months, AMD is now slated to showcase the next-gen GPU series in full style, and in light of this, mainstream retailers are pushing up RDNA 4 listings on their respective platforms, giving us a glimpse of the expected pricing.\n\nStarting with the most anticipated retailer, MicroCenter, they have managed to put up around nice different listings of the RDNA 4 GPUs, and before we go into them, it is essential to note that the retail prices might be placeholder values, or at least for some of the listings.\n\nImage Credits: Videocardz\n\nThe cheapest Radeon RX 9070 XT is the ASRock Triple Fan variant, which costs $699, while the non-XT counterpart is listed for $649, revealing a slight price difference. However, an RX 9070 XT is listed for $1,100 as well, but that is likely a placeholder value.\n\nASRock AMD Radeon RX 9070 CL Triple Fan: $649.99\n\nSapphire Technology AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT PULSE Triple Fan: $899.99\n\nASRock AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT SL Triple Fan: $699.99\n\nASUS AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Prime Overclocked Triple Fan: $1,049.99\n\nXFX AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Swift Triple Fan: $729.99\n\nPowerColor AMD Radeon RX 9070 Reaper Triple Fan: $1,099.99\n\nGigabyte AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Gaming Overclocked Triple Fan: $899.99\n\nPowerColor AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Reaper Triple Fan: $1,100.00\n\nYet again, it is important to note that nothing is official for now, and we will likely get the exact details tomorrow, which is when AMD is set to showcase the RDNA 4 lineup. Apart from MicroCenter, Newegg has put up listings as well, but in pre-built systems from iBUYPOWER and AVGPC, with the maximum configuration including the Ryzen 7 9700X and AMD's flagship RDNA 4 GPU, going for $1,799. This includes 32 GB DDR5 memory and a 1 TB SSD.\n\nImage Credits: Olrak_29\n\nWhile this is just an estimate, we are likely looking at around $650-$700 for the flagship model in this particular pre-built configuration, suggesting that this figure is justified. We recently reported on how the Radeon RX 9070 XT rivals NVIDIA's RTX 4080 at Furmark, and given that the latter model is available in the markets for $1,000+, that surely puts the GPU in the competitive spot, given that we are comparing synthetic performance for now.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what kind of show Team Red puts up at the upcoming launch, but based on the hype created over the past weeks, mainstream GPU consumers are definitely in for a treat.",

            "content": "The future of treating age-related macular degeneration (AMD) would primarily focus on more effectively halting the condition rather than slowing it as well as reducing the number and frequency of intravitreal injections needed, according to Paul Hahn, MD, PhD, a retina specialist at NJRetina.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nTranscript\n\nWhat are the treatment options for patients living with AMD?\n\nWe're very fortunate to have effective treatments for macular degeneration, and I say this because it's not that long ago that we had no treatments for these blinding conditions. So these treatments typically involve medicines that we inject into the eye, what we call intravitreal injections. For wet macular degeneration, these injections that we're putting into the eye typically involve what we call anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) antibodies. They're antibodies against VEGF, or now with more, newer therapies, some other angiogenic factors as well. And what they do is they help stop the bleeding and they help stop the vision loss that can occur from wet macular degeneration. These medicines are very important to start promptly, and so it's very important for patients to be vigilant with their vision and seek out care from a retina specialist if they develop those types of symptoms.\n\nFor dry macular degeneration, we're also lucky to have new treatment options, which weren't available up until recently. So about 2 years ago, the FDA approved 2 different treatments that helped slow down the growth of atrophy from dry macular degeneration. These are also medicines that we inject into the eye, these intravitreal injections, but work through a different pathway. They modulate the complement pathway, and therefore have been shown to decrease the growth of this atrophy. Importantly, they don't stop or even reverse the disease, but they just help slow down progression, which still continues. But it's great that we now have options to offer patients.\n\nWhat treatments are in the pipeline that patients can look forward to?\n\nPatients should really be excited that we have a very rich pipeline of therapies. If we think about wet macular degeneration, there are a lot of things that are exciting in that pipeline. One of the biggest unmet needs that retina specialists and patients have identified is the treatment burden. It's difficult for patients to come in every 1 to 3 or now 4 months for regular injections into the eye, often for the rest of their lives. And so there are treatments, such as gene therapy options, which may prove to be a 1 and done treatment option, a so-called cure for some patients. There are other options, like tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which work through a different mechanism of action to help suppress VEGF even further, and also with some formulations prove to be a consistent 6 month therapeutic agent. We're also looking at novel mechanisms of action. There are some patients who don't respond optimally to VEGF therapy alone, and some of these novel mechanisms of action may help those patients as well.\n\nIf we think about dry macular degeneration, we're lucky to have first generation treatments in our armamentarium, but there's definitely opportunity to improve. These first generation agents slow down worsening, but they don't stop the disease, or they don't reverse the disease, and we're looking for agents which might be able to do so. Similar to wet macular degeneration therapies, our dry AMD therapies for geographic atrophy are also medicines that need to be injected into the eye every 1 or 2 months, really lifelong. And there are also options such as gene therapy and other mechanisms that are looking to decrease that treatment burden. So there's a very rich pipeline in dry macular degeneration and in wet macular degeneration, and all these will hopefully help patients in the future.",

            "content": "With just a couple of days before AMD officially announces the RX 9070 family of GPUs, listings for these graphics cards momentarily appeared online on Micro Center. Although it seems that the retailer has already taken them down, we caught a glimpse of their prices, and we aren\u2019t happy. We saw one RX 9070 listing \u2014 the ASRock RX 9070 Challenger Triple Fan \u2014 for $649.99. The cheapest RX 9070 XT we saw \u2014 the ASRock RX 9070 XT Steel Legend Triple Fan \u2014 was listed for $699.99.\n\n\n\nSince AMD hasn\u2019t announced prices for these GPUs yet, we hope that these are just placeholder prices and that the real pricing will be much lower. After all, the company already denied that the starting prices for the 9070 and 9070 XT are $749 and $899, respectively. But if these leaked numbers are true, then the 9070 XT isn\u2019t much lower than the RTX 5070 Ti\u2019s MSRP of $749, and the vanilla 9070 is much higher than the 5070\u2019s $549 launch price. The company also compared the 9070 XT\u2019s performance to that of the 7900 GRE, which had a launch price of just $549, while the 9070 could match the 7800 XT, which had a launch price of just $499.\n\n\n\nAMD doesn't appear to have plans to sell a Made by AMD reference card to the public, so the GPUs that we saw listed may not even sell at MSRP. We expect there will be some \"MSRP\" variants at launch, but whether or not they remain available and in stock will depend on AMD's supply. This is also true of Nvidia's graphics cards and the RTX 5070 Ti, as Nvidia didn't create a Founders Edition version of that GPU. We only saw a few listings at the MSRP, and some options even hit nearly double the launch price. That might be due more to the retail outlets than the AIB partners, of course.\n\n\n\nMany gamers and enthusiasts are anticipating the arrival of AMD\u2019s competitors to Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell GPUs. With shortages still plaguing RTX 50-series GPUs despite being launched weeks ago, the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 GPUs might be the only real option for mid-range GPUs. AMD also renamed its graphics card lineup to make it easier to match and compare against the competition, so we expect the 9070 XT to be competitive with the 5070 Ti. However, leaked synthetic benchmark tests indicate it more closely matches the RTX 4070 Super, while the RTX 5070 Ti outperformed it by approximately 28%. We'll see where Team Red lands once we get our hands on these GPUs and are able to see how they perform in the real world.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

The X3D processors with extra 3D V-cache to boost gaming capabilities are nowhere to be seen \u2014 neither the crazy-popular Ryzen 7 7800X3D nor its successor the 9800X3D, and not the yet-to-be-released 9950X3D and 9900X3D, either.\n\nI suppose AMD thinks those chips can sell themselves\u2026 and based on how quickly they disappear from shelves, they\u2019re right. There\u2019s no mention of the upcoming Radeon RX 9070 or RX 9070 XT graphics cards, either, though of course those could be added later.\n\nYou can also grab a freebie if you pick up a new gaming laptop with AMD guts featuring the Ryzen AI 9 300, AI Max, 8000, 7000HX, or 7000HX3D processors.

As soon as we think it's over, AMD comes up with more and more processors for this 8-year-old platform. Looks like AMD still has plenty of leftover silicon to produce more Zen 3 chips and this time it is debuting the 'Ryzen 5005G' series, which comprises APUs.\n\nAMD has silently added several Ryzen 5005G SKUs to its Ryzen 5000 series table and now the total CPU count in this particular series is 25. Out of 25 CPUs, six are from the Ryzen 5005G series. AMD made sure that each subseries receives two SKUs, targeting different budget segments.\n\nAs you can see, AMD has released G and GE variants for both mainstream and power-efficient setups. The GE variants are rated at just 35W while the G variants feature the default TDP of 65W, which is found on most budget and mid-range Ryzen 5000 CPUs. Therefore, even though specs like Cores/Threads, iGPU, etc. are identical, the base clock is lower on the GE variants.\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 5705G is technically Ryzen 7 5700G but the only difference we can see from AMD's table is that it doesn't reveal if the 5705G will come with a stock heatsink. All the specs are identical and this is exactly how AMD went with other Ryzen 5005G parts, including the Ryzen 5605G, which is nothing but Ryzen 5600G in core specs, and the Ryzen 3 5305G resembles the Ryzen 3 5300G completely.\n\nThe date of availability and pricing hasn't been disclosed yet, but since the Ryzen 8000G series is already available on the market, the Ryzen 5005G should be comparatively cheaper. AMD's Ryzen 5005G will serve as entry-level APUs for systems that don't require high graphical computing power and will be sufficient for basic operations.\n\nApart from casual work, the Ryzen 5005G can also play non-intensive games, but one shouldn't expect a smooth gaming experience since Vega iGPU can't compete with modern budget or mid-range GPUs. Considering AM4 motherboards are still abundantly available in the market, including the A520 and B450/B550 chipsets, the Ryzen 5005G series is excellent for cost-effective systems and can be used in PCs to keep the cost under $500.\n\nAMD Ryzen 5005G Series\n\nCPUs Cores/Threads Base/Boost Clock iGPU TDP AMD Ryzen 7 5705G 8/16 3.8/4.2 GHz Vega 8 65W AMD Ryzen 7 5705GE 8/16 3.2/4.2 GHz Vega 8 35W AMD Ryzen 5 5605G 6/12 3.9/4.4 GHz Vega 7 65W AMD Ryzen 5 5605GE 6/12 3.4/4.4 GHz Vega 7 35W AMD Ryzen 3 5305G 4/8 4.0/4.2 GHz Vega 6 65W AMD Ryzen 3 5305GE 4/8 3.6/4.2 GHz Vega 6 35W\n\nNews Sources: @Olrak29_, AMD",

This driver set offers optimized chipset compatibility with AMD Ryzen processors and AMD Socket AM5 -The revision documentation for AMD Chipset Drivers version 7.02.13.148, released on February 25th, 2025, provides essential technical details for integration and troubleshooting. A significant element of this release is its improved support for new programs and the resolution of various bugs that have been documented in earlier versions. The update is engineered to enhance system compatibility across diverse hardware configurations, with specific instructions provided for scenarios where operating systems are non-English, resulting in some driver names appearing in English. In this release, detailed technical steps ensure that professionals can maintain stability even when reverting to previous software iterations if required.\n\nThere is an important compatibility note included with this release. Once you install any of the AMD Chipset Installer versions from the 7.xx.xx.xx series, you won\u2019t be able to go back to versions from the 6.xx.xx.xx series or earlier. The fix is pretty straightforward: first, you need to uninstall the current version, then delete the \"Qt_Dependencies\" folder found in \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\AMD\\Chipset_Software\". After doing this, you can install an older version if you really need to. Also, sometimes the Ryzen PPKG might not install or upgrade properly, so keep an eye on that if you run into any issues. This information is meant for technical gurus who manage these installations and need to keep things running smoothly.\n\nYou can now download AMD Chipset Drivers, and the file is 65 MB in size. Below, you'll find the details about the drivers and what you need to know about this update.\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows OS automatically installs a generic driver that allows computers to recognize basic motherboard functions. However, to make use of all board components, appropriate chipset drivers must be applied. If you install this package, the system will receive related information regarding the chipset. Also, this step might improve compatibility and bus transfer speeds, add various changes for sleep state behavior, power saving functionality and others, or include support for new features.\n\nTo apply this release, simply make sure your system configuration is supported by this package, get the file, run the available setup, and follow the on-screen instructions. Bear in mind that installing inappropriate chipset drivers can cause computers to malfunction. In addition to that, do perform a system restart after you have completely applied the present release so that all changes take effect. Despite the off-chance that other OSes might be compatible, we do not recommend installing any software on platforms other than the highlighted ones.\n\nAMD Ryzen AI 300 Series 7th-Gen AMD A-Series Processors AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO Processor AMD X870E/X870 Chipset AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Processor AMD X670E/X670 Chipset AMD Ryzen 9000 Series Desktop Processors AMD B650E/B650 Chipset AMD Ryzen 8000G Series Desktop Processors AMD B350 Chipset AMD Ryzen 8X40 Series processors AMD A320 Chipset AMD Ryzen 7040 Series Desktop Processors AMD X370 Chipset AMD Ryzen 7000 Series Desktop Processors AMD X399 Chipset AMD Ryzen 7000 Series Mobile Processors AMD B450 Chipset AMD Ryzen 5000 Series Desktop Processor AMD X470 Chipset 3rd Gen AMD Ryzen Threadripper Processors AMD X570 Chipset 3rd Gen AMD Ryzen Desktop Processor AMD B550 Chipset 2nd Gen AMD Ryzen Threadripper Processor AMD A520 Chipset 2nd Gen AMD Ryzen Desktop Processor AMD A620 Chipset AMD Ryzen Desktop Processor AMD TRX40 Chipset AMD Ryzen Threadripper Processor AMD TRX50 Chipset AMD Ryzen Desktop Processor with Radeon Graphics AMD WRX80 Chipset AMD Ryzen Mobile Processor with Radeon Graphics AMD WRX90 Chipset\n\nVersion History7.02.13.148 (February 25th, 2025)Release HighlightsNew program support added.Bug fixes.Known IssuesAfter installing the AMD Chipset Installer version \"7.xx.xx.xx\", users cannot install version \"6.xx.xx.xx\" or earlier.Workaround:Un-install the latest version of the AMD Chipset installer (version 7.xx.xx.xx or later).Delete the \"Qt_Dependencies\" folder located at \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\AMD\\Chipset_Software\\\".Install any older version of the AMD Chipset installer (version 6.xx.xx.xx or earlier).\\On a non-English OS, some driver names may appear in English.Occasionally, Ryzen PPKG may not install or upgrade.",

            "content": "A key challenge facing the industry was highlighted in KPMG\u2019s \"Data Center Supply Chain\" report published in November 2024. The report warns of the sector\u2019s heavy reliance on a small group of suppliers and contractors, which, despite improvements in procurement and operations, poses risks to capacity expansion, costs, innovation, and resilience\u2014especially as demand accelerates. KPMG cautions that failure to address these vulnerabilities could destabilize the ecosystem. To mitigate these risks, the report recommends diversifying the supply chain by encouraging new market entrants and reducing dependence on a handful of general, mechanical, and electrical subcontractors.\n\n\u201cWhile AI spending has yet to yield the expected returns and efficiency improvements, long-term growth remains assured, driven by hyperscalers\u2019 multi-year capex cycles and government initiatives such as the $500 billion Stargate Project. Although recent advancements in AI model training efficiency from DeepSeek have been disruptive, efforts to enhance efficiency and reduce the total cost of ownership in AI data centers have been underway for some time. Key areas of focus include advancements in accelerated computing through GPUs and custom accelerators, large language model (LLM) optimizations, and next-generation rack-scale and network infrastructure\u2014all essential for enabling sustainable growth from both cost and power perspectives.\u201d\n\nWith the rapid expansion of AI and high-performance computing, data centers have experienced exponential growth, a trend expected to continue for years. According to a February 5 report by the Dell\u2019Oro Group, global annual data center capital expenditure (capex) is projected to exceed $1 trillion by 2029. Despite ongoing concerns about high power consumption, investment in AI infrastructure remains on a strong upward trajectory. Baron Fung, Senior Research Director at Dell\u2019Oro Group, emphasizes this point:\n\nIn an AI-driven world, data centers have become more critical than ever. While many people have heard of data centers, few fully understand what they entail. Simply put, a data center is a physical facility that houses an organization\u2019s digital infrastructure, including servers, storage systems, and networking equipment. These facilities provide the computing power necessary for IT systems to function, serving as the backbone of modern digital infrastructure. They are essential to powering cloud computing, AI applications, and enterprise IT services.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Oversold Data Center Stocks to Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other oversold data center stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn summary, while the data center industry is fundamental to technological progress, it is still evolving and adapting to shifting economic and demand dynamics. There is enough scope for more players to offer new and innovative solutions to support the technological advancements. The surging demand for data center facilities has attracted substantial investments from private equity and infrastructure funds, reinforcing expectations of resilient long-term growth. As a result, the data center sector remains a highly attractive space for investors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo determine the 10 most year-to-date (YTD) oversold data center stocks to Buy, we conducted in-depth research to compile a list of U.S.-listed data center companies. Our process involved analyzing relevant exchange-traded funds (ETFs), research reports, and proprietary databases to identify key industry players. We then calculated YTD returns for all identified companies and shortlisted the 10 worst-performing stocks. These were then ranked based on their potential upside, with the highest-upside stock at the top. Additionally, we also included data on hedge fund holdings in these companies as of Q4 2024 to provide further insight into investor interest.\n\nNote: All pricing data is as of market close on February 24.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) the Tech Stock with Best Earnings Growth in 2025?\n\nA close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nYTD returns: -11%\n\nPotential Upside: 30%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 96\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor company that designs and manufactures high-performance computing and graphics solutions. Its product portfolio includes microprocessors, graphics processors, and system-on-chip (SoC) solutions for various applications, including data centers, gaming, and embedded systems. It has gained significant market share in the CPU and GPU markets and competes directly with Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has underperformed in both 2024 and 2025. After declining 18% in 2024, the stock has fallen an additional 11% so far in 2025. While the company has gained CPU market share in recent years, its growth in the AI sector has been comparatively slower, with weaker adoption of its advanced GPU products. As a result, AMD is often perceived as lagging behind competitors, particularly Nvidia.\n\nDespite this, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) continues to benefit from the expansion of the data center market. In its Q4 2024 earnings report released on February 4, the company posted a 69% year-over-year increase in data center revenue, fueled by strong demand for AMD Instinct GPUs\u2014designed for AI and high-performance computing\u2014and AMD EPYC CPUs. While AMD is working to enhance its AI software ecosystem through its ROCm open AI stack and strategic partnerships with hyperscalers, it has yet to pose a significant competitive threat to Nvidia.\n\nThe majority of analyst ratings remain positive on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), with market consensus indicating a strong 30% potential upside.\n\nOverall AMD ranks 9th on our list of the most oversold data center stocks according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "AMD's latest gaming hardware bundle is a standard practice for hardware marketing. In this case, however, Monster Hunter Wilds is a high-profile game that many might be looking to purchase already. If they're already planning to ugprade their PC, it's a nice bonus. Except, quite a few of the potential bundle items aren't really available anymore.\n\n\n\nAMD has had many gaming bundles, and they're typically used to push specific CPUs, GPUs, laptops. Team Red will be bundling Monster Hunter Wilds with a number of its mid-range to high-end gaming CPUs, GPUs, and laptops for about the next two months. AMD sent out a press release containing a list of all the eligible products to outlets this morning, as well as publishing a web page highlighting the bundle and specifying the qualifying purchases, which we've organized into a table below for your convenience.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Products eligible for AMD's free Monster Hunter Wilds bundle CPUs GPUs Laptops AMD Ryzen 9 9950X AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX Laptops featuring Ryzen AI 9 300 Series CPUs AMD Ryzen 9 9900X AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT Laptops featuring Ryzen AI Max Series CPUs AMD Ryzen 9 7950X AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT Laptops featuring Ryzen 8000 Series CPUs AMD Ryzen 9 7900X AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT Laptops featuring Ryzen 7000 HX or 7000 X3D Series CPUs AMD Ryzen 7 9700X Row 5 - Cell 1 ASUS ROG Zephyrus G16 AMD Ryzen 7 7700X Row 6 - Cell 1 ASUS ROG Strix G17 AMD Ryzen 7 7700 Row 7 - Cell 1 ASUS ROG Strix Scar 17 AMD Ryzen 5 9600X (unless in Japan) Row 8 - Cell 1 ASUS ROG Flow Z13 Row 9 - Cell 0 Row 9 - Cell 1 HP Victus 16 Row 10 - Cell 0 Row 10 - Cell 1 MSI Stealth A16 AI+ Row 11 - Cell 0 Row 11 - Cell 1 MSI Alpha 17 Row 12 - Cell 0 Row 12 - Cell 1 Lenovo Legion Slim 5 Gen 9 AMD 16\u201d Row 13 - Cell 0 Row 13 - Cell 1 Lenovo Legion Pro 5 Gen 8 AMD 16\u201d Row 14 - Cell 0 Row 14 - Cell 1 Lenovo Pro 7 Gen 8 Row 15 - Cell 0 Row 15 - Cell 1 Acer Nitro 17 Row 16 - Cell 0 Row 16 - Cell 1 Acer Nitro 16 Row 17 - Cell 0 Row 17 - Cell 1 Acer Nitro V 16 Row 18 - Cell 0 Row 18 - Cell 1 Acer Nitro V 14\n\nLike so many past bundles, at the time of writing, actually utilizing this deal does feel a little questionable. The best gaming CPUs right now are AMD's Ryzen X3D parts \u2014 none of which are part of the qualifying bundle list. And the AMD GPUs? As if! The 'best' option is $499 $531 on Amazon for an RX 7700 XT, which was selling for as little as $399 last year. So AMD is pushing CPUs that aren't as highly regarded, along with GPUs that you can't or at least shouldn't buy at current prices... plus laptops. One out of three isn't too bad, right?\n\n\n\nThe pricing of AMD's GPUs has shot up in the past couple of months, mostly due to the late arrival of the intended replacements. Nvidia's Blackwell RTX 50-series probably should have come out last October or November, right around the time supplies of the 4090 and 4080 Super disappeared, but there were delays precipitated by the data center B200 packaging problems. AMD was rumored to launch the RX 9000-series in January, but then backed off to apparently a March launch, and the various RDNA3 RX 7000-series GPUs are mostly out of stock or severely overpriced as well. The RX 7800 XT starts at $642, about $200 more than we saw during the holiday shopping season, while the various RX 7900 models mostly cost upward of $1,000 now.\n\n\n\nFor this reason, we anticipate that this bundle will actually be most appealing to those buying an AMD laptop or an AMD CPU, but if you're looking to buy Monster Hunter Wilds and can find a better price on a Radeon 7000-series GPU (and remember, the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 are supposed to arrive next month), maybe it's worth buying.\n\n\n\nMonster Hunter Wilds has already caught a lot of flak for having high performance demands across PC and consoles alike, with consoles especially struggling to achieve a stable 30-60 FPS under its weight. The previous Monster Hunter World was also intensive, but Wilds has definitely taken it a step further, with the baseline \"Recommended\" specifications (Ryzen 5 3600X paired with an RX 6700 XT) requireing the use of Frame Generation to achieve 60 FPS.\n\n\n\nThat doesn't bode particularly well for iGPU-bound laptops that will be getting this game bundled, so we highly recommend running the free Monster Hunter Wilds benchmark available on the Steam page before installing the game on those systems to calibrate your expectations properly.",

Framework announced today that they are doing almost exactly that. With a mITX form factor, the company is taking AMD\u2019s newest chip and putting it into a package that costs (once optioned) just over $2000.\n\nFramework Making a Mini PC with an AMD Ryzen AI Max and 128GB of Memory\n\nThe new Framework Desktop is a 4.5L mini PC that packs the AMD Ryzen AI Max line. There is an 8-core AMD Ryzen AI Max 385, or perhaps the more exciting AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395. That AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 has 16 cores, 32 threads, and a 40 CU RDNA 3.5 GPU (the 385 is a 32CU GPU.)\n\nOn all of the motherboards for the DIY folks or the desktops, you get LPDDR5x memory. 32GB comes on the 385 while the 395 has an option for 64GB or 128GB. On the storage side, there are two PCIe Gen4 M.2 slots.\n\nThat 128GB model is likely to sell well. With 40 CUs on the GPU, and 128GB of memory, the small machine is going to be a real competitor for an Apple Mac Studio in the local AI space. The company made this direct comparison as well as to the NVIDIA DIGITS. We should note that DIGITS has built-in high-speed networking while the Framework Desktop has 5GbE and WiFi 7, but not 25GbE or faster networking.\n\nFinal Words\n\nWe have been waiting for the PC industry to have an AI competitor to the Apple Mac Studio for some time, and it is finally coming. The Framework website has been slammed today, with a Cloudflare waiting queue just to log on. A major challenge right now is that getting enough memory for running local models tends to be very expensive, especially when paired with an even remotely recent GPU architecture. These shared memory desktops offer something extremely useful to those who cannot afford the largest GPUs.\n\nYes, we have one on order.",

The Ryzen 3 5305G, Ryzen 3 5305GE, Ryzen 5 5605G, Ryzen 5 5605GE, Ryzen 7 5705G, and Ryzen 7 5705GE have appeared in AMD\u2019s official documentation, as first highlighted in a Reddit post. These additions to the Ryzen 5000G lineup signal AMD\u2019s intent to provide affordable yet capable CPUs for entry-level systems, keeping older but still relevant technology in circulation.\n\nAs the name suggests, these new CPUs are just refreshed versions of the existing Ryzen 3 5300, Ryzen 5 5600 and the Ryzen 7 5700. The \u201cG\u201d variants of these processors come with integrated Radeon Vega graphics, making them ideal for users who don\u2019t need a discrete GPU. Meanwhile, the \u201cGE\u201d models are lower-power alternatives with reduced TDP of 35W, making them perfect for compact or energy-efficient systems such as small form-factor PCs or media centers. The Ryzen 7 5705G, the most powerful of the bunch, is expected to feature eight Zen 3 cores with a boost clock of up to 4.6GHz. The Ryzen 5 5605G will offer six cores, while the Ryzen 3 5305G will feature four, targeting mainstream workloads and office productivity tasks.\n\nBy refreshing its Ryzen 5000G lineup, AMD is giving budget PC builders and system integrators access to affordable processors with solid performance. These chips will primarily cater to users looking for a balance between efficiency and power, making them great for home offices, budget workstations, and media center PCs. With built-in graphics and lower power consumption, they also offer an attractive alternative for those seeking a cost-effective, all-in-one CPU solution without the need for additional GPU expenses.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nAMD\u2019s ongoing support for the AM4 socket allows users with first-generation Ryzen processors all the way back from 2017, to upgrade to a modern CPU without changing their motherboard.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!\n\nWhile AMD has yet to officially announce specifications, availability, and pricing, this long-term compatibility can also be a bit confusing for budget PC buyers unfamiliar with Ryzen\u2019s various generations. As pointed out by Tom\u2019s Hardware, many expect that a processor released in the current year will feature the latest technology, even if it\u2019s not the most powerful. Naturally, even those on a tight budget want assurance that their system will remain upgradeable for years to come.",

The Xeon chips were 62 percent faster for NGINX TLS 1.3, 17 percent faster for Mongo DB, 14 percent faster for Redis Memtier and 10 percent faster for Redis vector similarity search, according to Intel.\n\nIn high-performance computing, Intel showed higher gains for the Xeon 6900P series against AMD\u2019s EPYC 9005 series: 52 percent faster for the HPCG benchmark test, 43 percent faster for the OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics model, 23 percent faster for the LAMMPS molecular dynamics workload and 15 percent faster for the WRF weather prediction system.\n\nBut it was across four AI workloads where Intel said its Xeon 6900P series had the biggest advantage. Compared with AMD\u2019s 128-core EPYC 9755, Intel\u2019s flagship,128-core Xeon 6980P ran 2.17 times faster for the ResNet-50 image classification model, 87 percent faster for the DLRM recommender system model, 85 percent faster for the BERT-large language processing model and 76 percent faster for a transformer-based object detection vision model.\n\nThe company also said its 86-core Xeon 6787P has a performance advantage over AMD\u2019s 128-core EPYC 9755 across multiple AI workloads: 3 percent faster for the LCM image construction model, 27 percent faster for BERT-large, 53 percent faster for ResNet-50, 25 percent faster for the transformer-based vision model and 21 percent faster for DLRM.\n\nIn a single-socket server, Intel said that its 64-core Xeon 6767P has a performance advantage over AMD\u2019s 64-core EPYC 9575F for vector databases. When it comes to vector database indexing, Intel said the workload can take advantage of the CPU\u2019s Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) for a 30 percent speed-up. As for graph-based similarity search, the CPU can run 2.6 times faster by using its Scalable Vector Search feature.\n\nIntel also provided four examples of how the Xeon 6900P and 6700P series can not only provide better performance than AMD\u2019s EPYC 9005 series but also lower data center costs.\n\nFor example, the company said the 128-core Xeon 6980P can enable 87 percent faster server performance than AMD\u2019s 128-core EPYC 9755 for the DLRM recommendation system model, resulting in a total cost of ownership (TCO) reduction of 46 percent. For the OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics workload, Intel said the CPU can enable a 28 percent TCO reduction with a 43 percent performance improvement in servers.\n\nAs for the Xeon 6700P series, Intel said the 64-core Xeon 6760P CPU can enable a 41 percent TCO savings for the NGIX TLS web services application with a 55 percent server performance boost over AMD\u2019s 64-core EPYC 9535. The processors can also enable a 52 percent TCO reduction for a transformer-based image construction vision model with a 2.09 percent performance improvement for servers.\n\nWhile Intel said the Xeon 6700P and 6500P series deliver \u201csignificant gains\u201d over their fifth-generation counterparts across a broad range of workloads, the company took time to point out how the new chips can offer a substantial upgrade over its second-gen Xeon CPUs, not just for performance but also space, energy and money.\n\nThis is because the semiconductor giant believes there are ample opportunities to upgrade aging data center infrastructure, even as customers try to keep them running for longer.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re talking to our customers, our customers are living longer on the infrastructure that they have, but they\u2019re also saying, \u2018I have issues with my infrastructure,\u2019\u201d said Ronak Singhal, senior fellow and chief architect of Xeon products, in last week\u2019s briefing.\n\nFor example, Singhal said, the ongoing demand for AI applications is pushing customers to figure out how to free up extra power within fixed infrastructure. He also pointed to customers looking to lower their energy consumption to meet sustainability goals or improve the manageability or security aspects of their data centers.\n\nWith Intel\u2019s first- and second-gen Xeon processors representing a \u201csignificant volume of what\u2019s deployed across all data centers today,\u201d the company\u2019s Xeon 6 processors can help customers significantly consolidate that infrastructure, according to Singhal.\n\nOne example from Intel pointed to a data center for MySQL data services consisting of 780 single-socket servers running on 28-core Xeon 8280 processors from the second generation. With 86-core Xeon 6787P chips improving performance by nearly 4.3 times, the company said the CPUs could enable the data center to reduce its server fleet to 180.\n\nAcross a four-year timeline, this would result in the data center reducing energy consumption by 14,735 megawatt-hours and CO2 emissions by 6,247 metric tons, according to Intel. It would also result in lower costs for cooling and hardware maintenance. All of this would result in a TCO savings of $3.3 million over four years, which would amount to a 29 percent savings.\n\nIntel said the TCO savings can be greater for some workloads, such as MongoDB for data services and NGINX TLS for web services. For those workloads, the company said the Xeon 6787P processors can enable a TCO reduction of 44 percent and 67 percent, respectively, representing millions of dollars in savings across four years.\n\nWhile customers can use Xeon 6 to reduce their data center footprint, they can also use the chips to crank up application performance and still use less energy, according to Singhal.\n\n\u201cIt's a significant footprint reduction that they can have at the same performance or significantly higher performance at lower power, and so they have different opportunities on how they want to play this,\u201d he said.\n\nXeon 6700P, 6500P Specifications, Features\n\nWith the Xeon 6700P series scaling up to 86 cores and the Xeon 6500P series scaling up to 32 cores, the lineup includes processors for servers with one, two, four or eight sockets.\n\nThese processors support up to eight channels of DDR5 memory with speeds of up to 6,400 mega transfers per second (MT/s). Several Xeon 6700P models can reach 8,000 MT/s by using the new, high-performance DDR5 MRDIMM modules.\n\nWhile the Xeon 6700P and 6500P models for dual-, four- and eight-socket servers support 88 PCIe lanes, the single-socket models go up to 136 lanes for higher PCIe device density.\n\nThe processors come with Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) for application isolation and Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) for virtual machine isolation. They also support Intel TDX Connect, which provides a \u201chigh-performance encrypted connection between the CPU and PCIe devices,\u201d such as a GPU, according to Intel.\n\nOther features include up to four Ultra Path Interconnect 2.0 links for CPU-to-CPU transfer speeds of up to 24 giga transfers per second, a maximum of 64 CXL 2.0 lanes, the CXL-adjacent flat memory mode for reducing memory costs as well as Intel AMX and Intel Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (AVX-512) for AI acceleration.",

            "content": "Despite launching the Ryzen 9000 CPUs in 2024, some two generations after the Ryzen 5000G processors (which launched in 2021), AMD quietly released six new Zen 3 Cezanne chips recently. As X user Everest shared, these chips will come in the flavors of Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5, and Ryzen 7.\ufeff\n\nCezanne wields Zen 3 cores with integrated Radeon Vega graphics and slots into the AM4 socket. The chips are limited to PCIe 3.0 speeds and DDR4. AMD hasn\u2019t announced the prices for these CPUs yet, nor has it announced if they'll be available to the retail market. Given the specifications, they\u2019re likely priced lower to focus on the budget segment of the market. For example, the AMD Ryzen 7 5700G is currently listed for $155 on Amazon, whereas the most affordable Ryzen 9000 chip available right now, the AMD Ryzen 5 9600X, costs $279.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time AMD has launched new CPUs based on older generations of Ryzen chips. The company silently launched the Ryzen 5 7400F in January 2025, two months after the launch of AMD\u2019s celebrated Ryzen 7 9800X3D gaming CPU. Team Red has even released AMD Ryzen 5 5600XT and 5600T chips between the launch of the vanilla Ryzen 9000-series and 9800X3D, which can confuse the average consumer.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Name Cores / Threads Base Clock (GHz) Boost Clock (GHz) L2 Cache (MB) L3 Cache (MB) TDP Integrated Graphics Graphics Core Count Graphics Frequency (MHz) AMD Ryzen 7 5705GE 8 / 16 3.2 4.6 4 16 35 Radeon Graphics 8 2,000 AMD Ryzen 7 5705G 8 / 16 3.8 4.6 4 16 65 Radeon Graphics 8 2,000 AMD Ryzen 5 5605GE 6 / 12 3.4 4.4 3 16 35 Radeon Graphics 7 1,900 AMD Ryzen 5 5605G 6 / 12 3.9 4.4 3 16 65 Radeon Graphics 7 1,900 AMD Ryzen 3 5305GE 4 / 8 3.6 4.2 2 8 35 Radeon Graphics 6 1,700 AMD Ryzen 3 5305G 4 / 8 4.0 4.2 2 8 65 Radeon Graphics 6 1,700\n\nThe Ryzen 3 5305G, Ryzen 5 5605G, and Ryzen 7 5705G appear to share identical specifications to the vanilla Ryzen 4 5300G, Ryzen 5 5600G, and Ryzen 7 5700G. AMD will also offer the new chips in the GE (35W) variants as usual. AMD\u2019s continued support for the AM4 socket means that users still have the first-generation Ryzen processors (launched in 2017) and can get a modern CPU eight years later without replacing their motherboard.\n\nHowever, it might also create challenges for users who want to purchase a new budget PC but don\u2019t understand these processor generations. After all, if you\u2019re buying anything \u201creleased this year,\u201d you\u2019re bound to expect it will have the latest and greatest tech, even if it\u2019s not the fastest. So, even if you\u2019re not spending much, it\u2019s natural for you to expect that you can easily upgrade the PC several years down the road.\n\nGiven that we already have Zen 5 chips today, we don\u2019t know how long AMD will milk the Zen 3 architecture. Because of this, Intel called out AMD on this practice \u2014 putting out new chips based on much older technologies \u2014 even though they\u2019re guilty of doing the same thing. That\u2019s why anyone buying a new CPU must investigate the chip specifications, as you cannot trust the naming scheme and even the release dates of new processors today.",

            "content": "Come on, AMD, where the hell are your budget X3D chips? Actually, scrap that - where are the Ryzen 3 series, or even the 5 series? I know those aren't exactly super-exciting top-tier product lines, brimming with insane Cinebench numbers or slightly higher frame rates than the competition in whatever the most popular game of the month is, but they're products that we seriously need as a community - if for no reason but the health of this beautiful PC-building hobby of ours.\n\nWhat's worse is, by all accounts, (certainly for the 3 series) it's a segment that's been missing in the custom PC space since the rather excellent Ryzen 3 3300X way back in 2020. And with that, I'm talking about a full-fat design, complete with all of its PCIe lanes, and more. No G-series chips standing in pretending to be something it's not, aimed at eSports gamers.\n\nCheap as chips, as the British say. (Image credit: Future)\n\nWithout champions at the budget end of the spectrum - the Core i3s, the Ryzen 3s - the average cost of a good rig is only going to steadily increase. Not only does this effectively gatekeep our hobby, one that was once readily accessible to anyone looking to save a bit of cash, but it also encourages companies to push prices higher. Motherboards, RAM, SSDs, PSUs, cases, you name it. It introduces this weird, almost pseudo-elitism to it all. Sorry, you and your family don't have the financial clout to be PC gamers anymore. Perhaps you should try looking at becoming more socially mobile instead.\n\nI get it; PCs are expensive things. As our transistor size shrinks, processors become increasingly difficult and more expensive to fabricate. But I got into this space because my house got struck by lightning when I was young. It fried a rig, and my dad decided to replace the damaged parts rather than buy a whole new system. It wasn't exactly easy, but it was cheaper, and soon enough he discovered he could build his own PCs and get better value for a pittance, and it was fun. I soon followed in his footsteps, and 25 years later here I am. Trying to do that today with the latest hardware, though? Not a chance. You'd have to buy, at minimum, a new motherboard and CPU combo for at least $500.\n\nStagflation Disaster\n\nInflation and stagnation haven't helped this whole situation either. Late last year, I wrote an article about this and the rising cost of PC gaming, and the numbers still hold true in 2025. In the last decade, we've seen general inflation climb by around 40%. Wherever you are in the Western world, on average, household income has increased by less than half that. That puts a major strain on budgets and further pushes building custom PCs outside of the reach of many many people. And that's before the US's general purpose and directed tariffs come into play later this year.\n\nOver the years I've watched as builds have become more expensive. Yes, this is in part because the wider industry has introduced ridiculous RGB lighting, and cooling, and gaming chairs, and mechanical keyboards, and more advanced cases, but there's been a slow creep upward in terms of those core products too. Prices have continued upwards at a tedious but consistent rate, $20 here, $40 there, particularly for CPUs and motherboards, generation after generation.\n\nIn fact, it's such an accepted thing in our industry that we praise manufacturers when they keep the recommended retail pricing the same as last year's model. Or at least when they announce a product launching like that, only for it to increase by $200 at retail due to stock demand. The problem is, we don't go: \"Hang on a minute, how do you have the ROI to manage that to begin with?\" Instead, we go: \"Awh, how kind? They understand the current inflationary pressures and are giving us a deal\".\n\nPC building is fun, but not every custom computer has to be a powerhouse machine. (Image credit: Maingear)\n\nBut I digress. We don't have a full-fat Ryzen 3 chip in the 9000 series, and it's not looking likely that we'll get one either. The cheapest Team Red CPU you can currently buy is $245, and that's the 9600X, with the 9600 nowhere in sight after six months. That's not helpful. We need processors that are cheaper, more accessible, and that don't trim back features to encourage you to buy upwards into a chip that you don't actually need.\n\nI always thought it was graphics cards that were the major problem in this field, that the RTX 4060 cost way more than its GTX 660 counterpart back in the day - but ironically those prices have dropped with inflation, and Nvidia continues to support the low-end. Combine that with Intel, now aggressively pursuing that market as well with its Arc GPUs, and it almost feels like that graphics sector is sincerely masking a lot of those price hikes from other categories.\n\nJust imagine it, though. A Ryzen 3 9300X. Four cores, eight threads, 3.5 GHz base clock, 5.0 GHz boost, 32MB of cache, and a 65W TDP, all for $150. Full compliment of 28 PCIe 5.0 lanes, compatibility with all the chipsets, heck, you could lop off the iGPU to save manufacturing costs if you really wanted. What a dream that would be - but one that sadly, remains just that: a dream.",

            "content": "Facing stiff competition from its long-time rival AMD and the ever-present specter of custom Arm silicon in the cloud, Intel on Monday emitted another wave of Xeon 6 processors.\n\nHowever, these new P-core Xeons aren't trying to match AMD on core count or raw computational grunt this time. We got those parts, which were primarily aimed at HPC and AI-centric workloads, last fall.\n\nInstead, its 6700P, 6500P, and 6300P-series Granite Rapids Xeons launching today are aimed squarely at the workhorses of the datacenter \u2013 think virtualization boxes, storage arrays, and, of course, big multi-socket database servers.\n\nHaving successfully restored core count parity with its x86 rival, Intel is leaning heavily on what remains of its reputation among customers, its complement of compute accelerators, and more aggressive pricing in a bid to stem its share losses in the datacenter.\n\nScaling Xeon 6 down\n\nPeeling back the integrated heat spreader, we find a now-familiar collection of silicon. With Xeon 6, Intel has fully embraced heterogeneous chiplet architecture splitting of I/O functionality from compute and memory.\n\nAt the top of the stack are the 6900P-series parts we looked at last fall, which feature a trio of compute and memory dies, built on the Intel 3 process node, flanked by a pair of Intel 7-based I/O dies.\n\nWhile all of Intel's Xeon 6 parts largely share the same I/O die, Intel's new 6700P and 6500P Xeons feature different compute tiles ranging from a pair of extreme-core-count dies on the 86-core part or a single high-core-count or low-core-count die for the 48-core and 16-core chips.\n\nHere we see Intel has fully embraced the heterogeneous chiplet architecture pioneered by long-time rival AMD \u2013 click to enlarge\n\nThis gives Intel some flexibility in terms of balancing core count and clock speeds for specific workloads, and, we imagine, helps quite a bit with yields. However, because the memory controller is part of the compute die rather than integrated into the I/O die, this means they're limited to eight memory channels as opposed to the 12 on its flagship parts this generation.\n\nIntel's latest chips make up for this somewhat by including support for two DIMMs per channel configurations \u2013 something notably absent on its earlier Granite Rapids parts. In single-socket configurations, the chips also support up to 136 lanes of PCIe 5.0 connectivity versus 88 on its multi-socket optimized processors.\n\nLess silicon means that this round of Xeon 6 processors run a fair bit cooler and pull less wattage than the 500 W parts we looked at last year coming in between 150 and 350 W depending in large part on core count. This means you can now have up to 22 more cores in the same power footprint as the last generation.\n\nIntel remains committed to multi-socket systems\n\nAs of 2025, Intel remains the only supplier of x86 kit for large multi-socket systems, commonly employed in large, mission-critical database environments. For reference, AMD's Epyc processors have only ever been offered in single or dual socket configurations\n\nFor those running these kinds of large, memory-hungry workloads, like SAP HANA, the release of Intel's 6700P series parts represents a major performance uplift over its aging Sapphire Rapids Xeons.\n\nYep, Intel is still the only x86 vendor offering configurations that scale beyond two sockets \u2013 click to enlarge\n\nHowever, with Compute Express Link (CXL) memory expansion devices eliminating the need for additional CPU sockets to achieve the multi-terabyte memory capacities demanded by these workloads, the question becomes whether these big multi-socket configurations are even necessary.\n\nOne of CXL's key features is the ability to add additional memory capacity to compatible systems via expansion modules that slot into a standard PCIe interface. The extra memory, which, by the way, doesn't have to be DDR5, then appears as another NUMA node.\n\nDespite these advancements, Intel Senior Fellow Ronak Singhal doesn't see demand for four and eight-socket systems going away any time soon. \"When you're looking at the memory expansion, there's a certain amount you can do with CXL, but for the people that are going to four-socket and eight-socket, or even beyond, they want to get those extra cores as well,\" he said.\n\nIntel leans hard on its accelerator investments\n\nCompared to last gen, Intel says its 6700P-series chips will deliver anywhere from 14 to 54 percent higher performance compared to its top-specced fifth-gen Xeons.\n\nHere's how Intel says its latest Xeons stack up against last gen \u2013 click to enlarge\n\nHowever, against its competition, it's clear that Intel is leaning pretty heavily on the integrated accelerator engines baked into its chips to differentiate and give it a leg up.\n\nWhile the rise of generative AI has shifted the definition of accelerators somewhat to mean GPUs or other dedicated AI accelerators, Intel has been building custom accelerators for things like cryptography, security, storage, analytics, networking, and, yes, AI into its chips for years now.\n\nLeaning on its onboard accelerators, Intel says a single Xeon 6 server has the potential to replace up to ten second-gen Xeon boxes \u2013 click to enlarge\n\nAlong with increased core counts and instructions per clock this generation, Intel says its cryptographic engines and advanced matrix extensions (AMX) now mean a single Xeon 6 server can take the place of up to ten Cascade Lake systems, at least for workloads like image classification and Nginx web serving with TLS.\n\nCompared to AMD's latest and greatest fifth-gen Epycs, Intel is claiming a performance advantage of 62 percent for Nginx TLS, 17 percent for MongoDB, 52 percent in HPCG, 43 percent in OpenFOAM, and 2.17x in ResNet-50.\n\nHere's how Intel says its latest Xeons stack up to Epyc. Obviously take these with a grain of salt \u2013 click to enlarge\n\nAs usual, we recommend taking these performance claims with a grain of salt, especially because they are for Intel's flagship 6900P processors and focus on workloads that benefit directly from either its integrated accelerator engines, or early support for speed MRDIMM memory tech.\n\nWith that said, if your workloads can take advantage of these accelerator engines, it may be worth taking a closer look at Intel's Xeon 6 lineup. Speaking of which, here's a full rundown of Intel's 6700P and 6500P series silicon launching today.\n\nIntel Xeon 6 6700P/6500P Performance SKUs\n\nSKU Cores Base clock Boost clock (All core) Boost clock (Max) L3 cache TDP Sockets Mem channels Mem speed DDR5/MRDIMM UPI links PCIe lanes Price 6787P 86 2 GHz 3.2 GHz 3.8 GHz 336 MB 350 W 2 8 6,400/8,000 MT/s 4 88 $10,400 6767P 64 2.4 GHz 3.6 GHz 3.9 GHz 336 MB 350 W 2 8 6,400/8,000 MT/s 4 88 $9,595 6747P 48 2.7 GHz 3.8 GHz 3.9 GHz 288 MB 350 W 2 8 6,400/8,000 MT/s 4 88 $6,497 6745P 32 3.1 GHz 4.1 GHz 4.3 GHz 336 MB 300 W 2 8 6,400/8,000 MT/s 4 88 $5,250 6737P 32 2.9 GHz 4 GHz 4 GHz 192 MB 330 W 2 8 6,400/8,000 MT/s 4 88 $4,995 6736P 36 2 GHz 3.4 GHz 4.1 GHz 144 MB 205 W 2 8 6,400/NA MT/s 4 88 $3,351 6730P 32 2.5 GHz 3.6 GHz 3.8 GHz 144 MB 250 W 2 8 6,400/NA MT/s 4 88 $3,726 6527P 24 3 GHz 4.2 GHz 4.2 GHz 144 MB 255 W 2 8 6,400/NA MT/s 4 88 $2,878 6517P 16 3.2 GHz 4 GHz 4.2 GHz 72 MB 190 W 2 8 6,400/NA MT/s 3 88 $1,195 6507P 8 3.5 GHz 4.3 GHz 4.3 GHz 48 MB 150 W 2 8 6,400/NA MT/s 3 88 $765\n\nIntel Xeon 6 6700P/6500P Mainline SKUs\n\nSKU Cores Base clock Boost clock (All core) Boost clock (Max) L3 Cache TDP Sockets Mem channels Mem speed (DDR5) UPI links PCIe lanes Price 6788P 86 2 GHz 3.2 GHz 3.8 GHz 336 MB 350 W 8 8 6,400 MT/s 4 88 $19,000 6768P 64 2.4 GHz 3.6 GHz 3.9 GHz 336 MB 330 W 8 8 6,400 MT/s 4 88 $16,000 6748P 48 2.5 GHz 3.8 GHz 4.1 GHz 192 MB 300 W 8 8 6,400 MT/s 4 88 $12,702 6738P 32 2.9 GHz 4.1 GHz 4.2 GHz 144 MB 270 W 8 8 6,400 MT/s 4 88 $6,540 6728P 24 2.7 GHz 3.9 GHz 4.1 GHz 144 MB 210 W 8 8 6,400 MT/s 4 88 $2,478 6724P 16 3.6 GHz 4.2 GHz 4.3 GHz 72 MB 210 W 8 8 6,400 MT/s 3 88 $3,622 6714P 8 4 GHz 4.3 GHz 4.3 GHz 48 MB 165 W 8 8 6,400 MT/s 3 88 $2,816 6760P 64 2.2 GHz 3.4 GHz 3.8 GHz 288 MB 330 W 2 8 6,400 MT/s 4 88 $7,803 6740P 48 2.1 GHz 3.3 GHz 3.8 GHz 288 MB 270 W 2 8 6,400 MT/s 4 88 $4,650 6530P 32 2.3 GHz 3.7 GHz 4.1 GHz 144 MB 225 W 2 8 6,400 MT/s 4 88 $2,234 6520P 24 2.4 GHz 3.4 GHz 4 GHz 144 MB 210 W 2 8 6,400 MT/s 4 88 $1,295 6515P 16 2.3 GHz 3.8 GHz 3.8 GHz 72 MB 150 W 2 8 6,400 MT/s 3 88 $740 6505P 12 2.2 GHz 3.9 GHz 4.1 GHz 48 MB 150 W 2 8 6,400 MT/s 3 88 $563\n\nIntel Xeon 6 6700P/6500P Single-socket SKUs\n\nSKU Cores Base clock Boost clock (All core) Boost clock (Max) L3 Cache TDP Sockets Mem channels Mem speed (DDR5 / MRDIMM) UPI links PCIe lanes Price 6781P 80 2 GHz 3.2 GHz 3.8 GHz 336 MB 350 W 1 8 6,400/8,000 MT/s 0 136 $8,960 6761P 64 2.5 GHz 3.6 GHz 3.9 GHz 336 MB 350 W 1 8 6,400/8,000 MT/s 0 136 $6,570 6741P 48 2.5 GHz 3.7 GHz 3.8 GHz 288 MB 300 W 1 8 6,400/NA MT/s 0 136 $4,421 6731P 32 2.5 GHz 3.9 GHz 4.1 GHz 144 MB 245 W 1 8 6,400 / NA MT/s 0 136 $2,700 6521P 24 2.6 GHz 4.1 GHz 4.1 GHz 144 MB 225 W 1 8 6,400/NA MT/s 0 136 $1,250 6511P 16 3.2 GHz 4.1 GHz 4.2 GHz 72 MB 150 W 1 8 6,400/NA MT/s 0 136 $815\n\nIntel gets aggressive on pricing\n\nIntel's Xeon 6 6700P and 6500P-series launch sees the x86 giant get considerably more aggressive with regard to pricing.\n\nCore-for-core, Intel has traditionally charged a premium for its chips compared to AMD. Comparing Intel's fourth-gen Xeon launch \u2013 that's Sapphire Rapids if you'd forgotten \u2013 to AMD's fourth-gen Epyc processors, we saw launch price differences ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand depending on the segment.\n\nWith Intel's latest Xeon launch we don't see the same pricing dynamics at play. Looking at launch prices for AMD's fifth-gen Epycs from last fall, it's clear Intel has attempted to match, if not undercut, its smaller competitor on pricing at any given core count or target market.\n\nThe one exception to this is Intel's four and eight-socket compatible chips, which have no competition in the x86 space and so we still see Intel charging a premium here. Need a maxed-out, eight-socket database server? You can expect to pay more than $150,000 ($19,000 a piece) in CPUs alone.\n\nOf course, these are tray prices we're talking about, and so they don't take into account volume discounts offered to customers by either chipmaker. Prices aren't fixed and it's not unusual for them to be revised to account for competitive pressure or market conditions.\n\nWe've already seen Intel slash prices for its flagship 6900P-series Xeons by an average of $4,181 since they were launched in September. And it is easy to see why. AMD was charging nearly $5,000 less for the same number of cores with its fifth-gen Epyc Turin parts. Intel's more aggressive pricing makes its chip more than $500 cheaper.\n\nAnd that's not the end of the story. Short of steep price cuts to the Epyc lineup, Intel's Xeon 6 processors could end up being substantially less expensive than AMD's if a 25-plus-percent tariff on semiconductor imports ends up being implemented by the Trump administration.\n\nIntel's Xeon 6 processors are among the few current-generation products the company is still manufacturing in-house. Assuming it can keep up with US demand at its domestic fabs, Intel Xeons are positioned to sidestep these tariffs. AMD, meanwhile, is reliant on TSMC for manufacturing.\n\nNew entry-level Xeons and SoCs for the edge\n\nAlongside its mainstream 6700P and 6500P processor families, Intel is also rolling out new embedded and entry-level Xeon processors.\n\nAt the bottom of the stack is Intel's 6300-series Xeons, which can be had in four, six, and eight-core flavors with clock speeds up to 5.7 GHz. However, with only two DDR5 memory channels, which max out at 128 GB of capacity and speeds of 4,800 MT/s, these chips are more closely aligned with AMD's baby Epycs we looked at last year than your typical datacenter CPU.\n\nFor embedded, edge, and networking environments, Intel is also rolling out a new Xeon 6 SoC variant, which it's positioning as a successor to its fourth-gen Xeon with vRAN boost.\n\nAlongside its datacenter-focused parts, Intel is rolling out a new edge-optimized SKU with an I/O die tuned for virtualized RAN networks \u2013 click to enlarge\n\nThe chip, which is designed to be integrated directly into edge compute, networking, or security appliances, can be had with up to 42 cores and features a unique I/O die with 200 Gbps of aggregate Ethernet bandwidth, presumably broken out across eight 25GbE links.\n\nAlong with powering things like virtualized radio access network (vRAN) systems, the chips can also be equipped with accelerators for cryptographic acceleration, AI, or media transcoding. The idea being that these chips could also be deployed in security appliances or to preprocess data at the edge.\n\nYou're probably not cool enough for Intel's 288-core monster\n\nIf you're wondering what ever happened to that 288-core E-core Xeon former CEO Pat Gelsinger teased back at Intel Innovation in 2023, it's still lurking in the shadows, Singhal told press ahead of the launch.\n\nBut unlike Intel's earlier Sierra Forest E-core Xeons launched last year, it seems Intel is holding its highest core-count parts in reserve for cloud service providers.\n\n\"The 288-core is now in production. We actually have this deployed now with a large cloud customer,\" Singhal said. \"We're really working on that 288-core processor closely with each of our customers to customize what we're building there for their needs.\"\n\nThis isn't surprising as the part was always designed to serve the cloud and managed service provider market, providing loads of power efficient if not necessarily the most feature-packed or performant cores for serving up microservices, web-scale apps, and other throughput-oriented programs.\n\nWe also know that demand for its E-core parts hasn't lived up to expectations.\n\n\"What we've seen is that's more of a niche market, and we haven't seen volume materialize there as fast as we expected,\" Intel co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus said during the company's Q4 earnings call.\n\nThis ultimately resulted in the delay of Intel's 18A-based Clearwater Forest parts from 2025 to 2026. But as we noted, the timing of that launch was always awkwardly close to Sierra Forest and, in our opinion, left prospective customers in the difficult position of either being an early adopter or waiting a little longer for what's likely to be a far more refined and performant part.\n\nAccording to Singhal, the part is already running in the lab and an Intel customer has powered on its first systems using it. \u00ae",

I'm in practice in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nMajda Hadziahmetovic, MD:\n\nMy name is Majda Hadziahmetovic. I'm an associate professor of ophthalmology and electrical and computer engineering at Duke University.\n\nLalwani:\n\nAnd we are the retina program chairs that put together the retina section at the Envision Summit this year, along with doctors Maria and Nina Berrocal. So Majda, this year, at Envision Summit in Puerto Rico, you spoke about the deep learning models of neovascular AMD. Can you tell us a little bit about your talk?\n\nHadziahmetovic:\n\nAbsolutely, first, it was a pleasure being here today and Envision seems to be getting better every year\u20132025 is not an exception. So what I was talking about is a deep learning framework for identification of the time point when we have to treat patients who convert to neovascular age-related macular degeneration. We know how important it is that we start the treatment in a timely manner within those two weeks, crucial two weeks, so that we can preserve good visual outcome. So this model tries to predict the time when to start the injections, and also try to predict progression of the other retinal changes over a period of time. The model is quite accurate. We still have ways to go, but very, very good initial performance has been proven already.\n\nLalwani:\n\nSo I asked you this during the talk, but how far in the future do you think it's going to be before we can understand how to administer treatment, to make a more personalized regimen based on this model that you talk about.\n\nHadziahmetovic:\n\nThat's a great question. And I think that actually we have to start thinking about what's in the black box. And I think actually neurosymbolics is going to be the way to go. That we actually start to understand a little bit better how the machines think, and what the machines taking consideration when they make this decision, to predict this is progression. Obviously, we have to have good ground truth. We have to have good data sets that actually can compare what the machine says versus what really happens in the real world and in real time.\n\nSo Geeta, I want to ask you, what do you think about this year's Envision, and what was your favorite part of it?\n\nLalwani:\n\nOh, wow. Well, easily retina was my favorite part about it. I'm very proud of what Envision Summit is, and actually, I take that back. What I've been very pleased about is the transition this year has been seamless, and the talks have been fantastic, but the kids room! I mean, that is what makes Envision Summit so unique. And I love seeing my daughter, not only in the kids room, but she sneaks into the back of the room and listens to talks, as do many other of the kids here. And it is, it is really something wonderful to be able to hear your kids laughing and screaming right across the hall, and to be able to peek at them, and, you know, be a part of their world,\n\nHadziahmetovic:\n\nIndeed. And being present in the in the presentation room. I mean, kids were everywhere. And it's amazing, catching up with friends, colleagues, having this amazing scientific discussions and enjoying this beautiful weather and sun.\n\nLalwani:\n\nIt's truly epitome of a work life balance meeting. I love it.",

We recently reported on how AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D has been a victim of getting burnt out, and now, based on a mega thread on the ASRock subreddit, it is claimed that the markets are seeing an \"abnormal\" number of Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPUs are seeing failure on user systems, and it seems like the problem is more common with ASRock motherboards, although not exclusive to it.\n\nThis isn't good at all, considering that AMD's X3D CPUs are a top priority for gamers, and given that these SKUs are so hard to get right now, it really is disappointing. Moderators over the subreddit have managed to get a grip on what is happening with 9800X3D CPUs, and according to them, either the SKUs are being on dead on arrival, or dying out after a few hours or days/weeks of use, which means that anyone can experience this issue, only a matter of time for now. Interestingly, the reason behind this issue isn't known at all.\n\nUntil now, it has been claimed that over forty Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPUs have become victims of the problem, with four non-X3D processors included in the list as well, showing that the issue might be common with Zen 5 CPUs, although this isn't confirmed for now. For now, users who are experiencing this problem are suggested to update their BIOS to the latest versions by their respective manufacturer, and given that the problem is more familiar with ASRock boards, the firm has already released a new BIOS version 3.20, addressing the issue.\n\nFor now, AMD has acknowledged the problem, but Team Red has yet to make an official statement. It isn't confirmed whether the DOA issue exists for many SKUs in the market, but the affected units are indeed in decent numbers, suggesting that it might increase further. Team Red is only entertaining RMA requests in case your 9800X3D CPU fails, so make sure to avail yourself of it in case you are a victim of this issue.",

            "content": "After a relatively muted 'launch' at CES 2025, AMD's next-generation GPU architecture, RDNA 4, has been left to leaks and rumours, as to how much better it's going to be compared to previous Radeon iterations. One tech site, however, is claiming that it has the real deal\u2014AMD's own performance claims\u2014and depending on what you were hoping for, you might be excited or disappointed.\n\nThe site in question is Videocardz and it claims AMD announced the performance figures at a press briefing, to which it wasn't invited, but managed to scoop the details anyway. We already know a fair amount about RNDA 4 and the Radeon RX 9000-series, such as the number of compute units, VRAM amount, and rough clock speed figures.\n\nHowever, translating all of that into actual gaming performance is difficult to do because we don't know what other changes AMD has implemented under the GPU hood. That will eventually become clear once the new cards fully launch but for now, we'll just have to trust that Videocardz really does have AMD's performance numbers.\n\nStarting with the RX 9070 XT, it's purportedly 42% faster than a Radeon RX 7900 GRE (RDNA 3) and 51% faster than a RX 6900 XT (RDNA 2). That's at 4K, averaged across more than 30 games, using 'Ultra' quality settings. The latter is over four years old, so one should hope the RX 9070 XT is considerably better, but a 42% mean uplift over a 7900 GRE is not to be sniffed at.\n\nIn our review of a Sapphire RX 7900 GRE, we found that the RX 7900 XT was on average just 18% better at 4K, so if this 42% increase is genuine, it marks a substantial improvement for AMD. However, the devil is in the details and the horned one in question here is ray tracing.\n\nVideocardz has separated AMD's claimed gaming figures into standard rendering and ray-traced rendering games, and in the case of the former, the average uplift is 37%\u2014still impressive but not quite 42%. However, averaging the improvements in the games with ray tracing puts the RX 9070 XT at 53% better than the RX 7900 GRE.\n\nThe standard RX 9070 is quite a bit slower than the 9070 XT, with an average uplift of 21% against the 7900 GRE. That's half as good as the XT version and I find that to be puzzling, given that all the rumours we've had about the two card's specifications have pointed to them being separated purely by clock speeds.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

All three scenarios could be true, as well.\n\nOne thing that really puzzles me is, if the RX 9070 XT really so much better than the 7900 GRE, why didn't AMD compare it to the 7900 XT\u2014currently it's second most powerful gaming graphics card?\n\nAt least we don't have long to discover the truth of the matter, as the RX 9000-series is getting revealed at the end of this month, with retail sales starting in early March. One thing is certainly true, though: AMD likes to keep us guessing.",

Perhaps the most important part was the disclosure of AMD's official performance numbers of the new Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics card that appeared to be significantly ahead of the Radeon RX 7900 GRE, according to the allegedly official numbers published by VideoCardz.\n\nIn fact, AMD claims that the upcoming Radeon RX 9070 XT is 42% \u2013 168% faster than the Radeon RX 7900 GRE at a 4K resolution with 'ultra' quality settings across over 30 games. The Radeon RX 9070 XT outperforms the RX 7900 GRE by an average of 38% at 1440p and 42% at 2160p. However with certain titles that rely on ray tracing more than others \u2014 such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Hitman 3 \u2014 performance gains reach 164% \u2013168%, again according to the numbers published by VideoCardz.\n\nGames with ray tracing tend to see the biggest increases, emphasizing AMD's RDNA 4 advances in handling RT workloads. Titles like Cyberpunk 2077, Dying Light 2, F1 24, and Hitman 3 show the strongest performance jumps of 56% to 66%, which clearly makes the new Radeon RX 9070-series offerings strong contenders to sit amongst the best graphics cards in the coming quarters.\n\nWhen it comes to the performance difference between the Radeon RX 9070 XT and the Radeon RX 9070 (non-XT), the delta averages between 16.1% at 1440p Ultra Settings and 18.3% at 2160p Ultra Settings across the tested games, according to AMD. Yet, the Radeon RX 9070 (non-XT) still delivers a 20% performance boost at 1440p and a 21% higher performance at 2160p over the Radeon RX 7900 GRE.\n\nAMD admitted that it did not have a GeForce RTX 5070 Ti for comparison, so it did not compare its new flagship against some of Nvidia's most wanted parts of today. The company did not explain why it decided not to compare its upcoming Radeon RX 9070 XT against its existing Radeon RX 7900 XTX flagship, but stuck to the cut-down Radeon RX 7900 GRE. The latter has around 25% lower compute performance compared to the range-topping Radeon RX 7900 XTX, but also has 16GB of memory onboard, whereas the range-topping board carries 24GB of GDDR6 VRAM.\n\nUnlike AMD, Nvidia uses upscaling technologies like frame generation to demonstrate performance improvements over the previous generation, so the red company gains some kudos. As a result, AMD has chosen to focus on native rendering performance and ray tracing, so performance gains are quite real. More details will, of course, be shared on February 28 when AMD officially presents its Radeon RX 9070-series products.",

These negotiations might echo the company's broader strategy to reshape its data center operations, spurring investor interest. Despite optimism surrounding these business maneuvers, AMD's share price fell by 2% over the week. This decline coincided with widespread market volatility, as the Nasdaq Composite, and other major indices sank following major tech stock sell-offs, notably in Tesla and Nvidia. The broad sell-off stemmed partly from DOJ investigations into industry sectors, poor economic data, and lower-than-expected earnings from other tech giants like Block and Akamai Technologies. While the speculation around AMD's potential asset sale posed a pivotal development, the broader market downturn likely exacerbated the stock's price drop, illustrating the prevailing market pressure that overshadowed company-specific advancements.\n\nNasdaqGS:AMD Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2025\n\nThe journey of AMD's shares over the past five years has been quite remarkable, achieving a 143.71% total return, including both share price appreciation and dividends. This performance underscores the company's ability to capitalize on key developments in the technology landscape. Notably, AMD's acquisition of Xilinx in October 2020 for $30 billion significantly expanded its product portfolio, providing a broader market reach and diversifying its revenue streams. This strategic move was complemented by a $4 billion share repurchase program announced in May 2021, reinforcing shareholder value and helping offset dilution from stock issuances.\n\nAdditionally, AMD's robust revenue growth, illustrated by a substantial increase in Q1 2021 compared to the previous year, highlighted the company's success in scaling its operations and boosting profitability. Market recognition was further amplified when AMD was included in prominent indexes such as the Russell Top 200 Growth Index in June 2020, enhancing its visibility among investors. Despite recent challenges, these strategic actions and steady growth in key financial metrics have played substantial roles in shaping AMD's impressive returns over the long term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

            "content": "Editor's take: We are frequently asked some version of the question, \"Will someone acquire Intel?\" At this point, we think it is highly unlikely, but these are unpredictable times. Setting aside all the principal considerations \u2013 like money, strategy, and regulatory approval \u2013 there are a few other hurdles. Chief among these is Intel's license for x86.\n\nEditor's note: We published this opinion article in November 2024, ahead of most recent Intel hurdles, CEO ousting, and growing speculation about a takeover or company split. Due to increased interest in how these developments might impact AMD, we're resurfacing this article.\n\nApparently, when Intel and AMD resolved their multi-decade dispute over x86, the cross-license agreement included provisions about transferability. If either company is acquired, the other has the right to cancel the license, effectively blocking the deal. When this was signed, we have to think everyone involved assumed it would be AMD getting acquired, but the provision seems to be mutual, and times change.\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nGuest author Jonathan Goldberg is the founder of D2D Advisory, a multi-functional consulting firm. Jonathan has developed growth strategies and alliances for companies in the mobile, networking, gaming, and software industries.\n\nSo just for fun, let's think through how that would play out. Right now, the most likely potential buyer of Intel is Broadcom. What would happen if they approached AMD about this license?\n\nAMD would have a few options. Their default position would likely be to just refuse and block the deal. Broadcom is a fearsome competitor, and even if they do not directly compete in every area, a revitalized Intel under Broadcom would be a serious threat to AMD.\n\nThat said, a failed Intel would also be a major problem for AMD, if for no other reason than the two are now linked at the hip when it comes to x86, which AMD needs to remain healthy. All of which is to say there is room for negotiation.\n\nWhat would AMD ask for to grant that approval? Obviously, they would take some cash. However, there is only so much Broadcom would be willing to pay before the Intel deal becomes unappealing. That probably amounts to a few billion dollars. Beyond cash, there are things AMD could ask for that might be worth far more strategically.\n\nFor starters, they could ask Broadcom for help in their fight against Nvidia. This is an area of shared interest between the two companies, and there are likely multiple ways both could benefit from a deeper partnership. For example, Broadcom could invest more heavily in AMD's Ultra Ethernet and other networking initiatives. Alternatively, Broadcom could design an entire networking stack optimized for AMD's Mi300 series of AI accelerators.\n\nGoing further, AMD could request that Broadcom encourage its AI ASIC customers to adopt AMD-friendly networking interfaces. We imagine there are plenty of novel ways that Broadcom could promote AMD's interests in their combined fight against Nvidia.\n\nAlternatively, AMD could ask Broadcom to steer business toward ZT Systems. After AMD acquires ZT, they plan to sell off ZT's manufacturing side. Securing a healthy backlog of Broadcom orders would certainly make that business more attractive.\n\nAMD would also want to ensure Broadcom continues spinning off Altera, which competes with AMD's Xilinx division. They could even push Broadcom to commit to incorporating more Xilinx products into future designs and reference platforms.\n\nThe point of these demands is that they would cost Broadcom relatively little while potentially offering AMD significant strategic value.\n\nWhile this thought experiment is just for kicks, it highlights one more hurdle for anyone interested in buying Intel. Few potential buyers could offer AMD comparable strategic benefits. For instance, a private equity buyer for Intel would likely have only cash to offer, which might not be enough to get AMD on board. The deal is unlikely, but if it happened, it would shake up many corners of the industry.",

According to Videocardz, this GPU will be 38% and 42% faster than the AMD Radeon 7900 GRE at 1440p and 4K, respectively.\n\nAnd I know. A lot of you will be asking one simple question. Why did AMD use the 7900 GRE and not the 7900XTX? And the answer is simple. The AMD Radeon RX 9070XT will trade blows in a lot of games with that GPU. So, using it in an official slide would immediately make the 9070XT feel a bit underwhelming.\n\nCompared to the AMD Radeon RX 6900XT, the RX 9070XT will be 51% faster at 4K. This means that the AMD Radeon RX 9070XT should be close to the performance of the AMD Radeon RX 7900XTX. After all, the 7900XTX is usually 40-55% faster than the RX 6900XT at 4K.\n\nNow the good news is that the RDNA3 GPUs are said to be significantly faster in Ray Tracing than the RDNA2 GPUs. So, in theory, the RX 9070XT should be as fast as the RX 7900XTX in rasterized games, and a bit faster than it in ray-traced games.\n\nFrom what we\u2019ve seen, the NVIDIA RTX 5080 is faster in most of the games than the AMD Radeon RX 7900XTX. So, it\u2019s safe to assume that the AMD Radeon RX 9070XT won\u2019t be able to match its performance. However, it will be interesting to see how it will fare against the NVIDIA RTX 5070Ti.\n\nAMD will officially reveal its RDNA3 GPUs on February 28th. My guess is that the red team will unveil the release date and price for both the AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070XT. AMD\u2019s CEO has also confirmed that the first RDNA3 GPUs will be available in early March.\n\nBefore closing, I should note that these performance figures are from AMD\u2019s official slides. In other words, these could be the best-case scenarios for the upcoming RDNA3 GPUs. So, I strongly suggest waiting for some third-party benchmarks.\n\nStay tuned for more!",

It\u2019s crucial to emphasize that this is not a forecast or a trading plan but rather an analytical perspective on possible market behavior. The buyTheDip strategy was previously outlined, where two out of three buy orders have already been executed, with the possibility of the third still pending.\n\nIs AMD Stock a Buy Right Now?\n\nThe chart presents two possible paths for AMD\u2019s price action:\n\nAMD daily chart with the recent failed breakout\n\nPath 1 \u2013 AMD finds support around the $109-$110 region and attempts to regain momentum for another breakout attempt. A confirmed close above resistance could validate a bullish continuation. Path 2 \u2013 The stock fails to hold immediate support and extends its pullback towards the $106-$103 range before forming a stronger base for recovery.\n\nAMD Stock buyTheDip Plan\n\nThe dip buying is an idea and opinion. Do your own research.\n\nThis approach follows a layered buying strategy, ensuring a structured allocation at key support levels. The budget proportions must be maintained as outlined below. This AMD stock buying plan was already published on ForexLive.com (stay tuned for others) and 2 of the 3 buy orders were already filled, but the plan is still relevant for those that seek an opinion of 1 way to buy. At your own risk only, this is not financial advice. The budget/cost mentioned is just an example but the proportions matter.\n\nFirst Buy Zone\n\nPrice: $111.08\n\n$111.08 Position Size: 20 shares ( 16.67% of the budget )\n\n20 shares ( ) Total Cost: $2,222\n\nSecond Buy Zone\n\nPrice: $106.87\n\n$106.87 Position Size: 40 shares ( 33.33% of the budget )\n\n40 shares ( ) Total Cost: $4,191\n\nThird Buy Zone (Pending Execution)\n\nPrice: $101.38\n\n$101.38 Position Size: 60 shares ( 50% of the budget )\n\n60 shares ( ) Total Cost: $6,083\n\nWeighted Average Entry Price (WAP) for AMD Stock\n\nIf all buy orders are filled, the Weighted Average Entry Price (WAP) is calculated as:\n\nAMD Long - weighted average price for the entry\n\nWAP=(111.08\u00d720)+(106.87\u00d740)+(101.38\u00d760)120WAP = \\frac{(111.08 \\times 20) + (106.87 \\times 40) + (101.38 \\times 60)}{120}\n\nWAP=104.13WAP = 104.13\n\nAMD Stock Stop-Loss Consideration\n\nStop-Loss Level: $95.80 (8% below WAP)\n\nThis structured approach ensures an average cost basis of $104.13 with risk management in place. The next price movements will dictate whether AMD stabilizes at these levels or extends its correction before resuming a potential recovery.\n\nShould You Buy AMD Stock?\n\nThe failed breakout has led to uncertainty, but AMD remains within a structured price range.\n\nTwo out of three buy orders have already been executed in the buyTheDip plan, with the third potentially still active.\n\nin the buyTheDip plan, with the third potentially still active.

Now, just ahead of the planned late-February reveal, details about these GPUs, the reference designs and more have surfaces.\n\nHardware leaker Hoang Anh Phu (via VideoCardz) initially shared details confirming clock speeds and total board power (TBP) values, although the post was quickly deleted. According to the deleted post, the Radeon RX 9070 XT is set to boast a boost clock of 2,970MHz and a TBP of 304W, while the non-XT RX 9070 will feature a boost clock of 2,520MHz and a TBP of 220W. The leaks also confirm support for PCIe 5.0 x16, meaning the GeForce RTX 50 series will no longer be the only consumer GPUs supporting this PCIe standard.\n\nAdding to the excitement, a leaked 3DMark benchmark (via @GawroskiT) has surfaced, showcasing the RX 9070 XT's potential performance. While there's some speculation about the benchmark's authenticity, with suggestions that pre-release drivers might be masked as a Radeon RX 7800 XT, the results are impressive nonetheless. The leaked benchmark shows the RX 9070 XT achieving a score of 7979, putting it on par with the RX 7900 XTX, surpassing both the 7900 XT and 7900 GRE, and exceeding the 7800 XT by over 50%.\n\nIn addition, AMD has confirmed (on X) that the dual-slot reference design it previously showcased in marketing materials will not be available for purchase. This departs from AMD's usual practice of offering reference cards alongside partner models. While some might be disappointed by the lack of a reference design, this could benefit consumers. In the past, AMD has prioritised the production of its reference cards, often limiting the availability of GPUs for AIB partners at launch. This time, AIBs will be solely responsible for the RX 9070 series launch, potentially leading to greater variety and availability of custom designs.\n\nKitGuru says: What kind of performance do you expect from the Radeon RX 9070 series?\n\nBecome a Patron!",

In the early 2000s, it was said that Intel let AMD survive only so that Intel wouldn't be considered a monopoly in the PC processor market. Over the past decade, AMD eventually fought back and now compares favorably to Intel, but that hasn't done much for shareholders lately.\n\nNow, AMD looks to be losing the artificial intelligence (AI) race to Nvidia. AMD is only seen as an alternative, rather than the go-to provider for graphics processing units (GPUs) to power these massive workloads. AMD's failure to capitalize on this market (so far) has sunk its stock nearly 50% from its all-time high established in March 2024.\n\nHowever, it's not like AMD has completely missed out on all this growth, and many investors may wonder if this is their opportunity to scoop up shares on the cheap. Let's find out.\n\nIts divisions are either booming or slumping\n\nAMD has multiple product lines in its business, each with differing levels of success in the most recent quarter. Its divisions are:\n\nData Center, which includes GPUs and other hardware AMD sells to outfit data centers. This division is the primary beneficiary of the AI race.\n\nClient, which includes OEM hardware that AMD places in other companies' laptops and PCs.\n\nGaming, which includes producing GPUs for gaming consoles and aftermarket upgrades.\n\nEmbedded, which includes embedded processors that were added to the business from its Xilinx acquisition.\n\nThe results from these four divisions were an absolute mixed bag, with some divisions rising strongly in the fourth quarter while others sank.\n\nDivision Q4 Revenue (in millions) Revenue Growth (YOY) Operating Income Growth (YOY) Data Center $3,860 69% 74% Client $2,310 58% 711% Gaming $563 (59%) (78%) Embedded $923 (13% (21%)\n\nAt first glance, you are probably thinking: AMD isn't doing that badly at growing its data center division -- it rose 69% year over year! However, its $3.86 billion in revenue was far from what analysts expected: $4.14 billion. Furthermore, AMD's chief rival, Nvidia, saw data center sales of $30.8 billion, up 112% during its fiscal 2025's third-quarter (ended Oct. 27, 2024).\n\nThat's not a perfect comparison, since Nvidia's Q3 encompassed only one month of AMD's Q4. We'll have to wait and see on Feb. 26 (when Nvidia reports Q4 2025 results) what Nvidia's growth rates are to get a better idea of how \"bad\" AMD's quarter was. However, Nvidia is unlikely to post growth rates as slow as AMD. Plus, its division is nearly 10 times the size of AMD's, so it's clear that AMD isn't making up any ground in this race.\n\nWhile the client division saw strong growth, neither of AMD's other weak divisions was able to bolster revenue growth overall. Companywide in Q4, AMD's revenue rose 24% year over year, but its margins suffered, with net income decreasing 28% year over year. AMD's profit margin recovered from a dip in 2023, but it still hasn't reached 2021 levels.\n\nInvestors need to be careful comparing AMD's current margins to those attained in 2021. AMD had a massive boost from the COVID-19 computer buying spree, which allowed AMD to charge a premium for its products. As a result, its current profit margin may be a better indicator of future levels.\n\nAMD is valued at a slight premium to the broader market\n\nWith this in mind, is AMD's valuation at a point where it looks like an attractive buy? Despite tumbling nearly 50% from its highs, AMD's stock isn't as cheap as you'd think.\n\nThe stock now trades for 23.9 times forward earnings, which is slightly higher than the broader market (the S&P 500 trades for 22.5 times forward earnings). This means that AMD is viewed as a slightly better-than-market stock, which I think is probably a fair assessment.\n\nAMD's growth rate in 2025 and 2026 is projected to be quite strong, with 23% and 21% revenue growth expected from Wall Street analysts in 2025 and 2026, respectively. That's a quicker pace than the one at which the market grows, and if AMD can slightly improve its profit margins alongside that solid growth, it could easily become a market-beating stock.\n\nWhile AMD won't be the next Nvidia, investors can confidently take a position at this price point and expect market-beating returns moving forward.",

            "content": "AMD's \"3D V-Cache\" CPUs provide the best gaming performance. However, they are a bit difficult to get, not just based on availability but also on pricing. But Amazon has put up an amazing CPU and motherboard combo, featuring the Ryzen 7 7800X3D paired with the MSI PRO B650-P Wi-Fi ProSeries motherboard. That too, with a decent 10 percent discount, making it an excellent deal for entry-level consumers to look at.\n\nDiving a bit into technicals, AMD's Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU is known as one of the \"value-for-money\" options for getting into the modern market, and despite being a generation old, it still provides competitive performance. Coming in with an eight-core count and max boost clocks of up to 5 GHz, this CPU is optimal for being integrated into systems intended for high-intensity workloads. Moreover, with the extra L3 cache onboard, gaming performance sees a massive improvement, making this CPU a great 'all-rounder' option.\n\nApart from the CPU, the motherboard in this deal is also a solid picking, coming in with the mid-end B650 chipset. It offers support for dual-channel DDR5-6400 memory, along with 2 x M.2 PCIe 4.0 x4 slots, allowing consumers to mount their storage drives without running out of options. Moreover, with support for USB 3.2 Gen2 interfaces along with an onboard Wi-Fi 6E controller, the MSI PRO B650-P is a phenomenal option for pairing up the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, and it is far better than some of the other combos out there, which compromises on motherboard selection.\n\nThis package is indeed an awesome option if you are looking for a build in the sub-$1500 budget since slapping any of NVIDIA or AMD's top-end GPU options will create a system that would be fine for years to come, supporting AAA titles to the very end. With a price of $629.99, you are certainly getting the maximum value out of this deal. Assuming this bundle goes out of stock, which it will, we have included some more Ryzen 7 7800X3D and motherboard pairings for you to check out below.",

Here\u2019s how it works\n\nOne of AMD's high-end AM5 processors from the Ryzen 9000 series has reached a new all-time low price. If you want to build a powerful desktop computer that works great with modern games and can also do some heavy lifting in professional applications, check out the Ryzen 9 9900X, which is now available with a 24% discount on Amazon.\n\nThe Ryzen 9 9900X is a 12-core, 24-thread AM5 desktop processor. Its base clock is 4.4GHz, which can go up to 5.6GHz in max boost. Since the chip is unlocked, you can overclock it even higher as long as your cooling solution has enough headroom and your motherboard supports overclocking. Note that the processor does not come with a bundled cooler, so make sure to buy a beefy air cooler or a liquid all-in-one system (the default TDP is rated for 120W).\n\nThe Ryzen 9 9900X works with all AM5 motherboards with 800 and 600 series chipsets. Its memory controller works with DDR5 memory only, with a maximum RAM capacity of 192GB. The chip offers 64MB of level 3 cache.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning about the Ryzen 9 9900X is the fact that it has integrated graphics. Although the dual-core Radeon Graphics operating at 2.2GHz is unlikely to run the latest AAA games at any decent framerates, it is enough to have image and modern media capabilities while you wait for your GPU to arrive.\n\nAs an Amazon Associate, we earn from qualifying purchases.",

If you remember, AMD prepared the product page for the Ryzen 5 9600 quietly. While it was an indication that the processor was soon coming to the market, AMD didn't announce its availability or launch date.\n\nInitially, it was thought that the Ryzen 5 9600 would be available in January, but it was slightly delayed and has finally come to the shelves. As spotted by @momomo_us, the processor is now available in at least two retail stores, including one in the UK and one in another EU region.\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 9600 can be bought right now from the UK store SCAN.CO.UK at a price of \u00a3221.99. The product is currently in stock and is ready to be shipped as soon as the next day. The processor is also available on the French store LDLC at \u20ac299.95. However, availability will only be in 15 days.\n\nThe pricing seems to be according to its specs and is slightly lower than the current MSRP of Ryzen 5 9600X. The 9600X is available for \u00a3239.99 on Scan UK and for \u20ac309.5 at LDLC. Since these prices include VAT, you can expect the price to be around $229 in the US. This is $40 cheaper than the launch MSRP of Ryzen 5 9600X but since the latter is now retailing for around $249, the price difference is around $20.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 5 9600 is the smaller sibling of the Ryzen 5 9600X with similar specifications except for the clocks. The processor brings the same 6-core/12-thread configuration, Zen 5 architecture, L3 cache of 32 MB, and TDP of 65W. However, the base/boost clock is 3.8/5.2 GHz, which is lower than the 3.9/5.4 GHz of Ryzen 5 9600X.\n\nImage Source: AMD\n\nAnother big difference is that the Ryzen 5 9600 comes with a Wraith Stealth cooler while the X variant doesn't come with any. Therefore, the Ryzen 9600 can be a cost-effective solution for users who want to build a fast gaming/productivity build, allowing them to save money not only on the CPU but also on the cooling solution.\n\nIt's the only non-X SKU in the Ryzen 9000 series and AMD is known for releasing several non-X SKUs in its lineups. Therefore, it's safe to assume that AMD will be launching more non-X SKUs later on. As of now, AMD seems to be focusing more on the high-end parts and will be launching the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D soon. We recently saw both of them being benchmarked in Geekbench, which indicates that the launch is very near.\n\nNews Sources: Scan UK, LDLC",

AMD\u2019s strength elsewhere ebbs, particularly in its Gaming division, where revenue nosedived by 59%.\n\nThe company\u2019s overall revenue managed a 24% uptick, a deceptive glimmer that belies net income, which slid by 28%. As AMD navigates post-pandemic waters, its margins are stabilizing but still far from their pandemic peak, when surges in demand allowed for higher pricing.\n\nPrice-to-earnings ratios offer a glimpse into AMD\u2019s market standing. Trading at a forward earnings multiple of 23.9 times, AMD holds a slight edge over the S&P 500, yet suggests caution. However, Wall Street whispers of robust growth, with forecasts of 23% and 21% revenue upticks for 2025 and 2026, respectively.\n\nThough AMD may not dethrone Nvidia, the potential for market-beating returns lurks beneath its current valuation.

One such leak has provided a clue as to the power draw for these two new graphics cards, suggesting that they might closely match the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070, respectively.\n\nThe RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 are the first AMD RDNA 4 gaming GPUs to launch and have long been expected to compete with the RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti for places on our best graphics card guide. This latest leak, though, seems to confirm just how closely they will match.\n\nThis RX 9070 XT power draw leak comes from regular tech leaker, Hoang Anh Phu, who revealed the figures for the cards via X (formerly Twitter). In a since-deleted post, reported by Videocardz, Hoang Anh Phu suggests that the RX 9070 XT will launch with a 304W total board power (TBP) rating, while the standard RX 9070 will be rated for 220W instead.\n\nThe former figure actually puts the RX 9070 XT power at a lower level than suggested by a recent RX 9070 XT benchmark leak, which showed the RX 9070 XT could hit as high as 329W TBP. Meanwhile, the recently-released RTX 5070 Ti has a 300W power rating, leaving it just 4W under these rumored RX 9070 XT specs.\n\nAs for the RX 9070 non-XT\u2019s 220W power rating, that puts it a comfortable 30W below the RTX 5070\u2018s expected 250W TBP.\n\nOf course, power consumption doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to performance, but on the specs front, we\u2019re still expecting to see AMD\u2019s GPUs compete reasonably well with Nvidia\u2019s mid-tier cards. Videocardz also shared some specs data to help with that claim, with the RX 9070 XT set to have 64 Compute Units and a 2.97GHz boost clock speed, while the RX 9070 non-XT will ship with 54 Compute Units and a 2.52GHz boost clock instead, according to that site.\n\nBoth cards will include 16GB of GDDR6 VRAM, while also supporting a PCIe 5.0 x16 connection. PCIe 5.0 support will offer double the potential memory bandwidth compared to PCIe 4.0 cards like the RX 7800 XT, although this isn\u2019t likely to have any impact on real world performance.\n\nAMD isn\u2019t likely to confirm any of this data before it launches these cards on February 28, so we\u2019ll have to wait until then to see what the GPU maker has been cooking up. While you wait, you can check out our RTX 5080 review to get a sense of how a close Nvidia rival card performs in our real world gaming tests.\n\nYou can also follow us on Google News for daily PC hardware news, reviews, and guides, or join our community Discord to stay in the know.",

These test scores were probably inadvertently made public by an unsuspecting reviewer. In any case, while we don't want to jump to conclusions, and neither should you, the numbers are disappointing considering everything we've heard thus far. The flagship RX 9070 XT barely matches Nvidia's RTX 4070 Super. However, we cannot confirm the authenticity of these tests. Also, given the architectural revamps with RDNA 4, synthetic tests are not guaranteed to reflect how these GPUs will hold up in real-world performance.\n\nTwo separate test benches were used for the RX 9070 XT and its non-XT counterpart. The former is equipped with AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D on the Asus ROG Crosshair X870E Hero motherboard. The latter sticks with the standard Ryzen 7 9700X coupled with the MSI B650 Gaming Plus Wi-Fi motherboard. The setups are pretty different, so it's obvious the tests weren't conducted by a single person.\n\nGeekbench was also generous enough to unofficially confirm previously rumored specifications. From the listings, the RX 9070 XT and 9070 non-XT share a similar 16GB VRAM configuration. The only difference is in the core counts; the 9070 XT has 64 CUs (Compute Units) while the 9070 offers 56 CUs. For the sake of comparison, we've aggregated publicly available data across the Vulkan and OpenCL APIs at Geekbench.\n\nJumping into the benchmarks, the RX 9070 XT scored 177,395 and 179,178 points in Vulkan and OpenCL, dropping to 158,520 and 140,842 points for the 9070 respectively. The RX 9070 XT, per this test, is 22% slower than Nvidia's RTX 5070 Ti and that's quite telling. Jumping over to Ada, the RTX 4070 Super is a more suitable match. As expected, the 9070 XT isn't quite able to topple the RDNA 3 flagship but manages a somewhat decent 28% uplift against its predecessor, the RX 7800 XT.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally GPU Vulkan OpenCL vs 9070 XT in Vulkan vs 9070 XT in OpenCL RX 9070 XT (Leaked) 177395 179178 100.00% 100.00% RX 9070 (Leaked) 158520 140842 89.36% 78.60% RX 7900 XTX 235279 212081 132.63% 118.36% RX 7900 XT 206494 186399 116.40% 104.03% RX 7800 XT 155488 139983 87.65% 78.13% RTX 5070 Ti 228576 229140 128.85% 127.88% RTX 4070 Super 178982 192378 100.89% 107.37%\n\nWe can compare synthetics all day long, but at the end of the day, proper real-world tests are what truly matter. Back in January, a tipster alleged raster performance in the ballpark of an RTX 4080 Super, so it's possible that RDNA 4 doesn't perform as well in theoretical tests, but that's just a guess. If the RTX 5070 is around 15% faster than the RTX 4070; typical for Blackwell GPUs, that'd land it in RTX 4070 Super territory. This doesn't leave much wiggle room for AMD, but we'll get a clearer picture after its presentation on February 28.",

The tech site found that the RX 9070 XT is about 6% faster than the RX 7900 XT in OpenCL, and a touch slower (4% off the pace) in Vulkan compared to that same current-gen graphics card.\n\nThe RX 9070 (non-XT) on the other hand is about even with the 7800 XT in OpenCL and about 6% slower than this GPU in the Vulkan test (where it\u2019s only a smidge faster than the 7700 XT, in fact).\n\n(Image credit: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock)\n\nAnalysis: Reasons to be doubtful (and cheerful)\n\nAt this point you might be thinking: huh, weren\u2019t these RDNA 4 GPUs supposed to be faster than this based on previous rumors? Well, yes, they were. In fact past chatter has suggested that AMD was aiming to get the RX 9070 XT to be slightly faster than the RTX 4080 (Founders Edition model from Nvidia).\n\nNow, if the RX 9070 XT is not much faster than the RX 7900 XT as is indicated here, that current-gen AMD GPU is considerably off the pace of a vanilla RTX 4080, so this latest leak is disappointingly slow compared to what we\u2019ve been primed to expect.\n\nHowever, this is just a few Geekbench runs, and as I always say when it comes to gauging gaming graphics cards, this is not nearly the best way to judge performance. Synthetic benchmarks aren\u2019t ideal full-stop, and Geekbench is low on the ladder of these metrics to boot.\n\nOther leaked performance estimations (including 3DMark results, and a glimpse of the vanilla 9070 flexing its muscles in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6) suggest a beefier GPU than what we\u2019re seeing here, that\u2019s for sure. And AMD is certainly putting expectations firmly on the table with its new naming scheme \u2013 the RTX 9070 models are clearly intended to square up to Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5070 offerings.\n\nSo in short, I really wouldn\u2019t worry about these fresh benchmarks, and I\u2019d be surprised if they weren\u2019t proven to be out of line eventually.\n\nThe indicated power usage figures are interesting, certainly. Previously we\u2019ve seen suggestions that the RX 9070 XT could demand up to 330W of power, although that\u2019s for top-end boards, with the entry-level (and reference) graphics cards expected to pitch in at 260W. This leak claiming 304W for the reference board is a bit higher than expected, then (while top-end GPUs going very heavy with the power is something that's already been rumored, and not really a surprise, of course).\n\nThe RX 9070, on the other hand, sounds like it\u2019s in a theoretically much more comfortable spot for a lot of gaming PCs out there, being rated at 220W.\n\nAll these rumors will be cleared up soon enough, because as noted, AMD\u2019s official launch event is now imminent, where we\u2019ll find out the hefty-sized missing piece from the next-gen Radeon puzzle \u2013 those MSRPs.\n\nBecause after all, whatever performance comes out at relative to Nvidia\u2019s new mid-range graphics cards, the right price tag can still make RDNA 4 a potent rival, or perhaps even a force to blow away Blackwell. (Okay, so the latter is doubtless wishful thinking, but come on AMD \u2013 let\u2019s have a pricing surprise of a good nature in the GPU world for once, eh?).",

            "content": "The AMD EPYC 9005 \"Turin\" processors that launched last year offer excellent performance and power efficiency out-of-the-box. For those wanting to pursue maximum power efficiency and running in the most optimal configuration for performance-per-Watt, AMD EPYC BIOS tunables as well as recent Linux kernel driver improvements can help in driving even greater efficiency. Today's article is a look at the impact of the AMD P-State driver usage and options with recent kernel versions as well as the Power Profile Selection BIOS option for the impact on 5th Gen EPYC performance and power efficiency.\n\nAs covered in several Phoronix articles over the past few months, with the Linux 6.13 kernel and newer the AMD P-State driver is used by default on EPYC 9005/Turin processors and future AMD server processors moving forward -- assuming the server platform/motherboard supports ACPI Collaborative Processor Performance Control (CPPC). Over the generic ACPI CPUFreq CPU frequency scaling driver, the AMD P-State driver is able to make more informed frequency/power selection and paired with Energy Performance Preference (EPP) hints that can be set by the user / server administrators, there is much greater power/performance control than with ACPI CPUFreq as is used by default on pre-6.13 kernels and prior generation AMD EPYC servers.\n\nThose not having read the prior Phoronix articles on AMD P-State for EPYC servers can find all of the kernel driver documentation on kernel.org. Simply put, this transition from ACPI CPUFreq to AMD P-State can allow for greater performance and power efficiency when moving to a Linux 6.13+ kernel. Adjusting the EPP value allows for communicating your preference for performance or power efficiency.\n\nIn addition to the ACPI EPP value, via the server BIOS the \"Power Profile Selection\" can be set for going from the default high performance mode to an efficiency mode, maximum I/O performance, balanced memory performance, balanced core performance, or balanced core memory performance mode. Alternatively, the Power Profile Selection can also be adjusted at run-time using the AMD HSMP/APML software. For those really wanting to optimize for power efficiency without compromising much performance, the \"Balanced Memory Performance\" mode is recommended for most workloads in constraining the memory/fabric/xGMI performance to workload bandwidth and latency needs while utilizing the remaining TDP for maximizing the CPU core frequency.\n\nFor this article I tested the following CPU frequency scaling governor and driver modes, EPP values, and Power Profile Selections for demonstrating the impact of these changes on AMD EPYC 9005 power and performance:\n\nacpi-cpufreq performance [Old Default] - The default on pre-6.13 kernels where ACPI CPUFreq is used with the performance governor and default Power Profile.\n\namd-pstate performance, EPP performance [New Default] - The \"new\" default on Linux 6.13+ for those using an AMD EPYC 9005 series server that supports ACPI CPPC. The AMD P-State driver with performance CPU frequency governor and EPP \"performance\" preference and the default (high performance) Power Profile selection.\n\namd-pstate powersave, EPP power - The AMD P-State default above but switching to a \"power\" Energy Performance Preference bias.\n\namd-pstate powersave, EPP power, Balanced Memory - Switching over to the \"Balanced Memory\" Power Profile selection and with EPP power setting and using the powersave governor.\n\namd-pstate powersave, EPP performance, Balanced Memory - Switching over to the \"Balanced Memory\" Power Profile selection and with EPP performance setting and using the powersave governor. This is one of the recommended configurations by AMD engineers for those wanting to maximize their power efficiency on modern Linux servers. ([R] for recommended on graphs.)\n\namd-pstate powersave, EPP performance - Using the default High Performance Power Profile while switching to the powersave governor and performance EPP preference.\n\nacpi-cpufreq schedutil - The \"old\" default of using ACPI CPUFreq and for Linux distributions that default to using the scheduler utilization governor \"Schedutil\" rather than the performance governor.\n\nAll of this testing was done on the AMD Volcano reference server platform using two AMD EPYC 9755 processors. These 128-core Zen 5 server processors were running at their default speeds and other defaults except where otherwise noted (the difference in clock speed from the system table amounts to sysfs reporting differences for the clock speed depending upon whether ACPI CPUFreq or AMD P-State was utilized).\n\nDozens of different benchmarks were carried out across these different power/performance configurations for this dual AMD EPYC 9755 server running Ubuntu 24.10 with the Linux 6.13 stable kernel. The CPU power consumption, thermals, and peak core frequency were monitored during each benchmark being run.",

Unlike RTX 50 Series GPUs which remained on the same TSMC 4N process as their predecessors, RX 9000 Series is expected to move away from RX 7000\u2019s TSMC 5N manufacturing. This should put both brands on a similar footing, leaving architectural differences to define efficiency.\n\nAccording to a rumour shared by leaker Hoang Anh Phu on X before being removed, AMD may target a 220W TBP (total board power) for RX 9070 non-XT and 304W for RX 9070 XT. While the tweet didn\u2019t mention the GPUs name, the frequency figure alongside this power claim is identical to the one we saw on previous RX 9070 XT rumours. And besides, AMD isn\u2019t planning many releases in the near future aside from these RDNA 4 GPUs.\n\nIf correct, this would mark a slight but welcome improvement compared to RX 7900 XTX\u2018s 355W and RX 7900 XT\u2018s 300W targets. 304W would put the RX 9070 XT head-to-head with Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5070 Ti, which is also expected to offer similar graphics performance. This is understandable since the underlying RDNA 4 architecture is seemingly also using TSMC\u2019s 4N node.\n\nVideoCardz also confirmed that the leaked PCIe 5.0 interface is correct, making RX 9000 as the third GPU series supporting it after Moore Threads\u2019 MTT S80 and Nvidia\u2019s RTX 50 Series. Likewise, the RX 9000 lineup is set to include the latest DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b video outputs.\n\nWith this, the specs of RX 9070 Series are complete, though not official. As things stand, RX 9070 XT is set to feature a 4,096-core Navi 48 chip clocked up to 2.97GHz, coupled with 16GB of GDDR6 memory running on a 256-bit bus. Radeon RX 9070 non-XT, on the other hand, leverages a cut-down Navi 48 chip packing 3,584 cores clocked up to 2.52GHz, also linked to 16GB of GDDR6 memory via a 256-bit bus.\n\nWe should have confirmation of these specs plus pricing on February 28 during AMD\u2019s announcement event.",

            "content": "The launch of AMD's RDNA 4 graphics cards appears imminent. A month after sparking interest with a weird announcement at CES and following confirmation of a March release window, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su narrowed that down to \u201cearly March\u201d during the recent Q4 2024 earnings call. Su stated that these cards will be available for purchase, not just pre-order, suggesting a full product launch by then.\n\nThis news somewhat corroborates the recent rumours of a dedicated AMD press briefing for the Radeon RX 9070 series in late February, a plan that now seems to be confirmed by Su's statement. Adding further credence to the timeline, Uniko's Hardware (via VideoCardz), citing a source, claims to have pinpointed the launch date to March 6th, echoing Su's \u201cearly March\u201d timeframe.\n\nIt's worth recalling that the launch was initially slated for January 23rd but was pushed back. While AMD remains officially silent on the matter, the fact that many reviewers have already received RX 9070 cards for testing and reports of retail availability suggests that preparations are well underway. This additional six-week lead time could translate to healthier stock levels for the Radeon RX 9070 series GPUs, addressing a common concern with previous Radeon launches. Finally, it's important to note Su's specific mention of the 9070 series, suggesting that the initial launch won't likely include any other GPUs.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia remains tight-lipped about its RTX 5070 series, the Radeon RX 9070's competitor. While previous reports point to a February 20th release for the RTX 5070 Ti, with the 5070 following later, no firm date for the latter has been officially announced. Unlike AMD, however, Nvidia has already revealed pricing for its upcoming cards, with the 5070 Ti expected to cost $749 and the 5070 to go for $549.\n\nDiscuss on our Facebook page, HERE.\n\nKitGuru says: Are you planning on upgrading your GPU soon?

            "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has been trading in an increasingly tight range over the last few weeks. Chances are, it will break out of this range at some point soon.\n\nOne way to profit from a breakout is via a strategy called a long straddle. It is constructed by buying an at-the-money call and an at-the-money put.\n\nBuying at-the-money options can be expensive. They will also suffer from time decay, meaning that they will lose a little bit of value with each day that passes if the stock doesn't make a big move.\n\nWith a long straddle, the further out in time the trade is placed, the slower the time decay. But the options are more expensive and require more capital.\n\nFor AMD stock, a long straddle could be placed by buying a 115-strike call and put for the May 16 expiration. The call was trading Wednesday around $9.75 and the put around $8.75.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices earnings are set for late April, so the May 16 options should hold their value fairly well, even if the stock stays flat.\n\nAMD Stock Trade Break-Even Level\n\nWhen we add the two together, the total cost of the trade would be around $18.50 per contract, or $1,850.\n\nThis is the total amount of risk in the trade and the maximum loss.\n\nCalculate the break-even prices by taking the strike price plus and minus the cost of the straddle.\n\nThat gives us break-even prices of 96.50 and 133.50. But profits can be made with a smaller move if the move comes earlier in the trade.\n\nFor example, the estimated break-even prices in mid-March are around 102 and 125.\n\nImplied Volatility Impacts AMD Stock Trade\n\nChanges to implied volatility will have a big impact on this trade and the interim break-even prices. So it's important to have a solid understanding of volatility before placing a trade like this.\n\nThe worst-case scenario with this AMD long straddle would be a stable stock price. That would see the call and put slowly lose value each day. For a long straddle, I usually set a stop loss at around 20% of capital at risk \u2014 that would be around $370 \u2014 and a profit target of around 40%.\n\nI would also look to close the trade by the end of March if a big move hasn't occurred by then.\n\nThe trade starts with theta of -11. That means it will lose roughly $11 per day from time decay, with all else being equal.\n\nAMD Stock Ratings Not So Great\n\nAccording to the IBD Stock Checkup, AMD stock is ranked No. 18 in its industry group. It has a Composite Rating of 60, an EPS Rating of 97 and a Relative Strength Rating of 11.\n\nIt's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.\n\nThis article is for education purposes only and not a trade recommendation.

There are two types: dry AMD that appears to be the more common type characterized by slow gradual loss of vision and wet AMD, characterized by sudden vision changes due to the growth of the abnormal blood vessel underneath the retina. The AMD drugs market focuses mainly on anti-VEGF therapies, such as Eylea and Lucentis for wet AMD, whereas new advances such as Syfovre (pegcetacoplan) and Izervay (avacincaptad pegol) give new hope to patients suffering from dry AMD, previously treated underrepresented within the disease.The significance of AMD drugs is that they delay disease progression. The anti-VEGF treatments with wet AMD work with the mechanism of inhibiting new abnormal blood vessels from growing; newer treatment options for dry AMD are focused on geographic atrophy and macular degeneration. Factors encouraging growth in the AMD drugs market include an aging population, lifestyle factors that contribute to increasing prevalence of AMD, and research discoveries that lead to novel therapies. Introducing new treatments, especially dry AMD, presents a better opportunity to advance outcomes for patients to be assured that there are great options available for preserving vision and improving quality of life for those affected.List of Prominent Players in the Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) Drugs Market:\u2022 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.

(US)Expert Knowledge, Just a Click Away:Market Dynamics:Drivers-The Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) drugs market shows a strong growth rate, with various primary factors encouraging the same. There is a rising prevalence of AMD globally, especially among growing older populations, due to unhealthy lifestyle issues such as dietary lapses, smoking, and inactivity. Improvements in drug development-approvals of new innovative therapies such as Pegcetacoplan (Syfovre) and Avacincaptad Pegol (IZERVAY)-for dry AMD, along with long-acting anti-VEGF treatments for wet AMD, are increasing options and leading to a better effectiveness in treatment. More aggressive reimbursement policies have made treatments more accessible, which encourages patients to continue prescribed regimens. The market is bound to expand in new emerging regions of Asia Pacific and Latin America, and higher investment in R&D for novel therapies will open opportunities. Public-private partnerships are helping innovate, and the patient-centric shift would raise more demand for treatment plans tailored to the individual's needs. This, in turn, improves satisfaction and adherence levels, thus giving impetus to further growth in the market.Challenges:The treatments for Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) have challenges that may impede growth and limit access for patients. Exorbitant treatment costs, particularly in anti-VEGF therapies including Eylea and Vabysmo, curb access and promote nonadherence because it is cheaper for patients to use the off-label preparation of the drug, while dry AMD has been undertreated for quite some time, thus limiting the scope of the market.Regional Trends:North American leadership in Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) drugs is linked with strong pharmaceutical R&D, driven by large firms and research organizations that focus on novel therapies. The levels of research spending are also very high, hence such fast-paced drug development and approval, such as in the case of Enzeevu, which is a biosimilar for wet AMD. Advanced healthcare infrastructure, with dedicated facilities and tools for diagnosis, is another reason for such effective care and early intervention in the region. This positive regulatory environment, in large part driven by the FDA's increased aggressiveness in approving new therapies, further underlines market growth. Improvement in reimbursement policies and public-private partnerships for greater accessibility and affordability for the patient also significantly contribute to adherence, spreading innovation, and bettering the overall treatment paradigm.Unlock Your GTM Strategy:Recent Developments:\u2022 In August 2023, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals announced that the U.S. FDA has approved EYLEA HD (aflibercept) 8 mg for treating wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), and diabetic retinopathy (DR).\u2022 In March 2022, Novartis announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Beovu\u00ae (brolucizumab) 6 mg for treating visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema (DME), marking its second EC-approved indication following wet age-related macular degeneration in 2020.Segmentation of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) Drugs Market-By Products:\u2022 Lucentis\u2022 Eylea & Eylea HD\u2022 Vabysmo\u2022 Syfovre\u2022 Other ProductsBy Molecules:\u2022 Ranibizumab\u2022 Aflibercept\u2022 Faricimab\u2022 Pegcetoplan\u2022 Other MoleculesBy Type of AMD:\u2022 Wet AMD\u2022 Dry AMDBy Approval type:\u2022 Biologic\u2022 BiosimilarBy End User:\u2022 Hospitals\u2022 Specialty Centers\u2022 Long-Term Care FacilitiesBy Region-North America-\u2022 The US\u2022 Canada\u2022 MexicoEurope-\u2022 Germany\u2022 The UK\u2022 France\u2022 Italy\u2022 Spain\u2022 Rest of EuropeAsia-Pacific-\u2022 China\u2022 Japan\u2022 India\u2022 South Korea\u2022 South East Asia\u2022 Rest of Asia PacificLatin America-\u2022 Brazil\u2022 Argentina\u2022 Rest of Latin AmericaMiddle East & Africa-\u2022 GCC Countries\u2022 South Africa\u2022 Rest of Middle East and AfricaAbout Us:InsightAce Analytic is a market research and consulting firm that enables clients to make strategic decisions.

            "content": "Intel has faced severe financial and execution woes over the past couple of years, leading to all types of speculation about the future of the company, with the most recent rumors pointing to Broadcom's interest in taking over Intel's product business, as well as an alleged U.S. government intention to make TSMC run Intel Foundry manufacturing operations in a joint venture between Intel and the Taiwanese contract chipmaker. But there is an obstacle that many people overlook: the broad cross-licensing agreement between Intel and AMD, as observed by Digits-to-Dollars.\n\nAMD and Intel have a broad cross-licensing agreement (in fact, multiple agreements, with the most recent signed in 2009) that allows both companies to use each other's patents while preventing lawsuits over possible infringements. This covers their entire portfolios, including CPUs, GPUs, and other innovations. AMD can produce x86-based processors with Intel's instruction set extensions, while Intel can incorporate AMD's innovations into its own CPUs.\n\nHowever, neither can develop processors that work with the other's sockets or motherboards., and the agreement has strict conditions for termination. If either company merges, is acquired, or enters a joint venture that alters ownership, the deal ends immediately. In the event of one of these triggers, the two companies must negotiate a new licensing arrangement.\n\nAlthough some market observers tie the AMD and Intel cross-licensing agreement directly to the 1976 agreement concerning the x86 instruction set architecture (ISA), this is not the case. The agreements include a variety of extensions to x86 (such as SSE and AVX) as well as other innovations that are inseparable parts of today's CPUs. While it is possible to build an x86 CPU without AVX, SSE, or other extensions, such processors will not be able to compete against modern counterparts. Thus, losing the license could be devastating to both AMD and Intel.\n\nIn addition to the x86 ISA and extensions, the broad cross-licensing agreement between the two companies covers other technologies, including GPUs, DPUs, and FPGAs. Therefore, if the agreement were terminated, it would affect virtually all of AMD and Intel\u2019s products, necessitating a renegotiation of the cross-licensing agreement.\n\nCompanies in the high-tech industry tend to sign broad cross-licensing agreements, but a big question is whether AMD is actually interested in signing such an agreement with Broadcom. Historically, Broadcom was primarily known for networking solutions and wireless technologies, but today the company is a major player in the storage, cybersecurity, and infrastructure software markets. Perhaps more importantly, it has emerged as a leading developer of custom AI processors, collaborating with virtually all major cloud service providers and hyperscalers. Acquiring CPU capabilities would make Broadcom a formidable competitor for AMD. At present, Broadcom, armed with both CPUs and AI processors, poses a greater competitive threat to AMD than Intel, the latter of which lacks a clear AI strategy.\n\nWhile Digits-to-Dollars suggests that AMD could ask Broadcom to help counter Nvidia\u2019s dominance in the AI market by creating \"AMD-friendly\" networking interfaces and connectivity solutions, Broadcom\u2019s priority appears to be strengthening its position in the data center market, where it currently lacks CPUs. Once the company acquires a general-purpose data center processor business \u2014 further strengthened by Intel's large client PC processor volumes \u2014 it will likely focus on developing its own AI data center platform consisting of CPUs and ASICs, rather than assisting AMD in competing with Nvidia. Of course, an industry-standard platform centered around open standards like Ultra Ethernet could make life easier for both AMD and Broadcom in their fight against Nvidia. However, competing with Broadcom will be more challenging for AMD than competing with Intel.",

(NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other most promising technology stocks to buy now.\n\nThe global technology sector is on track for strong earnings growth in 2025, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and semiconductors. Despite macroeconomic uncertainties, tech companies have demonstrated resilience, leveraging innovation to sustain revenue and profit expansion. Analysts anticipate substantial earnings growth across the sector, reflecting solid fundamentals and continued investment in transformative technologies.\n\nAccording to a December 2024 report by John Butters, Vice President and Senior Earnings Analyst at FactSet, earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to grow by approximately 15% in 2025, with the information technology (IT) sector playing a crucial role in this expansion. Notably, all eleven sectors of the S&P 500 are projected to see year-over-year earnings growth, with six\u2014including IT\u2014expected to achieve double-digit increases. The report also emphasizes an interesting shift which is occurring outside of the \u201cMagnificent 7,\u201d the group of mega-cap tech companies that have historically driven market performance. While analysts forecast a 21% earnings growth for the Magnificent 7 in 2025, they also predict a significant improvement in earnings for the other 493 companies in the S&P 500, projecting a 13% increase. This represents a considerable jump from the mere 4% earnings growth expected for these same companies in 2024, signaling broader market participation in 2025.\n\nShifting Investor Focus Beyond Mega-Cap Tech\n\nAlthough the Magnificent 7 continue to dominate the market, investor sentiment suggests a growing shift toward smaller, high-growth tech firms. Gene Munster, Managing Partner at Deepwater Asset Management, highlighted in a recent CNBC interview that while large-cap tech remains fundamentally strong, smaller companies within the \u201cfrontier tech\u201d sector\u2014typically valued below $500 billion\u2014are poised to outperform over the next few years. This shift stems from concerns that trillion-dollar companies may have limited potential for high-percentage gains, prompting investors to explore smaller opportunities in AI, cloud infrastructure, and semiconductor equipment manufacturing.\n\nA report from Deloitte\u2019s 2025 Technology Industry Outlook reinforces the growth trajectory of the sector. Despite economic headwinds, technology investments are expected to accelerate, with increased spending on AI, cybersecurity, and enterprise software. Cybersecurity will be a critical focus as the digital attack surface expands due to the rise of IoT, generative AI, and cloud adoption. The global cost of cybercrime is projected to reach a staggering $10.5 trillion in 2025, emphasizing the need for heightened security investments.\n\nStory Continues",

This was merely above 1% in February 2024, and it has now gone to 10.26% as of January 2025. If you think this is crazy, then you should also see the RX 7600 stats, which now show a 35.16% share when we consider AMD Radeon GPUs.\n\nImage Credit: danawa.com\n\nThese are just a small glimpse of what 2025 has brought us, and this couldn't have been possible without NVIDIA's aid. If you think AMD is able to increase its GPU market share due to 'better' GPUs, then you are wrong. It's simply because NVIDIA's RTX GPUs are almost invisible in the market\u2014not just in Korea but also in various parts of the world.\n\nIf you visit popular retailers such as Amazon, Newegg, Best Buy, etc., you will understand what we are talking about. It's hard to find RTX 40 series GPUs, let alone RTX 50 series GPUs, particularly high-end ones, starting with the 70-class cards. AMD still has a decent supply of RX 7000 GPUs, as well as some from the RX 6000 series.\n\nImage Credit: danawa.com\n\nThe same is seen in the Korean DIY market, where AMD has reached a good 14.65% market share in January 2025. This is almost twice as compared to the 7.69% GPU market share in Feb 2024. The surprising part is that the trend is just getting started. With a a 14.22% GPU market share in the first week of January, AMD has gained up to 20.8% in the first week of February this year. As per Danawa Research, this is the highest it has ever recorded since the compilation of these stats.\n\nImage Credit: danawa.com\n\nAMD and Intel have also seen a good GPU market increase this year, reaching 1.2% total GPU market share. On paper, it seems really low, but look at the stats for the months of 2024. Intel was just at 0.09% at the start of 2024. All of this has resulted in a decline in NVIDIA's GPU market share, which used to be over 90% but now is at just 84.16%.\n\nIt's unclear how long this trend will continue, but it may continue until NVIDIA can provide its latest RTX 50 series GPUs to consumers according to the demand.\n\nNews Source: Danawa",

Unfortunately, none are currently planned. The ASUS ROG Flow Z13 review sampling appears to have been very limited and I wasn't offered any review samples. With pricing on the ASUS ROG Flow Z13 starting out at $2,099.99 USD, this initial launch model is very expensive... With the state of the ad industry and ad-block use among readers, I don't plan on buying the laptop for Linux testing.\n\nWe'll see what other AMD Ryzen AI MAX laptops come down the like but for now don't count on any Linux reviews/benchmarks, unfortunately, The AMD Ryzen AI MAX SoCs themselves should work fine under Linux for delivering great CPU and GPU performance. The caveats are just the typical issues you may need to worry about for laptop power management, touchpad / keyboard quirks, and other extra laptop features potentially not working out nicely under Linux. At least once any of those laptop issues are out of the way, the Ryzen AI MAX should be roaring on Linux going off by what we've seen out of the Ryzen AI 300 series and other Zen 5 hardware on Linux.If you end up picking up an AMD Ryzen AI MAX laptop, be sure to share your experiences in the Phoronix Forums for how well it's working and what the Linux performance is looking like especially for non-gaming/technical workloads.",

And presumably the hope for Team Red is that this could dampen the enthusiasm for Nvidia\u2019s graphics cards as they hit the shelves.\n\n(Image credit: PowerColor)\n\nAnalysis: Pricing cards on the table, please, AMD\n\nOf course, all this depends on how these reviews pan out, and the rival graphics cards actually stack up to each other. But thus far, the leaks around the RX 9070 paint a promising picture, and you\u2019ve got to think AMD must be reasonably confident to have set up an (almost) head-to-head launch here.\n\nAt any rate, I can\u2019t wait to find out, and obviously I\u2019m not alone there \u2013 anyone looking for a good mid-ranger at a (relatively) more affordable price is doubtless as keen as I am to discover where the final performance of these AMD and Nvidia GPUs will lie.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

It isn't unusual for some listed prices for PC hardware at online retailers to drop far below retail price by mistake (with some orders still honored at that price), but this is a different case as it's a legitimate price drop in-store for whoever grabs it first.\n\nA similar discount was available on Intel's i5 14600K which dropped to an insane $77.25 down from $309 (\u00a3229.99 / AU$419.99) - this packs 14 cores and 20 threads, ideal for gaming and multitasking duties. The Redditor didn\u2019t specify which Walmart store this was at, and there\u2019s sadly no sign of such deep price cuts making their way to online retailers - as much as I would love to see that.\n\nIf only this could happen to GPUs...\n\nOver on the GPU side of things, Nvidia's RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 are already out in the wild, but you're probably not going to find any of them at MSRP thanks to scalpers and an extremely limited supply.\n\nThe rest of the RTX 5000 lineup is fast approaching, with the RTX 5070 Ti confirmed to be launching on February 20 and the RTX 5070 following on March 5 - these will go up against AMD's Radeon RX 9000 series cards which are also due to launch in early March, and given the current state of the market, I'd imagine the scalpers will be hard at \u2018work\u2019 again.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

The challenge of implementing AI has rapidly moved from problems with the algorithms to issues with the data \u00e2\u20ac\u201c finding and selecting the data needed to build an application that uses AI to make accurate predictions, governing sensitive data so an app can use AI to only provide the data that is appropriate for a given user and purpose, and ensuring data is fresh and accurate, so that the AI applications give customers correct information using the latest-breaking changes. Those who look to best support their AI innovation by leveraging solutions that treat data challenges will come out on top. In addition, we believe that moving AI projects from lab to production, will require process redesign capabilities and change management skills.\n\nDell Technologies CEO: Michael Dell Dell Tenure: 41 Years Has Been Dell CEO For: 41 Years In 2025, businesses will continue to grapple with AI adoption, surging data volumes and an evolving workforce. Customers need solutions that remove complexity so they can focus on their core mission. This is where collaboration with our trusted partner ecosystem will play a central role. By combining innovative technology with partners\u2019 expertise, we will simplify adoption and offer flexible, scalable and secure solutions to address critical business needs.\n\nIBM CEO: Arvind Krishna IBM Tenure: 34 Years Has Been IBM CEO For: 5 Years For customers, demonstrating significant ROI from AI will be essential to building the institutional confidence to scale the technology across their business. As they scale, they can both improve productivity and begin to create new business models, new revenue streams, and drive enduring growth. The alignment between business strategy and technology strategy is a key priority \u2014 deciding what they want to do and then focusing tightly on the right use cases. With the correct strategy in place, they can better understand, map, and measure what the return on investment and value from AI will be. It\u2019s also important to note that as AI becomes pervasive, job roles from entry level to the executive suite will change along with organizational structures and even entire industries. Company leaders must be willing to change and move with this disruption. They must consider how to engage and bring their people on the journey, how to drive adoption, and how to give employees the skills, confidence and ability to use this technology in their work.\n\nAMD CEO: Lisa Su AMD Tenure: 13 Years Has Been AMD CEO For: 11 Years The toughest challenge facing customers is the rapid pace of change. As technology advances, cutting-edge solutions like AI are essential to scaling business. However, new technologies also bring significant complexity and the need for business process innovation. We are committed to working closely with partners to help customers leverage end-to-end AI and high-performance computing solutions to navigate these changes.\n\nNutanix CEO: Rajiv Ramaswami Nutanix Tenure: 5 Years Has Been Nutanix CEO For: 5 Years One of the toughest challenges facing our customers is around understanding how AI can deliver business value and effectively unlocking the ROI in AI initiatives. Many organizations are working to bring strategic expectations around AI projects in line with budgets. Customers are also grappling with how to simplify how they run their applications and manage data in a hybrid multicloud world. Customers want deployment flexibility and one platform to run applications and data anywhere they need it, especially as IT complexity has continued to increase. Our software-defined architecture adapts to various hardware and cloud options to provide consistent operations and data services across cloud, edge, and core environments. Lastly, we continue to hear from our customers that they are thinking through their strategy going forward to reduce their risk following the Broadcom acquisition. Many VMware customers have concerns about pricing, lack of support, and a decreased focus on innovation. As customers are seeking to modernize their IT infrastructure, the decision to migrate away from VMware is well-timed as it provides an opportunity to future-proof their application strategies, especially as technologies like GenAI take hold.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) CEO: Antonio Neri HPE Tenure: 30 Years Has Been HPE CEO For: 7 Years Customers and partners will continue to explore AI use cases for their businesses with an increasing pressure to move from experimentation to adoption. HPE and our partners are well positioned to help customers easily test proofs of concept and deploy them into production to solve this challenge. Our new turnkey HPE Private Cloud AI is a first-of-its-kind solution that provides deep integration with Nvidia AI computing, networking and software with HPE's AI storage, compute, and the HPE GreenLake cloud. The offering enables enterprises of every size to gain an energy-efficient, fast, and flexible path for sustainably developing and deploying generative AI applications.\n\nRed Hat CEO: Matt Hicks Red Hat Tenure: 20 Years Has Been Red Hat CEO For: 3 Years A major challenge for many customers will be the high price of innovation and the financial realities of investing in and implementing an AI strategy. For instance, training a single, general purpose large language model requires a lot of resources, with the largest AI models demanding some 10,000 GPUs and those models may already be out of date. In fact, research shows that by 2026, the cost of training frontier AI models will be equivalent to the US GDP which is $22 trillion. It should come as no surprise that the average CIO doesn't have a US GDP-level IT budget, nor do they have thousands of spare GPUs lying around. For Red Hat, the answer lies in optimized, built-to-purpose, and smaller, AI models driven by open source. If we look back on how the industry has evolved over the years, CIOs have long been moving away from monolithic technologies, starting with the shift from UNIX to Linux in the early 2000s. The industry is at a similar turning point now with huge, monolithic AI models taking center stage. So, the challenge for customers becomes exploring the options at their disposal for AI, understanding the associated costs of implementing and maintaining the technologies as well as necessary skills to do so, all while paving the way for the future of their business.\n\nLenovo CEO: Yuanqing Yang Lenovo Tenure: 20 Years Has Been Lenovo CEO For: 36 Years Sixty-one percent of CIOs find it challenging to demonstrate ROI from their AI investments or don't believe their organization has the proper skills to deploy AI. Many CIOs expect to wait two to three years to show any ROI. As AI innovators, it is our role to help demonstrate the value of AI and how we can deploy the technology at speed with our partners.\n\nExtreme Networks CEO: Ed Meyercord Extreme Networks Tenure: 10 Years Has Been Extreme Networks CEO For: 16 Years In a survey we conducted late last year of 200 CIOs and senior IT buyers, they told us their overwhelming focus is to improve the security of connected devices, while harnessing AI for tangible, ROI-focused use cases. The toughest challenges in 2025 will be managing and securing complex network architectures, addressing increasing cyber threats and smoothly and securely deploying AI. Extreme Platform ONE aims to address these challenges by integrating networking, security and AI solutions into a single framework, simplifying network management and enhancing security. The other significant challenge is AI and trust. At Extreme, we're focused on helping customers adopt AI at the pace of trust. There is no one size fits all with AI. We are working with customers and partners to help drive AI at a pace that they feel comfortable with and that is the beauty with the flexibility of Platform ONE, we can do that in a way that is meaningful and impactful.",

Plus the public code drops for openSIL only come in intervals and at this stage not with the flow of internal development. One of the topics I had been wondering about myself had been the Phoenix client SoCs and Turin (EPYC 9005 series) proof-of-concept code given prior presentations on AMD openSIL pegged it for release before the end of the 2024 calendar year.\n\n\"I appreciate all of the interest and passionate inquiries regarding the openSIL Proof-Of-Concept code releases.\n\n\n\nPlease know we are hard at work preparing the Phoenix and Turin POC\u2019s for public release.\n\n\n\nAlso, please be reminded that these POC projects are being made as sample code (a preview of future production worthy code releases) and are not intended or suitable for production implementations.\"\n\nHalf-way through Q1-2025 we haven't seen the AMD openSIL release yet for Phoenix or Turin. But someone else also was wondering and managed to receive an update as to the Turin and Phoenix PoC release:So it's still coming. Unfortunate the slip from the Q4-2024 target but delays happen especially when it's for a milestone not materially significant to the company. It's ultimately insignificant as long as the overall AMD openSIL roadmap remains on track for production readiness with Zen 6. The AMD proof-of-concept releases also tend to be limited to one or two reference motherboards as well so the experimental use of openSIL for Phoenix and Turin is limited as well beyond being a milestone to celebrate for open-source AMD initiatives.",

Recent rumors suggest that the \"blue team\" is quietly developing the next-generation Celestial GPU, which promises to be a formidable rival to Nvidia and AMD.\n\nLeaked sources indicate that the Arc Celestial will be built on the brand-new Xe3P architecture, rather than the previous Xe3. Notably, Intel may manufacture Celestial chips in-house using its internal INTC process instead of relying on TSMC, as it has in the past. This shift would allow Intel to have greater control over chip quality and supply while reducing dependence on external partners.\n\nThe Xe3P architecture is expected to deliver superior performance and improved power efficiency compared to previous generations. Additionally, new technologies such as AI-powered enhancements, advanced data processing, and frame generation could be integrated, unlocking significant potential for Intel\u2019s next-gen graphics cards.\n\nCurrently, Nvidia continues to dominate the GPU market, while AMD is working to close the gap. Although Intel's mid-range Battlemage GPUs have provided consumers with more choices, they have yet to pose a serious threat to the two industry giants.\n\nCould Celestial be Intel\u2019s secret weapon to dethrone Nvidia? While it's too early to say for sure, these rumors have already sparked excitement in the tech community. A more intense GPU market competition will undoubtedly benefit consumers with better products and more competitive pricing.\n\nAnd as always, if you are looking to elevate your next gaming experience, check out our comparator for the best offer on the Intel Core Ultra 7 200 CPU today.",

One lucky gamer was able to get an incredible deal at their local Walmart store, purchasing an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D gaming CPU for just $99.75. That\u2019s a huge 88% discount on the 7800X3D\u2019s $449 MSRP, saving this buyer a massive $350.\n\nThis AMD processor is a firm favorite of ours, featuring in our best gaming CPU guide as our top choice until the 9800X3D dethroned it. It\u2019s still our number two choice, however, and offers a huge amount of power and performance for gaming, thanks in large part to its 3D V-Cache technology.\n\nThe story of this incredible bargain came via a Reddit post on the r/pcmasterrace subreddit. According to OP Global-Pickle5818, this particular Walmart store is closing down its PC component section, so the huge retailer was putting big discounts on PC stock to clear it out quickly. At least four 7800X3D\u2019s were available at the $99 pricing, with this lucky gamer managing to pick up two of them at the hugely discounted price.\n\nThe picture shared by Global-Pickle5818 also shows a price tag for an Intel Core i9 14600K for $77.25, and that CPU currently sells for $239.99 on Newegg. While that processor appears to be out of stock here, judging from the picture, it\u2019s further proof that this Walmart went seriously hard on discounts in order to clear out this PC stock as soon as possible.\n\nAll in all, this is one very lucky, and very rare, success story, and congratulations to Global-Pickle5818 for their find.\n\nWhile you\u2019re unlikely to grab a $99 AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D any time soon, this is a good reminder that the best places to find discounts can often be in your local stores, rather than online. The next time your local Walmart has a sale or unfortunately closes down, it might be worth a quick look in, just to make sure you don\u2019t miss out on any mega-discounts like this one.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about building a new gaming PC, few options are as good as a 7800X3D for performance. Check out our 7800X3D review for our thoughts on this near-perfect processor, as well as our 9800X3D review to see how well its newer, more powerful sibling performs in our real world tests.\n\nYou can also follow us on Google News for daily PC hardware news, reviews, and guides, or join our community Discord to stay in the know.",

            "content": "As I wrote in my PC Performance Analysis, Avowed is one of the few games that can use more than 8 CPU threads. So, I wondered whether the game would run faster with a fully unlocked AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D. And the answer is yes.\n\nBut what do I mean by saying a \u201cfully unlocked\u201d AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D? Since upgrading our main PC gaming system to an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D, we have disabled its second CCD. That\u2019s the CCD that does not have a 3D V-Cache. The reason I\u2019ve disabled it is because some games can use by default the second CCD, something that will hinder performance. Plus, a lot of games could not take advantage of more than 6 CPU cores, so there was no point in running the CPU with both CCDs. Things though may soon change.\n\nBefore continuing, here are the specs of our PC gaming system.\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D\n\nGigabyte Motherboard X670E AORUS MASTER\n\nG.Skill Trident Z5 Neo RGB 32GB DDR5 RAM at 6000Mhz\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Founder\u2019s Edition\n\nCorsair PSU HX Series 1200W\n\nWindows 10 64-bit\n\nNVIDIA GeForce 572.16 WHQL driver\n\nSo after unlocking the second CCD, I tried running Avowed. And, to no one\u2019s surprise, the game defaulted to the second CCD. Thankfully, though, there is a program that allows you to prioritize the CCD with the 3D V-Cache. This program is called \u201cvcache-tray\u201d, and I highly recommend downloading it. And yes, it works.\n\nHere is a screenshot at 720p/Epic Settings/No RT. The first six CPU cores are those of CCD0 (that\u2019s the CCD with the 3D V-Cache) and the six bottom CPU cores (CPU9-CPU16) are those of CCD1.\n\nNow the good news is that in our CPU-bound scene, we saw a 15% performance increase over the 8cores/8threads configuration. That\u2019s a pretty healthy performance boost. Compared to the 8cores/16threads config, we only see an 8-9% performance boost. Still, this is one of the rare cases in which a game runs noticeably faster on an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D when using both of its CCDs. You can also see that the game used the 7950X3D at around 74% (so there is still room for improvement here).\n\nI\u2019ve also tried Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. And yes, this is another game that benefits from the two CCDs of the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D. Without SMT, my minimum framerate increased from 92FPS to 115FPS (that\u2019s a 25% performance increase). The performance difference between the 8cores/16threads and 16threads/16threads configs is around 13%. Pretty solid results in my opinion.\n\nSo there you have it. To be honest, I\u2019m pretty impressed with the CPU scaling of Avowed. After all, this is an Unreal Engine 5 game. A lot of people have criticized this engine. But, in the right hands, UE5 can scale incredibly well.\n\nStay tuned for more!",

Under the leadership of Thomas Caulfield, who became CEO in 2018, GlobalFoundries pursued a strategy that led it to become the third-largest semiconductor foundry by revenue, and a public listing in 2021.\n\nHowever, speculation is currently brewing that Caulfield could be set to become the next CEO of AMD\u2019s long time chip rival, Intel. As reported by eeNews Europe, the rumors began following an unexpected leadership change at GlobalFoundries. Caulfield is set to move from CEO to executive chairman, with Tim Breen, who has also been at the company since 2018, taking over as CEO. This shift has led observers to question whether Caulfield may be preparing for a leadership role at Intel, which has been without a permanent CEO since Pat Gelsinger\u2019s departure in December 2024.\n\nRegulatory hurdles\n\nCaulfield has extensive experience in semiconductor manufacturing but has not led a product company like Intel. This has fueled suggestions that instead of simply taking over as CEO, he could oversee a merger between Intel and GloFo. In such a scenario, eeNews Europe suggests that Caulfield would become executive chair of the combined entity, with Michelle Johnston Holthaus leading Intel\u2019s product business and Breen integrating GlobalFoundries into Intel Foundry.\n\nA merger would definitely benefit both parties. While AMD has seen its fortunes soar in recent times, intel has been struggling. Joining forces with GlobalFoundries could allow the merged company to offer a broader range of manufacturing capabilities.\n\nAdding further fuel to the rumor mill, eeNews Europe reports that observers on a Reddit stream noted a recent purchase of 8,913,000 Intel shares at $19.29. This unusual transaction occurred two days before GlobalFoundries announced its leadership changes, drawing comparisons to the $172 million stock incentive given to Gelsinger when he became Intel\u2019s CEO in 2021.\n\nAny potential merger would of course face regulatory hurdles, particularly in China, which previously blocked Intel\u2019s attempt to acquire Tower Semiconductor. If approval proves difficult, eeNews Europe suggests Intel could appoint Caulfield as CEO while maintaining close ties with GlobalFoundries.\n\nAre you a pro?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other semiconductor stocks.\n\nThe semiconductor industry has always been a battleground for technological development, though lately, it has turned into a full-scale battle. The US and China are not only vying to outpace each other in the race to achieve AI superiority but are also actively trying to slow each other down.\n\nThe US for instance has placed a number of export restrictions on global firms selling semiconductor technologies to China. Many leading US companies have had to deal with declining China sales as a result of these restrictions. On the other hand, China is trying its best to come up with technologies that compete with those in the US, despite restrictions.\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek AI at the end of January was a wake-up call for the Americans, with China building its latest AI model for a fraction of the cost that the US counterparts spend on their models. While the validity of these claims is debatable, it does show how far China has come when it comes to competing with the US.\n\nAs a result of the DeepSeek AI announcement, many semiconductor stocks took a big hit. Two weeks later, some of the stocks started recovering and investors started feeling comfortable with the thought of continued technological dominance by the US. We therefore decided to look at the semi-stocks that were making a comeback from the DeepSeek dip.\n\nTo come up with the list of 15 semiconductor stocks making a comeback from DeepSeek AI dip, we only considered stocks with a market cap of at least $10 billion that beat the S&P 500 in the last 5 days of trading.\n\nIs Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) the Most Oversold S&P 500 Stock in 2024?\n\nA close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor company that operates in embedded, client, data center, and gaming segments. It provides AI accelerators, GPUs as standalone devices, data processing units, embedded processors, and other products. The stock is up 4.26% in the last 5 trading days against the S&P 500\u2019s 1.13% gains. However, this hardly matters to investors who are down 37% in a year despite other semiconductor stocks posting enormous gains due to AI spending.\n\nThe recent optimism stems from the fact that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) continues to gain microprocessor market share over rival Intel. The increasing PC and server demand means AMD\u2019s market share grew from 21.6% to 22.1% QoQ. According to Citi\u2019s historical data, Intel\u2019s 67.4% market share is now the lowest since 2002.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Weekend Roundup: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk has recently been in the news for his vain attempt to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, but that\u2019s not all. It has recently come to light that Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company, xAI, is canvassing potential investors for a roughly $10 billion funding round. This could value the company at an estimated $75 billion.\n\nAccording to media reports, existing investors, including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and Valor Equity Partners, are in discussions to participate in the transaction. However, the terms of the round aren\u2019t finalized yet and may change.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Analysts Are Watching: Latest Ratings and News and Top 14 AI Stocks on Wall Street: News and Analyst Ratings\n\nAccording to data compiled by PitchBook, xAI was last valued at $51 billion. The startup was launched by Musk in 2023, a rival to OpenAI. xAI has recently revealed that Grok3, its AI chatbot, is in the final stages of development and will be released in a week or two.\n\n\u201cGrok 3 has very powerful reasoning capabilities, so in the tests that we\u2019ve done thus far, Grok 3 is outperforming anything that\u2019s been released, that we\u2019re aware of, so that\u2019s a good sign\u201d.\n\nWith the competition in the AI world heating up fast, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has recently revealed its plans around GPT-5, and how the company is going to work on simplifying its offerings. He stated that he realizes how the company\u2019s models and product offerings are getting complicated, bringing a solution for user ease.\n\n\u201cWe hate the model picker as much as you do and want to return to magic unified intelligence\u201d.\n\nCurrently, users are required to manually select various AI models for different tasks. According to Altman, GPT-4.5, internally known as Orion, will be the company\u2019s final \u201cnon-chain-of-thought model.\u201d After its release, the company will unify o-series and GPT-series models.\n\nIt will do so by offering a system that can use all of its features and determine when to take more or less time to think. The GPT-5 model will be launched as a comprehensive AI system that will incorporate o3 along with other technologies.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory Continues",

For this purpose, we first want to outline the single precision FLOPs each iGPU offers. Intel's Arc and AMD's Radeon series are based on entirely different architectures and despite the FLOPS of the Radeon iGPU being higher, it doesn't necessarily mean that the Radeon iGPU will be faster. But with that said, the following is how the two chips compare:\n\nSingle Precision Flops \"FP32\" (Higher is Better) GFLOPS 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 OneXPlayer X1 Pro (Radeon 890M) 7492 MSI Prestige A16 AI+ A3HM (Radeon 880M) 6037 MSI Prestige AI EVO 16 B2HMG (Arc 140T) 4790 ASUS Zenbook S14 (Arc 140V) 3982\n\nIn 3DMark Speed Way, we see the Radeon iGPU narrowly beating the Alchemist+ iGPU. Speed Way is a very intensive benchmark that uses ray tracing so Intel at least needs to work on some GPU-centric optimizations here.\n\n3DMark Speed Way (Higher is Better) Overall Score 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 ASUS Zenbook S14 (Arc 140V) 896 OneXPlayer X1 Pro (Radeon 890M) 537 MSI Prestige A16 AI+ A3HM (Radeon 880M) 511 MSI Prestige AI EVO 16 B2HMG (Arc 140T) 479\n\nFor 3DMark Steel Nomad, we get to see our first non-RT performance of the Intel iGPU and here the blue team leads by a massive 40.6%.\n\n3DMark Steel Nomad (Higher is Better) Overall Score 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 MSI Prestige AI EVO 16 B2HMG (Arc 140T) 827 ASUS Zenbook S14 (Arc 140V) 823 OneXPlayer X1 Pro (Radeon 890M) 588 MSI Prestige A16 AI+ A3HM (Radeon 880M) 524\n\nIn 3DMark Port Royal, Intel's Arc iGPUs offer a 27.4% lead over the fastest Radeon iGPU. This is a ray tracing-heavy benchmark and goes off to show that the results we saw in the Speed Way test are an anomaly, something that you will also notice in the gaming tests.\n\n3DMark Port Royal (Higher is Better) Overall Score 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 ASUS Zenbook S14 (Arc 140V) 2146 MSI Prestige AI EVO 16 B2HMG (Arc 140T) 1843 OneXPlayer X1 Pro (Radeon 890M) 1684 MSI Prestige A16 AI+ A3HM (Radeon 880M) 1515\n\nIn 3DMark Time Spy, the AMD Radeon 890M iGPU is 6% faster than the Radeon 880M.\n\n3DMark Time Spy (Higher is Better) Overall Score Graphics Score CPU Score 0 4000 8000 12000 16000 20000 24000 0 4000 8000 12000 16000 20000 24000 ASUS Zenbook S14 (Arc 140V) 4396 4112 7238 MSI Prestige AI EVO 16 B2HMG (Arc 140T) 4447 4047 10136 OneXPlayer X1 Pro (Radeon 890M) 3489 3150 8944 MSI Prestige A16 AI+ A3HM (Radeon 880M) 3297 2965 9024\n\nFor Fire Strike, Intel offers great performance even on DX11 APIs, which is a good showcase as many games still run DX11. The Radeon 890M ends up 5.5% faster than the Radeon 880M here.\n\n3DMark Fire Strike (Higher is Better) Overall Score Graphics Score Physics Score 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 30000 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 30000 ASUS Zenbook S14 (Arc 140V) 9153 10138 22169 MSI Prestige AI EVO 16 B2HMG (Arc 140T) 8315 8902 27466 OneXPlayer X1 Pro (Radeon 890M) 7657 8291 24392 MSI Prestige A16 AI+ A3HM (Radeon 880M) 7322 7866 23949\n\nLastly, we have 3DMark Night Raid where Intel scores another comfortable lead with its new Arc 140T iGPU. Once again, the Radeon 890M offers 6% better performance than the Radeon 880M.\n\n3DMark Night Raid (Higher is Better) Overall Score Graphics Score CPU Score 0 9000 18000 27000 36000 45000 54000 0 9000 18000 27000 36000 45000 54000 ASUS Zenbook S14 (Arc 140V) 35222 46927 14595 MSI Prestige AI EVO 16 B2HMG (Arc 140T) 32715 40055 16050 OneXPlayer X1 Pro (Radeon 890M) 28717 36909 12720 MSI Prestige A16 AI+ A3HM (Radeon 880M) 27742 34860 12861\n\nOneXPlayer X1 Pro Gaming Handheld - HD Gaming Performance\n\nWith the synthetic performance out of the way, we can start taking a look at pure gaming numbers and we start off our testing spree with Cyberpunk 2077 running at Medium Preset at 1200P. With Balanced XeSS/FSR upscaling, we can see that while the upscaling-only results for the Radeon 890M are a bit behind, with frame-gen, you can see performance parity with Intel's top iGPU-solutions, a fantastic result for a 30W only scenario.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 (1200P, Medium Preset) Average FPS (Balanced Upscaling) Average FPS (Balanced FSR Frame-Gen) 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 ASUS Zenbook S14 (Arc 140V XeSS) 55.64 76.55 OneXPlayer X1 Pro (Radeon 890M FSR) 46.75 76.30 MSI Prestige AI EVO 16 B2HMG (Arc 140T XeSS) 45.02 63.50 MSI Prestige A16 AI+ A3HM (Radeon 880M FSR) 40.15 59.93\n\nIn Forza Horizon 5, we only ran the game using Quality Upscaling at the Medium Preset at 1200P, and the Radeon 890M offered the fastest performance of all the iGPUs tested with a 27% gain over the Radeon 880M and a 14% gain over the Arc solutions.\n\nForza Horizon 5 (1200p, Medium, Quality Upscaling) Average FPS 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 OneXPlayer X1 Pro (Radeon 890M FSR) 71 MSI Prestige AI EVO 16 B2HMG (Arc 140T XeSS) 62 ASUS Zenbook S14 (Arc 140V XeSS) 61 MSI Prestige A16 AI+ A3HM (Radeon 880M FSR) 56\n\nIn F1 24, AMD's Radeon 890M once again offers a strong uplift over the Radeon 880M with a 40% gain in both upscaling and frame-gen scenarios.\n\nF1 24 (1200P, High Preset) Average FPS (Balanced Upscaling) Average FPS (Balanced Frame-Gen) 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 OneXPlayer X1 Pro (Radeon 890M FSR) 59 96 ASUS Zenbook S14 (Arc 140V XeSS) 54 81 MSI Prestige AI EVO 16 B2HMG (Arc 140T XeSS) 54 80 MSI Prestige A16 AI+ A3HM (Radeon 880M FSR) 42 69\n\nIn Horizon Zero Dawn at the \"Favor Quality\" preset, we used the FSR 2 upscaling set to Balanced. Here, the Radeon 890M delivers up to 58 FPS, once again showcasing the fastest iGPU performance in this particular title.\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn (1200p, Favor Quality, FSR2 On) Average FPS 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 OneXPlayer X1 Pro (Radeon 890M) 58 MSI Prestige A16 AI+ A3HM (Radeon 880M) 56 MSI Prestige AI EVO 16 B2HMG (Arc 140T) 51 ASUS Zenbook S14 (Arc 140V XeSS) 46\n\nMetro Exodus also runs great on the Arc 140T, offering the bare minimum 30 FPS with RT enabled at 1080P at the high preset while the Radeon 880M struggles to reach the 30 FPS mark & the same was the case with the Radeon 890M.\n\nMetro Exodus (1080p, High Preset, RT Normal) Average FPS 0 6 12 18 24 30 36 0 6 12 18 24 30 36 MSI Prestige AI EVO 16 B2HMG (Arc 140T) 30.47 ASUS Zenbook S14 (Arc 140V) 28.30 OneXPlayer X1 Pro (Radeon 890M) 23.33 MSI Prestige A16 AI+ A3HM (Radeon 880M) 22.19\n\nLastly, we have The Callisto Protocol where both iGPUs are very similar in performance but offer FPS in the mid-30s range even with FSR 2 enabled. It would be better to lower the resolution to get a better playing experience but still, over 30 FPS is decent for these iGPUs.\n\nThe Callisto Protocol (1200p, Medium, FSR2 On) Average FPS 0 8 16 24 32 40 48 0 8 16 24 32 40 48 OneXPlayer X1 Pro (Radeon 890M) 44.92 ASUS Zenbook S14 (Arc 140V) 43.4 MSI Prestige A16 AI+ A3HM (Radeon 880M) 37.5 MSI Prestige AI EVO 16 B2HMG (Arc 140T) 34.6\n\nOneXPlayer X1 Pro Gaming Handheld - Thermals, Power & Battery\n\nA major factor of today's laptops is their power consumption. For our tests, all handhelds and laptops are set to their \"Balanced\" preset by default but you can opt into the \"Performance\" mode through the BIOS which lets you access the \"Best Performance\" profiles in Windows. The X1 Pro is thermally constrained versus laptops and hence, it has a maximum TDP of 30W but ends up with much higher efficiency given the numbers that we have just witnessed.\n\nPower Ratings & Consumption MSI Prestige AI EVO 16 B2HMG (Core Ultra 9 285H) OneXPlayer X1 Pro (Radeon 890M) MSI Prestige A16 AI+ A3HM (Ryzen AI 9 365) ASUS Zenbook S14 (Core Ultra 7 258V) 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 OOB TDP 35 28 28 17 PL1 Peak 64 30 48 37 Idle Power 2.88 4.16 3.19 2.28 Media Playback 9 6 6 4.5 Gaming Power 40 30 32 32 Peak Power 73 30 71 42\n\nOnce again, due to thermal constraints, the OneXPlayer X1 Pro runs a tad bit hot with up to 77C temps in gaming.

It has seen a wider adoption in such designs versus the Intel offerings and the reason is simple, AMD has been offering a great balance of high performance and high efficiency with its chips. Intel only managed to close the gap very recently with its Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake options but AMD has been offering these chips for almost a year now.\n\nThe result is that manufacturers have had more time to optimize the hardware and software for AMD's chips. As such, you can get a wide variety of options based on AMD APUs such as the X1 Pro from OneXPlayer.\n\nIn terms of performance, the OneXPlayer X1 Pro offers great gaming capabilities, often securing the top position in the gaming tests that we conducted. It supports AMD's latest software technologies which are handy when gaming on these compact handhelds. FSR, Frame-Gen, and Fluid Motion Frames can lead to smoother gameplay but we often saw that the native performance even at 1920x1200 was very playable in some modern titles with a good quality preset.\n\nThe OneXPlayer X1 Pro is limited to just 30W but you can fine-tune it between 4W and up to 30W depending on your needs. So if you are just browsing, watching movies, or playing casual games, a lower TDP would be perfect to deliver long-lasting battery times and for plugged-in gaming, you can go for that 30W. The chassis does get a bit warm but you'll mostly be holding the handheld from the joysticks which feel comfortable and very durable. They are easy to access and are very easy to remove/install. Another thing that you can do is to convert the handheld to your choice of device. It can be turned into a tablet, a laptop, or a handheld so you aren't restricted to just hand-held use.\n\nThe display on the OneXPlayer X1 Pro is also superb with a maximum 2560x1600 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate in a 16:10 aspect ratio. The glossy screen almost felt like an OLED panel at first but it does give that premium look. The device also supports 100W PD so you can get it charged from 0% to 100% in under an hour. The folks over at OneXPlayer nailed the looks and feel of this handheld option.\n\nPricing of the OneXPlayer X1 Pro is currently listed for $1359 US which makes it one of the most expensive and premium handheld options on the market but you are getting the top AMD Ryzen AI 300 chip along with a 11\" screen and strong performance. It is also a 3-in-1 design for multi-use & all of these reasons make it a compelling option. For those who want a handheld-only experience, you can also look into the OneXFly F1 Pro which is a strong gaming handheld under $1000 US and we are going to have a look at it soon too.",

The day before, Benchlife also confirmed the same release date for AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT models. It's worth noting that this date comes just one day after the release of Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5070.\n\nOn February 28th, AMD is expected to officially announce its Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs. This announcement should provide insights into the performance and pricing of both the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 graphics cards. Additionally, gamers can anticipate an in-depth look at AMD\u2019s RDNA 4 graphics architecture and its advantages.\n\nIn order for AMD to capture market share with RDNA 4, it must offer impressive performance at attractive price points. Simply keeping pace with Nvidia\u2019s price/performance ratios will not suffice. Moreover, AMD needs to make a concerted effort to implement FSR 4 support across as many games as possible. It\u2019s important to note that AMD has an \u201cFSR 4 Upgrade\u201d feature for titles that already support FSR 3.1.\n\nRDNA 4 is anticipated to be one of AMD\u2019s most significant graphics architectures to date. With RDNA 4, AMD aims to enhance capabilities in AI, ray tracing, and traditional graphics performance. Coupled with software enhancements like FSR 4, AMD has a substantial opportunity to gain an advantage over Nvidia. Healthy competition benefits the overall GPU and PC market. Therefore, it is advantageous for all parties that AMD achieves success. However, AMD\u2019s success hinges on its ability to deliver a competitively priced product that surpasses its Nvidia rivals by a notable margin.\n\nIn the meantime, if you are looking to elevate your next gaming experience, check out our comparator for the best offer on the Radeon RX 7800 XT GPU today.",

AMD has been quick to deny the reports of the new RDNA 4 card with 32GB VRAM, too.\n\nNormally, we see XTX releases featuring higher GPU clocks, higher memory clocks and more... but the purported Radeon RX 9070 XTX might just be simply double the VRAM (9070 XT = 16GB GDDR6, with 9070 XTX = 32GB GDDR6). We might not see any other hardware improvements, as AMD is using the full Navi 48 GPU die on the Radeon RX 9070 XT as it is.\n\nIn a new post on X, Azor confirmed the news (sarcastically) saying that the Radeon RX 9070 XTX is actually called the Radeon RX 90700.05XTXT Max and it doesn't have 32GB of VRAM, but rather 320GB of VRAM. Not only that, but the card requires 1.21 gigawatts of PSU to run it, using new 96-pin power connectors.\n\nAzor was asked if the new Radeon RX 90700.05XTXT Max will beat NVIDIA's new GeForce RTX 5090 at 600W, to which Azor replied: \"only in raster\". But it was a post asking \"no Max+ at the end? Fail much\" to which Azor replied: \"Always a Marketing Disaster\" (Always a Marketing Disaster = AMD).\n\nBenchlife reports: \"Now, although Frank Azor denied that there will be no 32GB GDDR6 memory version of the Radeon RX 9070 XT, our sources confirmed that AMD is developing products with 32GB GDDR6 memory configuration with AIB partners.

            "content": "Nvidia has been the undisputed winner of the artificial intelligence trade, as the leader in creating chips and network infrastructure that power AI solutions. However, there are plenty of competitors trying to get in on the action. After all, the potential market for AI is expected to be so big that just a small connection to the market can send a stock soaring.\n\nTwo stocks that have been clumped in with the AI trade and that make chips and other AI infrastructure are Broadcom (AVGO -3.56%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.92%). Broadcom has performed well, with its stock up nearly 86% over the last year. Meanwhile, AMD has struggled, with its stock down nearly 36%.\n\nWall Street analysts currently expect one of these companies to grow earnings faster in 2025, but the other to outperform in stock price appreciation over the next 12 to 18 months. Let's take a look.\n\nBroadcom: 223% earnings growth\n\nWhile Nvidia has made its name by dominating the broad chip market, Broadcom has focused on creating custom chips for some of the large tech players like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft.\n\nAfter the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese company that claims to have developed an AI chatbot at a fraction of the cost of competitors', many think custom chips will be the path forward, which bodes well for Broadcom. Others also suspect Broadcom has locked up new customers like OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. The company has now topped a $1 trillion market capitalization\n\nFor its fiscal year ended in November, Broadcom only reported $1.27 of earnings per share, but most of this was due to the amortization of intangibles related to the company's acquisition of VMWare in late 2023. On an operating basis, diluted earnings came in at $4.86. Wall Street analysts on average expect the company to grow diluted earnings to $4.01 in fiscal 2025 and generate operating diluted earnings of $6.35, according to data provided by Visible Alpha.\n\nOn the company's last earnings call, management expressed bullishness on the custom chip market and thinks the company will play a role as hyper-scalers roll out their own custom AI accelerators or chips. Broadcom cited its three hyperscaler customers and said that together, their journeys represent an AI serviceable addressable market (SAM) for custom chips and network in the $60 billion to $90 billion range in fiscal 2027.\n\nBroadcom's stock has performed well, and analysts think it is fairly valued at this point. While no analysts are saying to sell, 27 have issued research reports on the company over the last three months, according to TipRanks. The average price target implies very minimal upside. Analysts don't seem bearish on the company at all, so it may be more of a valuation call to let the stock catch its breath. Broadcom currently trades at close to 37 times forward earnings.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices: 147% earnings growth\n\nBeing in the AI game is a big deal, which is why investors are often discussing Advanced Micro Devices. However, AMD's main problem is that it has to compete against Nvidia, a company generating gross profit margins in the mid-70s percentile and demonstrating extreme pricing power. According to experts, AMD manufactures cheaper chips than Nvidia, but they're only about 80% as powerful.\n\nStill, Wall Street analysts currently expect earnings to grow nicely this year -- from $1.00 in 2024 to $2.47 in 2025, according to Visible Alpha. On an operating basis, analysts expect earnings to grow from $3.31 to $4.62. However, we'll see how long these last after AMD's recent earnings disappointed the market. The company beat on estimates and even delivered revenue guidance ahead of consensus.\n\nBut revenue in the company's data center segment came in lighter than expected, which disappointed investors given how much the market is growing. After earnings, some analysts expressed concern about the outlook for growth in AMD's AI business.\n\nDespite weaker data center numbers, analysts are still largely bullish on the stock. A total of 36 analysts have issued research reports on the company over the past three months, according to TipRanks. Of these, 24 analysts rate the stock a buy, 11 say to hold, and only one says to sell. The average price target suggests nearly 33% upside from current levels (as of Feb. 11).\n\nThe discrepancy between AMD and Broadcom looks to be based on valuation. While Broadcom trades at 37 times forward earnings, AMD trades at around 23 times. In the near term, AMD may have more room to run on any change in sentiment. However, Broadcom seems to be better positioned to take advantage of current trends in the AI market.",

That being said, elevated valuations over the past 2 years, mainly in the US, have put global stocks in a vulnerable position, opines Goldman Sachs Research. By the close of last year, the S&P 500 saw one of its strongest 2-year periods of returns since the year 1928. Much of this increase demonstrates better fundamental growth than investors had expected, with higher valuations acting as a significant contributor.\n\nDiversification Remains the Key, Says Morgan Stanley\n\nAs per Morgan Stanley, while several investors continue to favour recently successful approaches, like passive exposure to the broader S&P 500 Index, a more diversified investment strategy might provide better risk-adjusted returns. The benchmark US equity index remains richly priced and excessively concentrated. The 10 biggest stocks in the S&P 500 index make up for ~40% of its total market capitalization, making it excessively dependent on certain mega-cap tech companies continuing to exceed ambitious performance forecasts.\n\n=With the S&P 500 anticipated to post a marginal 7% return in 2025, other regions, sectors, and asset classes might become more attractive, says Morgan Stanley. Generally, the stocks and bonds have an inverse relation, offering a natural hedge in diversified portfolios. However, the current trends have demonstrated that such assets are moving in tandem, with both witnessing losses simultaneously, as was seen in 2022. Morgan Stanley believes that the higher bond yields and lower bond prices have been coinciding with lower stock prices. This trend highlights the importance of diversifying beyond traditional asset classes to mitigate risks.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead for the S&P 500?\n\nWhile there are expectations of equity markets making further progress over the year as a whole \u2014 largely fueled by earnings \u2014 they have become vulnerable to a correction either due to higher bond yields and/or disappointments on growth in economic data or earnings, says Goldman Sachs. A fall in interest rates has been related to robust equity returns. In the US, the US Fed\u2019s rate-cutting cycles have often coincided with higher stock prices as long as the broader economy avoids recession.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Nvidia (NVDA -4.05%) has essentially owned the data center computing market, which is a huge deal, considering the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Nvidia is one of the primary benefactors of this investment, although some of its competitors, like AMD (AMD -2.92%), are also benefiting.\n\nHowever, the lead that Nvidia has surmounted looks unassailable, but all it takes is one innovation, and AMD could be neck and neck with Nvidia.\n\nSo, which of these two is the better AI stock for 2025?\n\nNvidia's lead in the data center market may be insurmountable\n\nNvidia's GPUs and software have become the industry standard in data centers. While AMD's GPUs look like they can compete on paper, Nvidia's software, CUDA, sets it apart. This software allows GPUs to process multiple calculations simultaneously and handle the sheer computing tasks that AI computing requires.\n\nBecause the industry has essentially adopted CUDA software versus AMD's ROCm, it's unlikely that AMD will ever be able to surmount Nvidia's lead in the data center race. The switching costs of moving from one supplier to another when the infrastructure is already set up for one is a massive consideration and is the primary hurdle for anyone switching.\n\nNvidia's lead over AMD can be seen in both of their financials. Each has a data center division, and Nvidia's lead is quite impressive. In Q4 2024, AMD's data center revenue was $3.9 billion, up 69% year over year. Nvidia hasn't reported its Q4 results yet, as its financial calendar is shifted by one month. As a result, using AMD's Q3 results provides a better comparison.\n\nIn Q3, AMD's data center revenue was $3.5 billion, up 122% year over year. These are impressive results by themselves, yet pale in comparison to Nvidia's.\n\nIn Q3 FY 2025 (ending Oct. 27), Nvidia's data center revenue was $30.8 billion, up 112% year over year. That indicates Nvidia's data center business is around 10 times the size of AMD's, which is a massive lead. We'll learn more about Nvidia's Q4 results when it reports on Feb. 26, but with all the talk from big tech companies about AI spending, it's likely to report great numbers.\n\nNvidia has built a massive moat with huge switching costs, which essentially blocks AMD from taking a meaningful amount of its data center business. However, if AMD is substantially cheaper as a stock, the discount could be enough of a reason to invest in AMD, as its data center business is still growing strongly, being much smaller than Nvidia.\n\nAMD doesn't have a discount to Nvidia\n\nBecause both companies are fully profitable, using an earnings-based metric like the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio makes sense.\n\nFrom this perspective, AMD's stock looks far more expensive than Nvidia's, which it is. However, both companies are undergoing strong growth, and AMD's profit picture is set to improve throughout 2025, so using a forward P/E ratio is also a good idea.\n\nFrom this perspective, AMD is cheaper than Nvidia. However, the discrepancy between these two valuation levels can largely be attributed to the company-wide growth rate. Considering that Nvidia is expected to grow revenue by 52% in FY 2026 (ending January 2026) and AMD is expected to grow at a 24% pace, this difference seems reasonable.\n\nNvidia is growing faster and dominating the most important computing market right now. While AMD is still a fine company, I don't think there's any reason to own AMD over Nvidia. Best-in-class stocks usually outperform their peers by a wide margin, especially when they start from a similar valuation point.",

AMD offered much better specs with its XTX variants in the RDNA 2 and RDNA 3 generations, but RDNA 4 might be limited to just memory and clock speed bumps due to the full Navi 48 die already being featured on the 9070 XT.\n\nThe AMD Radeon RX 9070 XTX (if this is the final name), would offer double the memory and as for the speeds, we can expect a small boost in clocks over the XT model with a slightly higher TDP. The card would be a strong solution for AI tasks which would take full advantage of those updated AI & ML cores on the RDNA 4 architecture.\n\nFurthermore, Benchlife also confirmed with its sources at AIBs that while AMD had denied the existence of a 32 GB Radeon RX 9070 XT, they are still working on products with 32 GB GDDR6 memory using the same Navi 48 GPU die.\n\nNow, although Frank Azor denied that there will be no 32GB GDDR6 memory version of Radeon RX 9070 XT, our sources confirmed that AMD is developing products with 32GB GDDR6 memory configuration with AIB partners. The GPU chip used is code-named Navi 48, the same as the Radeon RX 9070 series. via Benchlife\n\nThe AMD Radeon RX 9000 \"RDNA 4\" GPUs are going to see a full unveiling on the 28th of February and the retail launch is currently slated for 6th of March, so stay tuned for more information on the next-gen discrete graphics card lineup from team Red.\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9000 GPU Lineup (Preliminary):",

Below the CPU ranking charts and tables, this guide also gives you a basic introduction to CPU benchmarks and includes a list of commonly-used CPU benchmarks. We have benchmarked CPUs for over 25 years, so we've preserved many of our legacy historical CPU rankings on the second page of this article.\n\n\n\nYour CPU is considered a computer's most important component. CPU benchmark comparisons help us sort out the differences between chips, but you'll find a dizzying collection of model numbers and specs from both Intel and AMD. We've listed the best cheap CPUs and best CPUs for workstations and even covered the Intel vs AMD feature debate in other articles, but if you want to know the CPU rankings and how you can run CPU benchmarks of your own, this CPU benchmarks hierarchy is for you.\n\nThe $480 Ryzen 9 9800X3D is now the fastest gaming chip money can buy, but the previous-gen $460 Ryzen 7 7800X3D is a relatively close second that can often be found at lower pricing. The eight-core 16-thread chips use AMD's 3D V-Cache technology to accelerate gaming performance, but the tech doesn't accelerate all games and results in reduced performance in some applications. However, for gaming, AMD's 3D V-Cache tech is the uncontested leader.\n\nIntel's Arrow Lake delivers class-leading single-threaded performance and impressive multi-threaded performance, but it lags comparably priced competing chips in gaming. Intel delivered a combination of firmware and operating system patches that it said would rectify the situation, but our testing shows the 'fixes' didn't improve gaming performance. As such, Arrow Lake continues to lag the competition in gaming.\n\n\n\nWe'll explain how we ranked the processors under each table. The game testing ranking is first. We also include a productivity application performance metric, which we've split up into single- and multi-threaded measurements. We also have an integrated graphics CPU gaming benchmark ranking so you can see how AMD's APUs stack up to Intel's processors.\n\nCPU Benchmarks Rankings 2024 - Windows 10 and Windows 11\n\nImage 1 of 9 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nWe have multiple sets of benchmarks in the album above. All of our tests above were conducted with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090. We recently updated our test image, so we have a limited selection of benchmarks that include the latest Intel and Ryzen processors (the first three charts). The following slides contain previous test pools, and you can use the relative positioning of the processors to gauge performance differences to older chips.\n\n\n\nWe rank all the Intel and AMD processors using the Windows 11 and RTX 4090 test bench in the tables below, but we don't include CPU overclock performance rankings. We've also added separate charts for integrated graphics testing below.\n\nWe're currently in the process of retesting all of our processors with Nvidia's new RTX 5090 GPU, so you should expect a big update to our rankings soon.\n\n\n\nBear in mind that the charts above use the raw performance numbers, whereas our CPU benchmarks rankings in the tables below use a score to rank the chips relative to one another. Here are also a few of our faceoffs that pit top gaming CPUs head-to-head:\n\nGaming CPU Benchmarks Ranking 2024\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally 2024 Gaming CPU Benchmark Hierarchy Product / (MSRP) Lowest Price 1080p Gaming Score Architecture Cores/Threads (P+E) Base/Boost GHz TDP / PBP / MTP Ryzen 7 9800X3D ($480) No Stock 100.00% Zen 5 8 / 16 4.7 / 5.2 120W / 162W Ryzen 7 7800X3D ($449) $449 87.18% Zen 4 8 / 16 4.2 / 5.0 120W / 162W Ryzen 9 7950X3D ($699) No Stock 85.75% Zen 4 16 / 32 4.2 / 5.7 120W / 162W Ryzen 5 7600X3D ($299) Microcenter 81.30% Zen 4 6 / 12 4.1 / 4.7 65W / 88W Ryzen 9 7900X3D ($599) $609 79.94% Zen 4 12 / 24 4.4 / 5.6 120W / 162W Core i9-14900K ($549) $433 77.10% Raptor Lake Refresh 24 / 32 (8+16) 3.2 / 6.0 125W / 253W Ryzen 7 9700X ($359) $324 76.74% Zen 5 8 /16 3.8 / 5.5 65W / 88W / 105W Ryzen 9 9950X ($649) $564 76.67% Zen 5 16 / 32 4.3 / 5.7 170W / 230W Core i7-14700K ($409) $315 75.76% Raptor Lake Refresh 20 / 28 3.4 / 5.6 125W / 253W Core i9-13900K ($589) $542 75.40% Raptor Lake 24 / 32 (8+16) 3.0 / 5.8 125W / 253W Core i7-13700K ($275) $329 74.94% Raptor Lake 16 / 24 (8+8) 3.4 / 5.4 125W / 253W Core 9 285K CU-8200 | DDR5-7200 ($589) $599 74.17% | 72.45% Arrow Lake 24 / 24 (8+16) 3.7 / 5.7 125W / 250W Ryzen 9 9900X ($499) $409 74.09% Zen 5 12 / 24 4.4 / 5.6 120W / 162W Ryzen 5 9600X ($279) $245 72.81% Zen 5 6 / 12 3.9 / 5.4 65W / 88W Ryzen 9 7950X ($569) $523 71.65% Zen 4 16 / 32 4.5 / 5.7 170W / 230W Core 7 265K CU-8200 | DDR5-7200 ($394) $372 70.77% | 70.17% Arrow Lake 20 / 20 (8+12) 3.9 / 5.5 125W / 250W Core i5-14600K ($319) $224 70.61% Raptor Lake Refresh 14 / 20 3.5 / 5.3 125W / 181W Core i5-13600K ($225) $250 68.64% Raptor Lake 14 / 20 (6+8) 3.5 / 5.1 125W / 181W Ryzen 9 7900X ($474) $398 69.71% Zen 4 12 / 24 4.7 / 5.6 170W / 230W Ryzen 7 7700X ($349) $314 68.33% Zen 4 8 / 16 4.5 / 5.4 105W / 142W Ryzen 7 5700X3D ($229) $230 67.46% Zen 3 8 / 16 3.0 / 4.1 105W / 142W Core 5 245K CU-8200 | DDR5-7200 ($309) $319 67.39% | 67.18% Arrow Lake 14 / 14 (6+8) 4.2 / 5.2 125W / 250W Core i9-12900K ($589) No Stock 66.92% Alder Lake 16 / 24 (8+8) 3.2 / 5.2 125W / 241W Ryzen 5 7600X ($249) $198 65.62% Zen 4 6 / 12 4.7 / 5.3 105W / 142W Core i7-12700K ($209) $197 63.06% Alder Lake 12 / 20 (8+4) 3.6 / 5.0 125W / 190W Core i5-12600K ($150) $150 58.61% Alder Lake 10 / 16 (6+4) 3.7 / 4.9 125W / 150W Core i5-14400 ($225) $191 52.67% Raptor Lake Refresh 10 / 16 (6+4) 2.5 / 4.7 65W / 148W\n\nThe most powerful chip gets 100 percent, and all others are scored relative to it.

The most powerful chip gets a 100, and all others are scored relative to it.\n\n\n\nSingle-threaded performance is often tied directly to the responsiveness and snappiness of your PC in any number of daily applications, like loading an operating system or surfing the web. This metric largely depends upon a mixture of instruction per cycle (IPC) throughput (the number of operations the chip can execute in one clock cycle) and frequency, which is the speed at which the transistors switch between on and off states.\n\n\n\nHowever, a whole host of other considerations, such as cache, architecture, and interconnects (like rings, meshes, and infinity fabric) impact this measure of per-core performance, so these results do not align perfectly based on clock frequency. Instead, performance varies with each application and how well it is tuned for the respective architectures.\n\nMulti-Threaded CPU Benchmarks Rankings 2024\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally 2024 Multi-Threaded CPU Benchmarks Multi-Threaded App Score Architecture Cores/Threads (P+E) Base/Boost GHz TDP / PBP / MTP $600 - Ryzen 9 9950X 100% Zen 5 16 / 32 4.3 / 5.7 170W / 230W $620 - Core 9 285K CU-8200 | DDR5-7200 95.6% | 95.0% Arrow Lake 24 / 24 (8+16) 3.7 / 5.7 125W / 250W $490 - Ryzen 9 7950X 89.0% Zen 4 16 / 32 4.2 / 5.7 120W / 162W $600 - Ryzen 9 7950X3D 84.4% Zen 4 16 / 32 4.2 / 5.7 120W / 162W $440 - Core i9-14900K 82.6% Raptor Lake Refresh 24 / 32 (8+16) 3.2 / 6.0 125W / 253W $380 - Core 7 265K CU-8200 82.6% Arrow Lake 20 / 20 (8+12) 3.9 / 5.5 125W / 250W $400 - Core i9-13900K 80.7% Raptor Lake 24 / 32 (8+16) 3.0 / 5.8 125 / 253W $380 - Ryzen 9 9900X 78.2% Zen 5 12 / 24 4.4 / 5.6 120W / 162W $440 - Core i7-14700K 73.1% Raptor Lake Refresh 20 / 28 3.4 / 5.6 125W / 253W $370 - Ryzen 9 7900X 69.0% Zen 4 12 / 24 4.7 / 5.6 170W / 230W $275 - Core i7-13700K 64.8% Raptor Lake 16 / 24 (8+8) 3.4 / 5.4 125W / 253W $490 - Ryzen 9 7900X3D 63.6% Zen 4 12 / 24 4.4 / 5.6 120W / 162W $280 - Core i9-12900K 59.1% Alder Lake 16 / 24 (8+8) 3.2 / 5.2 125 / 241W $480 - Ryzen 7 9800X3D 58.3% Zen 5 8 / 16 4.7 / 5.2 120W / 162W $320 - Core 5 245K CU-8200 | DDR5-7200 57.3% | 56.9% Arrow Lake 14 / 14 (6+8) 4.2 / 5.2 125W / 250W $320 - Ryzen 7 9700X 55.9% Zen 5 8 /16 3.8 / 5.5 65W / 88W / 105W $235 - Core i5-14600K 52.7% Raptor Lake Refresh 14 / 20 3.5 / 5.3 125W / 181W $225 - Core i5-13600K 51.7% Raptor Lake 14 / 20 (6+8) 3.5 / 5.1 125W / 181W $209 - Core i7-12700K 50.3% Alder Lake 12 / 20 (8+4) 3.6 / 5.0 125W / 190W $300 - Ryzen 7 7700X 47.0% Zen 4 8 / 16 4.5 / 5.4 105 / 142W $460 - Ryzen 7 7800X3D 43.5% Zen 4 8 / 16 4.2 / 5.0 120W / 162W $250 - Ryzen 5 9600X 65W / 88W Zen 5 6 / 12 3.9 / 5.4 65W / 88W $150 - Core i5-12600K 38.4% Alder Lake 10 / 16 (6+4) 3.7 / 4.9 125W / 150W $220 - Ryzen 5 7600X 36.2% Zen 4 6 / 12 4.7 / 5.3 105W / 142W $210 - Core i5-14400 35.3% Raptor Lake Refresh 10 / 16 (6+4) 2.5 / 4.7 65W / 148W $300 - Ryzen 5 7600X3D 32.8% Zen 4 6 / 12 4.1 / 4.7 65W / 88W $220 - Ryzen 7 5700X3D 32.0% Zen 3 8 / 16 3.0 / 4.1 105 / 142W\n\nThe multi-threaded workload column is based on CPU benchmarks performance in Cinebench, POV-ray, vray, Blender (four tests - Koro, Barcellona, Classroom, bmw27), y-cruncher, and Handbrake x264 and x265 workloads. These CPU benchmarks represent performance in productivity-focused applications that tend to require more compute horsepower. The most powerful chip gets a 100, and all others are scored relative to it.\n\n\n\nAs we see with single-threaded performance metrics, multi-threaded performance, which measures a chip's performance in applications that utilize multiple software threads, varies based on a whole host of architectural factors. It also depends heavily upon how well the software scales with additional compute cores. As such, these results do not align perfectly based on core/thread count, though it does serve as a decent litmus of multi-threaded performance.\n\nBe aware that architectures, caches, and interconnects profoundly impact these results, as all of these factors impact how well performance scales with additional threads. Performance rarely scales perfectly with the addition of more cores/threads, so the scaling factor of each processor architecture weighs heavily on the value proposition of going with a higher core count processor.\n\nIntegrated GPU Gaming CPU Benchmarks Rankings 2024\n\nImage 1 of 8 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally iGPU Performance relative to Ryzen 7 5700G 1280x720 1920x1080 Ryzen 7 5700G B550-E 100% 100% Ryzen 5 5600G 96.3% 96% Ryzen 7 4750G 92.9% 94.1% Ryzen 3 5300G 85.8% 87.2% Ryzen 5 3400G 83.5% 84.1% Ryzen 3 3200G 77.1% 78.1% Intel UHD Graphics 750 32 EU (11600K, 11700K) 58.3% ~48.9% Intel UHD Graphics 730 24 EU (i5-11400) 51.7% 42.9% Intel UHD Graphics 630 24 EU (10600K) 36.0% 34.4%\n\nHere's our list of gaming performance with integrated graphics on several of the leading APUs available.

Simply run a CPU benchmark before you make any changes, then re-test after changes to see the results. You can head to our deep-dive details of overclocking in our How to Overclock a CPU guide for more details on tuning your processor, but if you want to learn how to benchmark your CPU, you're in the right place.\n\n\n\nHow do you benchmark your CPU? Well, that's not as complicated as you might think. Choosing the best CPU benchmarks can be a daunting task, but the general rule is that the best performance benchmark is simply measuring the performance of the programs you use the most. However, you might not be able to find other benchmarks to compare to, so these real-world benchmarks might not help you compare your performance to other CPUs.\n\n\n\nHowever, if the programs you frequently use don't have built-in benchmarks you can also use similar types of programs (renderers or encoders, for instance) as a proxy for your workload. There are also several well-known benchmarks with large databases that enable easy comparisons. You can also compare your results to the benchmarks you see in our library of reviews to get a good sense of how your system stacks up. We have a list of some great productivity benchmarks, and their download links, below.\n\n\n\nThese same theories apply to CPU game benchmarking \u2014 the best CPU benchmark is the game that you play the most. You can download an fps counter, like FRAPS, to measure performance during your gaming session. Games can vary widely, so we don't have a specific list of titles to test. However, you can use the gaming CPU benchmarks you see in our reviews as a good starting point.\n\n\n\nYou can also use synthetic gaming CPU benchmarks, a few of which we have listed below. Just be aware that these synthetic CPU benchmarks don't tend to translate well to real-world gaming, but they do show us the raw amount of compute power exposed to game engines. However, given their stability and repeatability, these are great benchmarks for comparing performance before and after any changes you may make to your system.\n\nMost often overlook web-browser performance, but these are among the best CPU benchmarks to measure performance in single-threaded workloads, which helps quantify the snappiness in your system. This also often directly correlates to performance in games that prize single-threaded performance. We've included a few web browser benchmarks below as well.\n\n\n\nIf you plan to compare to other gaming and application CPU benchmark results from reviews, forums, or friends, be sure to turn off as many background tasks as possible during your benchmarks to eliminate that influence from your CPU benchmark results. Here's a list with download links for some of the most common CPU benchmarks:\n\nBest CPU Benchmarks You Can Run\n\nCinebench R23 (MS Store) \u2014 This rendering CPU benchmark program has both single- and multi-core benchmark modes. This is one of the most commonly-used CPU benchmarks.\n\nUL Benchmarks 3DMark \u2014 This synthetic CPU benchmark has a plethora of built-in tests for both CPUs and GPUs (see our best GPUs) and is updated regularly with new tests. This is the go-to synthetic gaming test for many.\n\nCPU-Z \u2014 This is a common utility that exposes the details of your processor, but it also has a built-in CPU benchmark that is incredibly simple to run. The single- and multi-thread test results don't correlate well to real-world tasks, but the tests' stability makes them well suited for before and after comparisons. CPU-Z test results are also widely shared among enthusiasts, so it's easy to find comparison systems.\n\nPOV-Ray \u2014 This rendering CPU benchmark has both single- and multi-threaded test options but uses a heavier distribution of AVX instructions than Cinebench to create a taxing CPU benchmark.\n\nC-Ray \u2014 This CPU benchmark uses a raytracer rendering engine to measure a CPU's multi-threaded performance in floating-point operations.\n\nHandBrake \u2014 The HandBrake encoder comes with a plethora of options, so you can easily tailor the encoding CPU benchmark to your needs. Simply measure the amount of time it takes to encode a video, and then use that as your baseline for comparison.\n\nCorona \u2014 This is another popular rendering utility and is a simple-one click CPU benchmark that uses the Chaos Corona render engine to measure CPU performance in multi-threaded workloads.\n\nWebXPRT 4 \u2014 This is a click-to-run CPU benchmark that runs in your browser to measure performance in HTML5, JavaScript, and WebAssembly-based tests. This is a great CPU benchmark to measure single-threaded performance.\n\nARES-6 \u2014 This is a click-to-run CPU benchmark that runs in your browser to measure performance in JavaScript but has a heavy weighting towards the neural network (machine learning) workloads that are becoming increasingly common. This is a great CPU benchmark to measure single-threaded performance.\n\ny-cruncher \u2014 This CPU benchmark runs from a command line, so it isn't the most user-friendly. However, it calculates Pi using the latest AVX instruction sets in a heavily-threaded manner, making it among the best to measure SIMD performance. Beware, this test can break overclocks easily (which also means it is great for stress testing).\n\n2024 CPU Benchmarks Test System and Configuration",

That said, you should choose your next processor carefully, as price levels vary wildly between different models and some perform better than others at particular categories of tasks.\n\nThe best processor \u2014 be it the best Intel processor, the best AMD processor, or even the best Apple processor\u2014involves balancing speed, power consumption, and compatibility with other components. We have noticed that AMD processors currently outpace Intel and Apple CPUs in terms of speed, making them the fastest brand overall. But that doesn't mean the others don't serve a purpose for specific use cases.\n\nWe should warn you that the fastest CPUs also tend to be the most expensive and the most power-hungry, so you may also want to consider checking out the best CPU coolers if you want to maintain peak performance for longer\n\nBy providing a comprehensive overview, we aim to assist you in finding the fastest CPU tailored to your specific needs, ensuring a balance between performance, cost, and efficiency.\n\nBackup large drives online with cloud storage IDrive, the cloud backup veteran, delivers tons of storage online for an incredibly small outlay. 10TB for $3.98 for the first year is unmatched till now and so is the support for unlimited devices and the extensive file versioning system available.

AMD EPYC 9965 'Turin' Fastest CPU for servers Today's Best Deals VISIT WEBSITE\n\nOne of the fastest CPUs on the planet right now comes in the form of the AMD EPYC 9965 'Turin' processor, a 192-core monster running on AMD's Zen 5c architecture. Launched in October 2024, the AMD EPYC 9965 CPU boasts a base clock speed of 2.25GHz, rising to a maximum boost clock of up to 3.7GHz, mirroring the all-core boost speed of the same rate. Priced just shy of $15,000, it's considered the most complex microprocessor ever designed, with AMD also claiming it will more than double the performance of the fifth-generation Intel Xeon Scalable CPU, the 64-core Platinum 8592+.\n\nWhile we would consider this one of the fastest CPUs in the world, we would not recommend that you purchase and use it for any home-based or office-based setups, particularly due to the price but also because of the fact it's suited largely for processing in data centers. They are, however, ideal if you're setting up workstations for hardcore data simulation, AI workloads or Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).\n\nAlso launched in October was the AMD EPYC 9755, which comes very close to eclipsing the EPYC 9965 but just falls short. That said, it's available for around $2,000 less. This chip is twice as fast as AMD's previous Zen 4C-based CPU, the EPCY 9754 'Bergamo' chip, according to sister site Tom's Hardware , thanks to various micro-architectural improvements including double the L3 cache.\n\nThe fastest CPU for laptops\n\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\n2. Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX Fastest CPU for laptops Today's Best Deals VISIT WEBSITE\n\nThe fastest CPUs for laptops are difficult to distinguish between, but the current champion in this respect is the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX, which is set to launch with new laptops in February 2025. The second generation of Intel's AI-ready CPU beats the competition, according to PassMark aggregations , and even edging the previous fastest chip, the AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX3D, as well as the monstrously quick Apple M4 Max processor.\n\nThis Arrow Lake chip includes 24 cores (including eight performance cores and 16 efficiency cores), 24 threads and a maximum clock speed of 5.4GHz. But there are only a handful of laptops that feature this chip, including the Asus ROG Strix G16 and Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 AI \u2014 meaning you may have to shell out for a high-end gaming machine to make the most of this chip, until more options begin to hit the market.\n\nWhile Intel is currently the champion, we widely expect the upcoming AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX3D chip to steal the crown straight back when it launches later this year. The first laptops that include the new Ryzen 9 chip will ship in March or April, so it's too early to tell whether it truly will be the fastest CPU for laptops \u2014 but given how previous generations of this chip performed, we're willing to stake a claim that it's set to follow in the footsteps of its predecessor, the AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX3.\n\nThe fastest Apple silicon\n\n(Image credit: Apple)\n\n3. Apple M2 Ultra Fastest CPU for Macs Today's Best Deals VISIT WEBSITE\n\nAlthough we're a couple of generations ahead now, with the M4 series having launched only recently last year, the two-year-old Apple M2 Ultra processor is still the fastest CPU on the planet for Apple hardware, according to various benchmarking sites including Versus .\n\nThis workstation-grade processor is made up of two M2 Max chips stitched together \u2014 boasting 24 CPU cores and 76 GPU cores, alongside a base clock speed of just over 3.6Ghz. Indeed, it delivers far more power than you can get out of the M4 Max \u2014 and still reigns supreme, available in machines like the Apple Mac Studio . Also significant are its 800GB/s of unified memory bandwidth, and support for up to 192GB of unified memory. The neural engine fitted into this chip is also capable of 31.6 trillion operations per second.\n\nWe expect a successor to be launched sometime this year, but until it does, your best bet for maximum Apple power is the M2 Ultra.\n\nThe fastest CPU for desktops\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\n4. AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7995WX Fastest CPU for desktop PCs Today's Best Deals VISIT WEBSITE\n\nLeading the pack for the fastest CPU for desktops is the AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7995WX, launched in October 2023 but still an unbelievably fast chip that will supercharge your desktop PC. We do expect AMD to launch a 9000 'Shimada Peak' processor during 2025, based on the Zen 5 architecture, but there's no reason to wait given how powerful the AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7995WX still is \u2014 leaving the competition in its wake according to aggregate benchmarking on PassMark .\n\nAvailable for $10,000, this 96-core CPU operates across 192 threads and boasts a base clock speed of 2.5GHz and a turbo speed of 5.1Ghz. Whether you need to tap into this much power, however, depends on how you're going to make the most of your new desktop. This chip is really designed for scientific computing, heavy 3D rendering and CPU rendering, and not really intended for everyday tasks \u2014 which including conventional photo editing and video editing. That's not to say this processor cannot handle those tasks \u2014 obviously, it can \u2014 but it's quite simply the fastest CPU on the planet if you're building a desktop. For something a bit more suited to day-to-day use cases, check out our guide to the best processors instead, which take into account factors such as pricing too.\n\nThe fastest CPU for gaming\n\n(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)\n\nAlthough you may find it difficult to get right now , the 8-core 16-thread AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best CPU for gaming \u2014 if you can find it. Unfortunately, at the time of writing, there's a significant stock shortage. There are several good reasons, least of not all because it trounces the competition, according to benchmarking data , with the AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D trailing in its wake.\n\nWe wrote in our AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D review that this CPU is a gaming powerhouse that was among the best processors launched last year \u2014 but that there are a handful of minor flaws to take into account, including its price, as well as underperformance compared with its rivals in a handful of non-gaming performance areas. But it's a specialist chip for gamers who want the best overall gaming processor \u2014 and those who are happy to make that compromise will be absolutely fine eating those drawbacks.\n\nThere are, however, some benefits built into this chip for workloads like photo editing, with the extra cache really going a long way here. Ultimately, it's as good a gaming processor as you can get \u2014 if you manage to stumble on stock, that is.",

            "content": "The underdog chipmaker still has pretty sharp teeth.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices' (AMD -2.92%) stock price dropped 6% on Feb. 5 after the chipmaker posted its fourth-quarter earnings report. Its revenue rose 24% year over year to $7.66 billion and exceeded analysts' estimates by $132 million, while its adjusted EPS grew 42% to $1.09 and matched the consensus forecast.\n\nThose headline numbers looked impressive, but the decelerating growth of its closely watched data center business likely disappointed the bulls. Let's see if the market overreacted and created a worthwhile buying opportunity for patient investors.\n\nWhat happened to AMD over the past two years?\n\nAMD is the world's second-largest producer of x86 CPUs for PCs and servers after Intel. It's the second-largest producer of discrete GPUs for gaming PCs and data centers after Nvidia (NVDA -4.05%), and it sells programmable chips through its Xilinx subsidiary. It also sells custom APUs (accelerated processing units) that merge together CPUs and GPUs for notebook computers and gaming consoles.\n\nAMD's revenue declined year over year in the first half of 2023 as the PC market cooled off. That slowdown occurred as it lapped its pandemic-era growth spurt and inflation curbed consumer spending. Its custom APU sales also declined as Sony and Microsoft sold fewer gaming consoles. But over the past year, its top-line growth accelerated again as its margins expanded.\n\nMetric Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Revenue growth (YOY) 10% 2% 9% 18% 24% Adjusted gross margin 51% 52% 53% 54% 54% Adj. operating margin 23% 21% 22% 25% 26% Adj. EPS growth (YOY) 12% 3% 19% 31% 42%\n\nThat recovery was driven by two tailwinds. First, its client segment, which mainly sells its x86 CPUs for PCs, continued to gain ground against Intel with its Ryzen 8000 CPUs. Second, its data center segment, which sells its Epyc CPUs and Instinct GPUs for servers, grew rapidly as the AI market expanded. Those growth engines offset its soft sales of gaming GPUs, custom APUs for consoles, and Xilinx's embedded chips.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2025, AMD expects its revenue to rise by a midpoint of 30% year over year as its adjusted gross margin expands to approximately 54%. For the full year, analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 24% and 43%, respectively.\n\nSo why weren't investors impressed?\n\nThose growth rates look healthy, but the bulls were likely disappointed by the slowing growth of its data center business. The segment's revenue rose 69% year over year in the fourth quarter and accounted for about half of its revenue, but that represented a significant slowdown from its triple-digit growth in the previous two quarters.\n\nMetric Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Data Center revenue $2.3 billion $2.3 billion $2.8 billion $3.5 billion $3.9 billion Growth (YOY) 38% 80% 115% 122% 69%\n\nThat deceleration dampened the bullish thesis that AMD's Instinct GPUs would gain significant ground against Nvidia's H100 GPUs in the AI-oriented data center market. AMD's GPUs are much cheaper than Nvidia's, but Nvidia has already conquered about 98% of the data center GPU market with its first mover's advantage, premium reputation, and proprietary CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) platform for GPU applications. So, while some companies might experiment with AMD's Instinct GPUs as a cheaper alternative to Nvidia's GPUs, it doesn't seem likely that the former will ever disrupt the latter.\n\nDuring the fourth-quarter conference call, AMD CEO Lisa Su predicted its data center business would continue to grow by the \"strong double digits\" in 2025 as it ramps up its production of its new Instinct MI350 GPUs. That outlook is bright, but investors likely expected an even more aggressive forecast for the AI-driven segment.\n\nSo, is this the right time to buy AMD?\n\nAt $110 per share, AMD's stock still looks reasonably valued at 24 times forward earnings. But Nvidia -- which is expected to more than double its revenue and adjusted EPS in fiscal 2025 (which ended in January) and then grow both figures by more than 50% in fiscal 2026 -- trades at just 31 times forward earnings. We should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but Nvidia is clearly selling the best picks and shovels for the AI gold rush.\n\nTherefore, AMD isn't a bad stock, but it just doesn't look more appealing than Nvidia. AMD has carved out a little niche in the data center market, but it certainly won't transform into the \"next Nvidia\" anytime soon. So, while AMD is worth nibbling on at these levels as its data center market expands, it really can't be considered a golden buying opportunity yet.",

            "content": "AMD is adopting a different approach with its next-generation graphics cards, as Radeon RX 9070 XT indicates from its name alone. This change in tactics isn\u2019t merely skin-deep, though, as the company sets its sights firmly on the mid-range market with this particular pixel pusher, leaving high-end market share to its rivals. As such, there\u2019s plenty to unpack about this GPU and you\u2019ll find all you need to know about it down below.\n\nAll being well, Radeon RX 9070 XT should provide some welcome competition to Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 50 Series. The launch of the graphics card has strayed slightly from the norm, with board partners revealing much about it before scrubbing all details following an unexpected delay.\n\nHowever Radeon RX 9070 XT shapes up, you can expect an in-depth Club386 review come launch. For now, let\u2019s digest what we know about AMD\u2019s latest and greatest in the here and now.\n\nRadeon RX 9070 XT will arrive on the scene in March 2025. VP & GM of Ryzen CPU and Radeon graphics, David McAfee, confirmed the release window in a post on X. Recently, the company narrowed this down further to an \u2018early March\u2019 window.\n\nRDNA4 early March \u2014 Frank Azor (@AzorFrank) February 5, 2025\n\nRumours indicate that Radeon RX 9070 XT will launch March 6, but more details should emerge from AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 9000 Series launch event on February 28. This should provide an official and in-depth look at RX 9070 XT and its siblings that was sadly missing from their initial CES 2025 tease.\n\nUpon release, Radeon RX 9070 XT will have plenty of foes to face. It will arrive shortly after GeForce RTX 5070 Ti (February 20) but it\u2019ll need to wrangle the spotlight more directly from RTX 5070. Some rumours claim that RTX 5060 will also launch in March alongside AMD\u2019s contender but Nvidia will likely delay it to April.\n\nSpecs\n\nServing as the flagship of AMD\u2019s RDNA 4 GPU architecture, Radeon RX 9070 XT packs the beefiest specs of its siblings. Team Red remains hush about some details but announcements from board partners have revealed much about the graphics card\u2019s makeup.\n\nRadeon RX 9070 XT Launch date March 2025 Codename Navi 48 XTX Architecture RDNA 4 Process TSMC N4 Die size 390 mm\u00b2 Stream processors 4,096 Boost clock 2,970MHz Peak FP32 TFLOPS 48.7 RT cores TBC (3rd Gen) AI accelerators TBC (2nd Gen) ROPs 96 Texture units 256 Memory size 16GB Memory type GDDR6 Memory bus 256-bit Memory clock 20Gb/s Bandwidth 640GB/s PCIe interface Gen 5 MSRP <$899\n\nAMD adopts TSMC\u2019s N4 process in designing RDNA 4 GPUs, including the Navi 48 XTX die at the heart of Radeon RX 9070 XT. This should theoretically allow it to operate more efficiently than prior generation RX 7000 Series cards, but there\u2019s no way to know for certain until TDPs and real-world power consumption come to light.\n\nSecond generation AI accelerators and third generation RT cores arrive as part and parcel of RDNA 4. AMD hasn\u2019t revealed how much of a generational uplift we can expect from either. However, prior leaks indicate that the company has several new ray tracing features up its sleeve that will debut with Radeon RX 9070 XT and other RX 9000 Series cards.\n\nImage: AMD.\n\nThe memory configuration of Radeon RX 9070 XT won\u2019t deviate greatly from its forebears. AMD is equipping the graphics card with 16GB of GDDR6 VRAM, clocked at 20Gb/s and running on a 256-bit bus, for a total bandwidth of 640GB/s. For context, that\u2019s slightly higher than RX 7800 XT and just blow GeForce RTX 5070. Curiously, some rumourmongers claim that a 32GB RX 9000 Series could be in the works too.\n\nAlleged leaks show Radeon RX 9070 XT running with boost clocks up to 3,100MHz (3.1GHz) but this is likely an OC model rather than stock frequency. They also indicate that this will be the first generation of graphics cards from AMD to feature a PCIe Gen 5 interface.\n\nPrice\n\nAMD has not shared an official price for Radeon RX 9070 XT but has stated that it will cost less than $899. The company provided this clarification following rumours that the graphics card\u2019s MSRP was close to GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and 5080.\n\nWhile we aren\u2019t going to comment on all the price rumors, I can say that an $899 USD starting price point was never part of the plan. \u2014 Frank Azor (@AzorFrank) January 27, 2025\n\nEarlier rumours claim that Radeon RX 9070 XT pricing will begin at $479, rising to $549 for premium partner designs. This would put the pixel pusher in direct competition with Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 5070. An exact figure hasn\u2019t materialised more recently but AMD apparently has \u201caggressive\u201d pricing in mind for its next-gen graphics cards.\n\nShould Radeon RX 9070 XT arrive with the aforementioned $479 price point, it\u2019ll be more affordable than RX 7800 XT ($499) but more expensive than RX 7700 XT ($449).\n\nPerformance\n\nNo official performance data exists for Radeon RX 9070 XT. However, AMD claims that the graphics card is comparable to RX 7900 XT and GeForce RTX 4070 Ti at best.\n\nImage: AMD.\n\nFSR 4 (FidelityFX Super Resolution 4) will be on-hand to boost Radeon RX 9070 XT frame rates. It\u2019s the first version in the series to employ machine learning in its upscaling process, finally mirroring Nvidia DLSS and Intel XeSS. The technology will be exclusive to RDNA 4 GPUs but could come to prior generations in the future.\n\nSupport for AMD\u2019s upscaler should be suitably wide-reaching and to a high standard. The company claims it is working to enable FSR 4 in more titles prior to release, while enhancing the software stack of Radeon RX 9070 XT and its siblings. Meanwhile, rumours claim that it may be possible to inject the new version of the technology via upcoming drivers.\n\nImage: AMD.\n\nIn lieu of frame rates, leakers are filling the gaps with claims that Radeon RX 9070 XT is less than 10% behind GeForce RTX 5080. Although, this is purely in terms of raster performance. It\u2019s unclear how well the graphics card performs in ray traced workloads relative to its prior and current generation rivals.",

Then these cards were anticipated to launch around the time of the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 but pushed back to March. Now we are due to finally find out more about the AMD Radeon RX 9070 series and its fancy RDNA 4 architecture on February 28.\n\nSet to air at 8 AM EST / 5 AM PT on the AMD Gaming YouTube channel, the RX 9070 live stream is going to give more information on the cards that are confirmed to launch in early March.\n\nWith the RTX 5070 Ti set to launch on February 20 and RTX 5070 launching on March 5, the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards will likely launch just after these two Nvidia cards.\n\nThese will be AMD's first graphics cards to use the RDNA 4 microarchitecture so there's quite a lot of hype and/or speculation surrounding them.

But the vast majority of people (including you, discerning and tech-savvy Ars Technica reader) won't be spending $1,000 or $2,000 (or $2,750 or whatever) on a new graphics card this generation.\n\nNo, statistically, you (like most people) will probably end up buying one of the more affordable midrange Nvidia or AMD cards, GPUs that are all slated to begin shipping later this month or early in March.\n\nThere has been a spate of announcements on that front this week. Nvidia announced yesterday that the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, which the company previously introduced at CES, would be available starting on February 20 for $749 and up. The new GPU, like the RTX 5080, looks like a relatively modest upgrade from last year's RTX 4070 Ti Super. But it ought to at least flirt with affordability for people who are looking to get natively rendered 4K without automatically needing to enable DLSS upscaling to get playable frame rates.\n\nRTX 5070 Ti RTX 4070 Ti Super RTX 5070 RTX 4070 Super CUDA Cores 8,960 8,448 6,144 7,168 Boost Clock 2,452 MHz 2,610 MHz 2,512 MHz 2,475 MHz Memory Bus Width 256-bit 256-bit 192-bit 192-bit Memory Bandwidth 896 GB/s 672 GB/s 672 GB/s 504 GB/s Memory size 16GB GDDR7 16GB GDDR6X 12GB GDDR7 12GB GDDR6X TGP 300 W 285 W 250 W 220 W\n\nThat said, if the launches of the 5090 and 5080 are anything to go by, it may not be easy to find and buy the RTX 5070 Ti for anything close to the listed retail price; early retail listings are not promising on this front. You'll also be relying exclusively on Nvidia's partners to deliver unadorned, relatively minimalist MSRP versions of the cards since Nvidia isn't making a Founders Edition version.\n\nAs for the $549 RTX 5070, Nvidia's website says it's launching on March 5. But it's less exciting than the other 50-series cards because it has fewer CUDA cores than the outgoing RTX 4070 Super, leaving it even more reliant on AI-generated frames to improve performance compared to the last generation.",

This is the official launch price with zero markup, and it's not bundled with anything you don't want or need. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming processor currently on the market (across both AMD and Intel) and a better choice for gamers than the more expensive Intel Core Ultra 9 285K.\n\nHighlight: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Desktop Processor\n\nAMD's X3D series processors are optimized for gaming. In that respect, they bench better than even the most expensive of AMD's standard lineup of CPUs thanks to AMD's 3D V-Cache technology. Although perfectly capable of handling multitasking, rendering, and creation, the limited number of cores means they aren't the ideal processors for those tasks. At its retail price of $479, the 9800X3D is $110 cheaper than the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K ($589) and $170 cheaper than the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X, even though it outperforms both of them in gaming.

The Californian semiconductor giant has been operating well and truly in the shadow of its larger peer. NVDA\u2019s leading position and relative strength have ensured its share price has grossly outperformed AMD\u2019s. NVDA stock is up around 83% over the past 12 months, while AMD\u2019s has sunk 35%.\n\nMaximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:\n\nLeverage the power of TipRanks' Smart Score, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions.\n\nMonitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with Your Smart Portfolio\n\nPerformance Comparison between Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) over the past 12 months\n\nHowever, the market overlooks many of AMD\u2019s achievements and fundamental strengths. This is reflected by the company\u2019s attractive price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.53 \u2014 a valuation metric determining whether a stock is undervalued by factoring in the company\u2019s earnings growth. A PEG ratio below 1 suggests AMD is undervalued relative to its growth potential.\n\nDetailed performance comparison between Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) including key metrics\n\nOnce all the relevant factors are considered, AMD may be the better stock pick for avid tech investors looking to back one of these global graphics giants. In fact, Wall St. analysts forecast similar degrees of upside for both companies in 2025.\n\nThe DeepSeek Selloff is Overdone\n\nFirst, addressing the recent selloff in Western tech companies, especially those with exposure to AI development, is essential. According to various market commentators, DeepSeek represents an existential threat to the U.S. tech sector. Suppose a Chinese research lab can deliver a much cheaper large-language model (LLM) for artificial intelligence (AI) than Western rivals. In that case, the future outlook for companies like AMD, NVDA, and Intel (INTC) is somewhat bleak.\n\nHowever, there are several reasons to believe that the market\u2019s reaction is overblown due to three key misunderstandings. One of which is the economics of training versus inference. DeepSeek R1\u2019s touted $5.6M training cost excludes critical R&D expenses like architecture experimentation, algorithm tuning, and pre-training infrastructure. While this reduces upfront training barriers, inference demands remain GPU/TPU-intensive. For example, R1 requires ~37GB RAM per billion parameters, necessitating high-performance hardware like AMD\u2019s MI300 (384GB HBM3 memory, 5.3TB/s bandwidth).\n\nThen, there\u2019s AMD\u2019s inference advantage. AMD\u2019s MI300 has 1.8x higher memory bandwidth than Nvidia H100, making it ideal for inference workloads, with FireAttention V3 benchmarks showing AMD GPUs achieving 1.4\u20131.8x better throughput for models like LLaMA 70B. DeepSeek supports AMD consumer GPUs (RX 7000 series) and Ryzen AI CPUs, signaling long-term hardware reliance.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.92%) was among the stocks to see shares surge thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) over the past couple of years. But so far, 2025 is a different story.\n\nThe company's stock plunged to a 52-week low of $106.50 on Feb. 5, the day after it released earnings results for its fiscal fourth quarter, ended Dec. 28. This is a steep reversal from the 52-week high of $227.30 AMD shares reached last March.\n\nDoes this price decline signal a buy opportunity, or did its earnings results reveal reasons to avoid the stock? Let's dig into the company to find out whether AMD is a worthwhile long-term investment.\n\nWhy AMD's share price dropped\n\nAMD stock's fall after its Q4 earnings report was due in part to its all-important data center revenue failing to meet Wall Street's expectations. AI systems are built in data centers, so this area is an indicator of AMD's success in the AI market.\n\nThe company's data center segment delivered record revenue of $3.9 billion in Q4, a 69% increase over the prior year. This massive year-over-year sales growth wasn't good enough for Wall Street, which was expecting $4.2 billion in data center income.\n\nIn addition, warning bells went off on Wall Street after AMD management forecast Q1 revenue to drop around 7% to $7.1 billion from Q4's $7.7 billion due to seasonality. The quarter-over-quarter drop was interpreted as a sign AMD's AI sales are weakening.\n\nThe reality is AMD's $7.1 billion Q1 forecast is almost a 30% increase over 2024's first-quarter sales of $5.5 billion. It's also worth noting this $5.5 billion represented an 11% quarter-over-quarter decline, so the 7% drop forecast for 2025's Q1 isn't unusual.\n\nAMD's business performance\n\nIn terms of fears that AMD's AI business is weakening, CEO Lisa Su's perspective is that AI sales are only going up. She stated, \"Without guiding for a specific number in 2025, one of the comments that we made is we see this business growing to tens of billions, as we go through the next couple of years.\"\n\nSu's confidence in AMD's future is understandable given the success the company has achieved to date. For instance, in 2023, data center sales were about 30% of the $22.7 billion in total revenue produced by AMD. In 2024, the data center business expanded to nearly 50% of overall sales as this segment grew 94% year over year to a record $12.6 billion. This helped AMD reach a record $25.8 billion in 2024 full-year revenue.\n\nAMD's AI-related sales success led to solid financials. Its gross margin rose to 51% in Q4 compared to 47% in the prior year, indicating improved profitability in its core operations. The company's Q4 balance sheet was stellar with $69.2 billion in total assets compared to total liabilities of $11.7 billion.\n\nAMD's prosperity led management to double down on its AI strategy. It acquired Silo AI last year to help customers build AI systems using AMD hardware. It's also acquiring ZT Systems this year to assist customers with implementing AMD products on IT infrastructure.\n\nDeciding whether or not to buy AMD stock\n\nAMD's focus on its data center business, and assisting customers to implement AI, is a compelling strategy. But can AI demand continue to feed AMD's fortunes over the long run?\n\nForecasts estimate the AI market will grow from $244 billion in 2025 to $827 billion by 2030. The rise of AI is a secular trend expected to transform the computing industry as increasingly powerful computers capable of supporting AI become widespread.\n\nThe AI sector's expansion serves as a tailwind, helping AMD to achieve ongoing sales in its data center products. Its AI success to date, solid financials, and future prospects combine to make AMD stock a worthwhile long-term investment.\n\nThis brings me to whether now is a good time to buy AMD shares, given the stock isn't far from its 52-week low at the time of writing. Let's consider AMD's stock valuation using the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This metric tells you how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar's worth of earnings.\n\nBecause of its share price decline, AMD's P/E multiple looks more reasonable now than it has been over the past year. That said, the stock is still not a bargain. For comparison, competitor Nvidia's shares are at a P/E ratio of 53 versus AMD at over 100.\n\nSo while it's a better time to buy AMD stock than before, you might want to wait for a further price drop. Alternatively, you can adopt a dollar-cost averaging strategy, and buy a few shares now.\n\nThis approach involves building your position in AMD over time by purchasing equal dollar amounts of its stock at regular intervals. Dollar-cost averaging takes some of the guesswork out of whether AMD shares will go up or down from its current price, while allowing you to own a piece of a growing, well-run semiconductor company.",

Today, David McAfee (VP of Ryzen and Radeon) announced on X that the company will formally unveil the Radeon RX 9070 XT on the AMD Gaming YouTube channel on February 28 at 8 AM Eastern.\n\nAMD originally briefed the press on the Radeon RX 9070 XT in early January, saying that it would be part of the company\u2019s CES 2025 keynote. AMD never actually mentioned a new GPU generation, and in interviews afterwards, executives said it was delayed to provide a bigger, dedicated event for its complex new graphics generation. (Nvidia\u2019s RTX 50-series reveal, with lower prices than expected and a frame-boosting Multi Frame Generation feature, might have also taken AMD by surprise.)\n\nThe original press briefing didn\u2019t reveal much beyond philosophical changes. The new RDNA 4 architecture powering the Radeon RX 9070 and 9060 series graphics cards (finally) places a larger emphasis on AI hardware as AI upscaling devours native graphics. And AMD\u2019s next-gen FSR 4.0 is designed to lean heavily on those new AI cores to more closely compete with Nvidia\u2019s vaunted DLSS upscaling. AMD said a March launch would let the company add more polish to initial FSR 4.0 integrations.\n\nAMD\n\nBeyond that, we don\u2019t know anything official yet, though some compelling (unconfirmed) Radeon RX 9070 XT specs were recently leaked. Are they legit? Guess we\u2019ll find out on February 28.\n\nIn the meantime, check out our reviews of the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080, two graphics cards that go all-in on DLSS 4\u2019s new Multi Frame Generation feature. Nvidia just announced that the RTX 5070 Ti, a more direct competitor to the name-borrowing Radeon RX 9070, will launch on February 20.

By contrast, Intel's share declined following a scandal with Raptor Lake CPU stability issues in certain cases, as well as an inventory correction at a partner in the third quarter.\n\nAs of Q4 2024, AMD's unit share reached 27.1%, gaining 7.4% YoY but declining 1.6% from the previous quarter.

The mobile segment remains a critical area for AMD's expansion as notebooks outsell desktops 3:1, so winning a 3.4% from Intel in a year is a good result.\n\nServer Revenue / Unit share\n\n(Image credit: Mercury Research, compiled by Tom's Hardware)\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Server CPUs via Mercury Research Row 0 - Cell 0 3Q24 3Q24 2Q24 1Q24 4Q23 3Q23 2Q23 1Q23 4Q22 3Q22 2Q22 1Q22 4Q21 3Q21 2Q21 1Q21 4Q20 3Q20 2Q20 1Q20 4Q19 3Q19 2Q19 1Q2019 4Q18 3Q18 2Q18 4Q17 AMD Server Unit Share 25.1% 24.2% 24.1% 23.6% 23.1% 23.3% 18.6% 18% 17.6% 17.5% 13.9% 11.6% 10.7% 10.2% 9.5% 8.9% 7.1% 6.6% 5.8% 5.1% 4.5% 4.3% 3.4% 2.9% 3.2% 1.6% 1.4% 0.8% Quarter over Quarter / Year over Year (pp) 0.9% / 2% +0.1% / +0.9% +0.5 / + 5.6 +0.5 / +5.6 -0.2 / 5.5 4.7 / 5.8 0.6 / 4.7 +0.4 / +6.3 +0.1 / +6.9 +3.6 / +7.3 +2.3 / +4.4 +0.9 / +2.7 +0.5% / +3.6 +0.7 / +3.6 +0.6 / +3.7 +1.8 / +3.8 +0.5 / +2.6 +0.8 / +2.3 +0.7 / +2.4 +0.6 / 2.2 +0.2 / +1.4 +0.9 / +2.7 +0.5 / +2.0 -0.3 / - +1.6 / 2.4 +0.2 / - Row 2 - Cell 27 Row 2 - Cell 28\n\nIn the server CPU market, AMD continued its momentum, achieving a record-high market share in the fourth quarter of 2024. The company's unit share reached 25.1%, reflecting a 2% increase year-over-year and a modest 0.9% gain quarter-over-quarter. While Intel's Xeons still power three servers out of four, it is getting harder for Intel to maintain this lead, which leads to discounts and lower ASPs.\n\nOn the revenue side, AMD's server revenue share surged to 35.5%, marking an impressive 3.7-point YoY increase and a 1.6-point QoQ gain. This significant jump in revenue share suggests that not only is AMD selling more server processors, but it is also capturing more of the high-margin, high-performance market. In fact, AMD's datacenter group outsold Intel's datacenter and AI business unit in the fourth quarter, whereas Intel's datacenter CPU sales hit their lowest point in 13 years.",

I'm not sure we knew that would mean quite the number of delays and out-of-stock signs that we've seen so far, but we knew there was going to be a slew of new GPU shenanigans to watch out for. AMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT is certainly one of these, and it now looks like we're getting something slightly more than word of mouth regarding its specs and performance.\n\nIt's still very much borne of the ever-churning rumour mill, of course, but from X user HKEPC (via VideoCardz) we have a screenshot of GPU-Z showing a 'Navi 48' GPU, this being codename for the upcoming RX 9070 XT. And the specs? Well, they're in-line with what we expected\u20144,096 shader cores, 16 GB of GDDR6 memory, and a 256-memory bus\u2014but it's nice to actually see these specs on paper\u2013 err, I mean, on-screen.\n\nRX 9070 XT (Navi 48) pic.twitter.com/EjZSfSi1T5February 13, 2025\n\nHKEPC also shared a screenshot of a supposed RX 9070 XT achieving a whopping 211.7 fps in the Monster Hunter Wilds benchmark, albeit at 1080p and with frame gene enabled. But hey, as I discovered in my own testing of this benchmark for our Monster Hunter Wilds benchmark round-up, the game is pretty brutal on the ol' GPU.\n\nFor reference on the core front, by the way, the RX 7800 XT has 3,840 and the RX 7900 XT has 5,376. Just as previous plausible leaks had it, then: the 9070 XT sitting between the two in core/CU count. Again corroborating these previous leaks, we're (supposedly) looking at a higher boost clock for the RX 9070 XT\u2014in this case, even higher than previously thought at 3,100 MHz, presumably due to a particularly aggressive factory overclock.\n\nRX 9070 XT ? pic.twitter.com/lfivCXgvZ4February 13, 2025\n\nAll very exciting stuff, and we shouldn't have too long to wait for it, either, given Dr. Lisa Su has confirmed the GPU is officially arriving in early March. It might even beat the RTX 5070 to market given that it's rumoured to be delayed until March now, too. Maybe this will make up for AMD's botched CES appearance wherein they showed our eager eyes practically nada of the GPUs.\n\nThen again, Nvidia's just announced a February 20 launch date for the RTX 5070 Ti, so the RX 9070 XT will have that card to go up against. But even then-again-er, Nvidia's recent RTX 50-series launches haven't exactly given us much hope for, y'know, actual stock on shelves.\n\nMaybe that's where AMD can find an advantage: by actually having GPUs available to buy. If it can pull that off while pumping out this kind of Monster Hunter Wilds performance with 16 GB of high-bandwidth memory, preferably for cheap, I'll be one happy chappy. We'll see.",

If you have been following the developments around the RX 9070 GPUs, you must be aware of the specs already but in case you, want to see the specs on an actual tool, then here is one:\n\nImage Credit: @hkpcmedia\n\nThanks to @hkepcmedia for posting the screenshot, which clearly shows the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU being listed as Navi 48 and its release date as 2025.\n\nFrom the specs, it's easier to confirm that it is indeed the Radeon RX 9070 XT, as the GPU features 16 GB GDDR6 VRAM, a 256-bit memory bus, 4096 Stream Processors, and a Boost clock of up to 3.1 GHz. Moreover, the GPU does support the PCI-E 5.0 interface. It's not clear whether it is the reference design or a custom AIB edition, but looking at the boost clock, it does seem like a premium AIB edition.\n\nIn another post, we can see how it performs in gaming scenarios, such as Monster Hunter Wilds Benchmark. Even though it isn't the best platform to test and compare, it gives us a rough idea of how good a GPU is. As revealed in the screenshot, the GPU delivers 36102 points and 211.71 FPS at 1080p resolution when paired with Intel Core Ultra 9 285K and 48 GB RAM.\n\nImage Credit: @hkpcmedia\n\nWe don't know the exact nature of the settings used in this benchmark and whether Frame Gen and RT were On or Off.\n\nAs far as the comparison goes, considering the RTX 4080 Super benchmarks, such as in this case, the overall score and FPS are significantly lower than the RX 9070 XT. In this case, the RTX 4080 Super was paired with Ryzen 9 5900X and the Frame Gen was turned on while RT was turned off. Frame Gen usually result in a lower score (not FPS) as the game considers the actual frames, and therefore, it may not be an ideal situation to conclude.\n\nCredit: Side of Gaming YT\n\nNonetheless, we hope the RX 9070 XT can get as competitive as possible, but it's more important to have aggressive pricing to score a win over NVIDIA's RTX 5070 Ti. We recently saw the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 being listed on a Canadian retailer, starting at $698 and $586 respectively. But since there are still some weeks left before the launch, nothing is finalized yet.\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9000 GPU Lineup (Preliminary):",

            "content": "Broadcom and TSMC might be more balanced chipmaking investments.\n\nAMD was once a hot chipmaker, but it lost nearly 40% of its value over the past 12 months. It lost its momentum as its sluggish sales of gaming chips partly offset its stronger sales of PC and data center chips, and investors started to question the long-term growth potential of its closely watched artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators.\n\nAMD's data center revenue still surged 69% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2024, but that marked a significant slowdown from its 122% growth in the third quarter and 80% growth in the second quarter. That deceleration dampened the bullish hopes that AMD would loosen Nvidia's iron grip on the AI market with its cheaper AI accelerators. In the PC market, AMD's share of the discrete GPU market also shrank against Nvidia's.\n\nFor 2025, analysts still expect AMD's revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to grow 24% and 43%, respectively. Those seem like robust growth rates for a stock that trades at just 23 times forward earnings. However, those estimates might drift lower if its data center business continues to cool off and it falls further behind Nvidia in the gaming market.\n\nAMD isn't doomed yet, but investors might consider investing in more balanced and diversified chipmakers that don't directly compete against Nvidia. Two of those stocks are Broadcom (AVGO -3.56%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -0.93%).\n\n1. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom operates two main businesses: its chipmaking division, which sells a wide range of chips for the mobile, data center, networking, wireless, and storage markets, and its infrastructure software division, which provides enterprise software, security services, and cloud-based services. It significantly expanded both businesses through some big acquisitions (including Vmware in 2023) over the past decade.\n\nBroadcom's chip and software sales are cyclical, but the growth of the AI market is driving more data centers to ramp up their purchases of its networking chips and custom XPU accelerators. In fiscal 2024 (which ended last November), Broadcom's sales of AI-oriented chips surged 220% to $12.2 billion and accounted for 41% of its semiconductor revenue.\n\nThe rapid expansion of that business, along with the stronger growth of its non-AI chip and software businesses in a warmer macro environment, should drive Broadcom's revenue and profits higher over the next few years.\n\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Broadcom's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17% as its EPS rises at a CAGR of 75%. Its stock might seem pricier than AMD's at 43 times next year's earnings, but its broader diversification and more balanced growth justify that higher valuation.\n\n2.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, also known as TSMC, is the world's largest and most technologically advanced contract chipmaker. All of the world's leading fabless chipmakers, including AMD and Nvidia, outsource the production of their smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips to TSMC's fabs.\n\nNvidia's soaring sales of AI GPUs have been driving the growth of TSMC's high-performance computing (HPC) market. In 2024, its HPC revenue surged 58% and accounted for 51% of its top line. Its smartphone chip revenue, which accounted for another 35% of its top line, also rose 23% for the year as new handset sales warmed up again.\n\nThis year, TSMC aims to widen its lead against its two closest competitors, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Samsung, by ramping up its production of its smallest 2 nm chips. It also continues to expand its overseas plants in the U.S., Germany, and Japan to offset the geopolitical risks for its most advanced foundries in Taiwan.\n\nFrom 2024 to 2026, analysts expect TSMC's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 23% and 26%, respectively, as its core markets expand again. Its stock still looks cheap at 19 times forward earnings, but that's probably because its valuations are being squeezed by some near-term concerns regarding the tighter export curbs for AI chips, higher tariffs, and the escalating tensions between Taiwan and China. If those headwinds wane, it should command a higher valuation and rally even higher.",

            "content": "AMD's enthusiast-grade Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \"Strix Halo\" APU has been tested in 3DMark with the Radeon 8050S iGPU offering a huge uplift.\n\nDouble The iGPU For Over Triple The Performance: AMD Strix Halo \"Ryzen AI MAX+ 395\" 3DMark Performance Is Shockingly Good Thanks To Radeon 8050S\n\nLast month, AMD unveiled the ultimate mobile workstation solution in the form of Ryzen AI Max, codenamed Strix Halo. These APUs offer some insane specs, such as up to 16 Zen 5 cores, up to 40 RDNA 3.5 iGPU cores, lots of bandwidth, and a strong set of IO capabilities. While the first PCs and laptops featuring these APUs are on the horizon, it looks like Baudi Forums have published the first results of these massively powerful APUs.\n\nThe leak in question shows an alleged screenshot in 3DMark Time Spy with the GPU tab listing the \"Radeon 8050S\" while the CPU tab lists the \"AMD Eng Sample: 100-000001243-50_Y\". We checked the OPN ID and this seems to be the Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 with the Radeon 8060S instead of the AMD Radeon 8050S iGPU.\n\nImage Source: Baidu Forums\n\nThe difference between the two is that the Radeon 8060S packs the full 40 Compute Units while the Radeon 8050S is configured with 32 Compute Units. The CPU for each iGPU is also different and the one tested here packs 16 Zen 5 cores instead of the 12 Zen 5 cores featured on the Ryzen AI MAX 390. In terms of iGPU, you are looking at over double the iGPU cores versus AMD's current top gun, the Radeon 890M (16 Compute Units). The biggest benefit of this chip is that it offers up to 256 GB per second of bandwidth, which would help the graphics capabilities of this APU.\n\nIn terms of performance, the AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 scored an overall score of 9006, a graphics score of 10,106, and a CPU score of 5571 points in 3DMark Time Spy.\n\n3DMark Time Spy (Higher is Better) Graphics Score 0 4000 8000 12000 16000 20000 24000 0 4000 8000 12000 16000 20000 24000 Intel Arc B580 14700 AMD Radeon RX 7600 10990 NVIDIA RTX 4060 10614 Radeon 8060S (40 CU / Ryzen AI MAX+ 395) 10106 NVIDIA RTX 3060 8746 Arc 140V (8 Xe2 / Core Ultra 9 288V) 3996 Radeon 890M (16 CU / Ryzen AI 9 HX 370) 3367\n\nWhile the CPU score is low, the Radeon 8060S iGPU delivers a fantastic result versus the Radeon 890M, which can only manage an average of 3367 points according to 3DMark's database. This is a 3x improvement over Strix & is amazing. One should also point out that the standard Strix chips have a TDP of 30-45W while Strix Halo APUs will feature up to 120W TDP, a 3x difference.\n\nThe Radeon 8060S with 40 Compute Units performs just on par with other mainstream graphics cards such as the Radeon RX 7600 and GeForce RTX 4060. This is very strong performance for an iGPU and we can only expect updated architectures such as RDNA 4 to further uplift the internal graphics capabilities on these APUs.\n\nAMD's first Strix Halo-powered PCs are expected to land in the first half of 2025, so expect more details and prices of these powerful workstation designs soon.\n\nAMD Ryzen AI MAX 300 \"Strix Halo\" APU Lineup:\n\nSKU Name Architectures CPU Cores Max Clock Cache GPU Cores TDP Ryzen AI Max+ 395 Zen 5 / RDNA 3.5 16 / 32 5.1 GHz 80 MB 40 CUs (Radeon 8060S) 45-120W Ryzen AI Max 390 Zen 5 / RDNA 3.5 12 / 24 5.0 GHz 76 MB 40 CUs (Radeon 8060S) 45-120W Ryzen AI Max 385 Zen 5 / RDNA 3.5 8 / 16 5.0 GHz 40 MB 32 CUs (Radeon 8050S) 45-120W Ryzen AI Max 380 Zen 5 / RDNA 3.5 6 / 12 4.9 GHz 22 MB 16 CUs (Radeon 8040S) 45-120W\n\nNews Source: HXL (@9550pro)",

(NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other AI stocks trending on news and analyst ratings.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, a consortium led by Elon Musk said on Monday that it has offered $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI. Marc Toberoff, Musk\u2019s attorney, confirmed that he submitted the bid for all OpenAI\u2019s assets to its board.\n\nThe offer is a twist to Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s rift that began last August when Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI. The lawsuit accused the company of putting profits before its initial nonprofit mission which aimed to advance AI in a way that benefits humanity.\n\nThe two prominent figures of the tech world are still involved in a legal battle over the future of this AI startup.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI News Making Waves on Wall Street and 12 High-Flying AI Stocks This Week\n\nAnalysts have been skeptical of Musk\u2019s move ever since it came to light.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to be pretty suspicious of this considering that he has a competitor himself\u2026 which is structured as a for-profit company, so I think there\u2019s more than meets the eye here\u201d.\n\nSam Altman has this to say about the bid:\n\nMusk was \u201ca competitor who is not able to beat us in the market and you know, instead is just trying to say, like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna buy this\u2019 with total disregard for the mission\u201d.\n\nPlus, this is what Altman wrote on X as a reply to Musk\u2019s bid:\n\n\u201cNo thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.\u201d\n\nOpenAI was cofounded by Musk and Altman in 2018 as a non-profit, with Musk leaving before the company took off. Musk\u2019s lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman says that the founders originally approached him to fund a nonprofit focused on developing AI to benefit humanity. However, it was now focused on making money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was. We will make sure that happens.\u201d\n\nOn the contrary, Altman said that he has no interest in the offer, stating that OpenAI is not for sale.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "A new rumor suggests that Nvidia's mid-range RTX 5070, previously slated for a launch later this month, has been delayed to early March, per MEGAsizeGPU at X. Its elder Ti-class sibling should still arrive on time. However, considering the infamous RTX 5090/RTX 5080 launch, we cannot comment on GPU's retail availability. If true, it's probably no coincidence that this \"delay\" coincides with AMD's Radeon RX 9070 series.\n\nTo recap, the RTX 5070 was unveiled by Jensen Huang at CES last month, wielding the GB205 GPU at its heart with 48 SMs (6,144 CUDA cores) and 12GB of GDDR7 memory. The GPU offers a 192-bit interface, equating to six memory modules, filled by 28 Gbps GDDR7 ICs for 672 GB/s of bandwidth. Nvidia has set a launch MSRP of $549 for the RTX 5070, which is $50 cheaper than the last-generation RTX 4070. Instead of declaring a definite launch date, Nvidia said the RTX 5070 would supposedly launch with the RTX 5070 Ti in February, but that's no longer true.\n\nRenowned tipster MEGAsizeGPU, in a tweet, alleged that the RTX 5070 is delayed, with retail availability pushed back to early March, likely to thwart AMD's RDNA 4 launch. In light of recent leaked benchmarks putting the RX 9070 XT just behind the RTX 4080 Super (in raster), Nvidia's RTX 5070 marketing may hinge on pricing instead of performance.\n\nThe RTX5070 will be delayed. Instead of February, it will be on the shelf in early March.February 12, 2025\n\nDuring the RTX 50 reveal, Jensen Huang very proudly asserted the RTX 5070 is equal to the RTX 4090 (with MFG), which might be misleading for many unsuspecting consumers. The RTX 5080 barely edges the RTX 4080 Super by just 9%, which is quite disappointing for a gen-on-gen uplift, especially considering the RTX 4080 was 38% faster than the RTX 3080 Ti. In terms of other capabilities, Blackwell offers many new features such as Reflex 2.0, Smooth Motion, Multi Frame Generation, and.... more AI horsepower. Still, it's best to temper expectations and anticipate a 15-20% uplift in (raster) performance, at best, versus the RTX 4070.\n\nBoth cards in the RX 9070 family are reportedly packed with 16GB of memory, and as a result, AMD is marketing these GPUs as 4K-ready. The same cannot be said about the RTX 5070, which might struggle with VRAM-hungry titles at higher resolutions. Even though Nvidia is working on Neural Texture Compression (NTC) technology to reduce texture memory footprint, it's still a ways off from mainstream adoption.",

JR explains that there is mounting pressure among these mega tech companies to invest with \u201chigh conviction\u201d in a quest to fully capitalize on the tantalizing AI opportunities.\n\nAMD, on the other hand, does not seem to be energized to go all-in with attempts to satisfy the AI appetites of the major tech companies, concedes the investor. This is contrasted with Nvidia, which has moved into full-volume production for its Blackwell architecture.\n\n\u201cIf AMD cannot keep up the pace and try and grow faster than Nvidia and Broadcom this year, the gap could be widened even further,\u201d tacks on JR Research.\n\nWith that in mind, JR is playing it safe \u2013 moving to the sidelines with a Hold (Neutral) rating on AMD stock. (To view JR Research\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nWall Street, however, isn\u2019t ready to count AMD out. Most analysts are betting on a comeback, with 24 Buys, 11 Holds, and just 1 Sell, giving the stock a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The Street\u2019s 12-month average price target of $148.03 suggests AMD could climb 34% from here \u2013 if the bulls have it right.

            "content": "AMD wants to know what gamers are \"most excited about in RDNA4.\" Which has got us thinking. What are we hoping for on PC Gamer? Nvidia is now so dominant, it certainly feels like a strong new generation of GPUs from AMD is more important now than ever.\n\nSo here are our thoughts on RDNA 4, is it our last great hope for affordable mid-range PC gaming?\n\nJeremy L, desiccated pixel peeper\n\nAs I've said before, for me pricing is critical. I explained my thinking on this last year, but the short version is that RDNA 4 needs to be priced right from the get go. AMD keeps pricing GPUs too high at launch, getting poor reviews as a result, only to then lower the price a few months later but not make an impact because the PR damage is done.\n\nSo, with all that in mind, what I want is a Radeon RX 9070 XT with raster performance up around an RTX 4080 or 5080 (they're near enough the same, after all) plus better RT than RDNA 3 and upscaling at least as good as DLSS 3 (I don't think it's realistic to ask for DLSS 4 quality) and all for $500 maximum. That's probably too much to ask, but it's what I think AMD needs to deliver to make an impact.\n\nJacob R, forever an optimist\n\nConsidering Nvidia's generation-to-generation improvement is likely to get slimmer as more affordable graphics cards in the series are released, AMD does have more of an opportunity to build something competitive with the RX 9070-series than some might think. That's essentially me hoping for some decent performance-per-dollar stats.\n\nWill RDNA 4 be another 7800 XT? (Image credit: Future)\n\nWith plenty of VRAM and a competitive price, we might end up with something similar to the RX 7800 XT, or RX 7900 GRE, for value for money, which I'm wholly not opposed to. Heck, maybe even something better altogether. Knowing AMD, these cards will be a little too pricey at launch, but throw in some healthy discounts and a decent FSR 4 implementation, and either the RX 9700 XT or RX 9700 might be a sleeper, mid-range GPU to buy by the end of the year.\n\nWait, why am I hoping for discounts\u2014Frank, get your darn prices right!\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAndy E, hardware botherer\n\nAs a long-term FSR user, I'll take anything that can run an enhanced version with better image quality, thanks very much. FSR 3.1 might have made some decent improvements compared to previous iterations, but with the promise of machine learning thrown into the equation, part of me is excited for the potential of a proper DLSS equivalent in the form of FSR 4.\n\nI'll be honest, though, I'm not all that hopeful. Nvidia seems so far ahead of the curve on this one, I doubt we'll be seeing anything quite as powerful as transformer models and Multi Frame Generation bundled with the new cards. Prove me wrong, AMD. You wouldn't be the first.\n\nDave J, jaded\n\nTalking with both Frank Azor and David McAfee after the CES 2025 non-appearance of the RDNA 4 graphics cards was quite a sobering experience. It was all rather downbeat, as though they'd got wind of what Nvidia was going to do that evening when it announced an RTX 5070 with RTX 4090 performance for $549. Now, that was quickly exposed as just experiential gaming performance when Multi Frame Gen is supported, and not actually a $549 GPU with the rendering chops of an RTX 4090.\n\nStill, it forced the RX 9070 off the table and into a delayed March launch. But cards were already in the hands of retailers and ready to go out to reviewers, but promises of optimisations and more information about FSR 4 abound.\n\nWhat I want to see now is AMD be aggressive about its desires to really deliver on a gaming GPU for the 4K masses (in reality 4K as a resolution is actually dropping in prominence according to the latest Steam Hardware Survey). I want AMD to deliver against the efficiency promises it's made around the new architecture; it said it was being designed to be straightforward to manufacture and that means it should be available in high volumes and at a great price.\n\nMight RDNA 4 offer RTX 5070 Ti performance for $499? (Image credit: Future)\n\nGiven that a March release sees AMD able to get even more cards off the assembly line to add to the GPUs that were already in the channel for the missed January reveal, we ought to see a graphics card launch were you can actually buy the cards on offer.\n\nBut forget being competitive, let's put it at a price that makes it almost foolhardy to pick the relative Nvidia GPU\u2014which will most likely be the RTX 5070 Ti. Give us that level of raw gaming performance for $499 and it will be hard to argue against.\n\nBut if AMD toes Nvidia's line again, pricing its cards a scant few dollars below the Nvidia competition, then again the GeForce feature set is going to come into play and sway many gamers with the promise of higher frame rates. However fake you might consider them to be.\n\nJames B, AMD GPU sceptic\n\nI've not spent an extended amount of time with AMD graphics cards but I'd like the excuse to. The thing I'm looking for from RDNA 4 is good value. I don't necessarily want the best tech, and don't think the RX 9070 line is promising that. I just want a reason to not go for Nvidia's 50 line. Better FSR to compete with recent DLSS improvements and a boost to ray tracing would help. Competition in the GPU space is good and I'd like the chance to show that with my wallet.\n\nJacob F, cloud gazer\n\nAll I want from RDNA 4 is something to make me feel justified in splashing the cash on a graphics card again. I haven't had that since Nvidia's RTX 3060 Ti, which I'm still rocking today. It's kept up with all the games I like to play, but it's pushing it a bit, now, in this new RTX-by-default era.\n\nWhat this means in practice is that I'd like RDNA 4 graphics cards to deliver cheap competition that beats midrange RTX 50-series cards in terms of pure raster performance. I don't even care massively about frame gen, although great frame gen performance would be a nice bonus.\n\n50-series beating rasterisation pound-for-pound and great upscaling in the lower midrange segment\u2014yep, that's about it. I might actually decide to upgrade this GPU generation if that happens.\n\nNick E, GPU sniffer\n\nWhat I want from RDNA 4 is certainly not what I'll get, partly because it's not a realistic wish and partly because it's AMD. The fundamental architecture of RDNA 3 is absolutely fine\u2014a good balance between out-right compute ability and gaming performance\u2014but its biggest weakness has been the lack of dedicated hardware support for matrix/tensor operations, something that Intel offered right out of the bag with Alchemist (and Nvidia since Turing in 2018).\n\nI know we're finally getting this in RDNA 4 but it's appearing late in the game, and this will be the first revision of the units in a gaming GPU. Historically, every time AMD has introduced something completely new to its graphics processors, it's either been a wild, left-field choice (HBM with Vega, chiplets with RDNA 3) that ultimately transpires to be an unnecessary move or it's been a stripped-down, simplified approach, such as hardware ray tracing in RDNA 2.\n\nWill RDNA 4 be another stripped-down architecture like RDNA 2 the RX 6000-series? (Image credit: AMD)\n\nWhat I'd really like RDNA 4 to offer are compute units that don't have to rely on the driver compiler to correctly implement the dual-issue instructions, to make full use of all the available ALUs; I want to see dedicated hardware for accelerating BVH traversal, rather than doing it through compute shaders; I want to see matrix/tensor cores par with the competition. In short, I want an AMD card that offers the same feature set as Intel and Nvidia, but without a second-place performance.\n\nI don't even care all that much about the price. AMD has been undercutting Nvidia for years but it hasn't made a jot to its share of the discrete GPU market, so if the RX 9070 XT costs $700, for example, then fine. Just as long as it's as good, or better, than the other $700 graphics cards one can buy.\n\nExcept it won't be, of course. For some absurd reason, the multi-billion dollar chip business still operates its graphics division like it's a struggling underdog, a plucky team of poor engineers trying their best against the evil behemoths that dominate the industry. RDNA 4 will end up being cheaper than Blackwell, offer the same traditional rendering performance (aka rasterization), but fall behind on features and cutting-edge technology/performance.\n\nAnd once again, the Team Red faithful will cry 'Just you wait until RDNA 5 comes out, then you'll see!'\n\nIt's a wrap\n\nSo, there you have it folks. Our desperate hopes and dreams for RDNA 4. It's a popular riff that AMD never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity with its Radeon graphics, but there's something in my waters that tells me RDNA 4 is going to be different. It's not long now before we find out.",

            "content": "We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 10 Stocks & An Outfit Better Than DeepSeek. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn his recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer spent nearly all of the show either discussing stocks or the changed environment for AI data center stocks after the DeepSeek selloff. During the selloff, Wall Street's favorite AI GPU stock lost close to $600 billion in market capitalization. Since then, AI data center investors have been greeted with several optimistic earnings call announcements that counter the narrative of DeepSeek leading to lower AI data center capital expenditure and lower demand for its products.\n\nSince the selloff though, the stock still hasn't risen to its former glory. While it dropped by 17% during the day and has gained 12.5% since then, the shares are still down by 6.6%. The shares appear to have regained some of their value due to growing evidence showing that the demand for AI chips still exists.\n\nThe rise is also relevant when we consider Cramer's remarks in the selloff's immediate aftermath. Back then, the CNBC host had outlined that he was watching two key metrics to determine the fate of the AI stock According to Cramer, the first metric is energy spending. Investors have piled into nuclear energy stocks due to the industry's demand for clean energy to power gigawatt data centers. Cramer believes that any drawdown in energy spending or a slowdown of plans such as those to revive the Three Mile Island nuclear reactors could signal a paradigm shift in AI data center investing.\n\nThe second metric is GPU orders. On this front, earnings calls from big tech firms have painted an optimistic picture as no firm has significantly reduced their expenditure. Yet, Cramer had cautioned back then \u201cBut that\u2019s not, necessarily, what people are going to announce, \u2018listen, I\u2019ve decided. . . If this thing only needs one-tenth of the power, one-tenth of the compute, well I\u2019m going to cut my orders by nine-tenths.\u2019 I\u2019ve not heard that yet, but this thing is. . . a steamroll.\u201d\n\nWhile capital expenditure spending by big tech for data centers is an estimate of future capital outlays, a similar metric is the revenue earned by chip manufacturers. On this front, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer based in Taiwan announced in February that it had earned a cool $8.93 billion in January to mark an impressive 39% annual growth. This revenue is from chips that will ship later this year, and it presented investors with insight into semiconductor demand immediately after the DeepSeek selloff. Although, granted that these orders were likely made before the selloff, the shares of the AI GPU stock jumped by 2.7% on the news.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "There are two ways to make a programmable switch that can run network applications and accelerate certain network functions.\n\nThe first and more obvious way to create a programmable switch is to add programmability \u2013 hopefully through the addition of engines that can run algorithms created in the P4 programming language \u2013 into the very fabric of that switch ASIC itself. This is what the now-defunct Barefoot Networks created in 2016 before it went into the gaping maw of Intel in 2019 never to be seen again.\n\nThere was nothing inherently wrong with what Barefoot did with its \u201cTofino 1\u201d and \u201cTofino 2\u201d switch ASICs, although they did run a little bit hot compared to non-programmable switch ASICs of comparable speed. Which stands to reason because nothing is free in this universe, and extra processing always costs extra power somewhere. Given enough time and support from Intel, programmable switches might have taken off at the hyperscalers and cloud builders. Intel got distracted and eventually Barefoot was shelved. In the longest of runs, the hyperscalers and cloud builders may create their own ASICs and they would certainly be programmable in some fashion.\n\nThe other way to create a programmable switch is to do what Cisco Systems is doing with its new Nexus N9300 line of enterprise switches. And that is to take a switch ASIC and wrap a bunch of P4-programmable DPUs around it, offloading the running of those network applications and the acceleration of network functions from the switch ASIC to the DPU.\n\nAnd not surprisingly, Cisco has gone to AMD\u2019s Pensando DPU division, which was created by former Cisco executives, for the DPU it is wrapping around its new Silicon One E100 switch ASIC to create what it calls a \u201cSmart Switch,\u201d an analog to the \u201cSmartNIC\u201d that does network offload functions for server nodes.\n\nPensando was founded by Prem Jain and Soni Jiandani, serial entrepreneurs who along with Mario Mazzola and Luca Cafiero created the Nexus family of switches and the UCS converged server-networking platforms under spinouts for Cisco, which were then spun back in once the development was successful and productized and sold by Cisco. Many expected that the same thing might have happened with Pensando, which was not funded by Cisco, but AMD beat Cisco to the punch when the former acquired Pensando in April 2022 for $1.9 billion. The benefit of the Pensando DPUs \u2013 there are four thus far on the roadmap \u2013 is that they are programmable in P4, a language created just for packet processing, unlike FPGAs that have to be tweaked in their native RTL/VHDL language.\n\nThe switch-DPU hybrid just launched by Cisco is a variant of the server-switch hybrids that we have seen a number of times come out of development but never really go mainstream. Pluribus Networks created one back in 2014, and was eaten by Arista Networks for its intellectual property in 2022. Juniper Networks added X86 cores and FPGA engines to its QFX switches (using Broadcom Trident-II ASICs) in 2015 to create a similar kind of switch, this one aimed at high speed traders who wanted to compute closer to the wire for a latency advantage. Perhaps this time, with its Hypershield AI-powered, automated network segmentation security software as a killer app, the idea will take off. And by putting the DPU in the switch instead of a much larger of server endpoints, Cisco can make this programmable switching more affordable and ubiquitous.\n\nThe Nexus Hybrid Switch-DPU Godboxes\n\nThe heart of the new Nexus N9300 is a variant of Cisco\u2019s homegrown and merchant Silicon One switch ASIC called the E100, which is rated at a fairly modest 4.8 Tb/sec. Cisco has previously launched the P100, Q100, and Q200 variants for routing and the G100, G200, and Q200 variants for switching, and as the name suggests, the whole point for Silicon One is that a single architecture can span a wide range of use cases for switching and routing, from a top-of-rack box all the way put to a datacenter interconnect box.\n\nThe E100s are the first wave of a new line of Silicon One devices that are aimed at switches with relatively low bandwidth but much higher functionality, Kevin Wollenweber, general manager of Cisco\u2019s datacenter and service provider business, tells The Next Platform. While the G100 at 25.6 Tb/sec and the G200 at 51.2 Tb/sec are aimed at spine switches and high capacity AI back-end networks, the E100 is focused more on the enterprise top of rack and network border connectivity use case.\n\nWe are not interested in the Nexus N9300 because it is a high capacity switch, but because it might be a harbinger of things to come.\n\nOur case in point is a 12.8 Tb/sec variant of the Silicon One chip \u2013 Wollenweber didn\u2019t mention the ASIC by name, but the Q200L is the 12.8 TB/sec version on the switching side \u2013 that had eight Pensando DPUs wrapped around it and was created for an unknown number (but multiple) hyperscalers and cloud builders. This was done in the past few years, when hyperscalers and cloud builders were deploying 100 Gb/sec Ethernet switches in the core networks, and by the way, they still are because this machine is in pilots at those hyperscalers and cloud builders and they are getting ready to deploy at initial volumes of thousands of units scaling up to tens of thousands of units, says Wollenweber.\n\nThe Nexus N9300 is a chip off that hyperscaler block, starting with a more modest Silicon One ASIC and a lower number of two different AMD Pensando DPUs. As a refresher, here is the Pensando DPU roadmap:\n\nThe Nexus 9324C switch has the Silicon One E100 paired with four \u201cElba\u201d Pensando DPUs in the box. The Elba DPU launched in 2021 and is the second generation DPU from that company.\n\nThe Elba device was etched using 7 nanometer processes from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, and has 144 custom match processing units, or MPUs, running at 2 GHz for chewing through P4 algorithms as well as sixteen Arm A72 cores running at 3 GHz to assist in network application processing. It also has dedicated data encryption and storage offload engines, the latter of which may not be all that useful in this specific Cisco use case. Here is a block diagram for the Elba DPU:\n\nThe Elba device has a pair of DDR4 interfaces running at 3.2 GHz that support 8 GB to 64 GB of local main memory and 56 Gb/sec SerDes with PAM4 signaling to provide two Ethernet ports running at 200 Gb/sec, which can obviously be split successively to add more virtual ports. The Elba supports 2,000 virtual NICs and 16 million hardware queues and has ROCE v2 latency reduction to memory.\n\nThe Nexus N9324C is configured at 24 ports running at 100 Gb/sec, but the services throughput runs at 800 Gb/sec speeds. It is aimed at cloud and edge, zone segmentation, and datacenter interconnect use cases. It will be available in April.\n\nThe other hybrid Cisco switch is the Nexus N9348Y, which has the same Silicon One E100 switch ASIC, but it is surrounded by a pair of the newer generation \u201cGiglio\u201d DPUs from AMD, which were announced in 2023. We don\u2019t have a block diagram for the Giglio DPU, but we know that it is a version of the 7 nanometer Elba chip that has been optimized for low power consumption and relatively high performance despite that. The Giglio chip handles stateful packet processing (but not stateless as well as stateful like the Elba device) and has DDR5 memory running at 5.6 GHz.\n\nNot only are the DPU types and counts different with the Nexus N9348Y, but the ports on the E100 are carved up differently and matched to an actual top of rack configuration that is typical in the enterprise, where 25 Gb/sec is still a common speed for an Ethernet port out of a node. (It is still common in the clouds, too.) This switch comes with 48 ports running at 25 Gb/sec plus six uplinks running at 400 Gb/sec and two other ports running at 100 Gb/sec. This one will be available in August this year.\n\nThere is, of course, a software-defined angle to this, which Cisco says will save customers a bunch of money. Here are two total cost of ownership comparisons that the company has from two large banks, one deploying a firewall to replace an appliance from rival Juniper Networks and another replacing two firewalls interlinked with four switches with a pair of the Nexus N9300s:\n\nThese comparisons include the cost of Cisco\u2019s Hypershield security software. It would have been useful to see the raw data behind these charts, so we would know precisely what was being compared and over what term.",

That bandwidth will be divvied up across your choice of either 24 x 100 Gbps ports or a top-of-rack (ToR) appliance with 48 x 25 Gbps ports, two 100 Gbps, and six 400 Gbps ports.\n\nHowever, the switches' real party trick is the inclusion of those Pensando DPUs that, as their name suggests, are designed to offload data-intensive networking, security, or storage workloads from the rest of the appliance.\n\nTraditionally, when we've talked about DPUs, we were referring to SmartNIC-type devices, such as Nvidia's BlueField or Marvell's Octeon family of network add-in cards. And while AMD also offers its Pensando DPUs in this form factor \u2013 an add-on card you and I can buy for servers and similar machines \u2013 its P4 processing engines can also be included in switches sold by the likes of Cisco.\n\nOne notable benefit to this approach of putting DPUs into switches is that data processing can be handled by the ToR box rather than requiring individual connected systems to be equipped with a pricey DPU card of their own.\n\nIn the case of Cisco's N9300 smart switches, its E100 switch ASIC will handle the bulk of the networking duty, while security and other services are offloaded to the included DPU.\n\nIn-depth commentary...

Instead, Cisco tells us the 24-port Nexus 9324C will feature Pensando's older Elba generation of DPUs, which features 2 x 200 Gbps Ethernet interfaces, 144 match processing units, 16 Arm Cortex-A72 CPU cores, and dedicated encryption and storage offload engines.\n\nThe larger 56-port ToR switch, meanwhile, features a nearly identical DPU called Giglio which offers the same bandwidth capacity, and match unit and CPU core count, but has been optimized for lower power.\n\nCisco's Hypershield security platform will be among the first services embedded on its DPU-packed N9300 switches. Announced last year, Hypershield is Cisco's take on a hyperscale distributed security service that is designed to run across its portfolio of switches and servers, rather than relying on dedicated firewalls or load balancers to handle the job.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that Pensando's DPUs are by no means limited to accelerating security workloads thanks to their P4 programmability. Cisco says its switches will be able to host and accelerate multiple services.\n\nCisco's 24-port N9300 switches are expected to begin shipping this (Northern Hemisphere) spring, while its larger 56-port ToR switch is slated for release this summer.\n\nWhile these switches are the latest to integrate Pensando's P4 processing engines, they're by no means the first. Cisco and AMD previously teased [PDF] the 8102-28FH-DPU-O which paired a 12.8 Tbps Silicon One Q200L switch ASIC with up to 1.6 Tbps of data processing capacity by way of eight 200 Gbps Elba DPUs.\n\nPrior to AMD's acquisition of the networking startup in 2022, Pensando partnered with Cisco-rival HPE to bake its P4 engines into select switches from Aruba. \u00ae",

However, despite these advances, AMD continues to struggle to fully break free from Nvidia\u2019s overwhelming lead in the AI chip market.\n\nThis backdrop made AMD\u2019s latest earnings report all the more crucial. CEO Dr. Lisa Su hailed 2024 as a \u201ctransformative year\u201d for the company, emphasizing record-breaking revenues, largely fueled by a doubling of the all-important data center segment.\n\nYet, investors remained unimpressed. AMD shares continued their free fall and are now down ~36% over the past year.\n\nOne investor, known by the pseudonym Deep Value Investing, does not believe that AMD\u2019s plummeting share prices are going to stop falling until they reach $100, about 10% below its current level.\n\n\u201cIn my view, investors are waiting for a round number to start a long position in this beaten-up stock,\u201d explains the 5-star investor.\n\nDeep Value notes that there are reasons for optimism about AMD in the long-term. In fact, the investor believes that the company may have a chance at chipping away at some of Nvidia\u2019s data center market share with the launch of its MI350 AI accelerator.\n\n\u201cHowever, the main problem for AMD is that they are late to the party,\u201d notes Deep Value, adding that Nvidia\u2019s GB200 series is already in production, contrasted with the MI350 that is scheduled for mid-2025.\n\nIn addition, AMD is doing well fending off competitors when it comes to the enterprise server CPUs, notes Deep Value, citing the fact that the company holds more than 50% of this market among hyperscalers.\n\nGains are likely coming, predicts Deep Value, just not before another dip sets in.\n\n\u201cI believe the selloff will continue until we see shares trading at $100,\u201d concludes Deep Value, who rates AMD shares a Sell. (To watch Deep Value Investing\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nWall Street remains hopeful that AMD will begin to turn things around soon. With 21 Buy, 11 Hold, and 1 Sell ratings, AMD holds a consensus Moderate Buy rating. Its 12-month average price target of $150.35 implies ~30% potential upside for the year ahead.

            "content": "News Summary\n\nCisco announces the Cisco N9300 Series Smart Switches with a new class of intelligent networking silicon alongside embedded DPUs, reimagining AI data center designs.\n\nCisco Hypershield will be offered as the first service available embedded on the new switches; narrowing the gap between security and networking layers by converging them into a single solution.\n\nFeaturing Cisco Silicon One E100 and AMD Pensando DPUs, complex data processing tasks can be offloaded to the DPUs on the switch to improve both network architecture and security posture.\n\nCISCO LIVE, AMSTERDAM, Feb. 11, 2025 \u2014 Today, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) announced a family of data center Smart Switches, disrupting traditional data center network design by enabling networking and security services in a compact all-in-one solution. Utilizing programmable AMD Pensando\u2122 data processing units (DPUs), the switch functions as a high-capacity, multifunctional service-hosting device, architecturally transforming data centers to simplify their design and make them more efficient. Cisco\u2019s first integrated offering, the Smart Switch with Cisco Hypershield, introduces a new approach to securing AI data centers by fusing security directly into the network fabric.\n\nAs AI workloads multiply, building and managing data centers has become much more complex. Data center operators require a simpler way to design, build, and deploy infrastructure to fully benefit from AI. AI applications must sit where they are needed, whether a massive large language model sitting in centralized hyperscale facilities or a network drone monitoring crop irrigation at the very edge of the network. This shift in where data is created, accessed, and stored requires a new type of simplified data center infrastructure\u2013one that integrates compute, storage, networking, and security in new ways, and allows for automated and predictive operations via simplified management platforms.\n\n\"Data center infrastructure needs be reimagined for both AI training and inferencing workloads that dwarf even the largest enterprise jobs of the past,\u201d said Jeetu Patel, EVP and Chief Product Officer, Cisco. \u201cSimply upgrading data center infrastructure with higher \u2018speeds and feeds\u2019 switches does not address the requirements of modern data centers, which require acceleration of security and network services natively within the data center fabric.\u201d\n\n\"Cisco's innovative approach to data center design, leveraging leadership AMD Pensando DPUs, marks a significant milestone in transforming enterprise infrastructure to address the evolving security demands of data center networks while dealing with the fast paced AI deployments,\u201d said Soni Jiandani, senior vice president and general manager, Networking Technology and Solutions Group, AMD. \u201cOur collaboration with Cisco enables enterprises to achieve high-capacity throughput and impressive network security without compromising on workload performance on Cisco UCS servers or Hypershield enabled platforms. Together, we are paving the way for a new era of intelligent, adaptive, and secure data centers.\"\n\nCisco Smart Switches: a Game Changer\n\nAs AI drives rapid growth, organizations must manage significantly increased power, compute and networking demands. In traditional data center architectures, when each new service required a specific device, growth led to complexity. It also required adding, changing, or upgrading the enforcement of security policies with each new service or workload. Cisco Smart Switches offer a simpler, more efficient and extensible architecture by integrating services directly with the data center fabric, rather than bolting them on top.\n\nBy combining Cisco data center networking, Silicon One, and AMD DPUs, customers can scale services and adapt quickly to evolving business needs, all without the need for any additional hardware. The switches feature two processing engines: a high-performance network processor for stable data transfer and a network services sidecar for agile security processing. Traffic is intelligently steered between the two engines for optimal performance. This architectural shift drives cost savings through hardware consolidation, reduced power consumption, and operational simplicity. Cisco Smart Switches embrace all the capabilities of a NX-OS switch and management through Nexus Dashboard, and will unlock a diverse set of use cases like stateful segmentation, IPSec encryption, enhanced telemetry, DDoS protection and more.\n\nReimagining Data Center Security with Smart Switch and Hypershield\n\nThe first integrated service will combine Cisco Smart Switches and Hypershield to form a new approach to data center security. It will combine an advanced, AI-native, hardware-accelerated, distributed security architecture directly within the data center fabric to:\n\nProvide security that\u2019s melted into the data center network. Hypershield embedded in the switching layer reduces the number of appliances and allows data center operators to create a \u2018micro perimeter\u2019 around each service that makes up a workload.\n\nEnable autonomous segmentation policies. Customers can benefit from automatically updating security policies to the right enforcement points, ensuring consistent security with minimal manual effort.\n\nKeep security posture up to date reducing disruption. Organizations can minimize risks and drive policy lifecycle management at scale by using self-qualifying policy updates before deployment.\n\nEasily extend consistent policy enforcement across multiple domains. With the ability to manage policies consistently across a library of enforcement points in the cloud, on-prem, and on traditional next-gen firewalls, customers now have a single management system with Cisco Hybrid Mesh Firewall.\n\nManage network and security workflows with persona-driven operations. The solution seamlessly integrated into existing processes, and supports common and separate workflows for NetOps, SecOps, or NetSecOps teams using a single solution to maintain connectivity and security.\n\nFusing security directly into the data center network changes the fundamentals of data center security. Combined with Cisco Firewall Threat Defense, new AI Defense capabilities, and Security Cloud Control, Cisco will offer the first Hybrid Mesh Firewall optimized to protect AI applications in the data center and public cloud.\n\nGeneral Availability\n\nThe first available Cisco N9300 Smart Switch, which features 24 100G ports, is targeted for shipment in spring 2025. A top-of-rack model, which will feature 48 25G ports, two 100G ports, and six 400G ports, is targeted for first availability in summer 2025.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nAbout Cisco\n\nCisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide technology leader that is revolutionizing the way organizations connect and protect in the AI era.

            "content": "Advanced Micro Devices(AMD -2.92%) is one of the biggest names in the computing industry but has played second-fiddle to many competitors throughout its lifetime. While it was behind Intel in PC processors for many years, it's now considered a neck-and-neck competitor.\n\nHowever, a bigger computing trend is going on right now that's far more important than the consumer PC market: artificial intelligence (AI) computing. AMD is currently getting smoked by larger rival Nvidia, but can it mount a comeback to emerge as a top AI stock pick?\n\nAMD's Q4 results were a mixed bag\n\nAMD isn't a focused computing hardware business. It splits its revenue into four sectors: data center, client, gaming, and embedded. Each has a particular use case, but the performance from each couldn't be more different.\n\nGaming is exactly what it sounds like, as AMD provides gaming GPUs for PCs and gaming systems like the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. This division is seriously struggling, with revenue falling 59% year over year to just $563 million in Q4. Embedded processors, a business AMD acquired by purchasing Xilinx, also struggled, with revenue falling 13% to $923 million. This division makes processors for specific application purposes and is optimized for lower power consumption.\n\nThese divisions are dragging AMD's total growth rate down and aren't reasons to be excited about the company. However, the other two are. Client revenue, which accounts for all of the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) processors and equipment it places in PCs, was up 58% year over year to $2.3 billion. This was a big turnaround quarter for AMD, as this segment has struggled for multiple quarters in a row.\n\nBut AMD's biggest and most important segment is its data center division, which competes head to head with Nvidia to supply the computing muscle necessary to train AI models. On the surface, 69% revenue growth to $3.9 billion looks great, but it missed analyst expectations by a wide margin. These analysts expected $4.14 billion in data center sales, so it wasn't a small miss.\n\nOverall, AMD's management guided for $7.5 billion in sales for the fourth quarter. With the total coming in at $7.66 billion, it exceeded its own expectations, which is what investors should concern themselves with compared to Wall Street's expectations.\n\nThat didn't save the stock, as it fell more than 6% after reporting earnings and is now at its lowest stock price since late 2023. There are really no signs of AMD catching up to Nvidia in the all-important AI arms race, and the other divisions aren't enough to make up for its runner-up finish. However, a case can be made to own the stock if it provides a deep enough discount that it could be considered a value investment.\n\nAMD's stock looks expensive by one measure and cheap by another\n\nDespite AMD's shortcomings and its stock price reaching a low not seen in over a year, the shares still aren't all that cheap.\n\nAt 113 times trailing earnings, AMD is an incredibly expensive stock. But that valuation doesn't tell the whole story. AMD is expected to undergo massive earnings growth in 2025, as the average Wall Street analyst expected $3.31 in earnings per share (EPS) this year. That prices AMD's stock at 34 times forward earnings, which a far more reasonable price tag.\n\nHowever, when Nvidia is priced at 28 times forward earnings, why would you consider buying the second-place company for more? That's where I'm at with AMD stock, and I think there are far too many best-in-class investment opportunities available to concern yourself with second-fiddle players like AMD.",

AI runs on the CPU and GPU, but with less efficiency for multitasking.\"\n\nTrivia time! \ud83d\udca1 What is the difference between an AMD AI PC and a non-AI PC? Test your knowledge below. pic.twitter.com/rGjf4OhpdCFebruary 7, 2025\n\nWell, there you have it. Surely that's all the convincing anyone would need to go out and buy a spangly new AI PC with an NPU-equipped AMD Ryzen processor, right? AMD clearly doesn't think anyone actually needs to know any kind of specifics about the 'faster and smarter everyday use' bit because we all want our PCs to be faster and smarter. Every day.\n\nThe CPU in my main PC has an NPU (it's an Intel one) but as of yet, it's not been used for anything other than running a single benchmark to see it being used. Last year, I sat through a press briefing from one big system vendor in which it spent a good deal of time explaining why AI and an NPU were going to make things so much better.\n\nI know how an NPU can be used but I'm still totally none the wiser as to what real, tangible benefit they bring to the PC industry as a whole. Let me clarify: With an NPU, one can run a small AI algorithm locally, without having to send lots of data to a distant cloud server, which means you retain far more privacy over your details and content that are being AI'd. Summarising your notes, for example, or improving your CV\u2014that kind of thing.\n\nBut as AMD points out, your PC can do that without an NPU. It just uses the CPU or GPU to do it instead. Ah, but that's less efficient, you might say (or at least, AMD does). How much less efficient is it? Is it slower, a lot slower; does it involve a lot more power, draining your laptop's battery faster or using up more electricity from an outlet?\n\nWithout specifics, in the form of real-world examples being showcased in front of you, I can't imagine anyone will be nodding sagely at AMD's words and being converted into a champion of the AI PC. To be blunt, it's such a weak attempt at promoting AI PCs, that AMD has potentially done more damage than good.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWhile X isn't well-known for inviting reasoned and well-balanced comments these days, the replies to AMD's post are not in the least bit surprising. \"Scam,\" writes one user, whereas another expounds more with \"I'm good with the non-AI PC. I can't really think of anything AI does which would benefit me as an actual creator.\" Only one reply was positive, though there was not a great deal there at the time of writing.\n\nYour next machine (Image credit: Future) Best gaming PC: The top pre-built machines.\n\nBest gaming laptop: Great devices for mobile gaming.\n\nTo be fair to AMD, though, I don't think there's any reasoned argument that would make a tech-savvy buyer deliberately seek out an AI PC, even if they're a fan of generative AI or the like. The reason is that such users are already using their non-AI PCs to do all of this, either via the cloud or locally via the GPU. An NPU can be used to handle a RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) algorithm, to improve the results from a locally-run LLM but I've not seen any general-use software do this yet.\n\nAMD's latest laptop processors are fantastic chips, and any one of those paired with an Nvidia RTX GPU will make for a potent computer capable of blasting through AI workloads. If your portable PC is on its last legs, then by all means, grab an AMD 'AI PC' and enjoy a blisteringly quick computer, that's equally capable of gaming and content creation. The fact that it will sport an NPU doesn't really add to that, though at least it doesn't detract from it.\n\nCutting-edge technology always needs a 'killer app' to make it really take off but we've yet to see that for the little NPU. Until then, it looks like we'll just have to put up with more half-hearted marketing exercises that will leave us all still wondering the same thing: What use is AI to me?",

However, the 69% growth in the company\u2019s data center revenue lagged expectations, disappointing investors as they await AMD to reflect strong artificial intelligence (AI) tailwinds like rival Nvidia (NVDA). Nonetheless, Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers remains bullish as he believes that AMD stock is currently trading near relative valuation lows and offers \u201can increasingly compelling risk-reward looking into mid-2025.\u201d\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving strong buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nRakers reiterated a Buy rating on AMD stock with a price target of $140 following post-Q4 2024 results fireside discussion with CFO Jean Hu and two other executives. Let\u2019s look at the key takeaways from this meeting.\n\nKey Takeaways from Wells Fargo\u2019s Meeting with AMD Management\n\nPatience Vital as Data Center Strategy Plays Out: Rakers highlighted that AMD\u2019s management is confident about the data center product roadmap, but indicated that investors need to have patience as deployment \u201cwill exhibit lumpiness.\u201d The 5-star analyst noted AMD\u2019s focus on executing an expanding data center GPU strategy, with the expectations of a CDNA 4-based MI350X ramp (increased focus on AI training) in the mid/second half of 2025 and path to MI400X product cycle into 2026. While AMD didn\u2019t provide any particular outlook for Instinct GPU (graphic processing unit) revenue, it is positive above winning a notable share over time. Meanwhile, Rakers continues to expect a high single-digit revenue share.\n\nContinued EPYC Server Momentum: Rakers pointed out AMD\u2019s ability to continue to fuel further EPYC server CPU share gains this year. It is worth noting that AMD\u2019s most incremental CPU share gains are expected to be driven by traction in the traditional Enterprise business and momentum in third-party cloud apps. Rakers estimates that AMD\u2019s EPYC shipments have risen at a high-20% CAGR over the past four years compared to the high-teens CAGR decline in Intel\u2019s (INTC) shipments.\n\nStrength in Client CPUs: Rakers stated that several investors have asked about AMD\u2019s solid client CPU results in the second half of 2024 despite a subdued PC demand backdrop. Notably, AMD\u2019s client CPU shipments increased by 34% in 2024 compared to a 7% estimated rise in Intel\u2019s PC CPU shipments. In this regard, CFO Hu explained that the recent client CPU momentum came in due to share gains and customers gearing up for a Windows 10 refresh cycle. Rakers contends that AMD\u2019s momentum in the commercial PC market is an underappreciated future growth driver, given the Windows 10 refresh cycle and the beginning of shipments of Dell\u2019s (DELL) AMD-based Pro lineup in spring.\n\nOverall, Rakers is optimistic about AMD\u2019s ability to continue to win share in the server and PC CPU markets, increasing traction in data center GPUs, incremental operating leverage, and earnings power of more than $6 per share by 2025.\n\nRakers ranks No. 52 among more than 9,300 analysts tracked by TipRanks, with a success rate of 65% and an average return of 23.5%.\n\nIs AMD Stock a Buy or Sell Now?\n\nOverall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on Advanced Micro Devices stock based on 24 Buys, 12 Holds, and one Sell rating. The average AMD stock price target of $147.14 implies 32.5% upside potential. AMD stock has declined about 36% over the past year.\n\nSee more AMD analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure",

Even though there is no other company at the moment that is challenging NVIDIA's flagship Blackwell GeForce products, AMD has decided that they will attack its mid-range and upper mid-range offerings.\n\nAMD hasn't revealed much about the possible pricing of its RDNA 4 GPUs. The company has stayed mostly silent on providing enough details on the Radeon RX 9000 since its reveal at CES. However, as we approach the launch date (March) of the flagship RDNA 4 GPUs i.e., the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070, some reports are suggesting that AMD has finally decided on the prices of these cards.\n\nImage Credit: ithome.com\n\nIt's not yet official, so take this report with a grain of salt. As reported by IT Home, a leaker has indicated that AMD is going \"Aggressive\" in pricing the Radeon RX 9070 GPUs to challenge NVIDIA. So much so that it might affect the sales of its own Radeon RX 7800 XT sales. As per the report, AMD was supposed to halt the production and supply of the RX 7800 XT till the third quarter of 2025, but it has already issued a notice to stop production in January.\n\nThis is to ensure that the RX 9070 GPUs can remain in focus. That said, this report suggests that the RX 9070 series can be priced somewhere around $500-$600, as the RX 7800 XT launched for $500. Since AMD has confirmed that their 70-class GPUs will go against the 70-class GPUs from NVIDIA, it's safe to say that one of the RX 9070 GPUs might be priced between $500 and $600.\n\nCurrently, the fastest RDNA 4 has to offer is the Radeon RX 9070 XT as part of the full Radeon RX 9000 lineup, featuring the Navi 48 die and AMD is possibly going to price it at around $600, while the RX 9070 may launch for $500. This is just our speculation, but this seems rational as NVIDIA also launched its RTX 5070 GPU for $549. If the recent performance leaks are correct, the RX 9070 XT is going to compete with the RTX 5070 Ti, making it a much more appealing choice than the latter for $150 less.\n\nOn the other hand, the RX 9070 should be at least a bit faster than the RTX 5070 for $500 to make it more appealing. It's expected that the RX 9070 GPUs will also bring superior Ray Tracing performance compared to their predecessors and this should be quite enough for AMD to gain some good GPU market share in the mid-range segment.\n\nNews Source: IT Home",

Price remains one such mystery, but recent rumours suggest Team Red is adopting a welcome pricing strategy for its prospective pixel pushers.\n\nAs reported by IT Home, a leaker claims that pricing for Radeon RX 9070 XT and its siblings will be \u201cvery aggressive\u201d. While this phrasing doesn\u2019t indicate any potential MSRPs, it does suggest that we should expect to see AMD undercut Nvidia by a substantial margin.\n\nCuriously, AMD has allegedly cancelled Radeon RX 7800 XT production well-ahead of schedule in preparation for RX 9000 cards. The brand similarly called time on RX 7900 GRE last year. While these two actions could just be in service of maximising attention on the likes of RX 9070 XT, they could also point to potential pricing. If so, a price range of $500-549 may be in the works.\n\nThis would make Radeon RX 9000 Series\u2019 closest competition GeForce RTX 5070, priced at $549 and launching in February. AMD plans to launch its contenders a month later, following a rumoured launch event beforehand. The next few weeks could be very busy in terms of graphics card releases, with RTX 5060 Ti and 5060 potentially launching in the same timeframe.\n\nIt bears repeating that this isn\u2019t an official word from AMD and graphics card pricing is literally subject to change until the very last moment. Even when final MSRPs do arrive, likely alongside performance estimations, it remains wise to temper your excitement until you can lay your eyes on reviews. Of course, you can expect the official thoughts on Radeon RX 9000 Series from Club386 in due course.\n\nWith so many releases to look forward to, not forgetting AMD\u2019s Ryzen 9 9950X3D, make sure you\u2019re following Club386 on Google News in preparation.",

It\u2019s a true 14-incher, smaller than the ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 (Intel), which has a slightly larger 14.5-inch display.\n\nThe chassis is quintessential ThinkPad \u2014 highly durable, with sturdy hinges and an understated off-black matte finish. The keyboard feels solid, complemented by a multi-touch TrackPad with a pleasingly smooth Mylar surface. True to tradition, it also comes with the ThinkPad-standard TrackPoint with its three-button setup. We\u2019ve yet to meet anyone who actually uses this legacy pointing device, but removing it would likely spark outrage among die-hard fans. Meanwhile, the fingerprint reader is seamlessly integrated into the power button for added convenience.\n\nThis article is part of DEVELOP3D\u2019s 2025 Workstation Special report\n\n\u27a1\ufe0fSuscribe here\n\nThe laptop stands out for its impressive serviceability, allowing the entire device to be disassembled and reassembled using basic tools \u2014 just a Phillips head screwdriver is needed to remove back panel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt offers a range of customer replaceable components, including the battery (39.3Wh or 52.5Wh options), M.2 SSD, and memory DIMMs, which thankfully aren\u2019t soldered onto the motherboard. Beyond that, you can swap out the keyboard, trackpad, speakers, display, webcam, fan/heatsink assembly, and more.\n\nThe keyboard deserves a special mention for its top-loading design, eliminating the need to dismantle the laptop from below. Simply remove two clearly labelled screws from the bottom panel, and the keyboard pops off from the top.\n\nThere\u2019s a choice of two AMD Ryzen 8000 Series processors: the Ryzen 5 Pro 8640HS (6 cores) and the Ryzen 7 Pro 8840HS (8 cores). Both have a Thermal Design Power (TDP) of 28W. Lenovo has chosen not to support the more powerful 45W models, likely due to thermal and power considerations. 45W models are available in the HP ZBook Firefly G11 A (read our review).\n\nOur review unit came with the entry-level Ryzen 5 Pro 8640HS. While capable, it has slightly lower clock speeds, two fewer cores, and a less powerful integrated GPU compared to the flagship 45W AMD Ryzen 9 Pro 8945HS.\n\nThe machine performed well in Solidworks (CAD) and Revit (BIM), but unsurprisingly came in second to the HP ZBook Firefly in all our benchmarks. The margins were small, but became more noticeable in multi-threaded workflows, especially rendering. On the plus side, the P14s was slightly quieter under full load.\n\nOur review unit\u2019s 14-inch WUXGA (1,920 x 1,200) IPS display is a solid, if not stand out option, offering 400 nits of brightness. One alternative is a colour-calibrated 2.8K (2,880 x 1,800) OLED screen \u2014 also 400 nits, but with 100% DCI-P3 and 120Hz refresh.\n\nThe 5.0 MP webcam with IR and privacy shutter is housed in a slight protrusion at the top of the display. While this design was necessary to accommodate the higher-resolution camera (an upgrade from the Gen 4), it also doubles as a convenient handle when opening the lid.\n\nAdditional highlights include up to 96 GB of DDR5-5600 memory, Wi-Fi 6E, a hinged \u2018drop jaw\u2019 Gigabit Ethernet port, 2 x USB-A and 2 x USB-C. It comes with a compact 65 W USB-C power supply.\n\nOverall, the ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 stands out as a reliable performer for CAD and BIM, offering an impressive blend of serviceability and thoughtful design.\n\nIn an era where manufacturers often prioritise \u2018thinner and lighter\u2019 over repairability, it\u2019s great to see Lenovo bucking this trend, a move that is sure to resonate with right-to-repair advocates.\n\nSpecifications\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 Pro 8840HS processor (3.3 GHz base, 5.1 GHz max boost) (6-cores)\n\nIntegrated AMD Radeon 760M GPU\n\n32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-5600 memory\n\n512 GB, PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD\n\n14-inch WUXGA (1,920 x 1,200) IPS display with 400 nits\n\n316 x 224 x 17.7 mm (w/d/h)\n\nFrom 1.31 kg\n\nMicrosoft Windows 11 Pro\n\n3 Year Premier Support\n\n1,209 (Ex VAT\n\nwww.lenovo.com\n\nThis article is part of DEVELOP3D\u2019s 2025 Workstation Special report\n\n\u27a1\ufe0fSubscribe here\n\n2025 Workstation Special Report \u2013 Features\n\nAMD Ryzen AI Max Pro: the integrated GPU comes of age\n\nAMD Ryzen 9000 vs Intel Core Ultra 200S\n\nWorkstations for arch viz\n\nThe AI enigma \u2013 challenges for workstations\n\nNvidia RTX GPUs for Stable Diffusion\n\nZ by HP Boost: GPUs on demand\n\nWorkstations for reality modelling\n\n2025 Workstation Special Report \u2013 Reviews\n\nHP ZBook Firefly 14 G11 A mobile workstation\n\nLenovo ThinkPad P14s (AMD) mobile workstation\n\nScan 3XS GWP-A1-C24 and GWP-A1-R32 desktop workstations\n\nBoxx Apexx A3 desktop workstation\n\nArmari Magnetar MM16R9 desktop workstation\n\nComino Grando workstation RM",

            "content": "AMD is reportedly planning to price its new gaming GPU range extremely competitively compared with the equivalent Nvidia GeForce RTX 5000 graphics cards. With dwindling market share in the gaming GPU business, it\u2019s absolutely crucial that the new AMD Radeon RX 9070 price is not only reasonable, but aggressively competitive, if it wants to keep the new RTX 5070 at bay, and this latest leak suggests AMD is taking the situation seriously.\n\nSo far, AMD has kept tight-lipped about the pricing of its new GPUs, but with the Radeon RX 9070 release date window drawing near, and the RTX 5070 coming out later in February, it\u2019s essential that AMD get it right. Based on the new RDNA 4 architecture, AMD says the new GPUs will offer \u201cimproved\u201d ray tracing compared to its previous chips, which could help them compete with Nvidia\u2019s latest GPUs too.\n\nThis latest leak comes from the Board Channels forums in China, as reported by tech site IT Home. According to a user called \u201cGhost\u201d on the forum, using machine translation, the pricing of AMD\u2019s new Radeon RX 9000 GPUs is \u201cvery sharp\u201d (in a good way), with pricing that isn\u2019t only expected to make life difficult for Nvidia GeForce RTX cards, but also compete heavily with AMD\u2019s own Radeon RX 7000 GPUs, such as the Radeon RX 7800 XT.\n\nThe latter is currently in short supply, leading to inflated prices, but it used to go for around $499. With the RTX 5070 price already set at $549 at MSRP, it looks as though AMD is going to be pricing its new GPUs in the same league as these two cards. As a speculative guess, based on this information, I\u2019d predict a price of $549 for the Radeon RX 9070 XT, and $449 as the starting price for the RX 9070. If, as rumors suggest, the new cards come with 16GB of VRAM, and are in the same performance league as the RTX 4080, then they could potentially threaten Nvidia\u2019s stronghold in this price bracket.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s only if AMD can genuinely sort out the ray tracing performance of its new GPUs, and improve its upscaling and frame generation tech. Our AMD FSR 4 test at CES looked really promising, with the new AI-based upscaling tech looking significantly better than previous efforts. AMD will need to get this tech supported by lots of games, though, and it will also need to compete against Nvidia DLSS 4 with its new Multi Frame Gen tech.\n\nIt\u2019s looking set to be an exciting time if you\u2019re planning to buy the best graphics card for $500 in the near future. In the meantime, check out our RTX 5080 review to read our thoughts on Nvidia\u2019s latest $999 GPU (if you can find it at that price), as well as our RTX 5090 review, where we test the new flagship graphics card.\n\nYou can also follow us on Google News for daily PC hardware news, reviews, and guides, or join our community Discord to stay in the know.",

            "content": "This compact desktop workstation, built around the gamer-favourite Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor, is also a near perfect fit for reality modelling, writes Greg Corke\n\nThe first AMD Ryzen processor to feature AMD 3D V-Cache technology launched in 2022. Since then, newer versions have become the processors of choice for hardcore gamers. This is largely thanks to the additional cache \u2014 a superfast type of memory connected directly to the CPU \u2014 which can dramatically boost performance in certain 3D games. As we discovered in our 2023 review of the \u2018Zen 4\u2019 AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D, that applies to some professional workflows too.\n\nWith the launch of the \u2018Zen 5\u2019 AMD Ryzen 9000 Series, AMD has opted for a staggered release of its X3D variants. The 8-core AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D was first out the blocks in November 2024. Now the 12-core AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D and 16-core AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D have just been announced and should be available soon.\n\nThis article is part of AEC Magazine\u2019s 2025 Workstation Special report\n\n\ufeff\n\nUK manufacturer Armari has been a long term advocate of AMD Ryzen processors and has now built a brand-new workstation featuring the AMD Ryzen 9800X3D. With a 120W TDP, rising to 162W under heavy loads, it\u2019s relatively easy to keep cool. This allows Armari to fit the chip into a compact Coolermaster MasterBox NR200P Mini ITX case, which saves valuable desk space. Even though the components are crammed in a little, the 280mm AIO CPU cooler ensures the system runs quiet. While the fans spin up during all-core tasks like rendering in V-Ray, the noise is perfectly acceptable for an office environment.\n\nBut this is not a workstation you\u2019d buy for visualisation or in indeed CAD or BIM. For those workflows, the non-X3D AMD Ryzen 9000 Series processors would be a better fit, and are also available as options for this machine. For instance, the 16-core AMD Ryzen 9 9950 has a significantly higher single-core frequency to accelerate CAD, and double the number of cores to cut render times in half.\n\nThe X3D chips shine in tasks that benefit from fast access to large amounts of cache. As we detail in this in-depth article, reality modelling is one such workflow. In fact, in many scenarios, Armari\u2019s compact desktop workstation not only outperformed the 16-core AMD Ryzen 9 9950 processor but the 96-core AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 7995WX as well.\n\nHowever, the workstation is not quite the perfect match for mainstream reality modelling. While the AMD Radeon Pro W7500 GPU is great for CAD, it\u2019s incompatible with select workflows in Leica Cyclone 3DR and RealityCapture from Epic Games \u2013 those accelerated by Nvidia CUDA. Here, the Nvidia RTX A1000, an equivalent 8 GB GPU, would be the better option.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe test machine came with 96 GB (2 x 48 GB) of Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000C30 Expo memory, running at 5,600 MT/s. While the system supports up to 192 GB, anything above 96 GB requires the memory speed to be lowered to 3,600 MT/s. This reduction can lead to noticeable performance drops in some memory-intensive reality modelling workflows.\n\nArmari, true to form, is continually looking for ways to improve performance. Just before we finalised this review, the company sent an updated machine with 48 GB (2 x 24 GB) of faster 8,000 MT/s G.Skill Tri Z5 Royal Neo DDR5 memory, paired with the newer Asus AMD ROG Strix B850-I ITX motherboard.\n\nIn our tests, this new setup provided a slight (1-2%) performance boost in some reality modelling tasks. However, since our most demanding test requires 60 GB of system memory and 48 GB is the current maximum capacity for this memory speed, it\u2019s hard to fully gauge its potential. For the time-being, the higher speed memory feels like a step toward future improvements, pending the release of larger-capacity kits.\n\nHaving more cache probably isn\u2019t the only reason why the 9800X3D processor excels.

            "content": "Despite soaring demand for artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators and market share gains in the PC and server CPU markets, shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.92%) have been slumping over the past year. Since peaking in early 2024, AMD stock has plunged nearly 50%.\n\nRevenue and earnings growth aren't the issue. For 2024, AMD reported a 14% jump in revenue and a 25% rise in adjusted earnings per share. AMD's fourth-quarter results were solid, beating expectations for revenue and including 69% growth and 58% growth in the data center and client segments, respectively. Long story short, things are generally going well for AMD.\n\nThe stock market has a different interpretation, sending shares of AMD lower following that fourth-quarter report. While the big picture looks good, there are a few issues that could be hurting the stock.\n\nDisappointing AI growth\n\nAMD generated more than $5 billion in revenue from its AI accelerators in 2024. That's up from essentially nothing in 2023. While that growth is impressive, the company's outlook for 2025 left a lot to be desired. AMD didn't provide specifics, saying instead that it expected \"strong double-digit growth.\"\n\nThere are two problems with this outlook. First, Nvidia generated more than $30 billion in data center revenue in its most recent quarter alone. On an annual basis, the market leader is outselling AMD by more than 20-fold. If there were ever an opportunity to steal market share, this is it. And yet, AMD's AI chip revenue might only grow to $7 billion or so this year.\n\nSecond, demand for powerful AI accelerators is still booming. Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon have each announced audacious capital spending plans to boost their AI compute capacity, and that's on top of the Trump administration's Stargate initiative. Against the backdrop of this AI spending spree, AMD's AI accelerator outlook is downright disappointing.\n\nIn the long run, AMD does expect its AI business to eventually generate tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. However, an uncertain timeline has investors up in arms.\n\nTrouble in gaming and embedded\n\nAMD's data center and client computing segments are performing well. However, two smaller segments have been struggling. The gaming segment, which will be combined with the client computing segment starting next quarter, suffered a 58% revenue decline in 2024. The embedded segment, which includes AMD's acquisition of Xilinx, saw revenue tumble 33% last year due to excess customer inventory levels.\n\nFor the gaming segment, there's no quick fix. AMD's gaming GPU business has been far behind Nvidia for many years, and new product launches this year are unlikely to dramatically change the story. The semi-custom chip business, which provides chips for the major game consoles, isn't going to rebound until the next generation of consoles launch.\n\nThe embedded segment is particularly disappointing, given how much AMD spent to acquire Xilinx. The embedded segment generated $3.6 billion in revenue and $1.4 billion in operating profit last year, compared to a $35 billion price tag for Xilinx. So far, it's looking like AMD may have overpaid.\n\nIs AMD stock a buy or sell?\n\nAMD stock isn't overly expensive based on adjusted earnings, with a price-to-earnings ratio of about 33. However, a few things are important to remember.\n\nFirst, the data center CPU and PC CPU businesses are almost certain to slow down. The PC market in particular is sluggish, and rival Intel has been getting more aggressive about stabilizing its market share as it looks to turn itself around. AMD stock isn't expensive, but it's not cheap either. A growth slowdown could push the stock lower.\n\nSecond, investors shouldn't discount the possibility that AI is a massive bubble and that the \"tens of billions of dollars\" long-term estimate from AMD for its AI chip business will never materialize. If AMD's AI chip business doesn't accelerate from here, a major component of the company's growth story collapses.\n\nAll that being said, AMD will remain highly competitive in its core data center and PC CPU businesses, regardless of what Intel does. The company's products are great, and the era of Intel dominating those markets appears to be over. AMD makes sense as a long-term investment, but in the short run, the stock could face more challenges in 2025.",

While revenue in the Data Center segment, which houses AMD\u2019s AI chips, climbed a strong 69% year-over-year, the growth rate slowed significantly from Q3\u2019s 122% surge and fell short of analysts\u2019 $4.14 billion target.\n\nMaking things worse, AMD did not provide AI GPU guidance for the full year with a flat first half of 2025 expected although the Lisa Su-led firm anticipates accelerated growth in the latter half driven by the MI350 rollout.\n\nWhile investors wanted more from the outlook, Phillip Securities analyst Yik Ban Chong sees a positive in the Q1 guide. AMD expects first-quarter 2025 revenue of $7.1 billion, reflecting a 30% y/y increase \u2013 its biggest growth rate since a 70% surge in 2Q22. Chong attributes this momentum to strength in the data center and PC segments.\n\nAdditionally, in the PC segment, AMD continues to gain market share against Intel, notching a 52% y/y revenue increase in its Client PC division over the last twelve months. Q4 represented the third straight quarter of over 50% growth, driven by strong demand for its Zen 5 Ryzen 9000 processors and the ramp-up of the Ryzen AI 300 series. The company put the record desktop sell-through share in Q4 down to the \u201cstrong adoption\u201d of new products and anticipates both unit shipments and ASPs (average selling prices) to rise in 2025.\n\nHowever, in the near term, there are other developments that Chong finds concerning, especially regarding the data center business. Despite ramping up MI325 GPU production in Q4, as noted above, the company remained cautious in its outlook for the data center segment in the first half of the year and also failed to provide a specific guide for data center GPU revenue in 2025. This contrasts with its guidance of $5 billion for FY24, a target Ching points out it successfully met. And while the last twelve months data center revenue grew 94% y/y in Q4 \u2013 the strongest increase ever \u2013 Chong thinks there are signs it may be nearing a peak.\n\n\u201cWe may have to wait for the MI350 GPU production ramp in the middle of 2025 before seeing more substantial growth in the data center segment,\u201d the analyst went on to say.\n\nTo this end, Chong downgraded AMD shares from Buy to Accumulate (halfway between Neutral and Buy) while also lowering his price target from $170 to $120. The revised figure implies a ~12% upside from current levels. (To watch Chong\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nLooking at the broader analyst sentiment, AMD has received 35 ratings in the past three months. Among them, 22 analysts remain bullish with Buy calls, 12 take a more cautious stance with Hold ratings, and just 1 advises selling. This mix lands the stock a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Meanwhile, the average price target of $147.14 points to a potential ~37% gain over the next year.

Nvidia \u2013 inevitably - responded with its own results which show the opposite. Because of course they do.\n\nAccording to David McAfee on X, AMD\u2019s RDNA3-based GPU was up to 13% faster than the RTX 4090 and 34% ahead of the RTX 4080 Super. The RX 7900 XTX performed best against the RTX 4090 using DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 7B, where it led by 13%. AMD also tested Distill Llama 8B and Distill Qwen 14B, with its GPU being 11% and 2% faster, respectively. The RTX 4090 had one advantage, it was 4% ahead in Distill Qwen 32B.\n\nAgainst the RTX 4080 Super, AMD's GPU showed larger leads. The RX 7900 XTX was 34% faster using DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 7B, 27% ahead with Distill Llama 8B, and 22% faster using Distill Qwen 14B. Obviously, we can\u2019t be sure quite how Nvidia\u2019s GPUs were configured for the tests and, as AMD ran them, it\u2019s fair to say that Team Red may not have gone out of its way to optimize things for Team Green's hardware.\n\nNvidia fights back\n\nAs Tom\u2019s Hardware points out, the RX 7900 XTX is not widely used for AI, but its RDNA3 architecture includes AI processing capabilities and AMD has marketed this aspect under the \u201cAI Accelerator\u201d label.\n\nShortly after AMD\u2019s benchmarks went live, Nvidia countered in a blog post with its own results, also reported by Tom's Hardware, claiming the RTX 5090 is up to 2.2 times faster than the RX 7900 XTX. Using Qwen 32B, Nvidia reported a 124% advantage, while the RTX 4090 was 47% ahead. With Llama 8B, the RTX 5090 was 106% faster, and the RTX 4090 led by 47%.\n\nThe back-and-forth inevitably highlights the importance of treating manufacturer-released benchmarks with caution. Different optimizations, driver versions, and testing conditions can result in different outcomes.\n\nAre you a pro?

Unless you're a hardcore PC hardware enthusiast who keeps close tabs on new CPU tech, it's not easy making the jump from the familiarity of the Intel Core lineup to that of AMD \u2013- especially considering the daunting task of learning a whole new set of CPU nomenclature, hierarchies, and architectural complexities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven for those with deep pockets, throwing a lot of money at the problem doesn't guarantee the best performance or value. For example, an expensive workstation CPU, such as the AMD Ryzen Threadripper, optimized for productivity tasks, will run games poorly compared to the gaming-optimized Ryzen x3D chips sold at significantly lower price points. Fortunately, there's a method to this madness. The entire AMD lineup adheres to a well-established hierarchy, which makes it possible to zero in on the right CPU for your specific use case.\n\nChoosing wisely from AMD's lineup of Ryzen chips is easier when you have a clear use case in mind (such as gaming or productivity), a specific budget range, and have figured out other limiting factors such as PC form factor (small form factor or full tower) or the need to restrict the processor choice to a specific motherboard chipset you own.

You will have a hard time finding the CPUs on Amazon, but on Newegg, the Ryzen 9 9900X3D and 9950X3D pages are live except that you can't buy them or see their prices.\n\nImage Credit: @momomo_us\n\nThe leaker did help us see the supposed prices of these processors from what seemed like a website that tracks product availability. Each of these chips is pre-listed on Amazon and Newegg, and the latter reveals the price for the Ryzen 9 9900X3D as $599.99, and the supposed price for Ryzen 9 9950X3D as $699.99, which can be seen in the screenshot. In another instance, Newegg shows Ryzen 9950X3D's price to be $712.40.\n\nImage Credit: @momomo_us\n\nThese are the same prices that were attached to their predecessors at the launch time. So, unlike how AMD went with a slightly higher price for the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, the Ryzen 9 9900X3D, & the Ryzen 9 9950X3D supposedly won't have a higher MSRP tag compared to the Ryzen 9 7900X3D and 7950X3D. Still, take this leak with a grain of salt as it's not yet official.\n\nHowever, both AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D and 9950X3D will likely carry these rumored price tags as higher-end X3D chips aren't in such huge demand as the Ryzen 7 series X3D chips. Similar to the Ryzen 7 5800X3D and Ryzen 7 7800X3D, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is selling like hotcakes. If you are familiar with the recent CPU sales, you will see the 9800X3D topping the charts in almost every major retailer.\n\nThis is probably why AMD took its chance to increase the MSRP of AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D by $30 compared to the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. The AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D and 9950X3D are also much better iterations of their non-X3D counterparts compared to their predecessors due to a redesigned CCD with 3D V-Cache underneath. This helps both CPUs retain the same clocks as the non-X3D variants (except for 9900X3D's 100 MHz lower boost) while offering incredible overclocking potential.\n\nOne should expect powerful computing capabilities from both chips apart from leading gaming performance. As per a recent report, the 9900X3D and 9950X3D are going to bring 9800X3D's equivalent gaming performance, which seems obvious. Both CPUs will be launched in March alongside the Radeon RX 9000 \"RDNA 4\" GPU lineup.\n\nAMD Ryzen 9000 \"Granite Ridge\" Desktop CPUs Specs:",

            "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.92%) shares fell following its Q4 earnings report as its data center revenue soared but still came in below analysts' consensus expectations. The stock is now down more than 35% over the past year, as of this writing.\n\nLet's dive into the chipmaker's fourth-quarter results to see if this dip in price could be a buying opportunity.\n\nData center growth in focus\n\nAMD's data center business was in focus when the company reported its Q4 results. The segment's revenue surged 69% year over year and 11% sequentially to $3.9 billion. Both AMD's Instinct graphics processing units (GPUs) and EPYC central processing units (CPUs) helped drive the growth. However, analysts were expecting data center revenue to be $4.14 billion, as compiled by FactSet.\n\nThe company said that its EPYC CPUs continue to gain market share in the data center. Among hyperscalers, AMD now has a market share well above 50% for its EPYC CPUs. Meanwhile, AMD said Microsoft and Meta Platforms are both using its MI300X GPUs. It said it is seeing strong interest in its next-generation MI350 series GPUs, which it plans to ramp up around mid-year. AMD will launch its MI400 GPUs in 2026.\n\nAMD's client segment, meanwhile, also grew strongly, with Q4 revenue climbing 58% year over year to $2.3 billion. AMD said it continued to gain market share in the personal computer (PC) retail space, including having over 70% market share on popular platforms such as Amazon, Newegg, and MindFactory. It is looking to outpace PC market growth in 2025, which it sees rising by mid-single digits. The company continued to see weakness in its video game and embedded segments. Gaming segment revenue plunged 59% to $563 million as its customers Microsoft and Sony worked on normalizing inventory. Embedded sales fell by 13%, hurt by weaknesses in industrial and communication markets.\n\nOverall, AMD's Q4 revenue jumped by 24% year over year to $7.66 billion. Adjusted EPS, meanwhile, soared 42% to $1.09. That beat the analyst consensus for EPS of $1.08 on revenue of $7.53 billion, as compiled by LSEG.\n\nAdjusted gross margins rose 320 basis points to 54%. This shows that the company is not just growing revenue but that its revenue is becoming more profitable as well.\n\nFor the quarter, AMD generated free cash flow of $1.1 billion and and $2.4 billion for the full year. It ended 2024 with net cash and short-term investments of $5.1 billion and $1.7 billion in debt.\n\nLooking ahead, the company guided for Q1 revenue of between $6.8 billion to $7.4 billion. That would represent growth of 30% at the midpoint, showing continued revenue growth acceleration. The growth will be powered by strong growth in its data center and client businesses, offsetting a significant decline in its gaming business and a modest decline in its embedded business.\n\nFor the full year, it forecast double-digit percentage revenue and EPS growth year over year. It sees both its gaming and embedded segments having modest growth.\n\nShould investors buy the dip?\n\nAMD is very unlikely to make any big inroads against rival Nvidia in the data center GPU market. The company just does not have the software platform to compete against Nvidia's dominance, especially in training. The company has carved a decent niche in AI inference as a viable alternative and should continue to see GPU growth as a result.\n\nHowever, instead of viewing AMD as a GPU afterthought, perhaps it's best to view the company as the leading data center CPU company. This is the area where AMD has been thriving and taking market share. CPUs are not as big a component as GPUs when building out AI infrastructure, but they still play an important role, and AMD is seeing strong growth as a result. The company is also gaining share in the PC market as well.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, AMD trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of under 24 times 2025 analyst estimates, with 41% EPS growth projected. That's a relatively attractive valuation.\n\nIf you think AMD is going to be the next big GPU winner, you'll probably end up being disappointed. If you want to play the GPU market and its increasing computing power needs, Nvidia is still the best option. However, if you can appreciate AMD for its strong position in CPUs and its growth in this area, then the stock looks like a solid option to buy on this dip.",

Amazon listings aren't ready right now, but early Newegg listings have the Ryzen 9 9950X3D priced at $699, and the 9900X3D at $599.\n\nPopular Popular Now: Skyblivion, the fan remake of Oblivion in Skyrim's engine, nears completion\n\nAMD already has its Zen 5-based Ryzen 7 9800X3D on the market, kicking ass and taking names where it is released, beating out most processors, and absolutely dominating anything Intel has to offer. The 9800X3D has 8 cores and 16 threads, but the new 9900X3D moves up to 12 cores and 24 threads at up to 5.5GHz, and the flagship 9950X3D sports 16 cores and 32 threads at up to 5.7GHz.\n\n3\n\nThe big difference between the upcoming 9900X3D and 9950X3D comes in CPU cores and threads, total cache, and TDP. The 9900X3D has 12C/24T with 140MB cache and a 120W TDP, while the 9950X3D has 16C/32T with 144MB cache and a higher 170W TDP.\n\nWe should expect gaming performance to fall around the levels we see out of the 9800X3D, but the 9900X3D and 9950X3D will cater to different consumers that are seeking more cores and threads than the 9800X3D has to offer. Leaks suggest we'll see a March 2025 release, so we've only got a few more weeks to wait.",

This doubles the XCD count per AID compared to the MI300. By integrating more compute dies into fewer interposers, AMD could reduce latency and improve efficiency while increasing data throughput, which is critical for AI and HPC workloads.\n\nHowever, as Coelacanth\u2019s Dream points out, \u201cif the MI400 follows a similar CPU Complex Die (CCD) and AID partitioning as the MI300, where some AIDs are dedicated to CPUs rather than accelerators, then the maximum number of XCDs in some configurations could be limited to four, potentially reducing the XCD count compared to the MI300A APU.\u201d\n\nAn intriguing addition to the MI400 is the Multimedia IO Die (MID), which separates the multimedia engine from the AIDs. The MID will likely manage memory controllers, media engines, and interface logic, allowing the compute dies to focus on processing tasks. The patches suggest support for up to two MIDs, probably assigning one per AID.\n\nThis new component could be AMD\u2019s first integration of Versal/Xilinx FPGA technology into its accelerator lineup. AMD announced in 2022 that it planned to incorporate Xilinx\u2019s FPGA-powered AI inference engine into its CPU portfolio. It could also be an Alveo series data center acceleration card.\n\nAre you a pro?

The product pages are live, but the pricing details have not been listed, at least publicly. The source of this information is likely a data scraper, and similar prices shown at PCPartPicker support this.\n\nAMD revealed the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D at CES last month, claiming 20% higher gaming performance versus Intel's Arrow Lake processors. As with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, these CPUs are packaged with AMD's second-generation 3D V-Cache technology with the SRAM chiplet sitting beneath the CCD for improved thermals and higher clock speeds. As only one of the two CCDs (Core Complex Dies) features the 3D cache, the total cache count remains unchanged compared to the last generation.\n\nThe image shared by momomo_us lists several Ryzen 9000 series processors, including the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, priced at $699.99 and $599.99, respectively. As expected, both SKUs are currently out of stock, but they're rumored to hit shelves alongside the Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs next month. Conveniently for us, PCPartPicker also tracked the pricing of these CPUs at Newegg; however, it failed to capture any details about the Ryzen 9 9900X3D.\n\nBased on AMD's latest Zen 5 architecture, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D offers 16 cores and 32 threads, with 144MB of total cache (128MB L3 + 16MB L2) and a 170W TDP. On the other hand, the 12-core Ryzen 9 9900X3D comes with 140MB of total cache (128MB L3 + 12MB L2) and a TDP of 120W. Both CPUs are rated at boost clocks of 5.7 GHz and 5.5 GHz, respectively. However, these numbers likely refer to the CCD without the 3D cache. You can expect some frequency delta between both CCDs, as was seen with the Ryzen 9 7950X3D.\n\nUnlike the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which launched at a $30 premium ($479 MSRP) but is now impossible to find at MSRP, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D seemingly hold the same launch price as their predecessors. Assuming that AMD has sufficient inventory and the prices of these CPUs don't spike up, will the Ryzen 7 9800X3D eat into Ryzen 9 9900X3D sales? That should depend on whether these processors can keep up with their non-X3D counterparts in productivity since they offer comparable gaming performance versus the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which they do, according to an AMD representative.",

Despite a brief positive reaction in stock price following the earnings release, the stock later declined, which Bryson attributed largely to data center performance not meeting market expectations. He noted that expectations for AMD\u2019s AI-related revenue in 2025 have significantly decreased over the past month, contributing to the stock\u2019s recent poor performance.\n\nBryson discussed AMD\u2019s position in the competitive AI and data center market, particularly in relation to Nvidia. He sees AMD as the primary alternative to Nvidia, especially as major cloud providers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) develop their own processors for internal AI inference workloads. However, he believes there\u2019s still demand for a Nvidia-like solution in the market, suggesting that AMD remains relevant due to its similarity to Nvidia\u2019s offerings, providing a plug-and-play alternative that hyperscalers might prefer over custom silicon for certain applications.\n\nThe conversation also touched on the broader competitive landscape involving custom chips, where companies like Broadcom (AVGO) are involved. Bryson pointed out that while custom ASICs are becoming more prevalent for specific internal workloads, where the exact nature of the tasks is known, AMD\u2019s challenge lies in this area. Nevertheless, he remains optimistic about AMD\u2019s market position, arguing that for more general or unpredictable workloads in cloud environments, AMD\u2019s solutions are more versatile and easier to implement than custom chips, maintaining its competitive edge despite the evolving market dynamics.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

(NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other stocks.\n\nThe global economy seems to be at a point where fiscal ambition intersects with market skepticism, says Oakglen Wealth. Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election and the Republican takeover of the US Senate and retention of the House of Representatives resulted in a complicated mix of policy goals. Notably, the broader market\u2019s initial reaction hints at positivity given Trump\u2019s plans for growth, hinting at the continued outperformance of US assets in the year ahead.\n\nSectors To Focus on in 2025\n\nFidelity has an optimistic view of the financial sector, primarily because of steady economic growth for the broader US economy. Since the financial sector is cyclical, the sector\u2019s performance is mainly a function of the strength of the broader economy. The US economy has been showing momentum and a path towards the desired \u201csoft landing,\u201d says Fidelity. Therefore, worries about a mild recession (which could have impacted the financial stocks) are alleviated. One significant difference in market dynamics entering 2025, in comparison to recent years, is the outlook on interest rates.\n\nThe H2 2024 began a new rate cycle, with the US Fed cutting rates for the first time since the initial days of the pandemic. Banks might benefit from higher interest rates due to higher NIMs. On the other hand, lower rates can help boost confidence and decrease the pressure on economic growth, which is expected to be beneficial for virtually all industries in this sector, opines Fidelity. Within equities, Franklin Templeton has an optimistic outlook on IT, health care, energy, consumer staples, and industrial sectors.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nGrowth Drivers Amidst Policy Shifts\n\nAs per Russell Investments, the US economy is resilient as it enters 2025, but the road ahead is expected to be affected by shifting policy dynamics. On the positive side, tax cuts and deregulation can offer a meaningful growth boost, mainly to domestic and cyclical sectors. The investment firm believes that companies leveraging AI technologies to enhance productivity\u2014mainly in industrials and healthcare\u2014 are expected to see material improvements to operating fundamentals.\n\nEven though the mega-cap AI stocks have fueled the market returns over recent years, leadership has been shifting to companies leveraging AI to develop real-world efficiencies. Russell Investments believes that the Trump administration\u2019s policies offer a delicate balancing act. It assumes that the new administration will not aggressively pursue policies that can create inflation risk.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 12 Best Long-term Stocks to Invest in for High Returns, we sifted through several financial media reports related to the best long-term stocks to buy. After getting an initial list of 20 stocks, we chose the ones which analysts saw the most upside to. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of February 6. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 70.1%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 107\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) operates as a semiconductor company. In the server CPU market, the company has been gaining market share with its EPYC line of processors. 2024 was a transformative year for the company as it delivered record annual revenue and strong earnings growth. Notably, data center segment revenue came in at $12.6 billion, an increase of 94% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in both AMD Instinct and EPYC processors.\n\nLooking into 2025, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) continues to see clear opportunities for continued growth based on the strength of its product portfolio and growing demand for high-performance and adaptive computing. S&P Global opines that the positive AI industry outlook and strong momentum for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\u2019s AI products offer a strong foundation for its growth and margin expansion. The company recently launched its next-generation EPYC Turin server CPU, which is expected to further solidify its data center x86 market position, says the rating agency.\n\nFurthermore, S&P Global opines that PC-related orders will improve in 2025. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\u2019s strategic and technological advancements continue to solidify its position as a leading competitor in the AI chip infrastructure. The company wrapped up 2024 with a robust Q4, posting record revenue (which was up 24% YoY), and accelerated earnings expansion while, at the same time, investing aggressively in AI and innovation for long-term growth and value creation.\n\nOverall AMD ranks 1st on our list of the best long-term stocks to invest in for high returns. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Additional data were provided on the durability of aflibercept expression for up to two years. The data were presented by Dante Pieramici, M.D., in an oral presentation titled \u201cPhase 2b Population Extension Cohort Evaluating 4D-150 in Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration: 52-Week Results\u201d at Angiogenesis, Exudation, and Degeneration 2025.\n\n\u201cWe believe 4D-150 has paradigm-shifting potential. 4D-150 is designed to achieve favorable tolerability and robust and durable multi-year efficacy following routine intravitreal administration that enables seamless integration into retina clinics,\u201d said David Kirn, M.D., Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of 4DMT. \u201cThe data from the PRISM clinical trial, which evaluated wet AMD patients with a broad range of disease severity and duration, and the initial data from SPECTRA in diabetic macular edema (DME), demonstrate 4D-150\u2019s potential to become the first backbone therapy forming the foundation for the treatment of vascular retinal diseases. The ability to deliver disease control with long-lasting freedom from frequent bolus injections addresses the primary unmet need for patients and physicians.\u201d\n\nTopline 52-Week Efficacy Results for 4D-150 3E10 vg/eye (Planned Phase 3 Dose) from Phase 2b Population Extension Cohort of PRISM (Data Cut-Off January 15, 2025):\n\nPhase 2b (n=30): Broad Wet AMD Disease Activity Supplemental aflibercept injections : 83% reduction, representing 0.97 mean supplemental injections per patient over 52-weeks vs. 6.0 injections projected with on-label aflibercept 2 mg Q8W 70% 0-1 injection 57% injection-free Improved and maintained best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of +2.2 letters Durable central subfield thickness (CST) improvement with fewer fluctuations, as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT), of -11 \u00b5m; -13 \u00b5m in supplemental injection-free patients\n\nPhase 2b (n=15): Recently Diagnosed Subgroup Supplemental aflibercept injections : 94% reduction, representing 0.33 mean supplemental injections per patient over 52-weeks vs. 6.0 injections projected with on-label aflibercept 2 mg Q8W 87% 0-1 injection 80% injection-free Improved and maintained BCVA of +3.1 letters Durable CST improvement with fewer fluctuations, as measured by OCT, of -10 \u00b5m; -20 \u00b5m in supplemental injection-free patients\n\n\n\n4D-150 Safety Update from PRISM (Data Cut-Off January 15, 2025):\n\n4D-150 continues to be well tolerated during up to three years of follow up in all patients treated with 3E10 vg/eye 2.8% (2 of 71) had 4D-150\u2013related 1+ intraocular inflammation (IOI) (SUN/NEI scales), which were transient 1+ vitreous cells noted at a single timepoint, as previously reported 99% (70 of 71) completed steroid prophylaxis taper on schedule 99% (70 of 71) remained completely off steroids\n\nNo 4D-150\u2013related hypotony, endophthalmitis, vasculitis, occlusive/non-occlusive retinal vasculitis, or choroidal effusions observed to date\n\n\n\n\"The promise of 4D-150 for both patients and clinicians lies in its potential to tackle one of the most pressing unmet needs in vascular retinal diseases\u2014providing a long-lasting, effective treatment option that reduces the frequent burden of bolus anti-VEGF injections,\u201d said Dante Pieramici, M.D., a principal investigator of the PRISM study and member of the 4DMT Ophthalmology Advisory Board. \u201c4D-150 offers a profound shift in how we manage our patients\u2019 care, potentially freeing them from the ongoing challenges of injection frequency while ensuring they maintain the vision improvement characteristic of current standard of care.

It is estimated that the total prevalence of wet AMD in certain major markets, including the United States and the European Union, and Japan, will be greater than 4 million individuals in the next five years. Wet AMD is a type of macular degeneration in which abnormal blood vessels (macular neovascularization or MNV) grow into the macula, the central area of the retina. As a consequence, MNV causes swelling and edema of the retina, bleeding, and scarring, and causes visual distortion and reduced visual acuity. The proliferation and leakage of abnormal blood vessels is stimulated by VEGF. This process distorts and can potentially destroy central vision and may progress to blindness without treatment.\n\nAbout 4DMT\n\n4DMT is a late-stage biotechnology company focused on unlocking the full potential of genetic medicines to treat large market diseases in ophthalmology and pulmonology. 4DMT\u2019s proprietary invention platform, Therapeutic Vector Evolution, combines the power of directed evolution with approximately one billion synthetic AAV capsid-derived sequences to invent customized and evolved vectors for use in our wholly owned and partnered product candidates. Our lead program, 4D-150, is a potential backbone therapy that is designed to provide multi-year sustained delivery of anti-VEGF (aflibercept and anti-VEGF-C) targeted to the retina with a single, safe, intravitreal injection. Our second core program is 4D-710, which is the first known genetic medicine to demonstrate, in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF), successful delivery and expression of the CFTR transgene and initial clinical activity signals after aerosol delivery of a gene therapy. 4D Molecular Therapeutics\u2122, 4DMT\u2122, Therapeutic Vector Evolution\u2122, and the 4DMT logo are trademarks of 4DMT.\n\nAll of our product candidates are in clinical or preclinical development and have not yet been approved for marketing by the FDA or any other regulatory authority.

            "content": "February is Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) Awareness Month, spotlighting 1 of the leading causes of blindness in the United States. Increasing education on the condition can help to identify and treat AMD in its early stages, preventing further exacerbations that could impair vision permanently. Here are 5 things that all should know about AMD during its awareness month.\n\nAMD affects the central vision of those with the condition\n\nBlurring of central vision is the primary adverse symptom related to AMD. Damage to the macula due to aging is the source of the blurring, as the macula can control sharp vision that is at the center of the adult\u2019s vision. AMD is the leading cause of vision loss in adults. AMD can make reading, driving, seeing faces, and performing close-up work more difficult but does not cause complete blindness.\n\nAs its name suggests, AMD is primarily diagnosed in those aged 55 years and older and affects approximately 11 million people in the United States alone. People with a family history of AMD, smoking, and/or are Caucasian have a higher risk of AMD compared with others.\n\nAMD can manifest as 2 different types with different symptoms\n\nAMD can either be wet or dry AMD, commonly referred to as advanced neovascular AMD or atrophic AMD, respectively. Advanced neovascular AMD is characterized through its incidence of abnormal blood vessels growing in the back of the eye and damaging the macular. Advanced neovascular AMD is referred to as a late-stage form of AMD, which all atrophic AMD has the potential of becoming.\n\nAtrophic AMD can present in 3 stages of early, intermediate, and late. The thinning of the macula as a patient gets older is the main symptom of the condition. This type of AMD progresses slower and treatment for late atrophic AMD only recently gained treatment options.\n\nAge-related macular degeneration is a leading cause of blindness and primarily affects older adults | Image credit: Home-stock - stock.adobe.com\n\nThere are few signs and symptoms of AMD\n\nDue to limited treatment options, catching AMD early is the best way to slow the progression of vision loss. However, AMD is known for having few symptoms in the early stages. Early dry AMD has no symptoms at all. Patients with intermediate dry AMD may have mild blurriness in their central vision or issues seeing in low lighting.\n\nThe most common sign of late AMD for either the dry or wet type is straight lines looking wavy, which should prompt immediate medical attention. Other signs of late AMD include blurry areas near the center of your vision, blank spots in your vision, trouble seeing in low lighting, and colors appearing less bright than before.\n\nTreatment for AMD has been the same for several years\n\nThere are not many ways to treat AMD, with the most consistent methods of treatment being anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections for patients with wet AMD and antioxidant vitamins for patients with dry AMD. Anti-VEGF treatments were first introduced in 2005 and include injections of aflibercept, ranibizumab, faricimab, and bevacizumab. The injections, when taken monthly, can help to maintain the vision of patients with wet AMD, though adherence is low due to older adults not being able to maintain the monthly schedule. Higher doses of the anti-VEGF injections are currently being studied to test if duration between injections can be increased without loss of efficacy.\n\nDry AMD is primarily treated through antioxidant vitamins that can help reduce the risk of vision loss. Breakthroughs in treatment options have occurred recently but should only be sought out by patients with special considerations. The FDA recently approved pegcetacoplan and avacincaptad pegol as drugs that target the complement cascade, a part of the immune system identified as a primary cause of AMD. These drugs do not improve vision but can slow development of geographic atrophy by 20%. The ability of stem cells to replace vision cells in people with dry AMD is also currently under investigation.\n\nScreening is the best method for catching and treating AMD\n\nBecause of the lack of symptoms until later stages of the condition, patients should visit their eye doctor annually to confirm the health of their vision and eyes. Eye doctors can check for AMD through the use of optical coherence tomography or a dilated eye exam. The dilated eye exam involves the eye doctor administering eye drops to dilate the pupil, which allows for the doctor to check for both AMD and other eye problems. Optical coherence tomography allows the doctor to take pictures of the inside of the eye, which can help identify any issues with the macula.\n\nIf an individual suspects that they have AMD, swift confirmation from the eye doctor can help to maintain their vision and prevent worsening vision through the usage of effective treatments.\n\nReferences",

The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index is up more than 20% over that time, while Nvidia has soared 160%. AMD fell 0.9% on Friday.\n\nIn a break from recent quarters, the firm led by Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su refrained from giving an annual forecast for its key AI accelerator product in its latest results this week.\n\n\u201cIf you were looking for a catalyst for the next six months, she didn\u2019t give it to you,\u201d said Ted Mortonson, managing director at Robert W Baird & Co., referring to Su. \u201cFor people with large positions wanting a stronger story for the first half of 2025, this was a dead-money call.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s failure to elaborate on generative AI revenue \u2014 after having previously done so \u2014 is a concern that \u201cNvidia is just so far ahead of everyone else and has these huge advantages, which means there could be issues in terms of adoption for AMD chips,\u201d Mortonson added.\n\nThe report featured some bright spots, including better-than-expected revenue and a positive overall forecast. However, Su said she expects sales of AI accelerator chips in the first six months of 2025 to be about the same as they were in the second half of 2024. While things could change after AMD brings out a new chip around the middle of the year, the trend stood out to investors who\u2019ve bet on linear growth in a market that she and her counterparts have said is set to expand for the next few years.\n\nThe disappointment underlined concerns about AMD\u2019s ability to compete at a time when Chinese AI startup DeepSeek \u2014 which recently rocked markets by claiming strong performance with lower costs and fewer chips \u2014 has scrambled calculations for how much more money should be dedicated to AI infrastructure.\n\nCiti lowered its view on AMD in the wake of the earnings report, citing the lack of an AI revenue guidance and seeing \u201cboth downside risk to estimates and a lower multiple given slowing AI growth and margin dilution.\u201d\n\nStory Continues",

Priced at $729, the Lenovo Legion Go S has rolled out with a low-tier Z2 Go chip that\u2019s somehow weaker than the Z1 Extreme but largely performs as well as the $799 Asus ROG Ally X. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a hard sell when you consider Lenovo will release a $599 Windows OS version, $499 SteamOS model, and a more powerful Z2 and/or Z2 Extreme configuration later this May.\n\nThe Lenovo Legion Go S can be an excellent gaming handheld for the right price and configuration that will likely be released later this year. It offers fantastic ergonomics with extra comforts like adjustable triggers and a mini trackpad. The handheld\u2019s 8-inch screen looks fantastically bright and vibrant. However, it has a short battery life that lasts at most four hours while even moderately graphically challenging games. The Lenovo Legion Go S is the perfect gaming handheld for long hours of plugged-in couch gaming and short stints for commuting, but not long flights without power and gaming on the go.\n\n(credit: Kevin Lee / The Shortcut)\n\nFull Review\n\n\ud83d\ude0c Comfortable shape. Lenovo has gone a long way in improving the ergonomics of the Legion Go S. It feels so comfortable to hold for long stretches thanks to its thick handles. The sides of the handheld are curved similar to an Xbox controller, except, of course, there\u2019s a portable PC in between your hands. The textured plastic on the grips also adds a nice tactile grip to the device\u2019s completely smooth plastic surface.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa More vertical pixels. The Lenovo Legion Go S sticks with a large 8-inch screen at a slightly lower 1,920 x 1,200 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. That might feel like a step down from the original Legion Go\u2019s 2,560 x 1,600 144Hz screen, but this device (and handhelds in general) can only realistically run its display at full speed at this lower resolution. More importantly, I very much welcome the 16:10 display\u2019s extra vertical pixels and minimal bezels.\n\n(credit: Kevin Lee / The Shortcut)\n\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Show stealing picture. The Lenovo Legion Go S\u2019 screen is easily its best feature. At 8 inches, it\u2019s just a little larger than the 7-inch screen handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally X and Steam Deck OLED. That extra inch makes all the difference, so I don\u2019t have to squint at everything or hold the handheld closer to my face. It\u2019s also a gorgeously vibrant display that presents colors that just pop off the screen. The 500-nit display is also bright enough to let me take my gaming outside to a park too.\n\n\ud83d\udc8e One-of-a-kind CPU. Internally the Legion Go runs with an Z2 Go processor that\u2019s exclusive to Lenovo\u2019s gaming handhelds. It\u2019s the first chip I\u2019ve gotten to test from AMD\u2019s new Z2 chip lineup, though it\u2019s a bit hard to call it completely new. The Z2 Go features four older Zen 3 CPU cores and 12 RDNA 3 Compute Units. Comparatively, the Z1 Extreme has eight Zen 4 CPU cores and the same set of graphics components.\n\n\u2604\ufe0f David vs Goliath. On paper, the Z2 Go is a step down from the Z1 Extreme, but it keeps up surprisingly well. The synthetic benchmarks might portray a large gap, but the Z2 Go only lagged behind the Z1 Extreme by 5-10 fps in gaming benchmarks. This is largely thanks to how the Z2 Go can tap into more power up to 40W, whereas the Z1 Extreme could only push up to 30W. However, not all is well with the Z2 Go\u2019s performance. Expect some latency spikes and the frame rate to chug occasionally, as the Legion Go S\u2019 four older Zen 3 CPU cores will sometimes cause the system\u2019s performance to bottleneck.\n\n\ud83e\udeab Chews through battery life. Unfortunately, the Z2 Go\u2019s power-hungry nature doesn\u2019t make it a very efficient chip, and that hurts the Lenovo Legion Go S\u2019s battery life. Running at maximum performance mode, the Legion Go S chews through 12% of battery life in just 10 minutes with games like Helldivers 2 and Deeprock Survivor. Even a less graphically challenging 2D cell-shaded RPG like Indivisible used up 11% of the Legion Go S\u2019 battery in 10 minutes \u2013 also switching to Power Saver mode and 1,200 x 800 resolution only reduced battery usage to 6% in 10 mins.\n\n(credit: Kevin Lee / The Shortcut)\n\n\ud83d\ude9a In for the short haul. The Lenovo Legion Go S features a larger 55Whr battery than the 40Whr battery utilized by most of the first-generation gaming handhelds. However, it's only 4,650mAh in capacity. That\u2019s smaller than the 5,000mAh MagSafe battery I attach to my iPhone 16 Pro. At full performance mode, you should expect to get two to three hours of gaming at most, while power saver mode extends it to four hours. Even with quiet mode, you\u2019ll get a maximum of five to six, but that lowers the TDP to 10W, which makes it usable for low-impact, turn-based games like Persona 3 Reloaded and Slay the Spire.\n\n\ud83d\udecb\ufe0f Made for couch gaming. The Legion Go S\u2019 short battery life might not make it the best portable to take on long airplane rides, but its perfect for commutes to work and school. It also works better as a small couch gaming machine I have plugged in all the time, 85% of how I use a gaming handheld anyway. It\u2019s large screen and excellent ergonomics just make it more comfortable to use than the Asus ROG Ally X or Steam Deck OLED.\n\nYou can shorten the tigger pull into a trigger bump (credit: Kevin Lee / The Shortcut)\n\n\ud83d\udc86\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Creature comforts. The Legion Go S has a great overall shape and size, but it also has a few quality-of-life controls you won\u2019t find on most other devices, including adjustable triggers and a small trackpad. The adjustable triggers basically shorten the trigger pull to a lever-based button tap that\u2019s perfect for shooters. The mini-trackpad, meanwhile helps me get around the Windows 11 whenever the touchscreen fails to tell I\u2019m trying to tap a tiny spot on it. I just wished the trackpad area also doubled as a fingerprint reader because it\u2019s the perfect size for one.\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Improved app. Thankfully, Lenovo\u2019s Legion Space software has gotten much better, so I barely have to interact with the Windows 11 interface. The Legion Space app conveniently creates a library of games across different launchers like Steam, Epic, and Ubisoft Connect \u2013 all of which I can start with a simple tap or navigating with the controller buttons. The right-side shortcuts give me plenty of options to adjust the handheld\u2019s display resolution, frame rate, power draw, fan speeds, and more.\n\n(credit: Kevin Lee / The Shortcut)\n\n\u23f8\ufe0f App hiccups. The Legion Space app still has a few rough edges, though. For example, while you can toggle most system controls with controller buttons, some are only touch-interactive. The app also hangs easily, and the performance monitor has also frozen a few times. This may be chalked up to the system's limited CPU cores, but I hope Lenovo continues to improve its software.\n\n\ud83d\udce6 Better configurations to come. Unfortunately the Lenovo Legion Go S\u2019 biggest competitor is itself. The $729 model I tested is hardly the ideal configuration you should buy, as there will be a more affordable $599 model coming later this May with half the storage (512GB) and memory (16GB). Lenovo also plans on releasing a $499 Legion Go S running SteamOS as the first Valve-certified gaming handheld. In May, there will also likely be a Z2 Extreme or Z2 model that offers much better performance too \u2013 and hopefully longer battery life.\n\nShould you buy the Lenovo Legion Go S?\n\nYes, if\u2026\n\n\u2705 You want a personal gaming device for mostly playing games at home and on the couch.\n\n\u2705 You want a gaming handheld that\u2019s ergonomic and comfortable for hours of gameplay\n\n\u2705 You need a bigger screen on your handheld gaming device\n\nNo, if\u2026\n\n\u274c You want a longer-lasting gaming handheld (get the Asus ROG Ally X or MSI Claw 8 Ai+ instead)\n\n\u274c You want a more powerful gaming handheld (this ain\u2019t it yet)\n\n\u274c You\u2019re waiting for a Z2- or Z2 Extreme-powered gaming handheld (wait for other Legion Go S configurations this May)\n\n\u274c You want SteamOS gaming handheld (wait for the SteamOS Legion Go S coming this May)\n\nKevin Lee is The Shortcut\u2019s Creative Director.

            "content": "New GPUs selling out in picoseconds has depressingly become the norm. That includes, inevitably, Nvidia's latest RTX 50-series graphics cards. Maybe that's why when AMD yesterday asked gamers to say what they were most \"excited\" about for the upcoming RDNA 4 GPUs, \"availability would be a brilliant start,\" pretty much sums up the sentiment.\n\nOf course, that wasn't the only response to AMD's consumer and gaming rep, Frank Azor, when he posted, \"What features are you most excited about in RDNA4?\" on X. But the word \"availability\" does pop up rather a lot.\n\nWhat features are you most excited about in RDNA4?February 6, 2025\n\nPricing is another major theme AMD will need to address when the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT arrive in early March. \"Don\u2019t want to pay more for my GPU than I paid for my entire high end gaming rig a year ago,\" was the response from one X user and you get exactly where they're coming from.\n\nNext, upscaling generally and more specifically and as one poster put it, \"FSR 4 is a big one.\" FSR 4 will move AMD into the AI upscaling era, matching the approach Nvidia has been using ever since DLSS was first announced way back in 2018.\n\nThe slight snag is that just as AMD finally catches up in that broad regard, Nvidia has just made the jump from a CNN to transformer model for its upscaling, in some ways dramatically improving quality. Oh, and it has added Multi Frame Generation to DLSS, too. As ever, then, it feels like AMD is constantly playing catch up, always taking on Nvidia with a feature set that's a few years behind.\n\nOn the other hand, AMD can take solace from some of the response on X, many of whom said they just wanted solid raster performance at a great price. \"All I want is much better 'real' frames per $,\" is a comment that probably sums up that line of posting.\n\nBeyond that, one notable absence, relatively speaking, was mention of ray-tracing performance. It's not that nobody mentions it at all, but RT absolutely doesn't rank nearly as highly as availability, general performance, and FSR 4. That's interesting, isn't it?\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nPerhaps predictably, there's something of a chorus of \"give us real frames, not fake frames\" along with some posters suggesting that AMD needn't waste its time knocking up an answer to Nvidia's Multi Frame Generation.\n\nMFG is just the latest in a long line of Nvidia technologies that have caused controversy. DLSS upscaling \"arrived with a thud\" according Nvidia itself, and MFG is splitting opinions, albeit some on PC Gamer are very much convinced.\n\nArguably the real problem with MFG is how Nvidia has presented it. Claiming that the new RTX 5070 is going to match the old RTX 4090, essentially on the basis of comparing the RTX 5070 running MFG to the 4090 running natively, is at minimum dubious marketing. As we now know, the raw performance of the 5080 can't match the 4090. So, the RTX 5070 will be a long way off.\n\nAmong other lesser concerns mentioned in the responses on X are performance per watt, plenty of VRAM, AI performance, driver quality, and video encode and decode features. But more than anything it's that trio of availability, price, and upscaling that seems to matter most. Well, it seems to for the first couple of hundred responses on X.\n\nJump on over to X if you dare and take a look for yourself. As for me, price is key. I said last year, RDNA 4 need to be priced extremely aggressively right from launch. AMD needs to avoid the mistake of pricing too high at launch, suffering poor reviews as a consequence, only to lower the price in fairly short order, but not make much impact because the PR damage has already been done.\n\nWith that in mind, I think a Radeon RX 9070 XT with near RTX 4080/5080 (let's be honest, they're virtually the same) raster performance for $500 maximum is what I want to see, plus a decent RT uplift and FSR 4 upscaling at least as good as DLSS 3.

The integrated Radeon 890M GPU is based on RDNA 3.5.

The highest-end configuration finds the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 375 \"Strix Point\" APU with 12 cores and 24 threads at up to 5.1GHz, but there's the option for the Ryzen AI 7 Pro 360 \"Strix POint\" APU, too.\n\nPopular Popular Now: Skyblivion, the fan remake of Oblivion in Skyrim's engine, nears completion\n\nOn the GPU side of things, we've got the RDNA 3.5-based integrated Radeon 890M GPU that is found inside of the Strix Point APU, but the laptop comes with a huge 128GB of RAM no matter which APU you opt for. AnhPhuH notes on X that all three of the major DRAM manufacturers only have 128Gb x32 modules, and not 256Gb x32, and that the 128GB memory option is only available because of the 256Gb x32 modules.\n\nHowever, while Strix Point APUs can support up to 256GB of LPDDR5X memory, the maximum speed they can support is 8000 MT/s. HP's new EliteBook X G1a specs see support on HP's official website for a higher 8533 MT/s frequency, which is a feat that's even harder when the memory capacity increases (in this case, up to 128GB).\n\nWe'll have to wait for AMD and HP to comment on the matter, to see if Strix Point can indeed support 8533 MT/s, but seeing 128GB of LPDDR5X-8533 would be impressive inside of the EliteBook X1 G1a laptop.",

AMD usually brings the GRE (Golden Rabbit Edition) for Chinese residents in the Radeon series, and just like we had the RX 7900 GRE, the RX 7650 GRE has also hit the market.\n\nJust as you would expect, the RX 7650 GRE is faster than the RX 7600 but slower than the RX 7600 XT. The story is similar to that of the RX 7900 GRE, which falls between the RX 7800 XT and RX 7900 XT. However, the GPU is closer to the slower of the two cards. AMD's board partners, such as ASRock and PowerColor, have unveiled their custom designs for the RX 7650 GRE, namely the ASRock Challenger and PowerColor Hellhound variants.\n\n2 of 9\n\nEach features a dual-fan design, and you should expect slightly higher clock speeds on both of them compared to the RX 7600 editions. The RX 7650 GRE uses the same Navi 33 die as the RX 7600 and RX 7600 XT and boasts 32 Compute Units. While the RX 7600 XT uses 16 GB VRAM, the 7650 GRE retains 8 GB GDDR6 memory from the RX 7600 edition. The memory bus width and the memory bandwidth are the same as well.\n\nComing to the clock speed, the RX 7650 GRE brings a boost clock of 2695 MHz, which is a bit higher than the 2655 MHz boost clock of the RX 7600. However, it is around 645 MHz lower than the 2755 MHz boost clock of the RX 7600 XT. Equipped with a single 8-pin power connector, the RX 7650 GRE is roughly on par with the RX 7600 in power consumption but slightly increases TDP from 165W to 170W. This is still 20W lower than the RX 7600 XT; therefore, the 8-pin connector will be sufficient.\n\nAMD has priced the Radeon RX 7650 GRE at 2,099 yuan, which translates to around $289. This is $20 higher than the launch price of the RX 7600 and $40 cheaper than the RX 7600 XT.\n\nAMD Radeon RX 7000 RDNA 3 GPU Lineup (Updated):\n\nGraphics Card AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT AMD Radeon RX 7900 GRE AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT AMD Radeon RX 7600 XT AMD Radeon RX 7600 AMD Radeon RX 7600 XT GPU Navi 31 XTX Navi 31 XT Navi 31 LE Navi 32 Navi 32 Navi 32 Navi 33 XL Navi 33 Process Node 5nm+6nm 5nm+6nm 5nm+6nm 5nm+6nm 5nm+6nm 5nm+6nm 6nm 6nm Die Size 300mm2 (Only GCD)\n\n522mm2 (with MCDs) 300mm2 (Only GCD)\n\n522mm2 (with MCDs) 300mm2 (Only GCD)\n\n522mm2 (with MCDs) ~200mm2(Only GCD)\n\n150mm2(with MCDs) ~200mm2(Only GCD)\n\n150mm2(with MCDs) 204mm2 204mm2 204mm2 Transistors 58 Billion 58 Billion 58 Billion 28.1 Billion 28.1 Billion 13.3 Billion 13.3 Billion 13.3 Billion GPU WGPs 48 42 40 30 27 16 16 16 Stream Processors 6144 5376 5120 3840 3456 2048 2048 2048 TMUs/ROPs 384 / 192 384 / 192 320 / 160 240 / 96 216 / 96 128 / 32 128 / 32 128 / 32 Game Clock 2.3 GHz 2.0 GHz 1.9 GHz 2.2 GHz 2.1 GHz 2.47 2.2 GHz TBD Boost Clock 2.5 GHz 2.4 GHz 2.2 GHz 2.5 GHz 2.4 GHz 2.76 2.6 GHz 2.69 GHz FP32 TFLOPs 61 TFLOPs 52 TFLOPs 46 TFLOPs 37 TFLOPs 35 TFLOPs 23 TFLOPs 22 TFLOPs TBD Memory Size 24 GB GDDR6 20 GB GDDR6 16 GB GDDR6 16 GB GDDR6 12 GB GDDR6 16 GB GDDR6 8 GB GDDR6 8 GB GDDR6 Infinity Cache 96 MB 80 MB 64 MB 64 MB 48 MB 32 MB 32 MB 32 MB Memory Bus 384-bit 320-bit 256-bit 256-bit 192-bit 128-bit 128-bit 128-bit Memory Clock 20 Gbps 20 Gbps 18 Gbps 19.5 Gbps 18 Gbps 18 Gbps 18 Gbps 18 Gbps Bandwidth 960 GB/s 800 GB/s 576 GB/s 624 GB/s 432 GB/s 288 GB/s 288 GB/s 288 GB/s Effective Bandwidth 3.5 TB/s 3.5 TB/s 2.2 TB/s 2.7 TB/s 2.0 TB/s 476.9 GB/s 476.9 GB/s 476.9 GB/s TBP 355W 315W 260W 263W 245W 190W 165W 170W PCIe Interface PCIe 4.0 x16 PCIe 4.0 x16 PCIe 4.0 x16 PCIe 4.0 x16 PCIe 4.0 x16 PCIe 4.0 x8 PCIe 4.0 x8 PCIe 4.0 x8 Price $999 US $899 US $549 US $499 US $419 US $329 US $269 US $289 US Launch Dec, 2022 Dec, 2022 July, 2023 September, 2023 September, 2023 January, 2024 May, 2023 Feb, 2025\n\nNews Source: Videocardz",

In addition to receiving any treatments an ophthalmologist or optometrist recommends, you may be able to use resources on your smartphone to make everyday tasks easier.\n\nThis condition is caused by damage to the macula in your eye due to the formation of abnormal blood vessels. Without a functioning macula, you may not be able to see details, colors, or areas in your central vision as you should.\n\nApps may be available on your phone to help you monitor your wet AMD symptoms and assist you with everyday tasks such as reading, texting, and identifying objects.\n\nYou may be able to access similar aids on a smartphone. Depending on your phone\u2019s operating system, these features may already be built in:\n\nAs part of your wet AMD treatment plan, a healthcare professional may recommend low vision devices such as handheld magnifiers.\n\nReading and typing helpers can dictate text, often out loud. You can use these tools for longer pieces of text, such as letters and documents, as well as books and other items for leisure reading. Some apps may also type for you with the help of voice commands.\n\nWhile magnifiers can make text bigger and easier to read on labels, signs, and other everyday objects, reading apps can also be helpful when you have wet AMD.\n\nCentral vision loss in wet AMD may understandably reduce your confidence in your everyday mobility. However, there are apps you can download that may help detect everyday obstacles, such as doorways, stairs, and ground debris.\n\nDepending on the app, you may be able to set up an emergency contact who will be notified via text or email if your watch detects a possible fall. Some watches also automatically connect you with 911 unless you cancel the call.\n\nIf you have any of these smartwatches, you\u2019ll need to manually turn on the fall-detection feature.\n\nIf you have an iPhone or an Android phone, you may be able to sync it with a wearable smartwatch such as:\n\nWhen you have wet AMD, your central vision doesn\u2019t work as effectively. This can increase your risk of accidents and falls, which can be even more dangerous if you\u2019re alone.\n\nWhile no app should replace regular visits to an ophthalmologist, some apps can help you monitor your eye health at home in between checkups.\n\nWhen in doubt, you can also ask your eye doctor for their opinion on any particular app.\n\nYou can also ask a loved one to read through the app\u2019s development history. Apps that have been developed with the help of an eye health professional are usually more trustworthy than those that have had no medical input.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure whether a vision app is legitimate, first check its user ratings and number of downloads . If an app has 3,000 or fewer downloads, that\u2019s usually an indication that you should pass it up.\n\nThe world of apps is growing exponentially, and new vision-related apps may be introduced at any time. But keep in mind that not all apps are created equal, and some claims in an app\u2019s description may not live up to the hype.\n\nWet AMD is a progressive condition that can significantly reduce your vision and interfere with everyday tasks. While trendy new vision technologies are on the rise, such devices can cost several thousands of dollars, which means they\u2019re inaccessible to many people.\n\nHowever, there are some lower cost (or even free) apps that you can download onto your smartphone. These apps can help with everyday tasks, such as seeing objects and reading text, and can potentially increase your independence by helping you detect your surroundings.\n\nWhile these apps are not guaranteed to work for you, you might consider testing out one app at a time with a loved one to determine whether it helps with your wet AMD needs.\n\nWhen paired with wet AMD treatment, these apps may significantly increase your quality of life.",

The high-end GPU market faces a significant pricing dilemma, rendering PC gaming less accessible for typical gamers. Competitive pricing from AMD could challenge this issue and would likely be well-received by many PC gamers.\n\nAMD is anticipated to hold a press conference later this month focusing on RDNA 4.

(Intel 18A is the last node in former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger\u2019s comeback plan to surpass Asian foundry rivals TSMC and Samsung.)\n\nHolthaus said all this work provides a \u201cstrong foundation on which to build,\u201d noting that most of the world\u2019s data center workloads \u201cstill run on Intel silicon\u201d along with the company\u2019s \u201cstrong ecosystem, especially within enterprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to leverage these strengths as we work to stabilize our market share in 2025,\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s an important fight for Intel. In November, CPU-tracking firm Mercury Research reported that AMD\u2019s share in the x86 server CPU segment reached 24.2 percent against Intel, which means that the rival is two points from reaching the record it hit in 2006. This, along with AMD\u2019s early success in the AI accelerator chip market, allowed the competitor to make nearly as much data center revenue as Intel did last year.\n\nIntel is also facing a threat in the form of Arm, whose instruction set architecture that has dominated smartphone chips is now the basis for custom server chips designed by Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud for their own infrastructure. In fact, AWS said in December that more than half of the new CPU capacity it brought online over the last two years was based on its Arm-based Graviton chips.\n\nHow Intel Plans To Fight Back In The Data Center\n\nTwo major ways Holthaus said Intel plans to win back server CPU share is \u201cby re-engaging the x86 ecosystem\u201d with the recently formed x86 ecosystem advisory group\u2014which has the backing of Microsoft, Dell Technologies, Google, AMD and other major tech vendors\u2014and by building semi-custom and custom solutions, like it is doing for AWS.\n\nHolthaus also noted that Intel \u201chas a leading position as the host CPU for AI servers, and we see a significant opportunity for CPU-based inference on prem and at the edge as AI-infused applications proliferate.\u201d\n\nAnother element that will help Intel compete is competitive pricing. In response to a question from a Wall Street analyst on whether competitive pricing will weigh down product margins throughout the year, Holthaus said Intel needs to win every deal it can. (Intel reportedly cut the prices of its Granite Rapids CPUs by as much as 30 percent last month.)\n\n\u201cWe have to stem the tide of share loss in data center, and so we will be fighting for every socket in that business. And the way I look at it is we need to be aggressive, we need to win share, and we need to show our customers that they can win with us,\u201d Holthaus said.\n\nIntel Global Channel Chief Dave Guzzi told CRN in an exclusive interview in January that while the company has cut its direct partner coverage by an unspecified amount, it has increased funding for partner incentive and investment programs, which includes money used for winning customer deals when Intel is faced with a competitive bid.\n\nIntel\u2019s Challenges: Arm, AMD And A Delay\n\nWhile Holthaus touted Intel\u2019s Xeon 6 P-core Granite Rapid CPUs as a positive step in becoming more competitive again, she suggested the other side of the Xeon 6 lineup featuring E-cores, known as Sierra Forest, isn\u2019t getting the traction it had hoped for.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is that\u2019s more of a niche market, and we haven\u2019t seen volume materialize there as fast as we expected,\u201d she said.\n\nWhereas the Xeon 6 processors with P-cores continued Intel\u2019s legacy of delivering high-performance CPU cores in servers, the E-core chips are optimized for efficiency, allowing the company to deliver a higher number of cores with lower energy consumption.\n\nWith Intel pushing the E-core processors for cloud-native and telecom workloads, the chips have been viewed as Intel\u2019s response to the high-density, energy-efficient custom Arm-based processors that are allowing Intel\u2019s largest cloud customers\u2014AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud\u2014to lower their reliance on the semiconductor giant.\n\nIntel has also been faced with Ampere Computing, a chip design startup founded by former Intel executive Renee James that provides its own Arm-based processors with high core counts and low energy consumption for cloud-native workloads.\n\nBut while Ampere originally planned to go public through an initial public offering, Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Japanese investment giant SoftBank is in advanced talks to acquire the company, whose primary backer has been Oracle.\n\nOn the other hand, Qualcomm, which has begun selling custom Arm-based chips for PCs, has signaled that it plans to enter the server market with the recent hiring of Intel Xeon chief architect Sailesh Kottapalli, among other developments.\n\nThen there\u2019s AMD, which beat Intel in releasing energy-efficient x86 server CPUs with high core counts for cloud-native workloads in 2023. The chip designer then released a follow-up to its cloud-native server chips last year.\n\nDuring AMD\u2019s earnings call on Tuesday, the company\u2019s CFO, Jean Hu, didn\u2019t seem fazed that Intel planned to fight hard this year, saying that the chip designer \u201calways\u201d assumes that the server CPU market is \u201cvery competitive.\u201d She added that AMD has the \u201cbest lineup\u201d and the \u201cbest\u201d total cost of ownership with its fourth- and fifth-gen EPYC CPUs.\n\n\u201cSo overall, we are actually quite confident about [continuing] to drive the server CPU business,\u201d which is growing in unit sales, average selling prices and market share, she said.\n\nIn the same call, AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su said the company\u2019s server business \u201chas been performing extremely well\u201d between cloud and enterprise customers.\n\nAccording to Su, the company has seen \u201csome strong traction\u201d in the enterprise thanks to go-to-market investments it made last year\u2014which the leader of AMD\u2019s server CPU business detailed in a CRN interview a few months ago.\n\n\u201cThe enterprise sales cycle is often a six- to nine-month sales cycle, but as we\u2019ve invested more resources in it throughout 2024, we\u2019ve seen that convert into a significant number of new [proofs of concept] that are now converting into volume deployments,\u201d she said.\n\nThe other challenge Intel is facing is an internal one.\n\nOn the company\u2019s earnings call, Holthaus acknowledged that Intel\u2019s plan to release its next-gen Xeon E-core product, Clearwater Forest, in the first half of 2026 amounts to a delay from the original 2025 timeframe the chipmaker had given.\n\nClearwater Forest has been seen as a strategically important product in large part because of how it will be the first server CPU to use the Intel 18A node, which the company has repeatedly said will allow it to surpass the advanced chip-making capabilities of TSMC and Samsung. Several months before Gelsinger abruptly left the company as CEO, he said the product would allow Intel to \u201caccelerate share gains.\u201d\n\nDespite the delay, Holthaus said she still has high hopes for Clearwater Forest.\n\n\u201cIt does have some complicated packaging expectations that moved it to 2026, but we expect that to be a good product and continue to close the gap as well. But this is going to be a journey. It\u2019s not a destination,\u201d she said.",

That\u2019s according to comments made by an AMD executive, who confirms that the chipmaker has \u201cramped up production massively\u201d to ensure a good enough supply of X3D gaming CPUs for gamers this year.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that AMD has stomped to a commanding lead in the fight to produce the best gaming CPU over the last few years. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D has been widely lauded as the best of the best, all while Intel licks its wounds with products like the Intel Core Ultra 7 265K, which have failed to impress gamers so far.\n\nIn an interview with TechPowerUp, AMD vice president and general manager for Ryzen CPUs and Radeon GPUs, David McAfee, shared his views on how the chipmaker is performing. Asked what he would say to gamers struggling to buy a 9800X3D, McAfee confirmed that demand had \u201cblown away\u201d the company\u2019s expectations but that it would be \u201cadding significant manufacturing capacity\u201d throughout the year to improve supply.\n\nJust yesterday we reported on AMD outselling Intel for desktop CPUs by a ratio of 9:1 in some stores. Meanwhile, last month, another AMD executive blamed Intel for 9800X3D stock issues due to the \u201chorrible\u201d launch of Intel\u2019s Core Ultra CPUs, leaving demand for AMD\u2019s stock higher than expected.\n\nHowever, McAfee confirmed that AMD was delivering new CPUs to retailers each week to help resolve any stock issues. Increasing the challenge of meeting demand for AMD is that these X3D CPUs have a more involved, longer production time than more conventional chips, due to them needing to have an extra 3D V-Cache chip placed on top of the CPU die.\n\nThe 9800X3D isn\u2019t the only gaming CPU that the chipmaker has to worry about, however. AMD also needs to ensure enough stock availability for the recently announced 12-core 9900X3D and 16-core 9950X3D chips ahead of their launch, especially with 9900X3D launch date rumors suggesting it could see a release as soon as next month.\n\nThankfully, these comments suggest that AMD is well aware of the pressure. With AMD production ramped up, gamers will hopefully see availability for these top CPUs, including the 9800X3D, begin to improve over the next few months.\n\nYou can check out our AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D review for our thoughts on the best processor for gamers on the market right now, even if 9800X3D stock continues to be constrained in the short term.

Four-star-rated analyst Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities reaffirmed his Buy rating on AMD stock, noting that the post-earnings dip could present an attractive opportunity for long-term investors. Meanwhile, Mosesmann lowered his price target for AMD stock from $250 to $225, while still forecasting over 100% growth rate.\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving strong buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nWhat Concerns Investors in AMD\u2019s Latest Results?\n\nAMD stock dropped over 6% following Q4 2024 data center sales of $3.86 billion, which missed the $4.14 billion estimate, despite a strong 69% year-over-year growth. CEO Lisa Su\u2019s projection of a 7% drop in Q1 2025 data center sales has also raised investor concerns. Moreover, the company\u2019s uncertainty around AI chip revenue has raised doubts about its ability to take advantage of the rapidly growing AI market in the short term.\n\nNevertheless, management has provided Q1 2025 guidance with projected revenue ranging from $6.8 billion to $7.4 billion, compared to analysts\u2019 estimate of $6.99 billion.\n\nMosesmann Remains Optimistic on AMD\u2019s Future Growth\n\nMosesmann stays optimistic about the semiconductor giant, challenging the broader belief that AMD is losing momentum. In addition, Mosesmann expressed strong faith in Su\u2019s leadership and believes that the negative sentiment around the company is exaggerated.\n\nIn his report, Mosesmann dismissed worries that custom ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) are taking market share from GPUs (graphics processing units), stating that no one is quickly shifting from AMD and Nvidia (NVDA) to custom ASIC solutions this year. He also pointed out that custom ASICs have not gained a strong presence in the market.\n\nNotably, ASICs are tailored for a specific task or application, while GPUs are designed for general-purpose parallel processing.\n\nFurthermore, he expects AMD to secure double-digit market share in the data center GPU accelerated/AI compute unit segment over the next few years, with a total addressable market (TAM) of $500 billion.\n\nIs AMD Stock a Good Buy Right Now?\n\nOverall, several analysts maintained their bullish stance on AMD stock after its recent results. According to TipRanks, AMD stock holds a Moderate Buy consensus based on 21 Buys, 11 Holds, and one Sell rating. The average AMD share price target of $150.35 implies an upside of 34.23% from its current price.\n\nSee more AMD analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure",

The data center segment, which accounts for AMD's EPYC server CPUs and its Instinct AI accelerators, was the star performer. Revenue rose a whopping 69% to $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter, driven by both product lines. For the full year, AMD sold more than $5 billion worth of its Instinct accelerators.\n\nAMD's PC-centric client segment also shined, with revenue up 58% year over year to $2.3 billion. The company is likely benefiting from Intel's (INTC -4.68%) struggles. Intel's PC chips have been a mixed bag as of late in terms of performance, with its Arrow Lake desktop CPUs particularly disappointing.\n\nWhile AMD's two largest segments grew rapidly, the gaming and embedded segments continued to struggle. Gaming revenue, which includes PC GPUs and semi-custom game console chips, tumbled 59% year over year to $563 million. The decrease was largely due to a slump in semi-custom chip revenue, and a rebound isn't coming until the next generation of game consoles is ready for launch.\n\nIn the embedded segment, AMD is still working against excess client inventories. Revenue was down 13% year over year to $923 million, with the company pointing to mixed end-market demand as another factor driving the decline. While AMD's segments were a mixed bag, the company's overall results were solid.\n\nImmediate Market Reaction\n\nShare prices of AMD were down nearly 4% in early after-hours trading soon after the earnings report was released. AMD met expectations for adjusted earnings per share while beating on revenue, but that wasn't enough to push up the stock. AMD stock has been weak over the past year, down 33% going into the earnings report.\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nAMD expects to generate revenue between $6.8 billion and $7.4 billion in the first quarter of 2025, which represents year-over-year growth of 30% at the midpoint. That's an acceleration from the fourth quarter, although revenue is forecast to be down sequentially.\n\nAMD will likely provide more detail on its outlook during the earnings call. Investors are particularly interested in AMD's forecast for AI accelerator sales this year. Nvidia (NVDA -4.05%) continues to dominate the market, and Intel recently toned down its AI chip ambitions. For AMD stock to rebound, the company's AI momentum will need to continue into 2025.\n\nHelpful Resources",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. tumbled in late trading after giving a disappointing outlook for its data center business, an area where it\u2019s struggling to catch up with AI computing leader Nvidia Corp.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe division will grow by a percentage in the \u201cstrong\u201d double digits this year, AMD said on a conference call with analysts, predicting that the second half would be better than the first. But in an industry that\u2019s seen Nvidia\u2019s sales double during each of the past two years, that wasn\u2019t enough to impress investors.\n\nShares of the chipmaker slid as much as 11% to $106.50 after markets opened in New York on Wednesday.\n\nThough AMD\u2019s fourth-quarter overall revenue topped estimates \u2014 and it provided an solid forecast for the current period \u2014 the data center numbers overshadowed the other results.\n\nThe report renewed concern that AMD\u2019s push into AI equipment has lost some momentum \u2014 confirming the fears of analysts and investors. That sentiment was stoked in recent weeks by the arrival of a Chinese startup with a cheaper approach.\n\nRevenue in the data center division was $3.86 billion during the fourth quarter. That jumped 69% from a year earlier, but analysts had projected $4.09 billion. On average, analysts are predicting that the unit will generate $18.4 billion in 2025. That would be growth of 46% from 2024.\n\nThough AMD won market share from Intel Corp. in personal computers and servers last quarter, that area is less of a growth driver. PC chips brought in $2.3 billion in revenue last quarter, topping the $1.99 billion estimate.\n\nAMD is trying to persuade some of the biggest companies in the world to include its AI products in their data center expansion plans. It\u2019s still playing catch-up with Nvidia in this endeavor. Though AMD now generates more than $5 billion in annual revenue from the accelerator chips that help develop AI models, Nvidia\u2019s sales in this category exceed $100 billion a year.\n\nAMD\u2019s total fourth-quarter revenue rose 24% to $7.66 billion, topping the $7.54 billion estimate. Earnings per share amounted to $1.09, minus certain items, in line with predictions.\n\nTotal sales will be $6.8 billion to $7.4 billion in the current quarter, AMD said. Analysts estimated $7.04 billion on average.\n\nStory Continues",

The vulnerability is that the CPU uses an insecure hash function in the signature validation for microcode updates,\" the Google Security Team said.\n\n\"This vulnerability could be used by an adversary to compromise confidential computing workloads protected by the newest version of AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization, SEV-SNP or to compromise Dynamic Root of Trust Measurement.\"\n\nGoogle security researchers, credited with finding and reporting this flaw to AMD, have also shared a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit (tested on AMD EPYC and AMD Ryzen 9 CPUs) that shows how attackers can create arbitrary microcode patches.\n\nTheir PoC exploit makes the RDRAND instruction on vulnerable AMD Zen processors always return 4, which also sets the carry flag (CF) to 0. This indicates that the return value is invalid and ensures the exploit can't be used \"to compromise correctly functioning confidential computing workloads.\"\n\nThis week, AMD has also received a report from Li-Chung Chiang at NTU (National Taiwan University) detailing cache-based side-channel attacks against Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) that impact data center (1st Gen to 4th Gen AMD EPYC) and embedded (AMD EPYC 3000/7002/7003/9004) processors.\n\nAMD advised developers to follow best practices for prime and probe attacks (e.g., constant-time algorithms), avoid secret-dependent data whenever possible, and follow the guidance regarding Spectre-type attacks.",

Isn't this a warning sign of a market correction?\n\n\"The fact that there are new ways to bring about training and inference capabilities with less infrastructure is actually good,\" said Su, \"because it allows us to continue to deploy AI compute in the broader application space and [with] more adoption.\"\n\nAnd speaking of adoption, Su expects Instinct revenues to increase significantly compared to the $5 billion-plus they brought in during the 2024 fiscal year. The CEO offered only that enthusiastic outlook and resisted committing to a revenue number.\n\nSu did, however, suggest that AMD's strongest growth would come in the second half of FY 2025 (which ends on December 28 and therefore all-but overlaps the calendar year) and be driven by shipments of its next-gen MI355X accelerators.\n\nThose chips were initially expected to ship toward the end of the second half. However, given the performance of early silicon and customer demand, Su said the chip designer now expects to ramp production toward the middle of the year.\n\nFirst teased during AMD's Advancing AI event last fall, the next-gen GPU will use the CDNA 4 architecture and boast dense floating point performance roughly on par with Nvidia's B200 accelerators while delivering 50 percent more memory at 288GB.\n\nSu also took the opportunity to tease AMD's next-gen MI400-series accelerators, which will apparently be offered in a rack-scale architecture.\n\n\"The CDNA-Next architecture takes another major leap, enabling powerful rack-scale solutions that tightly integrate networking, CPU and GPU capabilities at the silicon level to support Instinct solutions at data center scale,\" she said.\n\nSu didn't go into much detail as to what these rack-scale systems will look like, but if we had to guess they'll be somewhat reminiscent of Nvidia's 120 kilowatt NVL72 systems we looked at last spring, only using Ultra Ethernet and UA Link rather than InfiniBand and NVLInk.\n\nAMD isn't the only one that's jumped on the rack scale bandwagon. Last week, Intel revealed its Jaguar Shores GPUs will also embrace the form factor \u2014 assuming they ever make it out of the lab.\n\nAMD downplays AI ASIC threat\n\nOn Tuesday's earnings call, Su also downplayed the threat of custom AI ASICs pose to AMD's GPU business.\n\nCustom silicon for AI workloads has become increasingly common among hyperscaler and cloud providers. In particular, Google and Amazon have now deployed large quantities of their respective tensor processing units (TPUs) and Trainium accelerators to support internal and external model development.\n\nLate last year, Amazon revealed plans to deploy more than 100,000 Trainium2 accelerators under Project Rainier for use by AI model builder Anthropic. Broadcom has told shareholders it sees a pipeline for millions of similar devices.\n\nDespite this, Su doesn't expect dedicated AI ASICs to replace GPUs any time soon.\n\n\"I have always been a believer in you need the right compute for the right workload,\" she said. \"Given the diversity of workloads, large models, medium models, small models, inference... broad foundation models or very-specific models, you're going to need all types of compute and that includes CPUs, GPUs, ASICs, and FPGAs.\"\n\nIn total, Su expects these accelerators to eventually contribute to a total addressable market (TAM) of more than $500 billion. However, she notes that the AI algorithms behind the generative AI boom are still evolving. \"My belief is, given how much change there is still going on in AI algorithms, that ASICs will still be the smaller part of that TAM [total addressable market].\"\n\nAMD Q4 by the numbers\n\nHow this mix will actually shake out remains to be seen, but it's clear from AMD's Q4 earnings the company has a lot riding on its Instinct accelerators, which accounted for roughly a fifth of its annual revenues.\n\nLooking back over the past four quarters, AMD profits nearly doubled during the 2024 fiscal year, surging 92 percent to $1.6 billion. Revenues, for the year, meanwhile were up 14 percent to $25.8 billion.\n\nOf that, $482 million in net income and $7.75 billion in revenues were realized during the fourth quarter. Unsurprisingly, AMD's datacenter division again accounted for the lion's share of the revenues, at $3.9 billion for the quarter, up 69 percent year on year. For the full year, datacenter sales totaled $12.6 billion, up 94 percent, of which Instinct GPUs made up $5 billion.\n\nAMD's client computing division won $2.3 billion in revenues in Q4, an increase of 58 percent compared to this time last year. AMD's gains in this arena aren't terribly surprising considering it recently refreshed both its mobile and desktop products.\n\nHowever, AMD's gaming and embedded divisions continued to struggle in the fourth quarter. Gaming revenues reached $563 million, down 59 percent year over year. Q4 is usually a good season for gaming revenue as high-powered PCs and consoles appear under Christmas trees. Executives pointed to the advanced age \u2013 five whole years! \u2013 of Sony\u2019s PlayStation and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox as a reason for poor performance, as console sales decline as they age meaning demand for the custom AMD processors they include diminishes.\n\nSu suggested the gaming and embedded segment could rebound in 2025 as AMD targets mainstream PC gamers with its Radeon 9000-series GPUs.\n\nAMD's embedded segment, which includes its FPGAs and Adaptive SoC family of products, also declined during the quarter, falling 13 percent year over year to $923 million. According to Su, market demand for FPGAs improved in the aerospace and defense spaces but remains weak among industrial and communications customers.\n\nLooking ahead to the first quarter, AMD is forecasting revenues of $7.1 billion give or take $300 million, an increase of about 30 percent compared to 2024, and a seven percent decline from the prior quarter.\n\nSpeaking of which, AMD's share price dropped about nine percent in after-hours trading, largely due to those quarterly datacenter sales not reaching the $4.1 billion Wall Street had anticipated. \u00ae\n\nMore analysis and commentary: AMD moves up Instinct MI355X launch as datacenter biz hits records",

            "content": "AMD CEO: Annual AI Chip Revenue To Reach Tens Of Billions In \u2018Coming Years\u2019\n\nWith AMD finishing its 2024 fiscal year with more than $5 billion in revenue from its Instinct data center GPUs, the company\u2019s CEO, Lisa Su, says the company expects the AI chip segment to reach tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue in the \u2018coming years.\u2019\n\nAMD CEO Lisa Su said the company expects its Instinct data center GPU revenue to reach tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue in the \u201ccoming years\u201d after it generated more than $5 billion from the AI chip segment last year.\n\nSu made the comments during AMD\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, where she also revealed that the company plans to start shipping its next-generation Instinct MI350 GPUs in the middle of the 2025, sooner than its original target window for the second half of the year. She added that AMD plans to start sampling the chips with customers by March.\n\n[Related: Intel Cancels Falcon Shores AI Chip To Focus On \u2018Rack-Scale Solution\u2019]\n\n\u201cThe customer feedback on MI350 series has been strong, driving deeper and broader customer engagements with both existing and net new hyperscale customers in preparation for at-scale MI350 deployments,\u201d she said.\n\nAMD beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations for fourth-quarter revenue with $7.7 billion, which was 12 higher sequentially and a 24 percent increase from the same period. The two main drivers were its data center segment, which nearly doubled in sales again year over year to a record $3.9 billion thanks in part to a \u201cstrong ramp\u201d of Instinct GPUs, and its client segment, which grew 52 percent year-over-year to a record $2.3 billion on the strength of its Ryzen chips.\n\nTouting AMD as the \u201conly provider with the breadth of products and software expertise needed to power AI across servers, edge devices and PCs, Su said the company made \u201coutstanding progress building the foundational product, technology and customer relationships needed to capture a meaningful portion of this market.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe this places AMD on a steep long-term growth trajectory, led by the rapid scaling of our data center AI franchise from more than $5 billion of revenue in 2024 to tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue over the coming year,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile AMD\u2019s $5 billion-plus of Instinct GPU revenue in 2024 is a fraction of the nearly $80 billion Nvidia made in data center revenue for the first three quarters of its recently completed fiscal year, the figure is nonetheless a significant increase from sales that were likely in the hundreds of millions in 2023 for the company\u2019s product line.\n\nAMD's Expectations For Instinct MI325X, MI350, MI400 GPUs\n\nSu said the company began volume production of its Instinct MI325X GPU in the fourth quarter of last year and touted \u201cnew customer wins\u201d thanks to its \u201csignificant performance and [total cost of ownership] advantages compared to competitive offerings.\u201d\n\nThe MI325X is the follow-up to AMD\u2019s Instinct MI300X that launched in late 2023 as the company\u2019s first significant competition to Nvidia\u2019s data center GPUs.\n\n\u201cWe have also made significant progress with the number of customers adopting AMD Instinct. For example, we recently closed several large wins with MI300X and MI325X at lighthouse AI customers that are deploying Instinct at scale across both their inferencing and training production environments for the first time,\u201d Su said.\n\nAmong the customers adopting Instinct now are Meta, which uses the MI300X exclusively to power its 405-billion-parameter Llama model, and Microsoft, which uses the same GPU, to \u201cpower multiple GPT-4-based Copilot services\u201d in addition to \u201cflagship instances that scale up to thousands of GPUs for AI training and inference and HPC workloads.\u201d\n\nMore than a dozen cloud service providers\u2014including IBM, Digital Ocean and Vultr\u2014use Instinct platforms for new instances, and Su said that number will grow this year. She added that more than 25 MI300 server designs are in production with the largest OEMs and ODMs.\n\nAs for the MI350 series, Su said there\u2019s \u201cvery strong customer demand\u201d for the GPU line, which is expected to boost AI performance by 35 times, the largest leap in the company\u2019s history. And by moving up the MI350 series\u2019 production ramp to the middle of this year, the move \u201cimproves our relative competitiveness,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cIt's a more powerful GPU. [Average selling prices] go up, and you would expect larger deployments that include training and inference in that timeframe,\u201d Su said.\n\nThen in 2026, AMD plans to launch its MI400 series GPUs, which is expected to enable \u201cpowerful rack-scale solutions that tightly integrate networking, CPU and GPU capabilities at the silicon level to support Instinct solutions at data center scale,\u201d according to the CEO.\n\n\u201cWe see significant traction and excitement around what we can do there with rack-scale designs and just the innovation that's going on there,\u201d she said.\n\nHow AMD Performed Elsewhere\n\nWhile AMD\u2019s Instinct GPUs played a major role in the company\u2019s data center growth in the fourth quarter, it also cited an increase in sales of its EPYC server CPUs.\n\n\u201c2024 marked another major inflection point for our server business as share gains accelerated driven by the ramp of 5th-Gen EPYC \u2018Turin\u2019 and strong double digit percentage year-over-year growth in 4th-Gen EPYC sales,\u201d Su said.\n\nThis was driven by a 27 percent increase last year in EPYC-based cloud instances, which now amount to more than 1,000, over 100 of which were stood up in the fourth quarter alone.\n\nAMD also saw EPYC CPU sales grow in the \u201cstrong double-digit percentage\u201d last year for on-premises enterprise deployments, with more than 450 EPYC-based server designs available from top OEMs and ODMs, more than 120 of which came online in the fourth quarter using the company\u2019s latest Turin processors from the likes of Dell Technologies, Lenovo and others.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing growing enterprise pull based on the expanding number of EPYC platforms available and our increased go-to-market investments,\u201d Su said.\n\nGrowth in AMD\u2019s data center and client segments offset a 59 percent year-over-year decline in AMD\u2019s gaming segment, which made $563 million in the fourth quarter, and a 13 percent decrease in the company\u2019s embedded segment, which generated $923 million in the period.\n\nThe company said it expects to make roughly $7.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million, in the first quarter of this year, which would represent a sequential decline of approximately 7 percent and a 30 percent increase from the same period last year. This is slightly above the average estimate of Wall Street analysts.\n\nAMD\u2019s stock price was down more than 8.5 percent in after-hours trading.",

Its competitive edge hinges on expanding its data center capabilities while innovating across the client and embedded markets.\n\nQuarterly Highlights\n\nAMD\u2019s Data Center segment notably reached $3.9 billion in Q4 revenue, up 69% from the prior year, driven by strong demand for its EPYC processors and Instinct GPUs. This performance underlines AMD's strength in providing the processing power demanded by cloud and enterprise clients. Meanwhile, the Client segment brought in $2.3 billion, reflecting a 58% increase year over year, propelled by Ryzen processor demands across both desktop and mobile markets.\n\nThe Gaming and Embedded segments experienced setbacks. Q4 Gaming revenue dropped 59%, generating $563 million as semi-custom product sales slowed. The Embedded segment also saw declines, with a year-over-year reduction of 13% this quarter, primarily due to inventory adjustments.\n\nGuided by its strategic direction, AMD continues to enhance its AI capabilities. Initiatives in this domain include strategic partnerships and the launch of new AI-centric products. Key among these are collaborations with industry giants such as IBM and Vultr, utilizing Instinct MI300X accelerators, and the introduction of Ryzen AI Max and PRO-series processors.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nIn projecting AMD\u2019s outlook for Q1 2025, management forecasts approximately $7.1 billion in revenue, marking expected continued growth at an estimated 30% year-over-year increase. Adjusted gross margin is expected to be approximately 54%. AMD management said it remains firmly committed to sustaining its growth momentum, particularly within the Data Center and AI sectors. This focus is projected to sustain the company's market competitiveness well into 2025.\n\nInvestors may want to keep an eye on forward guidance, with particular focus on computational and AI domains where AMD seeks expansion. Adjustments to market dynamics, demand for cloud computing, and AI infrastructure investments are anticipated to play vital roles in shaping AMD\u2019s performance. With strategic prioritization on advancing technological leadership, AMD remains poised to leverage industry opportunities in the upcoming quarters.",

But AMD stock fell in extended trading.\n\nThe fabless chipmaker earned an adjusted $1.09 a share on sales of $7.66 billion in the December-ended quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected AMD earnings of $1.08 a share on sales of $7.53 billion. On a year-over-year basis, AMD earnings climbed 42% while revenue increased 24%.\n\nFor the current quarter, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company predicted sales of $7.1 billion. Wall Street was modeling $7 billion.\n\nIn after-hours trading on the stock market today, AMD stock initially rose but then retreated. In recent trades, it was down more than 5% to 112.50. During the regular session Tuesday, AMD stock rose 4.6% to close at 119.50.\n\n\"2024 was a transformative year for AMD as we delivered record annual revenue and strong earnings growth,\" Chief Executive Lisa Su said in a news release. \"Data Center segment annual revenue nearly doubled as Epyc processor adoption accelerated and we delivered more than $5 billion of AMD Instinct accelerator revenue.\"\n\nShe added, \"Looking into 2025, we see clear opportunities for continued growth based on the strength of our product portfolio and growing demand for high-performance and adaptive computing.\"\n\nAMD competes with Intel (INTC) in PC and server processors and Nvidia (NVDA) in AI accelerators and graphics chips.\n\nLast week, Intel edged above diminished expectations for the fourth quarter. Intel earned an adjusted 13 cents a share, down 76% year over year, on sales of $14.3 billion, down 7%. It was Intel's third straight quarter of declining sales and earnings. Also, its sales guidance for the current quarter was below views.\n\nAMD stock ranks No. 16 out of 39 stocks in IBD's fabless semiconductor industry group, according to IBD Stock Checkup. It has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 63 out of 99.\n\nFollow Patrick Seitz on X, formerly Twitter, at @IBD_PSeitz for more stories on consumer technology, software and semiconductor stocks.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nAdobe Touts Acrobat AI Assistant For Contracts\n\nSpotify Stock Jumps As More Users Flock To Music Streamer\n\nSee Stocks On The List Of Leaders Near A Buy Point\n\nFind Winning Stocks With MarketSurge Pattern Recognition & Custom Screens\n\nJoin IBD Live For Stock Ideas Each Morning Before The Open\n\nGoogle Tumbles On Earnings After Palantir Leads Tech Rally",

Earnings came in at $482 million, or 29 cents per share, down from $667 million, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier, falling short of expectations. However, on an adjusted basis, AMD's earnings of $1.78 billion, or $1.09 per share, beat expectations.\n\nThe revenue gains came as AMD's data center sales climbed 69% to a record $3.86 billion driven by demand for the company\u2019s artificial intelligence chips, but still missed the $4.12 billion called for by analysts.\n\nAMD Forecasts Double-Digit Growth This Year on Strong Demand\n\nLooking ahead, AMD said it anticipates first-quarter revenue of $6.8 billion to $7.4 billion, up from $5.4 billion in the first quarter of 2024. The midpoint of that range is above the analysts consensus of $7.01 billion.\n\nFor the full year, AMD expects double-digit growth in its revenue and earnings per share thanks to a strong demand environment, CEO Lisa Su said on the company\u2019s earnings call, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense.\n\nAhead of the results, Wall Street analysts suggested AMD could be a key beneficiary as U.S. tech giants ramp up spending on AI, with Bank of America analysts suggesting worries about competition from Chinese firms like AI startup DeepSeek could push Big Tech to spend even more, to the benefit of chipmakers.\n\nSu said recent model breakthroughs like DeepSeek's and AI infrastructure investments like the $500 billion Stargate joint venture announced last month are \u201cexactly the types of advances we want to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of these initiatives require massive amounts of new compute and create unprecedented growth opportunities for AMD across our businesses,\u201d Su said.\n\nAMD shares fell over 8% in extended trading Tuesday following the results.

            "content": "Googlers have not only figured out how to break AMD's security \u2013 allowing them to load unofficial microcode into its processors to modify the silicon's behavior as they wish \u2013 but also demonstrated this by producing a microcode patch that makes the chips always output 4 when asked for a random number.\n\nAnd this ability to change the microcode not only allows Google and others to customize the operation of their AMD chips, for good and non-good reasons, but it also smashes the Epyc maker's secure encrypted virtualization and root-of-trust security features.\n\nBackground\n\nMicrocode is a special block of programs typically loaded into a processor during system startup that defines the way the chip works. By providing microcode to users, AMD can add some features, fix certain issues, and extend some functionality without having to redesign and reissue the physical silicon. It is a patch that updates your chip \u2013 Intel has similar \u2013 and crucially only AMD is supposed to be able to produce working microcode updates for its products.\n\nAMD bakes a cryptographic security mechanism into its processors that checks a microcode update truly came from AMD before accepting it. The format of the microcode is also not documented publicly and is highly proprietary and protected. All of this is to stop someone from coming up with their own viable microcode and making an AMD processor do things it shouldn't or in a non-standard way.\n\nWell, the boffins at Google have discovered a way to craft their own microcode that is accepted by AMD processors and successfully changes the silicon's operation. They say their technique works on all Zen-based AMD chips \u2013 all Ryzen and Epyc parts, basically.\n\nHow (not very) random\n\nTo back up these claims, the Googlers this week released initial details of their findings, and a proof-of-concept microcode update for Milan-family Epyc server chips and Phoenix-family Ryzen 9 desktop processors. This demo microcode forces a chip's read random (RDRAND) instruction to always output the value 4 rather than an actual random number, likely a reference to XKCD.\n\nThe Googlers carefully neutered their proof-of-concept, we note. The altered RDRAND instruction always clears the CPU core's carry flag to zero, signaling to applications the value isn't valid. Thus if some miscreant were to start distributing the patch, well-written apps and libraries should refuse to use the static number on hobbled processors. This is important because RDRAND is used by software to generate random values for strong secure encryption and other cryptography; a value of always 4 will silently wreck that data protection. That said, software can get random numbers from other sources.\n\nThe implications of this are fairly large. It demonstrates how software instructions can be altered or extended by unofficial microcode patches, that Google and potentially others can craft such patches, and that these patches could be used for good \u2013 improving CPU operations \u2013 and bad, such as backdooring systems or weakening security. There has been prior research into AMD's microcode format (eg, here and here) though Google's work covers AMD's latest parts down to those shipping in 2017.\n\nThis vulnerability could be used by an adversary to compromise confidential computing workloads\n\nCrucially, you need to kernel-level, ring-0 access on a system to load the microcode, so this can only be used once you have sufficient privileges. This makes this technique more useful for those customizing their own systems, or for privileged malware that really wants to deeply compromise an infected computer.\n\nBut consider a scenario where you're running a virtual machine on a remote host that you may not fully trust, so you rely on AMD's secure encrypted virtualization to shield your VM from the host; now the host can use Google's approach to load microcode that undermines or blows away that security.\n\nThe problem\n\nFrom what we can tell, the Google team was able to produce microcode updates that appear to be digitally signed by AMD, or signed in a way the processor will expect, while containing code that isn't from AMD. This is achieved by exploiting a weak hash algorithm in the chip, we're told.\n\n\"We have demonstrated the ability to craft arbitrary malicious microcode patches on Zen 1 through Zen 4 CPUs,\" the Google Security Team explained in their advisory on Monday.\n\n\"The vulnerability is that the CPU uses an insecure hash function in the signature validation for microcode updates.\n\n\"This vulnerability could be used by an adversary to compromise confidential computing workloads protected by the newest version of AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization, SEV-SNP or to compromise Dynamic Root of Trust Measurement.\"\n\nFixing it\n\nAMD and Google both consider this loading of unofficial CPU patches a security vulnerability, which we got a glimpse of in January when Asus jumped the gun by accidentally disclosing a microcode-related security fix was coming.\n\nThe flaw, listed as CVE-2024-56161 with a CVSS score of 7.2 out of 10, was discovered and reported to AMD in September, and a fix was devised by December. That remediation is being rolled out in the form of, ironically enough, an official microcode update via system manufacturers from AMD. So far it appears AMD has issued patches for datacenter-class and embedded processors, and nothing yet officially for its personal computing chips.\n\nThat said, the Asus leak from earlier was a beta BIOS update for AMD-powered gaming motherboards that fixed this microcode security issue, so updates for Ryzen and Threadripper components may be on their way. We're seeking clarification.\n\nAMD stressed CVE-2024-56161 is exploitable only by someone with host admin access. \"Once that level of access is achieved, almost anything is possible,\" a spokesperson told The Register.\n\nWe also note the hole cannot be exploited by an admin in a virtualized guest; you need kernel-level ring-0 access on the host, outside any virtual machines running.\n\n\"AMD has made available a mitigation for this issue which requires updating microcode on all impacted platforms to help prevent an attacker from loading malicious microcode,\" the chip designer explained.\n\n\"Additionally, an SEV firmware update is required for some platforms to support SEV-SNP attestation. Updating the system BIOS image and rebooting the platform will enable attestation of the mitigation. A confidential guest can verify the mitigation has been enabled on the target platform through the SEV-SNP attestation report.\"\n\nEpyc processors going all the way back to 2017 are affected, at least. More details are due to be released by Google next month.\n\n\"Due to the deep supply chain, sequence, and coordination required to fix this issue, we will not be sharing full details at this time in order to give users time to re-establish trust on their confidential-compute workloads,\" the G-team wrote. \"We will share additional details and tools on March 5, 2025.\"\n\nAMD thanked Googlers Josh Eads, Kristoffer Janke, Eduardo 'Vela' Nava, Tavis Ormandy, and Matteo Rizzo for their help in identifying and fixing the issue. \u00ae",

            "content": "(Reuters) - AMD (AMD) investors will closely examine the chip designer's artificial intelligence strategy when it reports fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, as Big Tech's shift to custom silicon raises doubts about its place in the AI infrastructure race.\n\nAnalysts expect AMD's December-quarter revenue to surge over 22% to $7.53 billion, but the company's growth prospects are shadowed by the dominance of Nvidia (NVDA) in the AI chip market and the rising trend of tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Meta (META) developing custom chips.\n\nInvestors see \"customer silicon and Nvidia as the AI chip market going forward,\" said Ryuta Makino, analyst at AMD investor Gabelli Funds. Customer silicon refers to custom chips designed for specific customers, unlike off-the-shelf processors.\n\nRahul Tikoo, SVP and GM of Client Business Unit for AMD, talks about the Ryzen AI Max processor for laptops at CES 2025 in January. REUTERS/Steve Marcus \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\n\nChinese AI startup DeepSeek's advances with models that can reportedly match or outperform Western rivals at lower costs have also raised concerns over the substantial projected spending on AI infrastructure that has been driving a rally in chipmaker stocks.\n\nTech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta are increasingly dedicating resources to developing their own silicon for processing large data volumes required by GenAI, with all three having unveiled new AI chip versions last year.\n\nThis has boosted sales for Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology, (MRVL) which provide so-called hyperscalers with custom AI processors.\n\nBroadcom CEO Hock Tan has said the company expects AI could present as much as $90 billion revenue opportunity by 2027.\n\nThe company's shares more than doubled in value last year, while Marvell rose about 83%. AMD in contrast, fell 18% in 2024.\n\nNvidia's existing majority share of the AI chip market and its proprietary CUDA software- a standard among most developers- is likely to help cushion the company against rising custom chip adoption, said Ben Bajarin, chief executive of technology consultancy Creative Strategies.\n\nThe high cost of switching chip providers presents a significant barrier to AMD making further inroads into the market.\n\nHowever, the push to develop sophisticated AI models could alleviate concerns as Big Tech continues massive AI spending.\n\nTD Cowen analysts, along with Omdia analyst Alexander Harrowell, expect AMD to rake in AI chip sales of as much as $10 billion this year - double AMD's forecast of $5 billion in AI processor revenue in 2024.\n\nRevenue in the company's data center chip segment is expected to jump close to 82% to $4.15 billion in the fourth quarter according to data compiled by LSEG- making up more than half of total sales.\n\nStory Continues",

There couldn't be more uncertainty in the space after the DeepSeek announcement, Tariff fears, and broad-scale market selloff to start the trading week. The options market is pricing in a +-8% stock price move for AMD this week, which puts the stock on the higher end of the range for implied volatility ahead of an earnings announcement.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices is expected to announce an earnings-per-share (EPS) of $1.09 on $7.53 billion in revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD Stock has had a bumpy ride as of late, with a lot of question marks around the future of the AI space and who might take hold of lingering marketshare. Seemingly bulletproof competitors like NVIDIA (NVDA) are down significantly the past few weeks, and AMD is no different. After reaching a high of $227.30 in 2024, the stock has fallen hard to a new price of around $114 per share. The past few months of trading represents the lowest the stock has traded since November of 2023. It seems trouble could be brewing for Advanced Micro Devices, and the implied volatility of the options market being so high confirms the uncertainty for AMD.\n\nJean Hu, AMD CFO, offered words of encouragement during the last earnings call:\n\n\u201cWe are pleased with our execution in the third quarter, delivering strong year-over-year expansion in gross margin and earnings per share...\u201d\n\n\n\n\"...We are on-track to deliver record annual revenue for 2024 based on significant growth in our Data Center and Client segments.\u201d\n\nIt is interesting to see very strong earnings reports from AMD, with three consecutive EPS estimate beats. In addition, AMD has raised EPS estimates three quarters in a row as well. It seems the company is getting more efficient and effective, and yet the stock price is well off the highs. It feels like something's gotta give - we may be in for a very bleak earnings report to pair with a depressed stock price, or another strong earnings report that may result in the stock finally rallying off of lows. With that said, we've seen plenty of earnings calls from companies that post great numbers and the stock still sells off. This is the nature of the beast with earnings trades, and this true uncertaintly aligns with high implied volatility in the options market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe look to the options market for context around the implied volatility of the stock price for specific timeframes. With AMD announcing earnings on Tuesday, we can check out the weekly options market for an estimate of the implied stock price move.\n\nWe're currently seeing an expected move of +-$9.92 for this week, which is over 8% of the current stock price of $114. This is on the higher end of earnings announcements for companies that typically land between 5-10% of the notional value of the stock price. To emphasize this point further, we can see just a +-$17.51 implied stock price move for the April options cycle that is 73 days to expiration.\n\nIn other words, over 50% of the expected move priced into the next 73 days is priced into this week's earnings call. If that doesn't scream high implied volatility, I don't know what will!\n\nAll eyes will be on AMD on Tuesday after the market closes as they release quarterly earnings and give us more detail related to their 2025 outlook.\n\n\n\nBullish on AMD Stock for Earnings\n\nIf you're bullish on AMD stock for earnings, you're looking for another strong earnings report that exceeds EPS and revenue estimates. With all of this negative press around AMD, if they can post another strong quarter and give plenty of optimistic tone during the earnings call, we could see the stock price finally rise from the recent lows.\n\n\n\nBearish on AMD Stock for Earnings\n\nIf you're bearish on AMD stock for earnings, you likely think this is the end of the road for previous reports that did well. After all, higher EPS and revenue estimates make it tougher to post a really strong number, so a miss in either of these categories could confirm the price action we've seen in AMD stock over the past few weeks.\n\nI expect nothing but fireworks in AMD stock after the close on Tuesday, and we'll be taking a look at the options market for earnings strategies at 11am CST on Options Trading Concepts Live.

            "content": "This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nAhead of its fourth-quarter earnings tomorrow, AMD saw its price target cut by Cantor Fitzgerald, with data center revenues expected to remain below consensus. AMD's shares have demonstrated lackluster performance over the past six months as markets have questioned the firm's ability to compete with NVIDIA in the AI industry and remained downbeat about the performance of the PC market during the year's first half. Cantor kept AMD's share rating at Overweight as part of a note that reduced the share price target to $135 from $150.\n\nAMD Scores Another Bearish Analyst Note Ahead Of Q4 Earnings\n\nBefore Cantor's price cut today, several investment banks and firms have already turned bearish on AMD's prospects. Bank of America got the ball rolling in December as it slashed AMD's price target to $155 from $180 and reduced its rating from Neutral to Buy. As part of its coverage, the bank noted that constrained supplies of NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs would increase demand for custom AI chips from Marvell and Broadcom and reduce the market available for AMD's products. It added that AMD would face a tighter PC market in 2025 but added that AMD might growth its revenue between 15% to 20% annually by capitalizing on Intel's weakness.\n\nBofA was followed by equally bearish coverage from HSBC and Goldman Sachs. HSBC's note cut AMD's share price target to $110 from $200 as it noted that \"AMD's AI GPU roadmap is less competitive than previously anticipated, limiting its penetration into the AI GPU market.\" Along with HSBC, Wolfe Research had also noted that \"AMD won\u2019t be in a position to guide AI for CY25 \u2013 which will in itself drive concerns.\"\n\nCantor Fitzgerald's latest AMD note comes as the firm gears up to deliver its fourth-quarter earnings tomorrow. The firm's shares slipped by 7% after its previous earnings as its Q4 guidance of $7.50 billion midpoint revenue fell below analyst estimates of $7.54 billion. Cantor's note reduces AMD's share price target to $135 from $150 but keeps an Overweight rating on the stock.\n\nThe analysts also expect a Q4 beat but a Q1 miss, with their estimate of $7 billion in 2025 data center GPU revenue falling below consensus estimates. Data center is AMD's business division responsible for supplying GPUs for AI workloads, and in its Q3 earnings, the division's revenue grew by $2 billion.\n\nInvestment bank Goldman Sachs had cut AMD's price target to $129 from $175 in a note early last month. Like BofA, Goldman had worried about the impact of Arm-based chips on AMD's products. According to Goldman Sachs, the rise of Arm-based products would strain AMD's margins, revenue growth and multiples. Consequently, the bank expects \"the stock to remain range-bound until the market regains confidence in AMD's future growth and margin trajectory.\"",

            "content": "AMD\u2019s new Ryzen 9000X3D gaming CPUs are reportedly due to arrive in just a few weeks, according to the latest leak. The new 16-core AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D has already been officially announced, as has the 12-core 9900X3D, but AMD has so far only given the release date window as Q1 2025.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly the same timeframe as the official Radeon RX 9070 release date window, leading to speculation that AMD plans to release the new CPUs and GPUs at the same time. According to AMD, the new Ryzen 9 9950X3D is, on average, 20% faster than the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K across a suite of 40 games the company has tested.\n\nBut when is it coming out? According to a report on French tech site Cowcotland, the new CPU is due to be released at the end of March 2025. The site cites its own anonymous sources for the information, saying that the new CPUs will be arriving at around the same time as the company\u2019s new Radeon RX 9070 XT gaming GPU.\n\nOf course, AMD hasn\u2019t officially announced a release date for the Ryzen 9 9950X3D yet, other than the Q1 2025 window, so take this with a grain of salt for the moment, but with only two months left of the first quarter of 2025, a release at the end of March seems highly plausible.\n\nBack to what we do know, AMD has announced that the Ryzen 9 9950X3D will have 16 cores and 32 threads, with a maximum boost clock of 5.7GHz. However, that boost clock will only apply to eight of its cores \u2013 the ones without 3D V-cache. The CPU will have two CCDs (the chips that contain the CPU cores) under its heatspreader, each with eight cores. One of these CCDs will have 3D V-cache, much like the eight-core Ryzen 7 9800X3D. The other CCD will just have eight normal Zen 5 CPU cores, but the ability to boost to a faster clock speed.\n\nWhen asked whether AMD could make a 16-core CPU with 3D V-cache on both CCDs, the company\u2019s senior technical marketing manager of consumer processors, Donny Woligroski, told us that \u201cwe could do it,\u201d but that the 9950X3D as it is makes for a better option for most people\u2019s needs. It has higher clock speeds for speeding up heavily multi-threaded workloads, and eight cores with 3D V-cache for gaming \u2013 a workload that very rarely demands more than six cores, let alone eight.\n\nMeanwhile, the 9900X3D only has six cores with 3D V-cache, and a second set of six cores that can boost to 5.5GHz. If gaming is your top priority, we recommend going for the eight-core chip instead. As we found in our Ryzen 7 9800X3D review, this CPU is fantastic for gaming, and you\u2019ll get little benefit from having more than eight cores in games.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to buy a new processor now, check out our guide to the best gaming CPU, where we take you through all our current recommendations to suit a range of budgets and users.",

The Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D look like they might be some seriously powerful CPUs, and now the latest scuttlebutt suggests they might be coming at the end of March, alongside some long-awaited RDNA 4 graphics cards.\n\nThat's according to French hardware website Cowcotland, who's sources say that the new AMD 3D V-cache-sporting chips will make an appearance at roughly the same time as the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT.\n\nAMD's David McAfee had previously tweeted that gamers will get their hands on the new GPUs in March, so that all lines up rather nicely if true.\n\nAs does the naming scheme, giving that these are the latest 9000-series CPUs, potentially launching next to the 9070-series GPUs. What a difference a digit makes, ey?\n\nAs for the chips themselves, the specs are pretty monstrous. The 9950X3D is a 170 W TDP chip with 16-cores and 32-threads with a boost clock of 5.7 Ghz and 144 MB of total cache, whereas the 9900X3D has 12-cores, 24-threads, and 140 MB of cache, with a slightly slower 5.5 GHz boost clock.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Header Cell - Column 0 Cores / Threads Boost clock Total cache TDP AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 16 / 32 5.7 GHz 144 MB 170 W AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D 12 / 24 5.5 GHz 140 MB 120 W AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D 8 / 16 5.2 GHz 104 MB 120 W\n\nCompare those specs to our current best CPU for gaming, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, and you can see why hearts are a flutter in anticipation of the new chips. The 9800X3D is the fastest gaming CPU we've ever tested, but with eight cores, 16-threads, and 104 MB total cache, it looks like it's firmly outmatched by its new siblings\u2014when it comes to multi-threaded workloads at least.\n\nStill, there's always price to consider. While the new AMD mega-CPUs are likely to be top performers, if the 9800X3D can still monster ahead of the Intel competition at a more reasonable price point, it might still be the chip to go for this generation to get the best bang for your buck. Time will tell. Still, if these rumours prove out, it looks like we won't have too much longer to wait.",

Nvidia countered in a blog post that the RTX 5090 is up to 2.2x faster than the RX 7900 XTX.\n\nNvidia benchmarked the RTX 5090, RTX 4090, and RX 7900 XTX in three DeepSeek R1 AI model versions, using Distill Qwen 7b, Llama 8b, and Qwen 32b. Using the Qwen LLM with the 32b parameter, the RTX 5090 was allegedly 124% faster, and the RTX 4090 47% faster than the RX 7900 XTX. Using Llama 8b, the RTX 5090 was 106% faster, and the RTX 4090 was 47% faster than the RX 7900 XTX. Using Qwen 7b, the RTX 5090 was 103% quicker, and the RTX 4090 was 46% more performant than the RX 7900 XTX.\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\nNvidia\u2019s results are a slap in the face to AMD\u2019s own benchmarks featuring the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080. The RX 7900 XTX was faster than both Ada Lovelace GPUs except for one instance, where it was a few percent slower than the RTX 4090. The RX 7900 XTX was up to 113% quicker and 134% faster than the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080, respectively, according to AMD.\n\nNvidia provides a significantly different picture with the RTX 4090, showing that the RTX 4090 is considerably faster than the RX 7900 XTX, not the other way around. The icing on the cake (for Nvidia) is that the RTX 5090 more than doubled the RTX 4090\u2019s performance results, thoroughly crushing the RX 7900 XTX.\n\nThis is a good reminder to take manufacturer-provided benchmark results with a pinch of salt. Nvidia\u2019s results might not even be correct, but regardless, AMD and Nvidia provide results that contradict each other.\n\nDeepSeek R1 is a new AI model that has blown away the industry, providing competitive performance with the best AI models out there but requiring 11 times less computing power. DeepSeek\u2019s incredible achievement was solely responsible for Nvidia losing nearly $600 billion in market capital in a single day.",

The amount of work that goes into providing a fix \u2014 and thoroughly testing it \u2014 is extensive. It\u2019s a big resource strain, so good coordination from AMD,\u201d Kimball said. \u201cIt is an unfortunate reality that these vulnerabilities find their way into systems, but it\u2019s a reality nonetheless. The real measure of a vendor is how quickly they respond to mitigating and nullifying these vulnerabilities. In the case of AMD, the response was swift and thorough.\u201d\n\nWhat is critical, Villanustre added, is that admins focus on the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), which is the interface between the OS and the firmware. If the UEFI, which used to be known as system BIOS, is not updated, the microcode problem will keep returning every time servers reboot, Villanustre explained. \u201cThis can be simply addressed by updating your UEFI.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis situation highlights how deeply firmware issues have become [embedded] in modern computing,\u201d Price said. \u201cIt is going to make emergency patches more difficult in the future. Future microcode patches will require full system reboots.\u201d\n\nAMD released two patches for the problem. \u201cAMD has made available a mitigation for this issue which requires updating microcode on all impacted platforms to help prevent an attacker from loading malicious microcode,\u201d AMD said. \u201cAdditionally, an SEV firmware update is required for some platforms to support SEV-SNP attestation. Updating the system BIOS image and rebooting the platform will enable attestation of the mitigation. A confidential guest can verify the mitigation has been enabled on the target platform through the SEV-SNP attestation report.\u201d\n\nAMD said the cybersecurity risk of not deploying the patch is significant, explaining, \u201cimproper signature verification in the AMD CPU ROM microcode patch loader may allow an attacker with local administrator privilege to load malicious CPU microcode resulting in loss of confidentiality and integrity of a confidential guest running under AMD SEV-SNP.\u201d",

Not long ago, the company was seen as a real threat to Nvidia\u2019s dominance in the AI chip space, but that narrative has taken a serious hit as the Street lowers expectations for AMD\u2019s AI chip business.\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving strong buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nWith the semi giant about to report Q4 earnings tomorrow (February 4), Susquehanna\u2019s Christopher Rolland, an analyst ranked in the top 1% of Wall Street stock experts, thinks investors might be in for some more disappointing news, despite the potential for a decent outlook.\n\n\u201cIn short, we expect generally in-line guidance, with a possibility of upside driven by Server and PC,\u201d the 5-star analyst said. \u201cHowever, we note the likely removal of a full-year MI300 guide, perhaps a modest negative for AMD AI bulls. While buy-side MI300 expectations have been coming down for the last few months (we think between $6-7B from the prior $10B+ for 2025), overt signs of this deceleration may weigh.\u201d\n\nThat said, considering the shares\u2019 retreat, Rolland does go on to add that this deceleration is now \u201cwidely understood and (mostly) removed from shares.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Rolland\u2019s take on AMD is mostly positive. Regarding EPYC (DC CPU), his recent checks \u201csupport a strong 2025, driven primarily by share gains.\u201d AMD is currently looking to expand its share in the hyperscaler market, particularly in China, while also accelerating adoption in the enterprise sector. Rolland believes the ASP (average selling price) \u201cwaterfall effect\u201d from Milan to Genoa to Turin should positively impact revenue on a year-over-year basis, with the analyst expecting an increase of around 20%.\n\nOn the client side, driven in part by tariff-related pull-ins, Rolland\u2019s checks have been \u201cconstructive,\u201d while he recently raised December builds. Such a dynamic could help support Q4 and Q1, but could present risks to PC numbers in 2Q25 and further down the line.\n\nFor the Embedded segment, Rolland anticipates a \u201cmodest recovery\u201d as FPGAs should improve after Q1, assuming inventory levels are finally normalized. Moreover, recent price increases of up to 20% could offer further support. In the Gaming segment, however, weak console sales continue to be a headwind.\n\nThe question is whether the company will comment on any declining sales of the MI300, and that could pose a risk to 2025 Street estimates. Rolland thinks old sell-side MI300 estimates for 2025 were just too exuberant, believing that following the results many on the Street could take the opportunity to \u201creset top line expectations for the year.\u201d\n\nWhat it all boils down to is a Positive (i.e., Buy) rating from Rolland although his price target is lowered from $200 to $165. Nevertheless, there\u2019s still potential upside of 44% from current levels. (To watch Rolland\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nElsewhere on the Street, the stock claims an additional 13 Buys, 8 Holds and 1 Sell, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average price target stands at $161.55, suggesting shares will gain 40% in the year ahead.

            "content": "A surprise development may have turned the market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips on its head. DeepSeek, a China-based start-up, developed an open-source large language model, claiming it took two months and cost less than $6 million.\n\nAmid that news, AI chip stocks such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.92%) and Nvidia (NVDA -4.05%) plunged.\n\nAdmittedly, the dust has yet to settle, and perceptions of these stocks may change as more information comes to light. Nonetheless, with this industry possibly in flux, it brings up the question of whether AMD stock or Nvidia stock is the semiconductor stock to buy right now.\n\nThe state of AMD\n\nAt first glance, it may appear AMD is better positioned for this development. Since Nvidia is the market leader in AI accelerators, AMD has not benefited as extensively.\n\nHowever, the data center segment (which designs its accelerators) has become a financial bright spot in AMD's otherwise lagging financial performance. In the first nine months of 2024, data center revenue grew 107% yearly. That comprised 48% of company revenue, up from 25% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nStill, even though it has not outperformed Nvidia, AMD's most advanced AI accelerators have commanded significant pricing power. Hence, it is unclear how higher demand for less advanced accelerators might affect revenue for the data center segment.\n\nAdditionally, data center growth has had to compensate for the revenue drops in AMD's gaming and embedded segments, which reached 58% and 38%, respectively, over the same period.\n\nOverall, AMD's $18 billion in revenue for the first three quarters of the year grew 10% annually. Indeed, signs have emerged that the gaming and embedded segments have bottomed. Thus, even if pricing power in the data center segment gets reduced, AMD's overall revenue picture could improve.\n\nMoreover, the falling price of AMD stock has made it cheap. Struggles with profits have skewed its P/E ratio, but its forward P/E stands at just 23 at this writing. Also, with a price-to-book ratio of 3, bargain hunters may look at AMD in a new light.\n\nWhere Nvidia currently stands\n\nFor all of AMD's efforts to catch up, Nvidia remains the dominant player in the AI accelerator market, which has translated into an overall performance that has far outpaced AMD's.\n\nIn the first three quarters of fiscal 2025 (ended Oct. 27, 2024), Nvidia's revenue of $91 billion rose an astounding 135%. Approximately 87% of that came from the data center segment. With the high demand for accelerators, growth in this segment is likely the main reason for Nvidia's growth.\n\nUnfortunately, investors have to remember that the chip industry is highly cyclical, and the news from DeepSeek could reverse those gains. Top-of-the-line AI accelerators have commanded premium prices. Should demand fall, it would force Nvidia to slash prices, which would slow or possibly reverse its massive revenue growth.\n\nNot all of the news for Nvidia is bad. DeepSeek built its model on Nvidia H800 chips, according to multiple reports. Furthermore, Nvidia's CUDA software is still necessary for parallel computing using Nvidia GPUs. Still, if the ability to utilize Nvidia's less-advanced GPUs has increased, it bodes poorly for sales of the most advanced technology, a negative for its stock.\n\nAmid the uncertainty brought by DeepSeek, Nvidia stock was down nearly 20% from recent highs as of the time of this writing.\n\nIndeed, Nvidia may not appear expensive with its 50 P/E ratio, but the uncertainty about DeepSeek calls the reliability of its 47 forward P/E ratio into question. Additionally, its price-to-book ratio of 43 is stratospheric by any measure, and if DeepSeek's breakthrough leads to falling revenue, Nvidia could struggle to justify such a book value multiple.\n\nAMD or Nvidia?\n\nUnder current conditions, AMD looks like the safer bet. Indeed, it bodes well for Nvidia that the DeepSeek breakthrough occurred with its processors. Also, dominating such a market gives it a competitive advantage. Unfortunately, with improved capabilities at the lower end, the meaning of that competitive advantage becomes more uncertain.\n\nMoreover, the DeepSeek development makes AMD more appealing to customers and investors, as the ability to build models with lower-end processors could boost demand for its accelerators. Furthermore, prospects for the recovery of its lagging sectors should draw investors back to that stock.\n\nUltimately, when considering Nvidia's elevated price-to-book ratio, AMD's low valuation and improved growth prospects make it the safer bet for now.",

While AMD is still working on the MI350 for release this year, we have started getting information on the Instinct MI400, which is set to launch in 2026.\n\nAs per the latest reports, some of the design aspects of the MI400 have been revealed. AMD has yet to provide specs and design information on the MI400 in detail officially, but the latest patches give us a sneak peek into what you should be expecting in the upcoming accelerators.\n\nAs spotted by Coelacanth Dream, the new patches available on the Free Desktop show that the MI400 will feature up to Four XCDs (Accelerated Compute Dies), increasing the count from two XCDs per AID on the MI300. That said, there will be two AIDs (Active Interposer Dies) on the MI400 accelerator, and this time, there will be separate Multimedia and I/O dies as well.\n\nImage Source: FreeDesktop.org\n\nFor each AID, there will be a dedicated MID tile, and this will offer efficient communication between the compute units and the I/O interfaces compared to what we had in previous generations. Even on the MI350, AMD uses infinity fabric for inter-die communication. So, it's a big change to the MI400 accelerators, which are aimed at large-scale AI training and inference tasks and are going to be based on the CDNA-Next architecture which is probably going to be rebranded to UDNA as part of the red team's unification strategy of the RDNA and CDNA architectures.\n\nImage Source: AMD\n\nMeanwhile, AMD is going to release the MI350 accelerators based on the CDNA 4 architecture this year, which already brings huge improvements over the MI300 and its predecessors. It brings the advanced 3nm process node, higher energy efficiency, and will offer up to a 35-fold increase in AI Inference compared to MI300. The details about the uplifts on MI400 are still unknown, and we await AMD's announcement of its specs and features.\n\nAMD Instinct AI Accelerators:\n\nAccelerator Name AMD Instinct MI400 AMD Instinct MI350X AMD Instinct MI325X AMD Instinct MI300X AMD Instinct MI250X GPU Architecture CDNA Next / UDNA CDNA 4 Aqua Vanjaram (CDNA 3) Aqua Vanjaram (CDNA 3) Aldebaran (CDNA 2) GPU Process Node TBD 3nm 5nm+6nm 5nm+6nm 6nm XCDs (Chiplets) 8 (MCM) 8 (MCM) 8 (MCM) 8 (MCM) 2 (MCM)\n\n1 (Per Die) GPU Cores TBD TBD 19,456 19,456 14,080 GPU Clock Speed TBD TBD 2100 MHz 2100 MHz 1700 MHz INT8 Compute TBD TBD 2614 TOPS 2614 TOPS 383 TOPs FP6/FP4 Compute TBD 9.2 PFLOPs N/A N/A N/A FP8 Compute TBD 4.6 PFLOPs 2.6 PFLOPs 2.6 PFLOPs N/A FP16 Compute TBD 2.3 PFLOPs 1.3 PFLOPs 1.3 PFLOPs 383 TFLOPs FP32 Compute TBD TBD 163.4 TFLOPs 163.4 TFLOPs 95.7 TFLOPs FP64 Compute TBD TBD 81.7 TFLOPs 81.7 TFLOPs 47.9 TFLOPs VRAM TBD 288 HBM3e 256 GB HBM3e 192 GB HBM3 128 GB HBM2e Infinity Cache TBD TBD 256 MB 256 MB N/A Memory Clock TBD 8.0 Gbps? 5.9 Gbps 5.2 Gbps 3.2 Gbps Memory Bus TBD 8192-bit 8192-bit 8192-bit 8192-bit Memory Bandwidth TBD 8 TB/s 6.0 TB/s 5.3 TB/s 3.2 TB/s Form Factor TBD OAM OAM OAM OAM Cooling TBD Passive Cooling Passive Cooling Passive Cooling Passive Cooling TDP (Max) TBD TBD 1000W 750W 560W\n\nNews Source: Videocardz",

NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 50 Series launch faced stock shortages, leading to a reported \"paper launch\" with limited availability. This scarcity has allowed AMD's Radeon GPUs to gain market traction, with several models becoming best-sellers on Newegg. The upcoming RDNA 4 may further influence GPU market dynamics.\n\nWith NVIDIA launching its new GeForce RTX 50 Series last week with the GeForce RTX 5080 and GeForce RTX 5090, stock shortages and unavailability meant that very few got their hands on a shiny new RTX Blackwell card for a weekend of PC gaming. With reports of hundreds of people lining up at stores and then only a handful getting GPUs, widespread reports of it being a \"paper launch\" have dominated the discussion.\n\n2\n\nNewegg's current best-selling GPUs are full of mid-range and high-end Radeon GPUs.\n\nVIEW GALLERY - 2 IMAGES\n\nPopular Popular Now: Skyblivion, the fan remake of Oblivion in Skyrim's engine, nears completion\n\nHowever, as we reported last year in the lead-up to the RTX 50 Series, we've also seen cards like the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER, GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER, and even GeForce RTX 4070 series cards become increasingly more challenging to find in the US. Online retailer Newegg's RTX 4080 SUPER stock is currently being sold for over $1,500 due to stock coming from overseas.\n\nThis had led to a (temporary or not) vacuum in the mid-range and enthusiast-class market for AMD's Radeon line-up to make a move. Five of the top ten best-selling GPUs on Newegg are Radeon GPUs, including the Radeon RX 7900 XT and the Radeon RX 7800 XT - with a few highlights sold for less than their original MSRP.\n\nWith RDNA 4 on the horizon and the new Radeon RX 9070 XT expected to deliver greater-than-Radeon RX 7900 XT performance for less, it's hard to say if the following three Newegg deals are \"great deals\" or \"wait and see what RDNA 4 has to offer.\" One reason we're seeing this shift could be AI, as these cards currently represent the most affordable options offering 16GB+ of VRAM.\n\nLooking at Newegg's current list of best-selling GPUs, the only GeForce RTX models readily available for a reasonable price are a wide range of GeForce RTX 4060 models and a handful of RTX 4060 Ti GPUs. Plenty of GeForce RTX 5080 cards are on the list the further you go down; however, these are all listed as \"Out of Stock,\" - indicating that not enough stock was supplied to both meet the demand and see one or more of these cards break into the Top 10.",

These are said to be higher-end counterparts in the lineup, offering higher core counts and frequencies compared to the existing Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which has been a huge hit. Now, based on a report by the French publication Cowcotland, Team Red plans to release the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D by March, alongside the release of the upcoming RDNA 4 GPUs.\n\nThis means that AMD plans to hold a new event dedicated towards consumer PC products, since Team Red did say that their RX 9070 series GPUs deserve a standalone showcase. This means that X3D CPUs will be a highlight of the event as well, adding on to the anticipation being built around AMD's event. In terms of specifications, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D features 16 cores and 32 threads with two CCDs and a single IO die, offering up to 144 MB of total cache. That's 64 MB from the Zen 5 CCDs and 64 MB from the X3D stack.\n\nThe Ryzen 9 9900X3D CPU has a 12-core/24 threads configuration, offering a total cache of up to 140 MB. Interestingly, we recently reported on how AMD claimed that their Ryzen 9 X3D SKUs will feature similar gaming performance to the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, despite the extra core counts, since the 3D V-Cache figures are similar around these chips. For gamers, the upcoming CPUs might not be too appealing, but they will definitely come with incremental performance in other workloads.\n\nSince the Ryzen 7 9800X3D managed to gain massive sales traction due to its impressive value, we should anticipate similar consumer anticipation with the new CPUs as well, but that remains uncertain for now.",

However, when it comes to gaming, a little more power would've been nice.\n\nWhy you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you\u2019re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.\n\nGeekom A6: 30-second review\n\nThe A6 is similar in design to the impressive A8 Max, just on a smaller scale. One of the main features of the machine, like the Max, is an impressive array of connection options with two USB Type-A ports on the front and then two HDMI 2.0, two USB Type-C ports, plus two Type-A and a network port, more than most other machines of this size.\n\nOnce set up, I was instantly impressed with the general performance, and I was able to navigate all of the Microsoft Office apps with absolute ease. If you're looking for a high-performance office machine that takes up very little desktop space, then this is a perfect option.\n\nHowever, at this price point, it is aimed at those who need a little more performance from their machines than just running MS Word, and while this chipset doesn't feature a dedicated NPU chip inside, it's still powerful enough to run many intensive apps. In this test, I've utilised both Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro to check out just how well the slightly less powerful CPU without AI would operate under the load of some heavyweight applications.\n\nThrough the test and editing of several high-resolution images as well as video, the machine was impressed with its speed and ability to handle the files\u2014showing that it was more than capable of handling most light to mid-weight HD and 4K editing. That editing was more than just one or two quick edits for some corporate video, and the power of the CPU and GPU handled most of the tasks, only struggling when more advanced effects and grading were applied.\n\nAs that processing ramps up, the sound of the fans does kick in, but unlike its larger sibling, the noise isn't quite as distracting. When it comes to gaming, the power of the CPU and GPU is under strain.\n\nHaving tested some of the best mini PC units around, I have to say, overall, for a machine of such a small size, the performance is impressive, but you can't help but feel that you're paying quite a premium for a machine of this size when you can get something similar and far more powerful in a desktop format for much the same price.\n\nGeekom A6: Price and availability\n\nHow much does it cost? $449 / \u00a3499\n\n$449 / \u00a3499 When is it out? Now\n\nNow Where can you get it? Widely available\n\nThe Geekom A6 Mini PC is widely available and can be purchased directly from the Geekom website; it's also available at most major online retailers, such as Amazon.com.\n\nTechRadar Pro readers can also get an exclusive 5% discount - click your chosen link below and use code TECHRADARA6\n\n\n\nGeekom US\n\nGeekom UK\n\nAmazon.com\n\nCode valid until April 1st 2025\n\nValue: 4 / 5\n\n(Image credit: Alastair Jennings)\n\nGeekom A6: Specs\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Item Spec CPU: AMD Ryzen\u2122 7 6800H. GPU: AMD Radeon\u2122 Graphics 680M RAM: 32GB DDR5 upto 64GB Storage: 1TB SSD, M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 \u00d74 SSD, up to 2TB Front Ports: USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A support Power Delivery, USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, 3.5mm front stereo headset jack, Power Button Rear Ports: USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, USB 2.0 Type-A, USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C support Power Delivery, USB 4 Gen 3 Type-C support Power Delivery, RJ45, 2 x HDMI 2.0, DC in. Connectivity: LAN 2.5Gbps, Bluetooth 5.2, WiFi 6E OS: Windows 11 Pro (pre-installed) Dimensions: 112.4 \u00d7 112.4 \u00d7 37 mm Accessories VESA Mount\n\nGeekom A6: Design\n\nThe A6's design and build is extremely high quality and matches the other A machines in the range. Again, there's an aluminium outer casing that reflects the premium look and price. The matte finish metal is contrasted with a matte black plastic base and back, all finishing off the design very nicely and making it a perfect complement to any stylish design studio. Size-wise, it measures 112.4 \u00d7 112.4 \u00d7 37 mm and weighs just 450 g.\n\nA characteristic of the A series Mini PCs is the number of connection options they offer. Here on the front, two 10 Gbps USB 3.2 Type-A ports sit next to a 3.5 mm audio socket and the power button. On the side, there's an SD card slot, which I would've preferred to have seen mounted at the front for accessibility.\n\n(Image credit: Alastair Jennings)\n\nRound the back, there's the DC power input, and again, because of the size of the machine, I would've liked to have seen this as possibly a USB Type-C power input, which would've made it slightly more portable and given more flexible power options. Next to this, there's two HDMI 2.0 ports, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, one USB 4.0 Type-C, one RJ45, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, and one USB 2.0 Type-A, giving you plenty of connection options.\n\nThe design of the A6 is stylish, with plenty of connection options, which should appeal to anyone working in the creative sector especially if they have plenty of peripherals such as control panels and SSDs to connect. The main thing here is that the smaller form factor of the A6 compared to a standard desktop means that if you are stuck for desk space, then this is a perfect solution. And, of course, it features the usual VESA mount option on the back, so if you do need to mount it away from the desk space, then that's also possible.\n\nDesign: 4.5 / 5\n\n(Image credit: Alastair Jennings)\n\nGeekom A6: Features\n\nBeing big on features is a key element of the Geekom A series, and here we have a compact machine with AMD Ryzen 7 6800H, complemented by the popular AMD Radeon 680M integrated graphics. Alongside the CPU, GPU combo is dual-channel DDR5-4800MHz that maxes out at 64 GB, with this review sample arriving with a more standard 32 GB. On the storage side, there's an M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 SSD, accepting up to 2 TB, with the review sample offering 1 TB.\n\nConnection options are well covered with Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2 and 2.5 Gbps Ethernet RJ45 port, which is all pretty standard, and of course, Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, just highlighting that this is a professional-level machine.\n\nAs already mentioned, the A series goes big on connection options, and on the back, the two HDMI 2.0 ports and USB 3.2 Gen 2 and USB 4 Gen 3 Type-C ports enable you to connect up to four 4K monitors or one 8K. The USB 4.0 port enables transfer rates of up to 40 Gbps, so if you are editing 4K video, then this port will facilitate the connection to the likes of ultrafast LaCie Tough SSDs.\n\nFor such a small system, the cooling is exceptionally important, and here we see the IceBlast cooling system\u2014again, a more compact version of the cooling system that GEEKOM employs in many of their other machines. Through testing, I generally found this cooling system worked exceptionally well. However, as more demand was placed on the CPU and GPU, especially during gaming or 4K video editing, those fans did, audibly, kick in.\n\nOne thing that I really like about the A6 is the small, compact size, which makes the unit easily portable. It's interesting to see that GEEKOM has obviously made the size and portability a bit of a feature, so it seems even more odd that they would keep the DC input when they could have swapped it for USB Type-C, which would be far better for those living the van life culture. However, that said, GEEKOM has stated that this small mini PC has been tested for vibration, high temperature, drops, humidity, and altitude, which is quite unusual for a mini PC but does mean it's probably a little more robust than most and if you are thinking about taking it on the road with you, then this extra level of durability can only a be good thing.\n\n(Image credit: Alastair Jennings)\n\nFeatures: 4.5 / 5\n\nGeekom A6: Performance\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Mini PC Header Cell - Column 1 Header Cell - Column 2 3DMark WildLife 15317 Row 1 - Cell 0 Fire Strike Overall 6789 Row 2 - Cell 0 Fire Strike Graphics 7463 Row 3 - Cell 0 Fire Strike Physics 24479 Row 4 - Cell 0 Fire Strike Combined 2459 Row 5 - Cell 0 Time Spy Overall 2713 Row 6 - Cell 0 Time Spy Graphics 2410 Row 7 - Cell 0 Time Spy CPU 9506 CineBench23 Single 1527 Row 9 - Cell 0 Multi 12135 GeekBench Single 2047 Row 11 - Cell 0 Multi 9498 Row 12 - Cell 0 Compute 26549 CrystalDisk Read MB/s 4056.90MB/s Row 14 - Cell 0 Write MB/s 3206.14MB/s PCMark 10 Office 6341 WEI Row 16 - Cell 1 8.2\n\nThe Geekom A6 features a Ryzen 7 6800H processor, which is quite a step up for such a small machine. The other point to consider is that, given the specifications and size, this is a phenomenally expensive machine, so you'd expect the performance to be right up there.\n\nOn opening up the package and getting started with the A6, I was instantly impressed with the design quality and build, which, like its larger sibling, the A8 Max, is exceptional. I also really like the fact that it's got two readily accessible USB Type-A ports on the front, although again, I'd really like to have seen a USB Type-C port, as most new accessories are USB Type-C, especially when it comes to ultrafast SSDs.\n\nThe SD card slot on the side is a nice touch, although again, had that been on the front, it just would've been a step up for accessibility.\n\nRound the back, the array of ports is really nice to see, and the fact that one is a USB 4.0 enables for ultrafast connections to external devices. Likewise, the single wired network connection enables you to hook into your local area network without too much issue, offering a really good, fast, and robust connection, which is essential in any studio or creative office.\n\nGetting started and taking a look at the Microsoft Office apps running on the Windows 11 Pro platform, there's no doubt about the power of this machine to handle day-to-day tasks. This is reflected with an overall Windows Experience score of 8.2 and a PCMark score of 7174, ultimately meaning that if you're working on office documentation, then this machine is just about as good as it gets\u2014if not a little bit overpowered.\n\nAs I started to push the machine and opened up Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro, I started to see its true ability. Even though it has a slightly less powerful AMD Ryzen 7 CPU, it's still able to handle Adobe Premiere Pro when editing HD and 4K footage shot on the Sony A7 IV. The video edit that I tested on the machine was around 15 minutes, and through the editing process, it managed to handle the processing without too much issue, also enabling smooth grading and audio enhancement in Audition.\n\nAs the effects were applied to the footage, there was some slowdown in the processing, but it was able to handle everything that was thrown at it, which is impressive considering the size. One thing to note, however, was that the fans did kick in as the whole system came under that processing load.\n\nSwitching over to gaming, this is where you can really see the AMD Ryzen 7 CPU struggle. At the same time, we've seen the AMD Radeon 680M handle graphics well with some of the larger Mini PCs; here, in a smaller form factor\u2014whether because of heat or the pairing with the AMD Ryzen 7 CPU\u2014the performance did take a considerable cut. In most cases, through the 3DMark benchmarking tests, there was at least a 1,000-point drop for the Fire Strike, Time Spy, and Wild Life scores compared to a Ryzen 9 machine. This essentially results in a reduction in frame rates and the need to lower some of the graphics settings.\n\nOverall, for general day-to-day work, the A6 is more than capable of handling advanced Excel tasks and Word documents. For casual video editing and image manipulation, this machine also has more than enough power to handle the Adobe Creative Suite to a good level. If you're using Adobe Creative Suite as your professional focus, then you probably want to opt for the larger machine with a bigger processor.\n\nAt the end of the test, whilst general office performance was exceptionally good and Adobe Creative Suite apps ran smoothly within reason, the price of this machine was high.\n\nPerformance: 4.5 / 5\n\n(Image credit: Alastair Jennings)\n\nGeekom A6: Final verdict\n\n(Image credit: Alastair Jennings)\n\nOnce again, Geekom has created a fantastic machine with the A6. The only issue is that the price is high. All things considered, you're essentially paying a premium for the high-quality build and the compact design.\n\nA few things that I would like to have seen on this machine\u2014firstly, a USB Type-C port or two on the front; these would be more compatible with the latest accessories, especially ultrafast SSDs, which you're likely to plug into to expand the storage, particularly for creative tasks such as video editing or photography.\n\nThen, at the back, it uses a 1.9 V DC input, which plugs into a standard AC wall socket. Because of the size, robustness of the build, and portability, I would've thought that a USB Type-C port here would've been a better option, giving far more flexibility over its use, especially for those considering using this as a mobile work machine\u2014and this would have been a great option for those working in the creative sector.\n\nWhen it comes to performance, however, it really is a cut above many other mini PCs of this size. The AMD Ryzen 7 processor packs an impressive amount of power and is perfect for general administration as well as standard video and image editing. It is only really starting to struggle when you try to utilise it for medium- to high-end gaming or longer and more advanced 4K video edits.\n\nWhile the Geekom A6 is expensive, it is also exceptionally high quality, so if you are looking for a solid machine for office work, some video and image editing, and a little bit of light gaming, then the A6 is an exceptionally good compact solution\u2014but all at a premium price.\n\nShould I buy a Geekom A6?\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Value You're definitely paying a price premium for the compact size and processor 4 Design The quality of the build and the style of the design make it one of the best-looking mini PCs out there 4.5 Features With plenty of RAM expansion, USB 4.0 and ultrafast SSD, it might be mini, but it's big on features 4.5 Performance Considering the size, this is one of the most powerful mini PCs in its class 4.5 Overalls A superb mini PC with plenty of power. It's just unfortunate that it costs as much as it does 4.5\n\nBuy it if...\n\nYou want a compact mini PC Considering the power inside, this is one of the smallest mini PCs available, making it suitable for anyone who needs processing power but is very short on space. You need plenty of connection options. Like the larger A8 Max, the A6 offers plenty of connection options, with USB ports on the front and back and the ability to connect up to four monitors.\n\nDon't buy it if...\n\nYou have a tight budget Considering the specifications and price, it really does highlight that you're paying a price premium when you see what else you can get for this budget. You need graphics performance Whilst the AMD Radeon 680M is a great integrated GPU, it doesn't quite have the power of a dedicated system.\n\nFor more essential hardware, we've tested the best business laptops for professionals on the go.",

Citing internal sources, French hardware news website CowCotLand claims that the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D are planned for release by the end of Q1, aligning with AMD's provided release timeframe.\n\nAMD revealed its high-core count Ryzen 9000X3D offerings at CES, boasting a 20% performance bump in gaming against Intel's Core Ultra 200S (Arrow Lake) processors. There is no difference in the total cache size versus the last generation, as the chipmaker will continue offering the 3D V-Cache on a single CCD. However, AMD's 2nd-generation V-Cache technology, which has the SRAM chiplet beneath the CCD, allows these chips to have a higher thermal headroom with a Tjmax of 95 degrees Celsius. This enables higher boost clocks, as seen with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. The Ryzen 9 7950X3D's V-Cache equipped CCD suffered a hefty 500 MHz frequency penalty compared to the CCD without the X3D cache, which should be resolved with the changes to the stacking structure.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCowCotLand suggests that these processors will arrive by the end of next month. While the source doesn't explicitly mention an expected timeline for RDNA 4, preliminary listings suggest RDNA 4 pre-orders start March 23. AMD will likely introduce the RX 9070 series first, followed by budget-friendly offerings later in the year. Given the hype behind AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is practically impossible to find at MSRP anywhere, let's hope supply for upcoming dual-CCD models is enough to keep up with demand.\n\nSpecifications for the RX 9070 XT and its non-XT counterpart have been leaked beforehand. The main highlight is that both GPUs are rumored to boast 16GB of memory, with the flagship RX 9070 XT allegedly trading blows with Nvidia's RTX 4080 Super. Our testing suggests a 10% performance gap between the elusive RTX 5080 and RTX 4080 Super. While this is purely speculative, the RX 9070 XT is projected to be within 15-20% of the RTX 5080. The best part? The 9070 XT might be in stock, unlike the RTX 5080.\n\nAMD seems to be planning two major launches next month. According to leaks, RDNA 4 looks good, so it makes sense that it would have a dedicated launch event. However, AMD has not yet announced any details.",

            "content": "We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 10 Stocks & Says He's In Waiting For AI GPU Spending Clarity. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on whether the low AI development costs demonstrated by China's DeepSeek AI models would upend investor expectations of AI spending. Ever since the AI wave kicked off in November 2022, businesses have committed and spent hundreds of billions of dollars to procure AI GPUs and develop data centers to host them. The high spending requirements also led President Trump to announce a massive $500 billion Stargate project earlier this month.\n\nHowever, data center stocks crashed on Monday and wiped out a trillion dollars of value as investors worried whether low AI development costs would mean that this spending would not materialize. Cramer is divided about the overall sentiment when it comes to AI spending after the DeepSeek selloff.\n\nHe commented that the lower costs are \"the theme of the moment because some people saw it coming.\" Cramer added \"and yet they still ordered. That would be the Zuckerberg case, maybe the Musk piece.\" On the other hand, he outlined that others \"just say oh my, what am I in, I'm gonna go buy a double short NVIDIA.\" Finally, the CNBC host also shared a third category of people \"who think that it's [Wall Street's favorite AI GPU stock] a hand cream.\"\n\nWhile investors fretted about lower AI costs translating into weaker demand for items such as GPUs, another narrative questioned whether lower costs meant that AI development would open up to more firms and entities than the higher costs had previously permitted. Cramer admitted that this was possible, but added that it also meant that perhaps \"the monopoly rent that people feel that\" the premier GPU company \"was charging is gone.\" He added that he was in wait-and-watch mode when it came to AI spending.\n\nCramer noted several events that could signal to him that perhaps the narrative shift surrounding AI spending was permanent. One of his tests \"test would be, uh, is, Three Mile Island not going to be reopened? That would be one I need to hear.\" The second driver that might convince the CNBC TV show host of a paradigm shift for AI spending would be reports of \"any [GPU] order pullback. And I have not heard that yet.\" Cramer added \"But that's not, necessarily, what people are going to announce, 'listen, I've decided. . . If this thing only needs one-tenth of the power, one-tenth of the compute, well I'm going to cut my orders by nine-tenths.' I've not heard that yet, but this thing is. . . a steamroll.\"\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Researchers from AMD and Johns Hopkins University have developed Agent Laboratory, an artificial intelligence framework that automates core aspects of the scientific research process. The system uses large language models to handle literature reviews, experimentation, and report writing, producing both code repositories and research documentation. The framework has demonstrated an 84% reduction in research costs compared to existing autonomous methods while maintaining research quality standards.\n\nThe system processes research ideas through a three-stage pipeline, with researchers providing feedback at each phase. In the initial phase, agents independently gather and analyze research papers. This transitions to a collaborative stage where agents plan experiments and prepare datasets.\n\nThe final phase automates the experimentation process and generates detailed research documentation. Testing with various language models showed that the framework powered by o1-preview produced optimal results. \"Our generated machine learning code matched state-of-the-art performance benchmarks\", noted the research team in their findings. The researchers confirmed that human oversight during each stage played a vital role in improving the final output quality.\n\nThe framework integrates with established tools, including arXiv for literature access, Hugging Face for model implementations, and Python for experimentation, along with LaTeX for documentation. The development team stated:\n\nThe modular design ensures compute flexibility, accommodating diverse resource availability while maintaining efficiency in generating high-quality research artifacts,\n\nSource: mle-solver\n\nAgent Laboratory implements MLE-Solver, a component that converts research directions into functional machine learning code through an iterative refinement process. The system maintains a collection of top-performing programs that continuously improve based on task instructions, command specifications, and accumulated knowledge.\n\nAgent Laboratory researchers conducted a comprehensive evaluation of three language models - gpt-4o, o1-mini, and o1-preview - to assess their capabilities in autonomous research generation. The o1-preview model demonstrated superior performance in perceived usefulness (4.4/5) and report quality (3.4/5), while scoring 2.9/5 in experimental quality. O1-mini achieved the highest experimental quality rating at 3.2/5 and maintained steady performance across all metrics. The gpt-4o model recorded the lowest overall scores, with 2.6/5 in experimental quality, though maintaining a strong usefulness rating of 4.0/5.\n\nThe performance analysis of Agent Laboratory reveals gpt-4o as the most efficient model, completing workflows in 1165.4 seconds at $2.33 per run, compared to o1-mini's 3616.8 seconds at $7.51 and o1-preview's 6201.3 seconds at $13.10. While gpt-4o demonstrated 3-5x faster execution in experiments and report writing, all models maintained high reliability with success rates above 95%. Report writing emerged as the most resource-intensive phase, with o1-preview showing the highest cost at $9.58 per report.\n\nThe most exciting part is running experiments: The core task here is handled by a component called mle-solver, which autonomously generates machine learning code, runs experiments, and iteratively refines code,\n\nMuratcan Koylan noted.\n\nI just had o1 write a major cancer treatment project based on a very specific immunological approach. It created the full framework of the project in under a minute, with highly creative aims,\n\nDerya Unutmaz, professor and biomedical scientist, reported.\n\nThe cost-efficiency aspects have particularly impressed data science professionals. Hazm Talab, a data scientist, observes:\n\n\"Very impressive to see such significant cost reductions in research through the use of LLMs with the Agent Laboratory framework\".\n\nLearn more about Agent Laboratory's technical implementation, documentation, and source code on GitHub.",

The RADV (Radeon Vulkan) is an open-source Vulkan driver for AMD GPUs, which is included in Mesa.\n\nBefore the RX 9070 launches in March, the Mesa 25.0 will be released, which will include optimal updates for the RADV driver for those GPUs. As far as the support for RDNA 4 is concerned, users on the Linux platform shouldn't be worried, as the lead RADV developer of the Valve Linux Graphics Driver team, Samuel Pitoiset, has confirmed that it is going to be \"Good Enough\" for the RDNA 4 GPUs aka Radeon RX 9070.\n\nThis initial support should be good enough but it's missing two features (cooperative matrix and video decode/encode) compared to GFX11 (RDNA3) because lack of time. DCC is still under active development but it might be possible to finish it during the RC period. - Mesa 25.0 patch notes\n\nAs indicated by Samuel, there is still some stuff that won't be included in the Mesa 25.0 release, which is around the end of February. This includes two features: Cooperative Matrix (VK_KHR_cooperative_matrix) and Video Decode/Encode (Vulkan Video). The former is crucial for specialized computation tasks in gaming and machine learning, while the latter focuses on efficient video processing within Vulkan API.\n\nIt should be noted that the missing Vulkan Video support doesn't mean that the VA-API (Video Acceleration API) for hardware-accelerated video decoding/encoding will be incomplete for RDNA 4. Rather, it's independent of the Vulkan Video support and will likely be handled by AMD engineers.\n\nNonetheless, what matters is adequate RADV support for RDNA 4 GPUs, which will remove any limitations users would face on Linux platforms using RX 9070 GPUs. However, the missing components are likely to be included after the GPU launch and will enhance the overall user experience.\n\nNews Sources: Phoronix, freedesktop",

            "content": "Just as we thought the number of cores in your average gaming CPU had hit a plateau, it looks as though next-generation Intel Core and AMD Ryzen desktop CPUs could feature many more cores than the CPUs of today. In fact, we could even be looking at 48-core Intel chips and 24-core AMD Ryzen chips, showing a big jump over the 24-core and 16-core threshold today.\n\nThat\u2019s unlikely to make a big difference if you only use your PC for gaming, especially seeing as the best gaming CPU you can buy right now only has eight cores. However, for desktop users wanting a CPU that can do everything, from gaming to rendering, a new 24-core AMD chip, perhaps called the Ryzen 9 10950X, or a 48-core Intel chip, maybe called the Core Ultra 9 385K, could make a massive difference.\n\nOf course, AMD and Intel haven\u2019t announced any details whatsoever about the core counts in their next-gen CPUs, but we were drawn to a chat between two regular tech leakers in a thread on X (formerly Twitter), which appears to suggest that both companies are working on significant increases in core counts.\n\nIt started with this post from Everest (Olrak29_), which simply outlines two sets of numbers with a \u201cvs\u201d between them and a question mark at the end. Often-reliable tech leaker kopite7kimi then chimes in with \u201cNVL vs Zen6\u201d as a follow-up, referring to Intel\u2019s forthcoming Nova Lake architecture and AMD\u2019s next-gen Zen 6 architecture.\n\nThe top number \u2013 \u201c2 * (8+16)\u201d \u2013 appears to suggest that a top-end Nova Lake CPU will have a pair of compute tiles in its package, each containing eight P-Cores and 16 E-Cores, doubling the number found in top-end Intel Arrow Lake CPUs today. Intel has been stuck with eight P-Cores and 16 P-Cores since its 13th-gen Raptor Lake CPUs at the top end, and it could be looking to increase the number of cores by moving to a smaller manufacturing process and adding a second compute tile to the package.\n\nThe conversation follows several recent comments by a user called Exist50 on a Reddit thread about Intel\u2019s financial results, which suggests that Nova Lake will indeed offer two compute dies, doubling the number of cores compared to Arrow Lake.\n\nMeanwhile, the ostensible Zen 6 figure appears to show that AMD is working on a 24-core CPU based on a pair of 12-core chiplets. Currently, AMD\u2019s chiplets have a maximum of eight cores, and have done since the Ryzen 3000 lineup, but a move to 12 cores per chiplet, perhaps thanks to a smaller manufacturing process, could be on the cards.\n\nPrevious AMD Zen 6 rumors have pointed to the new chips launching in late 2026 or early 2027, so this is a fair way off yet, if it\u2019s even true. However, the new chips are also rumored to work in existing Socket AM5 boards, meaning the best gaming motherboard you can buy for an AMD CPU right now should still work with one of the new Zen 6 chips.\n\nOf course, this is all speculation right now, based on a chat between two tech leakers, rather than any solid claims, but it\u2019s fun to imagine what might be coming in the future, and we have been stuck with the same core counts for several generations now \u2013 it\u2019s about time we had a change.\n\nIn the meantime, check out our Ryzen 7 9800X3D review to see how AMD\u2019s latest CPU with 3D V-cache performs in our game benchmarks, as well as our Core Ultra 7 265K review, where we test one of Intel\u2019s latest Arrow Lake chips.",

At the time of writing, FSR 4 is only confirmed to be available on RDNA 4 GPUs (no news yet on whether it can be used on RDNA 3 GPUs), so it may already be at a disadvantage up against DLSS 4 in terms of its capability of catering to older GPUs, since Nvidia's new upscaling tech will be compatible with GPUs way back to the RTX 2000 series.\n\nTaking DLSS 4's jump from CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to the new, superior transformer model into consideration, games will benefit from this, particularly in cases of poor optimization - while this shouldn't give game developers an excuse to slack off in the optimization department, it's hard to deny how important it will be going forward.\n\nDemo footage of AMD's FSR 4 is already out in the wild from CES 2025, and a prime example of this is the Hardware Unboxed FSR 3.1 and FSR 4 comparison video on YouTube (available below). In the same manner that Nvidia's DLSS 4 impressed me with its improved visual clarity with DLSS 4 in performance mode, FSR 4 appears to follow in those same footsteps - now there's no frame rate counter, so it's difficult to judge just how good this mode will be performance wise, but it's certainly a good sign.\n\nHands-On With AMD FSR 4 - It Looks... Great? - YouTube Watch On\n\nIf AMD's FSR 4 comes close to Nvidia's DLSS 4, what does this mean in terms of competition?\n\nIn the event that FSR 4 goes toe-to-toe with DLSS 4, the only aspect that would then be holding Team Red back from competing would be the possible exclusivity to RDNA 4. While that could come down to hardware limitations preventing it from working on older GPUs, I've once held the same frustrations with Nvidia before regarding DLSS 3's Frame Generation being exclusive to RTX 4000 series GPUs - so the same case applies here.\n\nIn this case, it would be an even bigger omission - we're not just talking about FSR 4's frame gen potentially being exclusive to RDNA 4, but the entire package that includes its super-resolution technology too.\n\nAs much as I absolutely want AMD to provide the necessary competition against Team Green in the GPU market, it already stated that the focus will be on mid-range GPUs (which we're yet to really determine with the RX 9000 series), and DLSS 4 will be available on all RTX GPUs - if we're being honest, it won't help AMD's position in this race...\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

The billionaire is known for his investments in innovative companies, and he's generally found them in the area of technology. The sector consistently represented more than 40% of his holdings over the past five quarters, and four of his five most heavily weighted stocks -- led by Meta Platforms and Amazon -- are giants in the tech field.\n\nBut in the third quarter, Laffont and his team cut their positions in two of the world's most-watched tech stocks right now and increased positions in two stocks in a completely different high-growth area that's generating billions of dollars these days. Laffont reduced artificial intelligence (AI) chip giants Nvidia (NVDA -4.05%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.92%), companies that have been growing data center sales in the triple digits, and increased investment in two companies dominating a market that may reach beyond $100 billion later this decade. Let's find out more.\n\nLaffont's Nvidia and AMD holdings\n\nSo, first let's talk about Laffont's Nvidia and AMD holdings. He hasn't exactly dropped them like a hot potato and still clearly believes in these companies' futures. Nvidia is the leading AI chip designer, with more than 70% market share, and offers customers an entire portfolio of related products and services. This has helped the company generate record revenue in recent times -- and the stock has followed, climbing 171% last year.\n\nAMD may be a far-behind rival to Nvidia in the AI chip market, with about 11% share, but the company still has delivered significant growth thanks to demand from AI customers. In the recent quarter, AMD reported a 122% increase in data center revenue to $3.5 billion and said it's on track to report record full-year revenue.\n\nLaffont reduced his position in Nvidia by 26% in the quarter and now owns 10,138,161 shares, and he cut his AMD holding by 32% to 4,249,190 shares. So, Laffont is still betting on gains in these stocks, but he's also turning to another area to benefit from innovation.\n\nIn the quarter, Laffont boosted his holdings of Eli Lilly (LLY 0.06%) and Novo Nordisk (NVO 5.18%), two companies that are dominating the weight loss drug market. Analysts expect this market to reach $100 billion to $130 billion by 2030, so this could represent significant opportunity for these drugmakers and those who invest in them.\n\nLooking for innovation beyond the tech industry\n\nLaffont increased his position in Lilly by more than 19% and now holds 247,950 shares, and he lifted his position in Novo Nordisk by more than 800% and now owns 326,363 shares. Of course, these pharma players still represent a much smaller portion of Laffont's portfolio than AI stocks, but his move shows he's on the lookout for innovation and growth opportunities -- and can find them -- well beyond the tech industry.\n\nLilly and Novo Nordisk both have demonstrated they could be the right stocks to add growth to a portfolio now and into the coming years. Lilly is the seller of Mounjaro and Zepbound, while Novo Nordisk sells Ozempic and Wegovy -- names many of us have heard in the news due to high demand for these products. They act on hormone pathways involved in the management of blood sugar levels and appetite, and as a result, they've delivered great results to patients aiming to lose weight. (Mounjaro and Ozempic are approved for type 2 diabetes, but doctors have prescribed them off-label for weight loss. Zepbound and Wegovy are specifically approved for weight control.)\n\nThese drugs have generated blockbuster revenue, and considering the level of demand and forecasts for market growth, this is likely to continue. On top of this, Lilly recently won approval for Zepbound in another indication -- sleep apnea -- opening the door to Medicare coverage. And Medicare covers Wegovy as a treatment to reduce heart attack or stroke risk. This is important because it increases the number of patients who can afford these drugs. (Medicare won't reimburse drugs approved for weight loss alone.)\n\nAll of this means buying shares of these two big pharma players right now may have been a genius move by Laffont -- and other investors looking for growth might want to do the same.",

            "content": "Andy Edser, hardware writer (Image credit: Future) This month I've been testing: Handhelds and headsets. Both of which appear to be getting bigger as time goes on. It won't be long now before I strap a pair of speakers to the top of my head, stick a slab of granite in my backpack, and merrily head off to work\u2014with my spine complaining all the way.\n\nIf there's one thing I've never quite understood about the PC hardware community, it's the tribalism evident when it comes to GPU choices. I've never much cared for being team red, team green, or team blue for that matter. Give me the best bang for my buck, and a fraction of my poorly-managed finances are yours.\n\nWhich is why I currently run an RX 7800 XT in the PCIe slot of my main PC. It wasn't the chiplet-based design that won me over, nor the desire to stick one to the big green man and buy the underdog choice. Simply put, I wanted great 1440p performance on a limited budget\u2014and as a result I opted for an XFX version of AMD's mid-range card.\n\nMy other option was the RTX 4070, a card I've often used for performance comparisons and agree is also a fine choice for a reasonably-priced GPU. The RX 7800 XT was a bit cheaper though, and a bit faster in raw raster performance at 1440p, so I plumped for that with my personal cash instead.\n\nCut to just over a year and a half later, and I'm sat in my Vegas hotel room at CES 2025, watching the Nvidia RTX 50-series announcement along with many of the rest of you (my hardware overlord, Dave James, bravely dealt with the immense queues to see it in person). The lights go up, Jen-Hsun appears in an even shinier leather jacket, and the card rollouts begin. And it's time for me to make an admission: I scoffed a little when the RTX 5070 was revealed with claims of \"4090 performance\" for $549.\n\nThat'll be with a lot of upscaling help, I thought. A bit of a contentious claim, and something to potentially write up as an opinion piece later. Fake frames, man, and all that. Raw raster still counts for something, and DLSS can't really be used as a salve for all ills.\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\nAs we later found out, I wasn't entirely wrong. But then I saw the DLSS 4 demo, with all its immensely pretty ray-traced shenanigans. And the staggering frame rate boosts of Multi Frame Generation. Not to mention the claimed image quality improvements, the Neural Texturing, and all sorts of other enticing AI-based doohickeys.\n\nOf course, it was just a demo trailer. Impossible to really judge until I saw it running in front of me for myself. But if there's one thing that's bugged me during my time with the RX 7800 XT, it's that I've been locked into using lesser upscaling tech, like FSR and XeSS.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nDLSS has been better, is better, than either of those competing solutions for some time. Miles better.\n\nI felt a twinge. It was the same twinge I've felt every time I've seen DLSS in motion for the past couple of years, the same slight regret I've felt whenever I've enabled FSR or Fluid Motion Frames on my home machine to boost the framerate in a struggling game.\n\nFSR and XeSS work fine. But DLSS works brilliantly. And now, with all these transformer-based improvements? Nothing suggests to me that has changed. In fact, Nvidia seems to be so far ahead, the competition looks to be floundering in its wake.\n\nDLSS 4 / DLSS 3 / DLSS 2 / DLSS Off Comparison | Cyberpunk 2077 - YouTube Watch On\n\nThere are still those among us who consider AI upscaling and frame generation to be cheating, to some degree. It'll always introduce some sort of artifacting or latency, they argue, and it's never quite as good as raw raster. I like my coffee black and my meat raw, those sorts of people.\n\nFor a long time, I was one of them. But now I think it's time to admit that, far from being a frame-boosting lesser option, a panacea for performance-related woes, it's now an integral part of PC gaming. Hell, gaming in general. Complaining about it at this point feels a little like King Canute shouting at the tide. Get those AI kids off my lawn, and all that.\n\nAnd in this brave new world of upscaling being more of a requirement than an option, Nvidia really does seem to be holding all the cards. Yes, FSR 3.1 isn't bad at Quality settings, but as my upscaler comparison testing shows, it's still not a patch on DLSS when it comes to image quality\u2014especially when you push it down to Balanced or even, goodness forbid, Performance levels.\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\nAMD says FSR 4 is coming, and it's now machine-learning based. That's probably why you'll need either an RX 9070 or RX 9070 XT to run it, as those cards presumably have some hardware on board equivalent to Nvidia's Tensor cores. Perhaps it can deliver similar framerate gains and image quality, but something in me doubts it. Nvidia has leant so heavily on the AI button for so long, I honestly can't see AMD catching up in a single swoop.\n\nAI-based upscaling and frame generation performance now matters more than ever. Raw raster performance? Still so, but lesser. And a $549 card that can take advantage of all the DLSS 4 benefits, to the point where it can spit out hundreds of AI-generated frames at a similar rate to the RTX 4090? Yeah, that's a darn tempting package if those claims prove out\u2014and one that AMD seems destined to struggle to beat.\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\nWe don't really know yet what the red team will be bringing to the table. We (and every other major outlet) received a slide presentation announcing the new cards, yet no mention was made of any of them at the briefing itself. We know they'll be mid-range equivalents, we know they'll make use of FSR 4, and we know what the cooler designs look like. Virtually everything else is still conjecture.\n\nBut unless FSR 4 pulls off the same frame-generating magic trick as DLSS 4\u2014and the pricing is ultra-competitive\u2014these new offerings look set to be a hard sell for any gamer in the face of Nvidia's claims. Even for me, sitting over here, willing AMD to provide some meaningful competition.\n\nThere's still a lot yet that might change my mind. For example, in Dave's RTX 5080 testing, he found that Multi Frame Generation struggles with latency when really pushed. Force the RTX 5080 down to 25 fps raw performance levels and the added latency becomes noticeable, which doesn't bode well for the much-less-powerful RTX 5070 being pushed into similar territory.\n\nWe'll find out just what that's like in person when our test sample arrives. The same applies to the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT for that matter, as all is currently quiet on that front\u2014other than suggestions they'll be here in March. But again, unless the price is phenomenally cheaper than the Nvidia equivalent (or AMD pulls an upscaling rabbit out of a hat), it really does seem like the RTX 50-series stands a good chance of dominating this generation.\n\nFor what it's worth, I hope that's not the case. I hope FSR 4 is great, the RX 9070-series is impressive, the prices are low, and this article can be shoved back in my face. Competition is a good thing, and one company completely dominating all the others benefits no-one.\n\nAs things currently stand, though, when it comes to my own cash, the RTX 5070 looks like the most likely candidate for my next GPU purchase. Well, after I've convinced my partner I need a new graphics card and we don't need to be saving for a house quite as hard as we currently are.\n\nAh, damn it. I'm going to be stuck with the RX 7800 XT and old-school FSR forever, aren't I?",

            "content": "Corporate America just kicked off a new quarterly earnings season. Over the next few weeks, hundreds of companies will report their latest financial results, but Wall Street will be most focused on those leading the artificial intelligence (AI) race.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.92%) will release its report for the fourth quarter of 2024 on Tuesday, Feb. 4. The company has become a worthy competitor to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), which are critical for AI development, and investors will be eager for an update on its progress.\n\nAMD stock is attractively valued relative to its AI rival, so should investors buy it ahead of next week's report?\n\nAMD could be Nvidia's biggest threat in the GPU space\n\nAt the end of 2023, AMD launched its MI300X data center GPU in a bid to capture some of Nvidia's incredible 98% market share at the time. The MI300X won several top AI customers, including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Oracle, some of which yielded better performance and lower costs compared to using Nvidia's flagship H100.\n\nAMD has since launched the MI325X to compete with Nvidia's newer H200, and in the second half of this year, it expects to start shipping the new MI350 series. The MI350 will be built on an entirely new architecture called CDNA (Compute DNA) 4, which will deliver 35 times more performance than CDNA 3 GPUs like the MI300X. CDNA 4 will rival Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, which is currently the gold standard in AI.\n\nBut AMD is also the leading supplier of AI chips for personal computers -- a segment of the industry in which Nvidia doesn't currently operate. Over the next few years, AI workloads are going to shift from data centers to the devices we use each day, because it will lead to a much faster and more efficient user experience.\n\nThe widespread adoption of new AI models from developers like China-based DeepSeek could accelerate that transition. They deliver a new level of efficiency which means they require less computing power to run, making them ideal for devices like laptops and tablets.\n\nThis year, AMD says manufacturers like HP, Lenovo, and Asus will launch over 100 computing platforms fitted with its new Ryzen AI 300 Series chips. Expect to hear more about this exciting segment of AMD's business next week.\n\nThe numbers to watch on Feb. 4\n\nIn the near term, Wall Street will remain focused on AMD's data center business because it's now the company's largest source of revenue. During the third quarter of 2024, it brought in a record $3.5 billion which was a 122% increase from the year-ago period. Strong GPU sales were a big contributor to the result.\n\nAMD CEO Lisa Su went into 2024 expecting GPUs like the MI300X to generate $2 billion in total revenue for the year. However, by the third quarter, her forecast had soared to $5 billion because sales were consistently exceeding expectations. If AMD tops that $5 billion number, it will be a sign that its competitive position continues to improve versus Nvidia. That's the first number investors should watch when the report is released next Tuesday.\n\nThe second number to look out for is GPU sales guidance for 2025. Investors will want to see significant growth over the 2024 result, and the near-term direction of AMD stock could hinge on Su's commentary surrounding the number.\n\nFinally, AMD's gaming business will also be under the microscope. Its revenue plunged by 58% during the first three quarters of 2024 due to slowing demand for consoles like Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox, which are both powered by AMD's hardware. Gaming has therefore been a drag on the company's overall results, offsetting the strong growth from the data center segment.\n\nA new generation of GPUs will start shipping to PC gamers everywhere early this year, so that could reignite the segment's revenue. Investors will want to see a clear update on that front.\n\nAMD stock looks attractive at the current level\n\nBased on AMD's trailing 12-month non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $3, its stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 39.1. That's a 17% discount to Nvidia's P/E ratio of 47.1, which implies AMD stock is cheap relative to its AI rival.\n\nThe picture looks even better on a forward basis. According to Wall Street's consensus forecast (provided by Yahoo!), AMD's EPS could soar 54% to $5.13 during 2025, which places its stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 22.8.\n\nIn other words, the stock would have to climb by a whopping 71% over the next 12 months just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 39.1 -- assuming the company doesn't deliver even higher earnings than expected, which is a real possibility that could drive even further upside.\n\nSo, back to the big question: Is AMD stock a buy ahead of the Feb. 4 report? Given the company's enormous AI opportunity not only in the data center, but also in personal computing, the stock will probably be a great addition to any portfolio over a time horizon of five years or more.\n\nIt's unlikely one quarter alone will alter the company's long-term trajectory, so whether investors buy the stock before or after Feb. 4 probably won't impact their chances of earning a positive return over the next few years.",

            "content": "A YouTuber has been outlining some compelling theories on RX 9070 performance versus the RTX 5070\n\nThis theorizing is based on purported internal AMD benchmarks for the RX 9070, and napkin maths for RTX 5070 frame rates\n\nIf it pans out, the RX 9070 XT could easily beat the RTX 5070 Ti, and even come within 10% of the RTX 5080\n\nAMD\u2019s RX 9070 models could handily outgun Nvidia\u2019s mid-range RTX 5070 Ti and 5070 graphics cards, if a considered prediction from a YouTuber pans out.\n\nThis is regular rumor peddler Moore\u2019s Law is Dead (MLID), who in his latest video (embedded below) engages in some napkin maths to work out where the performance of the RTX 5070 and 5070 Ti GPUs are likely to weigh in (more on the intricacies therein shortly). The YouTuber then compares that to internal benchmarks purportedly carried out by AMD a month ago with its RX 9070 models.\n\nThe upshot is this: going by those internal tests from AMD \u2013 add skepticism with all this, meaning the benchmarks, and also MLID\u2019s own theories \u2013 Team Red was targeting a slight win for the RX 9070 XT over the RTX 4080 Founders Edition (to the tune of 3% or so).\n\nMLID then took that level of estimated performance and overlaid it on a graph of benchmarks (a 17-game average) from Hardware Unboxed that includes the RTX 5080. From this, we see that in theory, the RX 9070 XT is within 10% of the RTX 5080 for rasterized (non-ray tracing) performance at 4K resolution.\n\nOn top of that, the YouTuber added in the mentioned napkin maths approximations of RTX 5070 performance, which is that the vanilla RTX 5070 is likely to come in at about 20% faster than Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4070 (so in the ballpark of the RTX 4070 Ti). And that the RTX 5070 Ti is likely to be a rather minor generational uplift, and maybe only slightly faster than the RTX 4070 Ti Super.\n\nGranted, that adds in a good deal of uncertainty, and ifs-and-buts, though it is based on sound enough reasoning. (Namely the uplifts we\u2019ve seen for the RTX 5090 and 5080, on average \u2013 a strong flavor of the architectural gains for Blackwell, in other words \u2013 and then the relative specs of the new RTX 5070 models versus their predecessors).\n\nRTX 5070 performance may not pan out like this, but if it roughly does, MLID theorizes that the RX 9070 XT (based on those internal AMD benchmarks) could potentially be 15% faster than the RTX 5070 Ti. And that the RX 9070 versus the RTX 5070 could see a win for AMD, too, more to the tune of 10%, but still, a marked victory.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

Well, as I\u2019ve already said a couple of times \u2013 but it bears another mention just to underline \u2013 a lot of this is up in the air theorizing, albeit workings-out that make sense to me. MLID lays some heavy caveats on all this himself, although the YouTuber does assert that he\u2019s confident enough in these predictions on the whole.\n\nWe should bear in mind that the graphs used (from Hardware Unboxed) are just straight rasterized performance. Although MLID also notes he\u2019s confident AMD has almost caught up to Nvidia with ray tracing in this generation, but another major piece of the puzzle is DLSS 4 and Team Green\u2019s new frame generation. The latter MFG feature, and other improvements in DLSS 4, are actually huge \u2013 and that shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. We don\u2019t yet know how FSR 4, AMD\u2019s rival next-gen tech, will shake out, and so that remains a fairly weighty question mark here.\n\nAnother critical point here is that it\u2019s all very well analyzing (potential) relative performance levels in a theoretical exercise like this, but even if this proves correct as to the comparative frame rates we\u2019ll get from the RX 9070 versus RTX 5070 models, there\u2019s AMD\u2019s pricing to consider. We know the rough value proposition of the RTX 5070 flavors as we have the MSRPs, but we don\u2019t with the RDNA 4 graphics cards.\n\nMy worry, then, is that AMD will be calculating where to pitch RX 9070 asking prices based on the Nvidia RTX 5070 reviews when they arrive in February (well, if Team Green sticks to its promised launch timeframe for these mid-range graphics cards). It\u2019s certainly been rumored that AMD is still very much weighing up pricing, and the question then becomes: how much does Team Red want to take Nvidia down in the mid-range space?\n\nIf that\u2019s a strong motive here, AMD might come in with really competitive MSRPs for the RX 9070 models. But, if maximizing profits and return is higher up the priority list for RDNA 4, then we could get weightier than rumored asking prices.\n\nWho knows, is really the point, and the RX 9070 will only be an RTX 5070 killer \u2013 assuming MLID\u2019s napkin scribbling and GPU hypothesizing is in the right ballpark \u2013 if AMD prices it to be an RTX 5070 killer. Hopefully that\u2019s the intent, and MLID suggests $499 and $649 (US) as possible price tags for a suitably aggressive move with the RX 9070 and its XT sibling respectively.\n\nPreviously, there were hopes of a sub-$500 price for the RX 9070, but if performance does shape up anything like as suggested here, there\u2019s no reason AMD would need to dip lower than the mentioned $499. And again, this comes back to my worry that AMD might feel free to just push pricing harder than originally intended, perhaps, if the RX 9070 models are outmuscling the RTX 5070s in this vein.",

            "content": "Up until today, the choice of $999 graphics card falls on the shoulders of Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super or AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX. Both premium offerings provide excellent gaming chops in rasterised titles \u2013 4K60 is easy \u2013 though Team Green retains a comfortable lead in ray tracing and arguably has a better upscaling implementation in the form DLSS versus FSR. Now, though, RTX 4080 Super is unceremoniously pushed aside for a new GPU taking the thousand-buck crown. Enter GeForce RTX 5080.\n\nBased on the all-new Blackwell architecture and purposely going big on ray tracing, RTX 5080\u2019s other not-so-secret weapon is multi frame generation. All that said, it still competes with Radeon RX 7900 XTX for mindshare, so let me do the hard work and compare the pair across specs and games.\n\nRTX 5080 RX 7900 XTX Ratio Released Jan 2025 Nov 2022 \u2013 Codename Blackwell Plum Bonito \u2013 GPU GB203 Navi 31 XTX \u2013 Process TSMC 4N TSMC 5/6 Transistors bn 45.6 57.7 0.79 Die size mm\u00b2 378 529 0.71 Cores 10,752 6,144 1.75 Base clock MHz 2,295 1,929 1.19 Boost clock MHz 2,617 2,498 1.05 FP32 Boost TFLOPS 56.3 61.4 0.92 SM count 84 96 0.87 RT cores 84 (4th Gen) 96 0.87 RT TFLOPS 170.6 \u2013 \u2013 Tensor cores 336 (5th Gen) 192 1.75 FP16 Acc TFLOPS 450.2 122.8 3.67 ROPS 112 192 0.58 Memory GB 16 24 0.67 Memory type GDDR7 GDDR6 \u2013 Mem. clock Gb/s 30 20 1.50 Mem. interface bits 256 384 0.67 Mem. bandwidth GB/s 960 960 1.00 Board power watts 360 355 1.01 Launch MSRP $ 999 999 1.00\n\nGeForce RTX 5080 is over two years newer than AMD\u2019s head consumer honcho. I know Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 are slated for a March launch, though all indications point to slower performance than RX 7900 XTX in most games and applications.\n\nAMD\u2019s historical focus on FP32 throughput stands proud against RTX 5080. Navi 31 XTX\u2019s architecture effectively double pumps cores to reach 61.4 TFLOPS, which is around 10% higher than Nvidia.\n\nRTX 5080, however, offers significant ray tracing and AI capability. Going by my calculations, it has over 3x the FP16 Tensor throughput and while ray tracing numbers are not available for AMD, I\u2019m adamant Nvidia is way higher, borne from knowledge of how cards compare in previously tested RT-heavy games.\n\nNvidia persists with a single monolithic die whereas AMD uses a chiplet architecture for RX 7900 XTX, where main graphics is built on a 5nm process while memory uses a marginally cheaper 6nm node.\n\nAMD also provides a 24GB framebuffer compared to 16GB for Nvidia, though both are serviced with identical memory bandwidth. Nvidia goes narrow and fast \u2013 256 bits and 30Gb/s GDDR7 \u2013 while AMD opts for slower and wider. The two GPUs consume almost identical power running full chat, too.\n\nDivergent design philosophies clash in this $1,000 showdown.\n\nPerformance\n\nI ran GeForce RTX 5080 and Radeon RX 7900 XTX back-to-back on the 2025 Club386 test system. Keeping all other variables as consistent as possible, the following benchmark numbers can be trusted as a yardstick for evaluating performance across a swathe of applications and games.\n\nApplication and AI\n\n3DMark Speed Way adds to conventional load by including lots of ray tracing. This is perhaps why RTX 5080 steals a large lead over RX 7900 XTX. 38% is not to be sniffed at.\n\nRemoving ray tracing and focussing on pure rasterisation performance has the opposite effect. Benchmark numbers get closer together, suggesting to me that Radeon RX 7900 XTX is still a mighty fine card for older games run at high resolutions with all eye candy turned on. The gap falls from 38% to 23%.\n\nUse a graphics card to render projects in Blender? I send you towards Team Green\u2019s RTX 5080.\n\nSimple AI is a doddle for either card.\n\nThis test uses a locally run 13-billion parameter Llama 3.1 model to generate answers to various questions, in the same way programs like ChatGPT work in the cloud. Though a heck of a lot simpler, Llama 3.1 is a great on-device LLM. GeForce RTX 5080 is almost exactly twice as capable.\n\nBut what do these numbers really mean? They represent an accumulation of how long it takes for Llama 3.1 to answer your query and how quickly it\u2019s able to build on that with a reasoned answer. RTX 5080, for example, takes 0.28 seconds to start answering and then pushes 150 tokens per second, or how quickly it finishes answering. By comparison, RX 7900 XTX takes 0.82s and returns 108 tokens per second. Looking at them in real time, Radeon doesn\u2019t feel twice as slow.\n\nGaming\n\nOn to the nub of the matter. GeForce RTX 5080 can\u2019t pull away from RX 7900 XTX in Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage. AMD\u2019s healthy FP32 throughput and generous memory bandwidth and Infinity Cache hold it in great stead. Though it loses, I mark this as an indirect win for an older design.\n\nAnother rasterisation-heavy title, another closely fought contest. You can look at this in two ways. The first is to think Nvidia deliberately leaves raster performance on the table \u2013 RTX 5080 ROPS count is much lower than RX 7900 XTX \u2013 and goes after RT and Tensor/DLSS; the other is to applaud AMD for making a card this competitive in 2022.\n\nThrowing in a generous dollop of ray tracing separates the pair at each resolution. Nvidia usually argues its GPUs are more forward looking in nature. I tend to agree.\n\nIt takes up until UHD for Nvidia to squeak past AMD.\n\nThis matchup is closer than I originally suspected. No one\u2019s going to complain at 4K150+ from either card, though.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets interesting. I run Cyberpunk 2077 with Ray Tracing Overdrive, which is a setting that includes GPU-bashing path tracing.\n\nIn many ways, this is an ideal scenario for GeForce RTX 50 Series cards because it very much plays to their architectural strengths. I know this because RTX 5080 is twice as fast as RX 7900 XTX at each resolution, but I question the usefulness of either at UHD.\n\nDLSS\n\nAdding DLSS and FSR3 Quality upscaling in the mix elevates frame rates markedly. But here\u2019s the thing; Nvidia remains twice as fast.\n\nSticking on each card\u2019s best-performing frame generation reinforces Nvidia\u2019s dominance with this type of technology. All that said, it\u2019s worth pointing out higher framerates at UHD aren\u2019t that useful a metric. The reason for this is DLSS/FSR work best when the underlying frame rate is >30fps, as one cannot magic fluidity out of a slideshow, no matter what the on-screen frame rate says.\n\nGame RX 7900 XTX to RTX 5080 % uplift at 4K Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage 5.8 Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail 7.7 Forza Motorsport 47.5 Mount and Blade 6.1 Rainbow Six Extraction 9.0 Cyberpunk 2077 DLSS + FG 270\n\nI\u2019ll preface 4K results by saying they\u2019re absolutely dependent upon game. Those which mainly use rasterisation \u2013 four of six here do \u2013 see single-digit performance increases from RX 7900 XTX to RTX 5080. In that context, I\u2019m more impressed with AMD than with Nvidia, particularly as the former provides a 50% larger frame buffer into the bargain.\n\nNever has GPU evaluation been so fraught with methodology. Cranking up ray tracing gives RTX 5080 a 47% lead, while the magic button that is multi frame generation takes performance to a completely different level, though it may not experientially feel that much faster or better.\n\nIf you\u2019ve found this comparison useful, please do read the following head-to-heads.\n\nGeForce RTX 5080 vs. RTX 5090\n\nGeForce RTX 5080 vs. RTX 4080 Super\n\nGeForce RTX 5080 vs. RTX 3080\n\nVitals\n\nWhat do you know, near-identical system wide power consumption.\n\nAnd both coolers perform well in keeping them cool.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Founders Edition is plain better at matching up low temperatures with low noise.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt\u2019s well known in gaming circles that AMD is leaving the $999+ graphics card segment to Nvidia for the time being. A wasted opportunity in my book as existing Radeon RX 7900 XTX proves to be a fine GPU even in 2025. My numbers suggest it performs closely to GeForce RTX 5080 in rasterisation and light ray tracing scenarios, which is some feat for an architecture over two years old and one carrying far greater card memory.\n\nNevertheless, RTX 5080 cracks RX 7900 XTX when oodles of ray tracing are added to the mix \u2013 see Forza Motorsport and Cyberpunk 2077 as proof points \u2013 and I contend Nvidia has comfortably superior upscaling technology in the form of DLSS run with Transformer models. Then there\u2019s multi frame generation to consider, which is a technology that AMD has no current answer to. It\u2019s available on 75 games and apps on launch, implemented by either native support or override in the control panel. It\u2019s what I call a Big Deal\u2122.\n\nPutting these parts together leads to me to the inevitable conclusion that RTX 5080 is a better graphics card than RX 7900 XTX if both cost the same money. Muddying waters, AMD\u2019s finest is currently available for $870 or so, and I expect partner RTX 5080s to hit shelves north of $1,100. If pricing holds true, the decision becomes a lot tougher.\n\nMy key takeaway is there\u2019s no bad card at the premium end of the market. GeForce RTX 5080 carries on the good work established by numerous previous generations, though I\u2019d really appreciate a future Super variant with 24GB of onboard memory. Come on, Nvidia, you can do it.\n\nGeForce RTX 5080 \u201cGear up for game-changing experiences with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 and AI-powered DLSS 4.\u201d Read our review. Buy from Amazon",

Several LLMs using R1 are compatible with RX 7000 series desktop GPUs and select Ryzen CPUs with XDNA NPUs. However, they require the optional driver Adrenalin 25.1.1 to run.\n\nThe guide has everything AMD users need to get DeepSeek R1 running on their local (supported) machine. LM Studio has a one-click installer tailor-made for Ryzen AI, which is the method AMD users will use to install R1. AMD shows how the application needs to be tuned for its hardware, including a list of the maximum supported LLM parameters.\n\nDeepSeek R1 allegedly has only recently been distilled into \"highly capable\" smaller models, small enough to run on consumer-based hardware. The DeepSeek-V3 model was initially trained on a cluster of 2,048 Nvidia H800 GPUs for context.\n\nYouTube Watch On\n\nThe maximum supported LLM parameters are based on memory capacity. The RX 7600 XT, 7700 XT, 7800 XT, 7900 GRE, and 7900 XT all support up to \u201cDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B\u201d. The flagship RX 7900 XTX supports up to \u201cDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B\u201d.

Two days ago, it was solely responsible for Nvidia\u2019s record-breaking $589 billion market cap loss. The DeepSeek R1 model relies on extreme optimization levels to provide its 11X efficiency uplift, relying on Nvidia\u2019s assembly-like Parallel Thread Execution (PTX) programming for most of the performance uplift.\n\nNvidia and AMD GPUs aren\u2019t the only GPUs that can run R1; Huawei has already implemented DeepSeek support into its Ascend AI GPUs, enabling performant AI execution on homegrown Chinese hardware.",

First, make sure you have the absolute latest graphics driver from AMD. That means the 25.1.1 Optional driver, which, in our testing, absolutely will not come down in Adrenalin, even with Optional drivers enabled. You're going to have to head to AMD's site to download it the old-fashioned way.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeepseek is well-suited to math questions in particular.\n\n\n\nThis screen lets you easily download new models to try out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, LM Studio has an option built into the software to browse and download models; you can see it in the screenshot above. Type in the model you want\u2014find it in the chart below\u2014and in theory, it should be as simple as clicking on Download. In practice, we weren't able to get model downloads in LM Studio working, and had to go download the GGUF weighs ourselves from HuggingFace . If you have to go this route, make sure you hit the console and do \"lms import \" (you'll have to launch LM Studio once first.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe specific versions of DeepSeek you should grab for each supported hardware.\n\nOnce you've got the model installed in LM Studio, it's as simple as loading it using the button at the top and then chatting away. Even if you have a powerful GPU like our Radeon RX 7800 XT\u2014which is capable of producing more than 40 tokens per second, far faster than anyone can read\u2014you'll still have to wait anywhere from 5 to 50+ seconds for the model to think before it answers. You can actually unfurl the box for this and see the model's reasoning process, too, which is pretty enlightening sometimes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a tweet, AMD claims LLM competitiveness against NVIDIA's finest... as of last week.\n\n\n\nMuch of the discussion around upstart Chinese AI firm Deepseek's technology has been centered around the idea that it can be deployed using considerably less powerful hardware than is typically required for useful language models. That means you can run it directly on your home PC; no internet connection required at all. This isn't exactly novel in and of itself, but Deepseek's R1-Distill model is indeed the first \"reasoning\" model to be released to the public for use on whatever hardware you like.Once you have that installed, simply head to this link to download the Ryzen AI version of LM Studio. LM Studio isn't created by AMD and is not exclusive to AMD hardware, but this particular version comes pre-configured to work on AMD's CPUs and GPUs, and should give you pretty decent performance on any of them\u2014albeit those CPU-based AI computations are pretty sluggish compared to GPU.As we noted above, LM Studio is not exclusive to AMD hardware, but if you're not using red-team gear you may want to download the standard LM studio instead of the AMD Ryzen version. We're not sure if it really matters, but better safe than sorry. You can head to AMD's blog post if you want more detailed instructions on how to set it up.",

Before the announcement, this platform was also known as AMD Kraken Point.\n\nThis hardware is meant for mid-range thin-and-light computers and is found stand-alone in most implementations. However, some lower-tier variants of certain all-rounder notebooks are also available with Krackan Point Ryzen 7 specs, while the upper-tier implement Ryzen 9 AI HX specs.\n\nKrackan Point hardware is still built on AMD\u2019s latest technology as of early 2025, with a processor that offers a mix of Zen5 Performance and Zen5c Efficiency cores, as well as an iGPU with RDNA 3.5 Compute Units. However, there\u2019s just less of everything on these Ryzen 7/5 processors in comparison to the Strix Point Ryzen AI 9s.\n\nThat means you should expect lower CPU and especially graphics capabilities from Krackan Point laptops, but also significantly more affordable prices and, hopefully, wider availability.\n\nDown below I\u2019ve gathered the AMD Krackan Ryzen AI 300 APUs that will be implemented in devices this year, with Pro and non-Pro variants. The Pros are meant for business/enterprise notebooks, while the non-Pros are for regular consumer laptops.\n\nI\u2019ve also included the AMD Strix Point Ryzen 9 APUs in the table, as well as AMD Hawk Point and Hawk Point-R Ryzen 7 APUs, to showcase the differences between these platforms, as you will find them all implemented in fairly similar devices, and you\u2019d better understand the differences between them in order to figure out which one is best suited for your needs and budget.\n\nRyzen 7 AI\n\n350 Ryzen 5 AI\n\n340 Ryzen 9 AI\n\nHX 370 Ryzen 9 AI\n\n365 Ryzen 7 250 Ryzen 7 8845HS Build process TSMC 4nm FinFET Generation Zen 5 Zen 4 Zen 4 Codename Krackan Krackan Strix Strix Hawk Point R Hawk Point TDP 15+ W 15+ W 15+ W 15+ W 15+ W 15+ W Cores/Threads 4x Zen5, 4x Zen5c,\n\n16 Threads 3x Zen5, 3x Zen5c,\n\n12 Threads 4x Zen5, 8x Zen5c,\n\n24 Threads 4x Zen5, 6x Zen5c,\n\n24 Threads 8x Zen4/\n\n16 Threads 8x Zen4/\n\n16 Threads CPU Max Turbo up to 5.0 GHz \u2013 Zen5,\n\nup to 3.5 GHz \u2013 Zen5c up to 4.8 GHz \u2013 Zen5,\n\nup to 3.54 GHz \u2013 Zen5c up to 5.1 GHz \u2013 Zen5,\n\nup to 3.3 GHz \u2013 Zen5c up to 5.0 GHz \u2013 Zen5,\n\nup to 3.3 GHz \u2013 Zen5c 5.1 GHz 5.1 GHz L2+L3 Cache 24 MB 22 MB 36 MB 34 MB 24 MB 24 MB Memory Type DDR5-5600, LPDDR5x-8000 DDR5-5600, LPDDR5x-7500 Graphics Radeon 860M,\n\n8CUs, RDNA3.5 Radeon 840M,\n\n4CUs, RDNA3.5 Radeon 890M,\n\n16CUs, RDNA3.5 Radeon 880M,\n\n12CUs, RDNA3.5 Radeon 780M,\n\n12 EUs, RDNA3 AI Engine NPU \u2013 up to 50 TOPS\n\nTotal \u2013 up to 66 TOPS NPU \u2013 up to 50 TOPS\n\nTotal \u2013 up to 80 TOPS NPU \u2013 up to 50 TOPS\n\nTotal \u2013 up to 80 TOPS NPU \u2013 up to 50 TOPS\n\nTotal \u2013 up to 73 TOPS Total \u2013 up to 38 TOPS\n\nHere\u2019s a very brief explanation of these specs:\n\nStrix Point and Krackan Point hardware both implement AMD\u2019s latest CPU and iGPU cores, with fewer processing/graphics cores on the Ryzen AI 7 and AI 5 SKUs;\n\nKrackan Point is mostly slower in GPU loads and games, where the Radeon 860M/840M get far fewer CUs than the Radeon 890M/880M in the Strix chips. But on the CPU side, the general capabilities of the two hardware lineups should be close, with still an advantage for the Ryzen Strix Point SKUs, of course, but just not as notable as on the graphics side;\n\nHawk Point 2 is rebadged Hawk Point hardware, so the Ryzen 7 250 is just a Ryzen 7 8845HS with a new name; they\u2019re all built on Zen4 CPU cores and RDNA3 graphics;\n\nEven so, though, the Ryzen 7 250 should have a performance advantage over the Ryzen AI 7 350, with 8x performance cores and 12 EUs on the iGPU. And it should be a cheaper option as well. However, where the Ryzen AI chip wins is IPC and single-core performance, as well as efficiency on battery power. But the choice between the two isn\u2019t as straightforward as it might seem.\n\nI\u2019d even argue the choice between Krackan Point and Strix Point specs isn\u2019t straightforward either, especially with Strix Point laptops already available in stores for a while and now offered at discounts. That means there\u2019s a fair chance you\u2019ll find a Ryzen 9 365 notebook for less than a Ryzen 7 350 model, at least in the first part of the year. But for the most part, Krackan Point implementations are going to end up more affordable than Strix Point variants. Plus, EOMs will most likely be careful choosing between these two hardware platforms, and I doubt you\u2019ll be able to find both options in the same chassis, at least in most cases.\n\nFor now, very few Krackan Point configurations have been announced, with retail availability scheduled around the second part of Q1 2025. That\u2019s when we\u2019ll be able to get our hands on some units and update the article with more details on performance and general capabilities versus the Strix Point models. Stay around for updates.\n\nWe\u2019ll also discuss how this hardware compares to Intel\u2019s counterparts, such as Lunar Lake Core Ultra 200V and Arrow Lake Core Ultra 200H, even if those are quite different and are mostly found in more expensive devices.\n\nList of Laptops built on AMD Krackan Point (Ryzen AI 300) hardware\n\nThis section lists all the available notebooks built on Krackan Point chips, with either Ryzen AI 7 350/ Ryzen AI 5 340 hardware or their Pro-series counterparts.\n\nSo far, only a handful of units have been announced on this hardware, most of them thin-and-light implementations. We\u2019re upgrading the article as new units are announced.\n\nThis list is a work in progress, so if you spot any device that should be in here and is not yet, let us know about it in the comments section at the end of the article.\n\n\u2014 updating\n\nModel Format, Weight Screen Hardware and particularities Battery Acer Swift Go 14 AI mid-tier ultrabook,\n\n1.3 kg / 2.9 lbs 14\u2033 16:10,\n\nOLED or IPS,\n\ntouch or non-touch,\n\n180-hinge up to AMD Ryzen AI 7 350,\n\nmax 32 GB LPDDR5x RAM, 2x M.2 SSD 65 Wh Acer Swift Go 16 AI mid-tier portable laptop,\n\nall-metal build,\n\n1.5 kg / 3.3 lbs 16\u2033 OLED or IPS,\n\ntouch or non-touch,\n\n180-hinge up to AMD Ryzen AI 7 350,\n\nmax 32 GB LPDDR5x RAM, 2x M.2 SSD,\n\nup to 45W TDP;\n\ndual-fan single-heatsink dual-heatpipe cooling 53, 65 Wh Acer Nitro V 14 AI mid-tier portable gaming laptop,\n\nmostly plastic build,\n\n1.6 kg / 3.55 lbs 14.5\u2033 IPS, matte,\n\n2.5K 165Hz up to AMD Ryzen AI 7 350, w/ RTX 4050 ??W\n\nmax 32 GB DDR5 RAM, 2x slots, 1x M.2 SSD,\n\ndual-fan dual-exhaust cooling 76 Wh Acer Nitro V 15 AI entry-tier all-around laptop,\n\nmostly plastic build,\n\n2.1 kg / 4.6 lbs 15.6\u2033 16:9 IPS, matte,\n\n2.5K 180Hz up to AMD Ryzen AI 7 350, w/ RTX 4050 ??W\n\nmax 32 GB DDR5 RAM, 2x slots, 2x M.2 SSD,\n\ndual-fan dual-exhaust cooling 57 Wh Acer Nitro V 16 AI mid-tier all0around laptop,\n\nmostly metal build,\n\n2.45 kg / 5.4 lbs 16\u2033 IPS, matte,\n\n2.5K 180Hz up to AMD Ryzen AI 7 350, w/ RTX 4050 ??W\n\nmax 32 GB DDR5 RAM, 2x slots, 2x M.2 SSD,\n\ndual-fan quad-exhaust cooling 76 Wh Asus Zenbook 14 UM3406 upper-tier ultrabook,\n\n1.2 kg / 2.65 lbs 14\u2033 16:10 OLED\n\n2K 60Hz or 3K 120Hz,\n\nmostly non-touch up to AMD Ryzen AI 7 350,\n\nmax 32 GB LPDDR5x RAM, 1x M.2 SSD,\n\n~30W TDP;\n\nsingle-fan single-heatsink single-heatpipe cooling 75 Wh Asus Vivobook S 14 M5406 mid-tier ultrabook,\n\n1.25 kg / 2.8 lbs 14\u2033 16:10 OLED\n\n2K 60Hz or 3K 120Hz,\n\nnon-touch up to AMD Ryzen AI 7 350,\n\nmax 32 GB LPDDR5x RAM, 1x M.2 SSD\n\n~45W TDP;\n\ndual-fan dual-heatsink dual-heatpipe cooling 75 Wh Asus Vivobook S 16 M5606 mid-tier ultrabook,\n\n1.5 kg / 3.3 lbs 16\u2033 16:10 OLED\n\n3K 120Hz, non-touch up to AMD Ryzen AI 7 350,\n\nmax 32 GB LPDDR5x RAM, 1x M.2 SSD,\n\n~45W TDP;\n\ndual-fan dual-heatsink dual-heatpipe cooling 75 Wh Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 GA605 premium all-rounder,\n\n1.85 kg / 4.1 lbs 16\u2033 16:10 OLED\n\n2.5K 240Hz, non-touch from AMD Ryzen AI 7 350, w/ RTX 5070 115W,\n\nmax 32 GB LPDDR5x RAM, 2x M.2 SSD\n\ndual-fan with multiple heatpipes 90 Wh Lenovo Legion 5 mid-range portable all-rounder,\n\n3 kg / 4.4 lbs 15.1\u2033 16:10 OLED\n\n2.5K 165Hz, non-touch up to AMD Ryzen AI 7 350, w/ RTX 5070 115W,\n\nmax 64 GB DDR5 RAM, 2x slots, 2x M.2 SSD\n\ndual-fan with multiple heatpipes 80 Wh\n\nSo far, all these are hardware refreshes of existing thin-and-light portable devices.

The RX 9070 XT, priced between $599 and $649, could challenge the RTX 5080, which starts at $999. The RX 9070 XT features 16GB of GDDR6 memory, while the RTX 5080 has 16GB of GDDR7. NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5080 has launched, and AMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT is expected to perform within 10% of it in 4K gaming. The RX 9070 XT, priced between $599 and $649, could challenge the RTX 5080, which starts at $999. The RX 9070 XT features 16GB of GDDR6 memory, while the RTX 5080 has 16GB of GDDR7.\n\nNVIDIA's new GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card just launched, and now we've got some performance targets from AMD for its new Radeon RX 9070 XT and Radeon RX 9070 graphics cards... where it looks like we can expect the RX 9070 XT to fall inside of 10% of the performance of the RTX 5080.\n\n2\n\nVIEW GALLERY - 2 IMAGES\n\nIn a new video from leaker Moore's Law is Dead who has gone through GeForce RTX 5080 reviews and overlayed the performance targets for the new RDNA 4-powered Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 in 4K gaming, when looked at from HBU's review data from 17 game average performance at 4K, we can expect the new RX 9070 XT to have performance that's within 10% of the RTX 5080.\n\nThis means that AMD's new flagship Radeon RX 9070 XT could get pretty damn close to the 4K gaming performance of the RTX 5080, and if sold at $599 to $649, could really stir up the gaming GPU market. Furthermore, the Radeon RX 9070 non-XT should have 4K gaming performance that'll sit above the RTX 5070 and below the RTX 5070 Ti... right in the middle, in fact, and just under the RDNA 3-based Radeon RX 7900 XT.\n\nAMD's new flagship Radeon RX 9070 XT will have 16GB of GDDR6 memory, matching the VRAM capacity of NVIDIA's just-launched GeForce RTX 5080 which has the same 16GB, but newer, super-fast GDDR7 memory.\n\nNVIDIA has a starting price of $999 for its new RTX 5080, so if AMD could price its new RX 9070 XT at $649... it could be an automatic win for Team Red, at $599, it would be a stellar victory if performance falls within single-digit percentage of the RTX 5080, for far, far less money.",

Sadly, the company\u2019s communications don\u2019t extend past shutting down whispers with any notion of an official word relegated to the nebulous realms of the future.\n\nIn an X post, AMD\u2019s Frank Azor responded to recent claims that Radeon RX 9070 Series pricing could have been close to GeForce RTX 5070 Ti. More specifically, Azor categorically denies that an $899 starting price point was ever a part of the company\u2019s plans.\n\nWhile we aren\u2019t going to comment on all the price rumors, I can say that an $899 USD starting price point was never part of the plan. \u2014 Frank Azor (@AzorFrank) January 27, 2025\n\nNaturally, this leaves potential buyers with the question of: \u201cwell, how much are they?\u201d In response to such queries, Azor merely confirmed that more news would be forthcoming. As a reminder, Radeon RX 9000 Series will launch in March. Prior to release, I expect AMD will follow through on its plans to throw an event specifically for the graphics cards following their omission from the company\u2019s CES 2025 keynote. Expect more details then.\n\nThere\u2019s little reason to distrust Azor\u2019s word regarding Radeon RX 9000 Series pricing. However, it doesn\u2019t put to rest rumours that price pressure from Nvidia was partly to blame for this unexpected change in launch plans. At least the wait should be worthwhile as AMD takes this extra time to increase FSR 4 support in games prior to release through driver updates or natively.\n\nI sincerely hope prior rumours of a $479 price tag for Radeon RX 9070 Series hold water, with RX 9060 Series cards naturally costing even less. This would allow AMD to undercut all of Nvidia\u2019s confirmed GeForce RTX 50 Series offerings and should leave its rival with little wriggle room for 60 class GPUs.\n\nUntil then, we have graphics card goliaths GeForce RTX 5090 and 5080 to contend with. Both are due to arrive January 30 and you can expect the Club386 verdict on the latter in due course.

            "content": "The media and entertainment (M&E) industries have long been at the center of society\u2019s innovation \u2014 from the printing press and radio to the first moving pictures, television, animation, and video games. As creative industries evolve, consumer demand for the next big thing has only increased. Today, we\u2019re at an inflection point where consumers are expecting fresh and innovative entertainment experiences across film, television, and gaming, and creatives must deliver.\n\nHowever, this expectation poses many challenges: artists and studios must create a larger volume of higher-fidelity entertainment content than ever before, which in turn requires more compute power to handle the ever-growing datasets. So, while production software is important, having the right workstation to run it is essential. Lenovo is helping creatives in the M&E industry meet this challenge through AI-optimized devices in its Workstation portfolio, working with partners such AMD.\n\nA history of innovation\n\nSince the advent of modern television more than 70 years ago, the medium has constantly been evolving \u2014 and the past 20 years especially have seen tremendous growth and innovation. Standard definition TV was ubiquitous up until the late-1990s, when major networks began to embrace HDTV. Adoption was slow, but eventually it became the norm.\n\nThen came 4K, which saw mass adoption once content became more readily available through cable providers and streaming services. In addition to a higher definition picture, 4K also puts more demands on creatives because any time you make resolution changes, the complexity of the required content multiplies. Looking ahead, the industry is currently making great strides on 8K resolution, though widespread adoption is still further in the distance. While this new development will mean incredible picture quality, it will put even higher demands on graphic artists and visual effects professionals.\n\nThe right solution for a challenging task\n\nThere is a fundamental gap between what artists and studios are being asked to deliver and what they\u2019re able to deliver given imposed timelines and budgets, along with the current tools available. That\u2019s where Lenovo\u2019s Workstation portfolio, powered by AMD, can help bridge the gap between clients\u2019 expectations and the resources needed to deliver the highest-fidelity visual content. Not only has the technology progressed, but also the skill of the artists to be able to harness that technology \u2014 and the compute power is essential to creating high-quality visuals.\n\nThe ThinkStation P8 Workstation helps power-users create revolutionary products better, smarter, and faster than ever before. It combines a breakthrough compute architecture with an advanced thermal design in a rack-optimized, Aston Martin-inspired chassis. Featuring the latest AMD Ryzen\u2122 Threadripper\u2122 PRO 7000 WX-Series processor, up to three NVIDIA RTX\u2122 6000 Ada Generation graphics, robust PCIe Gen 5 connectivity, and high-speed DDR5 memory, the ThinkStation P8 delivers staggering performance output from a single-socket platform. M&E creatives benefit from the lightning-fast renders, simulations, image processing and simulations, and build/compiling processes for game development.\n\nThe ThinkStation P8 workstation was developed directly from customer feedback. By partnering with organizations dedicated to smarter innovation, like AMD, we\u2019re able to make our power users\u2019 needs a top priority. But we don\u2019t just create solutions in a bubble \u2013 we include customer input as part of the development process to make sure we deliver what they need and help make their creative process more efficient. In fact, many of the current Workstation features are the result of direct conversation with artists and studios about what they expect and need from the technology.\n\nLenovo and AMD in action\n\nWylie Co., founded in 2015 creates pre-viz, post-viz, and visual effects finals for feature films in a very efficient manner, and at a higher quality than most other visual effects studios. The company was brought onboard to work on visual effects for the first Dune movie and had to turn around shots quickly, and at a very high-quality. \u201cTo be successful in this business, you have to be incredibly efficient,\u201d says Jacob Maymudes, Wylie Co. founder and CEO. \u201cIn order to do that you need the best hardware.\u201d\n\nThrough research Wylie Company found the AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO, which he describes as having an \u201cunfathomable amount of bandwidth.\u201d Deploying Lenovo ThinkStation P620 workstations, powered by Threadripper PRO, helped the Wylie team turn around hundreds of post-viz and final shots needed to complete the movie\u2019s stunning visuals. \u201cIt enabled us to turn around incredible amounts of iterations and be incredibly efficient with our team,\u201d Maymudes says.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nWith the promise that AI will make our lives and jobs easier comes the concern that it could replace certain jobs. But that simply isn\u2019t the case. If anything, it will be more of an assistant to the artist, allowing them to focus more on more of the creative aspects of the project versus the technical components.\n\nThe world of production is rapidly changing, and artists and studios require the technology \u2014 hardware and software \u2014 to create content across film, television, streaming, and gaming that meets consumer demand. By working with companies like AMD, Lenovo is delivering on the promise of being a valued technology partner now and in the future.",

This is similar to the RDNA 3 GPUs starting with the RX 7800 XT. This is one area that AMD has pushed some of its price to performance, giving gamers a bit more VRAM than comparable NVIDIA products.NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5070, while only having 12GB of VRAM, makes it the newer GDDR7 variety. Priced at $549, it also puts significant pressure on AMD to produce a keen competitor. Going up the range, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti bumps the VRAM to 16GB, along with the price at $749. These two GPUs are more than likely the range that the Radeon RX 9070 XT will target, as anything over that approaches the $999 GeForce RTX 5080 territory.AMD has another problem on its hands, namely the technology advantage that NVIDIA currently enjoys. This takes the form of superior ray tracing performance, which has been a trouble spot historically for AMD's offering. The more polished DLSS 4 and multi frame generation technology also pin NVIDIA's AI implementation for gaming ahead of AMD's FSR and similar.Perhaps even AMD itself is unsure of what to do versus the NVIDIA lineup. There has been some confusion around launch dates and similar preparations for the RX 9070 XT , which started with a lack of information at CES 2025. One thing that we do know is that the GPU will not start at $899, since that was confirmed by Frank Azor.",

VideoCardz calculated that this meant the RX 9070 XT would retail at around $899, while the vanilla RX 9070 would be $749. Moreover, the original launch date of the first RX 9000 cards was claimed to be January 23. However, AMD Chief Architect of Gaming Solutions and Gaming Marketing Frank Azor has now clarified that an $899 starting price for the RX 9070 XT \u201cwas never part of the plan.\u201d\n\nWhile we aren\u2019t going to comment on all the price rumors, I can say that an $899 USD starting price point was never part of the plan.January 27, 2025\n\nAMD has yet to release official pricing for its upcoming RDNA 4 graphics cards, which are supposed to deliver performance on par with the RTX 5070 and 5070 Ti. The first batch of Radeon 9000 graphics cards was conspicuous by the absence of details during AMD\u2019s keynote, with the company saying it ran out of time to show them off on-stage at the event.\n\nRumors suggest that Team Red was caught off guard by the aggressive pricing that Intel and Nvidia introduced in the mid-range market, especially as the Intel Arc B580 launched at $249, while Team Green priced the RTX 5070 Ti and 5070 'MSRP cards' at $749 and $549, respectively. These rumors were quickly dispelled by AMD, though, through its posts on social media. Though we are still waiting for the actual pricing of its latest GPUs.\n\nNevertheless, it seems that there\u2019s already a ready stock of AMD\u2019s latest GPUs in various retailers and that they\u2019re just waiting on the company to give the go signal and put them on the front-of-store shelves. This delay means that reviewers haven\u2019t been able to release the details of these new GPUs, and that we can only rely on leaked specs to estimate how much these graphics cards will perform.\n\nAMD hasn\u2019t released any official statement about why they delayed the release of these graphics cards, but we hope it will allow retailers to stock up on RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 GPUs from the get-go and prevent shortages. That way, we don\u2019t have to worry about finding a new GPU and dealing with scalpers selling these hard-to-find PC components at more than triple the MSRP.\n\nStill, if you\u2019re looking to upgrade your GPU, you should wait until the release of the Nvidia 5070 and 5070 Ti, which is rumored to be on February 20, and these AMD GPUs in March, before spending your hard-earned money. That way, you can check out multiple independent reviews of these cards and ensure that you\u2019re getting the best hardware for your needs and budget.",

This comes after a session where AMD had closed at $115.01, amid a backdrop where competitor Nvidia (NVDA) witnessed a staggering $600 billion loss in market capitalization.\n\nMelius Research has revised its outlook on AMD, downgrading the stock from \u2018Buy\u2019 to \u2018Hold\u2019 and cutting its price target by nearly 20%, from $160 to $129. This downgrade does not stem from concerns related to DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, but rather reflects a more cautious outlook on AMD\u2019s prospects in the x86 server and PC markets over the long term.\n\nThe research firm\u2019s note to investors highlights an increasing competitiveness in these segments, where AMD has traditionally held strong positions. The caution arises from potential challenges in maintaining market share against not only Nvidia but also other players in the increasingly crowded and dynamic semiconductor space.\n\nAMD\u2019s performance in the server market, particularly with its EPYC processors, has been a significant growth driver in recent years, offering competitive alternatives to Intel\u2019s (INTC) offerings. However, with the market evolving, especially with AI and specialized computing needs, the landscape for x86 processors could become more challenging.\n\nMoreover, the PC market, which has seen fluctuations due to various global economic factors, also weighs on AMD\u2019s outlook. While AMD has made substantial inroads in this market with its Ryzen series, the cyclical nature of PC sales, coupled with potential shifts towards ARM-based architectures, could impact growth projections.\n\nThis downgrade by Melius Research might also reflect broader industry trends where the focus is shifting towards AI and cloud computing, areas where Nvidia has been particularly aggressive. Even though AMD has made strides with its graphics and AI processing units, the competition is intense, and market expectations might now be adjusting to a more conservative growth narrative for AMD.\n\nInvestors are thus navigating a period where the semiconductor sector is at a crossroads, with traditional computing architectures facing new challenges from emerging technologies. The adjustment in AMD\u2019s stock price and the analyst\u2019s revised expectations underscore the need for AMD to pivot or enhance its strategy in these key markets to maintain or grow its market share. This scenario also signals to investors the importance of monitoring AMD\u2019s strategic moves in AI, cloud computing, and its ability to innovate in a rapidly changing tech landscape.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

Melius Research\u2019s Ben Reitzes has downgraded his AMD rating from Buy to Hold (i.e., Neutral), while also cutting his price target from $160 to $129. (To watch Reitzes\u2019 track record, click here)\n\nBut is this just another case of dampened GPU prospects? Not exactly. While Nvidia\u2019s shadow certainly plays a role, Reitzes had already tempered his GPU outlook earlier this year.\n\n\u201cWe are now more cautious on x86 server and PC as well over the long-term for AMD,\u201d Reitzes explained. \u201cThe reason? We think Nvidia is going to increasingly \u2018come for them\u2019 in both markets with their Arm-based CPUs that are optimized for \u2018accelerated PCs.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the analyst is becoming more worried that custom CPUs and Nvidia CPUs will \u201ccannibalize even more\u201d of the x86 server market in the long run, despite AMD\u2019s current chip, Turin, performing well.\n\nReitzes says it makes sense for Nvidia to \u201caccelerate its disruption\u201d of the PC and even x86 server markets. PCs, in particular, will increasingly rely on GPUs to securely run AI applications at the edge. Which begs an obvious question: why not handle both the CPU and GPU? With the rise of DeepSeek and more affordable models that can run on PCs, the demand for AI-optimized PCs is likely to grow. This creates a need for more integrated Nvidia-based solutions capable of running AI apps more efficiently. Servers are already being overtaken by Nvidia and custom accelerators, driving fleet consolidation.\n\n\u201cIf you are Nvidia,\u201d says Reitzes, \u201cwhy not accelerate these pushes and make it so the AMD and Intel CPU profit pools get hit so they can\u2019t win in data center GPUs?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not only Nvidia that is getting in the way of AMD\u2019s success. Although 2025 is expected to be a strong growth year for server CPUs, Reitzes is convinced that major cloud providers will adopt custom CPUs more and more over the long term, similar to AWS\u2019s Graviton. AMD is also facing rising competition in the server CPU segment from new players, with even Qualcomm setting its sights on the market.\n\n\u201cWhile AMD is likely seeing upside to traditional server CPU sales with its next-generation chip Turin\u2019 right now, the investment community is likely to grow increasingly concerned that this market will be threatened beyond 2025,\u201d Reitzes said on the matter.\n\nTurning now to the rest of the Street, 10 other analysts join Reitzes in taking a neutral stance on AMD. However, with 22 Buy ratings and just 1 Sell, the stock retains a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average price target remains optimistic at $170.28, suggesting a potential one-year upside of 49%.

Now, it appears that the company\u2019s pricing strategies prior to its presumed delay have leaked, suggesting RDNA 4 GPUs were much more expensive than previously thought.\n\nAccording to Bulgarian retailer Gplay, pricing for Radeon RX 9070 XT was closer to RX 7900 XT ($899) than 7800 XT ($499). However, Videocardz has since confirmed that the flagship card was purportedly priced at $899 with RX 9070 rocking a $749 MSRP.\n\nSuch MSRPs would put Radeon RX 9070 Series cards in direct competition with GeForce RTX 5080 and 5070 Ti. If true, this adds strength to prior rumours claiming that price pressures from Nvidia were partly to blame for AMD\u2019s delayed launch.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that graphics card pricing is subject to change almost right up until launch, with AMD adjusting Radeon RX 7600\u2018s MSRP by $30 days before release. It\u2019s unclear whether RX 9070 Series March release will usher in lower costs for consumers, alongside better FSR 4 support, but I\u2019d wager it\u2019s likely.\n\nWhether AMD like it or not, the company is decidedly on the backfoot against Nvidia as Radeon RX 7000 Series adoption remains woefully low relative to GeForce RTX 40 Series. If the brand has any hope of capturing market share from its rival, it must nail Radeon RX 9070 Series pricing relative to performance while undercutting GeForce equivalents as best it can. In a nutshell, Team Red must go lower.\n\nImage: AMD.\n\nWithout benchmarks to draw from, it\u2019s difficult to discern where Radeon RX 9070 XT should sit relative to GeForce RTX 5070 and 5070 Ti in terms of pricing. However if AMD\u2019s performance estimates put the card close to GeForce RTX 4070 Ti at best, then $899 is way off the mark.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping a Radeon RX 9000 Series reveal event provides some welcome clarity on AMD\u2019s pricing strategy.

The surge comes as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 1.7% and 3.3%, respectively.\n\nAMD's stock suffered from the same news dragging down much of Silicon Valley today: the release of a new artificial intelligence (AI) model out of China that rivals the best U.S. models.\n\nA new Chinese entrant makes a big splash\n\nDeepSeek, from a company in China, is relatively new. In a short amount of time, with inferior hardware and for a fraction of the price, DeepSeek was able to create an AI model on par with offerings from both OpenAI and Amazon.\n\nThat revelation sent many AI stocks down on Monday, especially hardware companies like AMD. The belief is that the red-hot demand for computing power that has driven AI chip sales for years will now cool, given what DeepSeek managed to do with relatively little.\n\nThere is a silver lining\n\nThere is merit to this thesis, but I would exercise caution here. The market reacted very strongly -- I believe too strongly. While this does bring some uncertainty into the mix, I do not believe it is the death knell some are making it out to be.\n\nIn fact, the efficiency of DeepSeek could, among other things, rapidly advance the adoption of edge AI applications -- that is, AI run locally rather than in the cloud. This would be great news for AMD since the company's chips that enable this are better competitors for Nvidia's premier data-center powering chips.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nInvestors have become increasingly concerned about the rising capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, with many wondering whether the expectations embedded in financial markets today project a realistic path ahead. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega-cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025.\n\nThe Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now makes up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and has driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on a 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nAnalysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. Hardware firms were defined as the companies that drive the design and manufacture of the semiconductors that are key to generating computing power. Hyperscalers were picked out as the companies that provide physical AI infrastructure such as cloud services and data centers, create custom silicon chips, and build large language models that can be used by other companies. AI developers were recognized as software companies that leverage hyperscaler technologies to provide solutions for end users.\n\nStory Continues",

These numbers show raw performance free of upscaling from the frame-generation tech found in AMD and Nvidia\u2019s respective laptop GPUs.\n\nAs you can see, the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 outperformed the Nvidia RTX 4070 laptop GPU on every game tested. On average, we see 50% better performance across the board. We don\u2019t know the power configurations for the systems AMD tested, but the company\u2019s internal benchmarks are impressive.\n\nOutlook\n\nAMD\u2019s numbers look promising for its flagship AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 APU. Of course, we\u2019ll need to test these laptop GPUs ourselves to see if AMD\u2019s numbers are close to what we see above. If accurate, laptops with Nvidia GPUs might not be the default choice for gamers.\n\nGiven AMD\u2019s internal gaming benchmarks for the AI Max+ 395 and the promise of 87% lower power consumption according to what the company announced during CES 2025, we could be in for a serious treat this year. We can\u2019t wait to try out Halo Strix laptops to see what they can do. Stay tuned for more!\n\nMore from Tom's Guide",

Across a suite of 17 games at 1080p high settings, Strix Halo handily bests its Nvidia equivalent, with an up to 68% lead in Borderlands 3, per AMD. Being first-party benchmarks, we shouldn't take them at face value. It is also prudent to mention that the RTX 4070 mobile can be configured up to 115W, but a 65W variant features in this comparison, due to the Asus ROG Flow Z13 design.\n\nIn productivity tests, Blender sees the 395+ blaze past the Core Ultra 9 288V (Lunar Lake) by 302% but that isn't an apples-to-apples comparison since the latter is a 17/30W chip. Versus Apple's M4 Pro, AMD touts an 86% lead in V-Ray, dropping to 12% in Cinebench R24. Moving over to AI performance, the XDNA 2 NPU enables the Ryzen AI MAX series to dish out 50 TOPS of AI performance, exceeding the Lunar Lake and Snapdragon X Elite series by two TOPS. AMD also claims its Strix Halo APUs can deliver 2.2x more tokens per second than the RTX 4090 when running the Llama 70B LLM (Large Language Model) at 1/6th the TDP (75W).\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD)\n\nWe highly suggest you wait for independent testing before jumping the gun, like perhaps pre-ordering a Strix Halo device. These laptops are likely to target enthusiasts as suitable alternatives to dedicated GPU options. With Strix Point laptops still costing over $1,000, pricing will play a key role in determining if Strix Halo can displace dedicated mid-ranged laptop GPUs like the RTX 4070 can be found in.",

These will include the recently announced Radeon RX 9000 series products, which include the RX 9070 and RX 9060 series.\n\nBoth of these segments are positioned against the RTX 4070/5070 and RTX 4060/5060 series and aim to offer better value. AMD has recently pushed the launch of its RX 9000 GPUs slightly back and the company will take this time to better optimize the software stack, though there are also reports that the pushback might be to adjust the prices even more competitively against the competition.\n\nVS: And do you see prospects for RDNA 4 laptops going ahead? Unfortunately, the number of AMD dGPU-based laptop SKUs have been pretty anemic. Ben: Our current graphics strategy is focused on the desktop market with RDNA 4. So, I think you'll see those types of products first in the future. Certainly, RDNA 4 and future graphics technologies will make it into mobile, whether they be on APUs or future products. Ben Conrad - AMD Director of Product Managment for Premium Mobile Client (via NotebookCheck)\n\nHowever, there's still the possibility of a mobile launch, whether that be on the discrete GPU side for laptops or an integrated APU part. AMD's RDNA 3.5 GPU architecture is limited to integrated releases on the Ryzen AI 300 and Ryzen AI Max chips, but we can expect future APUs to utilize the newer architecture in the coming year.\n\nVS: Probably this is futuristic, but we've heard stuff like RDNA and CDNA would be combining together. Ben: Yes, so that is a long-term project to unify the two, and I'm actually personally very excited about that because the ML focus is actually where the client market is going to go in the long term. So having that, um everybody going in the same direction, you know, I think would be a real positive. Ben Conrad - AMD Director of Product Managment for Premium Mobile Client (via NotebookCheck)\n\nFinally, Ben also touched upon the upcoming UDNA architecture which would unify the RDNA and CDNA architectures under one roof. The UDNA architecture is expected to mark the return of the high-end series for the Radeon division and will focus intensely on the ML/AI side of things, which is something that NVIDIA has also opted for in their Blackwell lineup.",

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nLaptop Mag uses many of these same benchmarks in its testing to find the Best gaming laptops. However, we opt for \"Ultra\" graphics settings \u2014 not \"High\" \u2014 and disable frame-generation technology like AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution, or FSR for short.\n\nHowever, with scores of 77-197 fps (frames per second), the Ryzen AI Max 395 is on the high end of the spectrum for mobile GPU performance.\n\nAMD does not state in the PDF whether FSR or Nvidia's DLSS was enabled while testing the Ryzen AI Max 395 and RTX 4070.\n\nWhile AMD's benchmarks look reliable, we'll wait for our independent testing to confirm the performance.\n\nHowever, assuming these benchmarks are accurate, the Ryzen AI Max could be a solid contender for the mid-range gaming space, as it would easily outperform the RTX 4050 and 4060 mobile GPUs.\n\nIs the RTX 4070 a good comparison point for Strix Halo?\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\nAMD's benchmarks are a fair comparison for the RTX 4070 mobile GPU and Ryzen AI Max 395, as both are restricted to a similar device. Though the two Flow Z13 gaming tablets have some differences in build, they are the best comparison we can make with existing consumer devices.\n\nYes, the 2023 Flow Z13 has an Intel Core i9-13900H processor, nearly two generations behind. And yes, gamers backing Team Blue prefer the Intel HX series CPUs over the H.\n\nAsus likely decided to build the Flow Z13 with the 13900H rather than the HX variant due to the Z13 tablet's thermal constraints.\n\nSo, given all that, the comparison to the RTX 4070 feels about as fair as we can expect without running the chips on an independent test bench.\n\nIn my hands-on testing with the Flow Z13 at CES, the tablet performed smoothly and at decently high graphics settings while playing Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart.\n\nEven if Ratchet and Clank isn't the most demanding game, the Ryzen AI Max 395 performed well after hours of running the same demo.\n\nSo, while I can't say I can confirm the RTX 4070 comparisons, I can't argue with them either.\n\nCould this indicate a shift in the budget laptop market?\n\nNvidia will launch the RTX 50 series on laptops in just a few months. However, the desktop RTX 50-series GPUs are already subject to price-hike rumors. Additionally, all of the known launch systems for the RTX 50-series mobile launch are on the premium side of the market.\n\nAfter all, Nvidia hasn't announced any new lower-end GPUs for desktops or laptops. While those GPUs could launch later this year, the budget gaming space will still utilize the RTX 4050 and RTX 4060 for a while longer.\n\nSo if AMD's Radeon 8060S iGPU on the new Ryzen AI Max chips can provide Nvidia RTX 4070-level performance, it could be a cheaper mid-range gaming GPU option that offers better performance than the RTX 4050 and RTX 4060 mobile GPUs.\n\nThe Asus ROG Flow Z13 tablet is the only AMD Ryzen AI Max launch system dedicated to gaming. However, the Flow Z13 gaming tablet is a little pricey to be called mid-range at $2,000. But there could be plenty of reasons for that price tag.\n\nWe'll have to wait for more Ryzen AI Max systems to hit the shelves to tell.\n\nBut so far, 2025 is shaping up an enjoyable time for gaming.",

The chips are a brand-new design that will cater to enthusiasts and workstation-grade laptops and offer specs that haven't been seen on mobility platforms.\n\nTo recap, the AMD Strix Halo lineup is based on the latest Zen 5 core architecture for the CPU and the RDNA 3.5 graphics architecture. These chips are based on three dies, two of which are CCDs & one of them is the IOD which houses the graphics unit. The chips are interconnected using a next-generation Infinity Fabric and there's also a new memory interface that offers up to 256 GB/s of total bandwidth. Each Ryzen AI Max APU will also come with a 50 TOPS \"XDNA 2\" NPU, taking the AI side of things to the max.\n\nThe star of the show is the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395, which is the top chip on the stack. This chip is equipped with 16 cores and 32 threads. The APU is clocked at a base speed of 3.0 GHz & a 5.1 GHz boost clock. There's also 16 MB of L2 and 64 MB of L3 cache with a TDP of 55W which can be set at 45-120W. For the iGPU, you are getting the Radeon 8060S, which is a 40 CU graphics configuration based on the RDNA 3.5 architecture and clocks up to 2900 MHz.\n\nAMD Ryzen AI MAX 300 \"Strix Halo\" APU Lineup:\n\nSKU Name Architectures CPU Cores Max Clock Cache GPU Cores TDP Ryzen AI Max+ 395 Zen 5 / RDNA 3.5 16 / 32 5.1 GHz 80 MB 40 CUs (Radeon 8060S) 45-120W Ryzen AI Max 390 Zen 5 / RDNA 3.5 12 / 24 5.0 GHz 76 MB 40 CUs (Radeon 8060S) 45-120W Ryzen AI Max 385 Zen 5 / RDNA 3.5 8 / 16 5.0 GHz 40 MB 32 CUs (Radeon 8050S) 45-120W Ryzen AI Max 380 Zen 5 / RDNA 3.5 6 / 12 4.9 GHz 22 MB 16 CUs (Radeon 8040S) 45-120W\n\nAMD did share a few benchmarks on the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 during its CES showcase, but now they have some more numbers available that compare the chip to the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 laptop GPU. The numbers for the RTX 4070 were obtained on the ASUS ROG Flow Z13 laptop, and several games were used at 1080p High Settings. The numbers are native performance, so you aren't looking at upscaling or frame generation involved in these.\n\nImage Source: AMD\n\nIn all games tested (17 in total), the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 was able to outperform the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 laptop GPU. Now, it is not known what power configurations were used to test both systems, but here we can see the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 and its Radeon 8060 iGPU offering over 50% better performance and going as high as 68% in Borderlands 3.\n\nAMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 vs NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop (1080p High Gaming):\n\nGame AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Difference Counter Strike 2 197 196 +1% Hitman 3 185 123 +50.4% Middle Earth Shadow of War 137 106 +29.2% Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 123 98 +25.5% Shadow of Tomb Raider 118 117 +1% F1 24 117 102 +14.7% Borderlands 3 111 66 +68.1% Ashes of The Singularity 111 81 +37.0% Watch Dogs Legion 101 88 +14.7% Total Warhammer III 99 85 +16.4% Assassins Creed Mirage 98 86 +13.9% Far Cry 6 97 89 +8.9% Marvel's Spiderman 97 91 +6.5% Assassins Creed Valhalla 96 84 +14.2% Baldur's Gate 3 87 57 +52.6% Final Fantasy 14 86 81 +6.1% Cyberpunk 2077 77 56 +37.5%\n\nOn average, this is a 23.2% improvement versus the RTX 4070, which is quite decent as it shows that AMD's integrated chips can now compete with high-end/mainstream laptop GPUs.\n\nThis is also an older graphics architecture (RDNA 3.5), so we can expect even better performance with an RDNA 4-based APU of a similar scale, though those are likely not going to arrive soon, and we have yet to see how the market actually responds to the Strix Halo lineup. With that said, AMD Ryzen AI Max+ \"Strix Halo\" APUs are looking to be a solid solution for high-end laptop users & we can't wait to see them in action on laptops and Mini PCs.\n\nNews Source: @uzzi38",

The new UDNA architecture aims to unify data center and gaming GPUs, potentially using TSMC's N3E process for improved efficiency. However, it may not surpass NVIDIA's RTX 5090 in performance.\n\n\"They aren't making a big enough GPU,\" a new comment by an industry insider and known GeForce and Radeon leaker @Kepler_L2 over on X. Referencing AMD's next-next-gen UDNA architecture, which will unify the company's data center and gaming GPU hardware, AMD is reportedly to release a new flagship high-end enthusiast Radeon GPU in 2026 - a successor to RDNA 3's Radeon RX 7900 XTX.\n\n2\n\nThe GeForce RTX 5090 towers over AMD's current flagship Radeon GPU.\n\nVIEW GALLERY - 2 IMAGES\n\nPopular Popular Now: Skyblivion, the fan remake of Oblivion in Skyrim's engine, nears completion\n\nWith RDNA 4 set to debut in March 2025, AMD will focus on the mid-range market this generation. The Radeon RX 9070 and Radeon RX 9070 XT will compete with NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti, respectively. This means it won't have an answer to the GeForce RTX 5080 or RTX 5090 until UDNA arrives sometime in 2026.\n\nAlthough we're still in the very rumor stage of AMD's new unified GPU architecture, @Kepler_L2's confident \"AMD won't beat 5090 next-gen\" comment and mention of the GPU die size indicates that they're familiar with Team Red's plans for its first flagship UDNA GPU for gaming and, presumably, AI workloads.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 5090's eye-watering $1999 price tag, which is much higher for partner models like the impressive MSI GeForce RTX 5090 SUPRIM SOC model we recently reviewed, and performance make it the undisputed king of PC gaming performance. To put that into perspective, based on our testing, it's a whopping 89% faster than the Radeon RX 7900 XTX for 4K gaming - a card that is set to be the most powerful Radeon gaming GPU for at least another year.\n\nHowever, rumors point to UDNA potentially using TSMC's cutting-edge N3E process, and AMD could be looking to match or surpass GeForce RTX 4090's performance with better overall efficiency. According to NVIDIA's benchmark data, the raw performance of the upcoming GeForce 5080 will only be 15% faster than that of the GeForce RTX 4080. This leaves ample room for AMD to introduce a new flagship gaming GPU significantly more performant than the Radeon RX 7900 XTX while still falling short of the RTX 5090's performance.\n\nEither way, it's still early days for UDNA (at least officially), and it'll be several months before we start getting a better picture of how AMD's new flagship gaming GPU is panning out.",

Now a tip from reputable industry insider @Kepler_L2 on Twitter, indicates that the RDNA 4 driver for the AMD RX 9000 Series will simply be replacing the FSR 3.1 .dll application extensions with those for FSR 4, making for a seamless upgrade on the user's end, without requiring help from the developer.\n\nSince AMD FSR 4 was also showcased at CES 2025 in Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart without a patch being needed, this tracks with what we've previously seen of FSR 4.\n\nThe RDNA4 driver replaces FSR 3.1 DLL with FSR4January 25, 2025\n\nThis also means that \"supported games with FSR 3.1 already integrated\" indeed applies to all AMD FSR 3.1-enabled games. For games that aren't yet upgraded to support AMD FSR 3.1, it does unfortunately seem like developers will need to devote some resources to start supporting FSR 4 and its AI hardware-enhanced upscaling features, but once they do it seems like FSR support moving forward will be near-seamless to AMD's ability to improve it and AMD GPU architectures.\n\nFortunately for future buyers of the AMD RX 9070/XT and other RX 9000 Series RDNA 4-based GPUs, this process does seem to have already started, at least for some select PlayStation-to-PC ported titles. The Tweet that originally prompted @Kepler_L2's confirmation of how AMD FSR 4 is implemented over FSR 3.1 was coverage of The Last of Us Part 1 being updated to support FSR 3.1, with speculation that it was done for this purpose. The likes of Ghost of Tsushima or God of War Ragnarok have also already gotten the AMD FSR 3.1 upgrade, too \u2014 and thus, automatic FSR 4+ injection with future AMD GPUs.\n\nIf Kepler_L2's assertion is true, this shows just how smart AMD was to make AMD FSR 3.1 a forward-thinking solution that would allow for future iterations to be seamlessly slotted in without requiring developer resources to be dedicated to manually updating the game every time a new AMD GPU architecture drops. In general, it's always a shame to see older games still stuck on older versions of AMD's FSR or Nvidia's DLSS when you know your GPU could easily support a yet better-looking image upscaling implementation... but AMD seems to have solved the problem without issue this generation.",

            "content": "XRP (XRP -0.49%), the third-most-valuable cryptocurrency in the world, has taken the sector by storm since Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. The price of XRP is up more than 530% since election night. Trump has embraced crypto, surrounding himself with several officials who support cryptocurrency. He has also promised a lighter regulatory touch and to make the U.S. \"the crypto capital of the world.\"\n\nXRP's market cap has gotten so large that it is now bigger than many large tech stocks that have been around for years and decades. Will XRP, the cryptocurrency created by Ripple, eventually surpass the large artificial intelligence player Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.92%)? Let's take a look.\n\nBoth have upside\n\nAs of Jan. 24, XRP's market cap was about $181 billion, while AMD's market cap was $199 billion. AMD designs different semiconductor products that make artificial intelligence (AI) possible, including central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Some of the largest technology companies in the world use AMD's products to power their products, whether it's gaming, their cloud business, or AI and machine learning models.\n\nWhile most AI companies enjoyed a stellar year in 2024, AMD struggled, with its stock falling about 18%. One issue AMD has run into is AI chip leader Nvidia. As most investors know, Nvidia dominates the market. It has incredible market share and margins, and, therefore, incredible pricing power.\n\nAMD is in an interesting position, because many analysts have actually expressed concerns about the company's prospects and earnings trajectory this year. However, they still think the risk-reward setup is favorable, considering that AMD operates in a sector with a large and growing total addressable market. During the past three months, 32 analysts have issued research reports on the company, with 21 rating the stock a buy, 10 saying to hold, and one saying to sell. The average price target implies almost 40% upside from current levels.\n\nMeanwhile, after years of underperforming, XRP has broken out. The cryptocurrency is still facing an appeal from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in an ongoing lawsuit regarding whether Ripple and its founders sold XRP as an unregistered security in 2013. Most observers suspect the appeal will not succeed and the lawsuit will eventually be put to bed once and for all. This would let XRP bypass a major regulatory headwind that has stymied the company since 2020, and potentially pave the way for a spot crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nXRP may also benefit as Ripple's stablecoin RLUSD picks up steam, because XRP tokens are needed for RLUSD transaction fees. Ripple is also being used by several financial institutions to conduct cross-border payments. XRP's network can process up to 1,500 transactions per second, which is a lot, but it also faces stiff competition from Solana.\n\nWill the AI or crypto wave last longer?\n\nWhether XRP eventually has a larger market cap than AMD will depend on how long the crypto rally lasts. During crypto rallies, XRP tends to outperform Bitcoin, which is considered a bellwether for the sector, but it also tends to underperform in crypto bear markets.\n\nIt's hard to see the crypto rally running out of steam in the near term, given Trump's pro-crypto stance, but the sector is incredibly volatile. If inflation turns out to be stickier than expected, that may slow some of the momentum. The AI wave may also continue, although AMD has not benefited nearly as much as peers and it outright struggled in 2024.\n\nUltimately, I suspect XRP will surpass AMD in market value if the crypto rally continues. AMD has work to do to prove to investors that it can truly take advantage of the large market opportunity it has.",

There is no area where the processor doesn't either match or surpass competing chips on the market, and coming in at a slightly lower price point than its predecessor, it is the enthusiast processor to own right now.\n\nIf there is a single fault with the processor, it's that the new Ryzen 7000 series requires a new AM5 motherboard and doesn't support DDR4 RAM, so you'll need to buy a new expensive RAM kit as well, but given the generational leap here, there's no question that the price is worth it for those who have the means to invest heavily in their system.\n\nRead More: AMD Ryzen 9 7950X review\n\nThe best budget AMD processor\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 5 7600X is hands down one of the finest processors we've ever laid our hands on, thanks to its compelling price and performance, something that isn't always easy to find in the components marketplace.\n\nWith solid multi-core and phenomenal single-core performance, this chip will be able to cut through almost any productivity task you throw at it, while its gaming chops are fantastic for a chip at this price point. It's creative workload performance is decent enough, but you should really look to a processor with more cores if you're expecting to do much 3D rendering work.\n\nTo top it all off, this chip doesn't draw a whole lot of power or generate a lot of heat, making it a great choice for smaller PC builds.\n\nRead more: AMD Ryzen 5 7600X review\n\nThe best midrange AMD processor\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nThe Ryzen 7000 series has definitely impressed us with its massive generational leap over its predecessor \u2013 as well as its rival, Intel. Nowehere is that more clear than with the Ryzen 7 7700X, a midrange-ish chip meant for more serious content creation and gaming performance that easily outperforms the best chips of the previous generation while not costing a fortune.\n\nWhile it's content creation chops are decent enough, it still lags the Intel Core i5-12600K in many content creation tasks, so if content creation is your priority, there are better chips out there.

This latest release from AMD is not just a stronger processor across the board, but it's also an incredibly powerful processor for gaming and creative work full stop. If you have an AM4 motherboard, this is the processor for you.\n\nIn 2024, the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X is considerably cheaper than it was when it first hit the scene. While originally costing a mammoth $549 (about \u00a3420, AU$760), you can now find the high-end AM4 hardware for around the $280 (about \u00a3229 / AU$330) mark through retailers such as Amazon. That puts the once-leading chip in a whole new light, whether you're upgrading from an older AM4 CPU or building for the first time. You won't get 12 cores and 24 threads cheaper anywhere else.\n\nRead the full AMD Ryzen 9 5900X review\n\nThe best AMD processor for gaming\n\n(Image credit: Future/John Loeffler)\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D stands out as the premier choice for gaming enthusiasts, delivering exceptional performance across virtually all games, courtesy of its innovative 3D V-Cache technology.\n\nHowever, its capabilities outside of gaming are somewhat less impressive. For those seeking a versatile processor capable of handling a broader range of tasks, the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X emerges as a compelling alternative within this category, unless one prefers the Intel Core i7-14700K mentioned previously.\n\nThough priced on the higher side, it offers a somewhat more affordable option compared to the Ryzen 9 7950X3D. Potential buyers without an AM5 motherboard should note the necessity for significant additional component upgrades to accommodate the latest AMD Ryzen processors.\n\nRead the full AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D review\n\nThe best AM4 AMD processor for gaming\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D is without question one of the best processors for gaming with an AM4 motherboard on the market. With incredible performance thanks to AMD's new 3D V-Cache technology, the 5800X3D punches way above its weight class and even bests the Core i9-12900K when it comes to gaming.\n\nSince this is essentially an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X with additional cache memory stacked on the CPU die, it keeps the same motherboard socket as earlier chips, making it a much more affordable option for those who want great gaming performance but don't want to spend a lot of money.\n\nThis of course assumes that you have an AMD AM4 system in the first place. If not, you'll need to buy a whole new motherboard, and maybe a new cooling solution, in which case you might as well go all in and get the i9-12900K, which offers comparable gaming performance, but comes with a whole lot more extra goodies.\n\nRead the full AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D review\n\nThe best AMD processor: FAQs\n\nWhich AMD processor is best? In our testing, we were particularly impressed with the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X . This is a top-tier AMD processor that provides incredible performance across the board and represents an energy-efficient choice, too.\n\n\n\nIt supports the latest DDR5 and PCle 5.0 technology and is a best-in-class showcase amongst AMD\u2019s roster. Provided you\u2019re prepared to invest in a new AM5 motherboard, as well as a RAM kit that supports DDR4, this one is a clear winner.\n\nHow to choose the best AMD processor for you\n\nWhen it comes to finding the best AMD processor for your needs and budget, the most important thing is knowing what you need your processor to do. There is such a thing as buying too much processor when you're looking to upgrade, and getting the absolute fastest chip on the market isn't always the best way to go about it.\n\nIf you only need to do general-use computing like shopping online, streaming movies, and some light productivity work, then a Ryzen 3 or Ryzen 5 processor is more than enough for your needs, and getting a Ryzen 7 or a Ryzen 9 will barely add anything to your user experience while also costing significantly more.\n\nIf you are looking to do a lot of PC gaming and content creation, then you'll definitely want to go with a Ryzen 7 or Ryzen 9, since a Ryzen 5 will barely cut it, and you can forget about anything more involved than Candy Crush on a Ryzen 3.\n\nHow we test AMD processors\n\nIt's impossible to tell the best processors from the worst just by looking at them. All of the core components are hidden away in identical-looking packaging, and even if you were to peel back that packaging, the transistors on the CPU die (the neurons of the CPUs \"brain\") are literally measured in nanometers. How can you tell a million transistors on a chip from a billion, and how can you measure a processor's clock cycle by looking at the box?\n\nFortunately, there are tests we can run to see how well a processor performs in the real world, and the best way to do that is to push a processor to its limits by running finely-calibrated benchmarking tools that produce comparable scores based on how well a processor performs a specific task like compressing a video file or performing the very complex math used in 3D gaming.\n\nWe use industry-standard tools like Geekbench 5, Cinebench R23, and PCMark 10 to synthetically push processors to the limit using realistic workloads that you're likely to experience in day-to-day use.\n\nWe also use modern PC games set to the lowest graphical settings on the best available gaming hardware to isolate CPU performance while gaming, which we measure in frames per second.\n\nThen, with the scores in hand, we look at the price of the processor. The best processors offer either best-in-class performance regardless of price, or compelling value for the customer, since it's just as important to get the best processor you can afford and not just a top-scoring processor that is out of most people's budgets.",

But there's some items worth mentioning, particularly for the GFX12 graphics engine with the upcoming RDNA4 / Radeon RX 9070 series graphics.\n\nIn addition to the GFX12 improvements/fixes merged for the main Linux 6.14 merge, Friday's pull request brings further GFX12 fixes. Additionally, it now enables cleaner shader support for GFX12. The cleaner shader is for help ensuring app/user isolation and in recent kernels has been extended to more GPU families Linux 6.14 is enabling cleaner shader for GFX12.0 and GFX12.0.1 GPUs to clear GPU resources like the local data share (LDS), vector general purpose registers (VGPRs), and scalar general purpose registers (SGPRs) between workloads. By clearing these resources between workloads, it helps prevent possible data leakage and ensures better security/reliability with the upcoming RDNA4 graphics cards. GFX9 through GFX11 IP has already seen cleaner shader enablement. I haven't seen any public communication from AMD driver developers about their motivation for adding this cleaner shader functionality at this stage as opposed to something that could have been done years ago, if it's due to new customer demands / security concerns or other factors. In any event this cleaner shader support is particularly useful for today's multi-tenant GPU-accelerated systems and even when just running untrusted code on your system with GPU access.One of the GFX12 fixes also part of this update is disabling GFXOFF support (turning off the graphics engine) support during compute workloads, in order to workaround an OpenCL test failure issue.The other fixes part of this latest pull request appear to be mostly general fixes. These AMDGPU/AMDKFD changes have already been queued up into Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) tree for likely sending to Linus Torvalds as part of \"DRM fixes\" in the coming days for Linux 6.14.",

            "content": "While several chip stocks had convincing performances in 2024, Intel (INTC -4.68%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.92%) were not among them. Intel shares fell about 60% last year, while AMD shares were down about 18%.\n\nLet's examine which semiconductor stock looks like the better rebound candidate in 2025.\n\nAI afterthoughts\n\nIn a semiconductor market largely being driven by artificial intelligence (AI), Intel and AMD have largely been afterthoughts. AMD is the distant No. 2 designer of graphic processing units (GPUs) behind market leader Nvidia. Intel's market share in GPUs, meanwhile, has dropped to zero, although it wasn't a far fall, with the company having just a 2% market share in PC graphics cards in 2023.\n\nAMD has struggled against Nvidia, largely due to its inferior software. In a recent study, SemiAnalysis called AMD's out-of-the-box GPUs \"unusable\" for AI training, noting it needed \"multiple teams of AMD engineers\" to help it fix software bugs. However, AMD has been able to carve out a niche in AI inference, with SemiAnalysis saying its customers typically use AMD's GPUs for narrow, well-defined inference use cases.\n\nNonetheless, AMD has been able to see strong data center growth, albeit not nearly at the same scale as Nvidia. Last quarter, it saw its data center revenue surge 122% year over year and 25% sequentially to $3.5 billion. The company credited both its Instinct GPUs and EPYC central processing units (CPUs) for the jump in sales.\n\nCPUs act as the brain of a computer, while GPUs have superior processing power. While there is a lot of deserved attention on GPUs, AMD has been doing a good jump in the CPU market, noting that it has been taking share in the CPU server market while it also has been doing well in the PC market.\n\nOverall, AMD saw its Q3 revenue climb 18% to $6.8 billion and its adjusted EPS jump 31% to $0.92. So the company has still been growing nicely despite the dip in its stock price.\n\nIntel, on the other hand, saw its revenue decline last quarter by 6% to $13.3 billion, and its adjusted EPS flip to a loss of -$0.46 versus a profit of $0.41 a year ago. The one bright spot last quarter was its data center and AI segment, which saw revenue rise 9% to $3.3 billion. However, when compared to Nvidia and AMD, that is a very modest gain in this segment.\n\nMeanwhile, its largest segment, Client Computing, saw its revenue drop 7% to $7.3 billion. By comparison, AMD saw its Client segment revenue surge 29% last quarter to $1.9 billion, showing it's making some inroads on Intel's primary PC business.\n\nPerhaps Intel's biggest woes, though, stem from its Foundry segment, which has been a big drag on its results. The company has poured money into this business through capital expenditures (capex), building out new manufacturing facilities. However, the segment has been a consistently large money loser, including reporting a $5.8 billion operating loss last quarter, or $2.7 billion when excluding a noncash impairment charge.\n\nFollowing the exit of its CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel has said it could look to spin off its foundry business. The business recently received $7.86 billion in direct funding and a 25% investment tax credit from the government to continue to build out its manufacturing footprint in the U.S.\n\nValuations and verdict\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Intel is the cheaper stock, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 12.6 times versus 17.6 times for AMD.\n\nHowever, if you separately value Intel's core business and its foundry business, its valuation is even more attractive.\n\nIntel's foundry business has been losing lots of money, but it also has a lot of physical assets. Intel has spent $68.5 billion in capex, mostly on the foundry business, since the end of 2021 and has $104 billion in physical assets on its balance sheet. If you take just its recent capex spending and subtract out its $26 billion in net debt, its foundry business would be worth about $10 per share on 4.3 billion in shares. It also owns an 88% stake in Mobileye, which is worth about $11.4 billion, or $2.66 per Intel share.\n\nAs such, it is no surprise that the company has been the subject of takeover rumors. There are a lot of hidden physical assets not reflected in its share price, not to mention the government's direct funding and tax incentive.\n\nAMD, meanwhile, has certainly been the stronger of the two businesses, although it hasn't gotten the investor respect it may deserve. If more AI infrastructure turns toward AI inference, it could be in a good place. Meanwhile, investors shouldn't overlook its CPU business, which has been gaining share both in data centers and PCs.\n\nI like both stock as turnaround candidates this year. I like Intel slightly more because of the deep value I think is still in the stock. However, AMD also looks like a solid rebound candidate. Fortunately, investors don't have to choose and can add both stocks to their portfolios if they choose.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other most promising AI stocks according to Wall Street analysts.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) continues to accelerate rapidly, moving from emerging technologies to influencing how businesses carry out operations. As per SAP, the changes occurring in 2025 revolve around autonomous AI agents, specialized AI models, user interface design, and enterprise adoption patterns. On 13th January, an AI behemoth highlighted that the first Trump Administration focused on America\u2019s strength and success in AI, boosting an environment where the broader US industry can compete.\n\nTherefore, mainstream AI is now a critical part of every new application, which helps fuel economic growth, promote US interests, and make sure that America can sustain its leadership in cutting-edge technology. On a related note, Trump announced billions of dollars in private sector investment focused on building AI infrastructure in the country.\n\nTrump Announces $500 Billion Investment for AI Infrastructure\n\nUS President Donald Trump announced a private sector investment of up to $500 billion focused on financing infrastructure for AI, targeting to outperform rival nations in the business-critical technology. Mr. President went on to add that ChatGPT\u2019s creator OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle are discussing a JV called Stargate, which is expected to build data centers and create over 100,000 jobs in the US. Notably, these companies, together with several other equity backers of Stargate, decided to commit $100 billion for immediate deployment. The remaining investment is expected to take place over the upcoming 4 years.\n\nAs per Trump, this is the largest AI infrastructure project in history. Also, Stargate is expected to build the physical and virtual infrastructure which will focus on powering the next generation of AI, including data centers around the US.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nAI Rally to Continue in 2025, Says UBS\n\nAs per UBS, the AI rally has aided in driving 2 straight years of healthy returns for the NASDAQ Composite, which also includes a 28% rally last year. The Mag 7 group of technology stocks drove more than half of the S&P 500\u2019s gains in 2024. In the previous year, continued upward revisions in AI capex from the Big 4 tech giants supported keeping the AI rally on track.

If you are following the RDNA 4 developments, you must be aware of PowerColor's RX 9000 GPUs, which were unveiled at the CES. However, the official website of the company only had the Red Devil edition for Radeon RX 9070 XT, which is supposedly the fastest of all it has in its catalog.\n\nPowerColor teased the Hellhound Radeon RX 9070 XT a few weeks back, and we also learned about the Reaper series even before CES. So, the new cards were imminent, but obviously, you can't buy them yet. Videocardz spotted the Hellhound Radeon RX 9070 XT and Reaper Radeon RX 9070 XT on PowerColor's official website, which revealed their design.\n\nUnfortunately, we have not officially seen the specifications from AMD or its board partners. Nonetheless, here is what the Hellhound RX 9070 XT looks like:\n\n2 of 9\n\nThe Hellhound RX 9070 XT edition looks plain and simple but has a three-fan configuration and a decently big heatsink. It appears to be a 2.5-slot card and exhibits the classic Hellhound logo on two fans, but the PowerColor logo on the middle fan is a new design compared to RX 7900 XTX. There are four output ports, including 3x DP and 1x HDMI.\n\n2 of 9\n\nThe Reaper Radeon RX 9070 XT edition is round at the edges and boasts a simple and plain shroud with a triple fan configuration. It is also a 2.5-slot card and has a similar I/O connectivity as the Hellhound edition. The only difference between the two cards will be different boost clocks, and the Hellhound will likely have a higher one.\n\nNo specifications have been listed on any of the PowerColor RX 9070 XT cards yet, and we are likely going to see them much later than we previously anticipated. AMD has announced that it is going to launch these cards officially in March, and therefore, one shouldn't expect an official specs reveal in a few days from now. As per AMD, they still need some time to work on the software stack to optimize the performance on RX 9000 GPUs, which is why they delayed the launch.",

            "content": "What just happened? AMD has confirmed a security vulnerability in some of its processors, which was inadvertently revealed through a beta BIOS update from Asus. The flaw, described as a \"microcode signature verification vulnerability,\" came to light before AMD could officially disclose it, sparking concerns in the cybersecurity community.\n\nThe vulnerability was first noticed by Tavis Ormandy, a security researcher at Google's Project Zero. Ormandy spotted a reference to the flaw in the release notes of an Asus beta BIOS update for one of its gaming motherboards. \"It looks like an OEM leaked the patch for a major upcoming CPU vulnerability,\" Ormandy wrote in a public mailing list post.\n\nAMD has since acknowledged the issue. The company has not yet specified which of its products are affected but has indicated that mitigations are being developed and deployed.\n\nThe vulnerability appears to be related to the microcode and seems to circumvent the process that ensures only official, AMD-signed microcode can be loaded into the processor. Exploiting this vulnerability requires not only local administrator access to the targeted system but also the capability to develop and execute malicious microcode, according to AMD. This high bar for exploitation suggests that while the vulnerability is serious, it's not something that could be easily weaponized by casual attackers.\n\nWhile the full extent of the vulnerability's impact is not yet known, security experts have begun speculating about its potential consequences. Demi Marie Obenour, a software developer for Invisible Things, suggested that if an attacker could load arbitrary microcode, they might be able to compromise critical security features such as System Management Mode (SMM), Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP), and Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM).\n\nThe recent discovery of a microcode signature verification vulnerability is not an isolated incident. Over the years, AMD has faced several security challenges across its product lines.\n\nIn March 2018, researchers from CTS Labs uncovered a series of vulnerabilities affecting AMD's Ryzen and Epyc processors. These flaws, collectively known as RYZENFALL, MASTERKEY, CHIMERA, and FALLOUT, posed security risks to both consumer and enterprise-grade processors. Exploiting the vulnerabilities required administrative access, according to AMD.\n\nIn August 2024, a more widespread vulnerability named \"Sinkclose\" was disclosed. This flaw in the System Management Mode potentially exposed hundreds of millions of devices to security risks. In this case, exploiting the vulnerability required kernel-level access, making it a threat primarily to \"seriously breached systems,\" AMD said at the time.",

            "content": "One of my main complaints concerning Nvidia's RTX 4000-series of graphics isn\u2019t, surprisingly enough, the massive wattage (though that is a legitimate concern) but the pricing. For the past couple of generations, Nvidia has been massively hiking up the cost of its cards, especially its best graphics cards like the RTX 4080. But it's mid-range offerings haven't been spared either. It\u2019s become particularly noticeable with the absence of budget-minded cards to offset this phenomenon.\n\nWhen rumors for the RTX 50-series began to accelerate, buyers rightfully worried that prices would face a far steeper climb while offering a performance return that didn\u2019t reflect the increase. However, the 50-series received its full announcement at CES 2025 and we now know that the MSRP is shockingly affordable .\n\nThe flagship Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, widely thought to be a Titan due to its incredible specs, is priced at $1,999 / \u00a31,999 / AU$4,039 \u2014 while steep, it\u2019s not too far off from the original $1,599 price tag of the RTX 4090. This is especially promising since the rumors all pointed to a price nearly double what it ended up being.\n\nThen there\u2019s the RTX 5080, which is $999 / \u00a3939 / AU$2,019, and the RTX 5070 and 5070 Ti with respective retail prices of $549 / \u00a3549 / AU$1,509, and $749 / \u00a3749 / AU$1,109. The 5080 is $200 cheaper than the RTX 4080 was at launch, and will hopefully have a solid increase in performance to boot.\n\nMost impressively, Nvidia claims that the RTX 5070 will offer comparable performance to the RTX 4090's native performance with some help from DLSS 4, but at around a third of the initial MSRP, while the RTX 5070 Ti will come in at just $150 more with even better performance.\n\nThis is also incredibly promising since it is a generational decrease in price, as the RTX 4070 Ti initially retailed for $799, and the RTX 4070 launched at $599.\n\nAMD has been fumbling hard lately\n\n(Image credit: AMD / TechPowerup)\n\nI\u2019ve long complained about how graphics cards need to be made more affordable, and how Intel has been stepping in the right direction with its Intel Arc Battlemage series . Now it feels like Nvidia is finally doing the same, capping overall price increases while lowering the cost of its mid-range offerings somewhat to remain accessible.\n\nThis, unfortunately, is in direct opposite of AMD\u2019s current approach. AMD has been known for years as being the more affordable option for cards, balancing solid performance with more competitive price tags. However, some troublesome new reports suggest that the upcoming RDNA 4 cards may miss the mark in terms of pricing.\n\nThe RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 don\u2019t currently have official prices (though apparently will be \u2018competitive\u2019 with Nvidia ), and it\u2019s been officially confirmed that it won\u2019t launch until at least March 2025 . This puts Team Red on the back foot as Team Green\u2019s RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 will be launching in February 2025 with a healthy MSRP. By the time AMD releases their GPUs, everyone might already have bought new Nvidia cards, or may just opt for the more premium Nvidia offerings if AMD's prices are too close to its competitors.\n\nEven worse, new reports indicate that the RX 7400 and 7300, which would have been new aggressively budget-friendly RDNA 3 options, have been axed in favor of fully supporting RDNA 4. If this turns out to be true, then Team Red is giving up a serious advantage in the market.\n\nRight now, we\u2019re looking at a potentially major upset in terms of better budget options for graphics cards. Nvidia has been at least responsive to complaints about price inflation, while AMD seems rather lost on the GPU front.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame too, as it would be more beneficial to consumers to have two giants on an even playing field in order to keep prices low.",

I\u2019m losing faith, and I\u2019m not alone AMD could still make the RX 9070 XT a success\n\nIt looks like I may have played myself again. I was genuinely excited about AMD\u2019s RX 9070 XT, but now, I\u2019m starting to worry about its future. I always knew that the new AMD flagship wouldn\u2019t be able to compete against some of Nvidia\u2019s best graphics cards, but I had a lot of hope that it\u2019d still be a great competitor for a number of other reasons.\n\nI\u2019m not doubting the performance of the RX 9070 XT. I have no reason to, as we don\u2019t know a thing about it \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m worried. Not only are the GPUs still a complete mystery, but they\u2019ve also reportedly been delayed. At this rate, I fear that AMD may have lost the war before it even started, and I\u2019m not alone.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhat\u2019s going on with RDNA 4?\n\nI felt pretty excited for the RX 9070 XT, but so far, the launch of RDNA 4 has been a harsh lesson in managing your expectations.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!\n\nFirst, the GPUs barely got a mention during AMD\u2019s 45-minute-long CES 2025 keynote. Then, the few slides that AMD released to the press offered very little information; we basically only learned a little bit about the RDNA 4 architecture and AMD\u2019s performance goals. The information was vague, too \u2014 think \u201cimproved ray tracing performance\u201d and the like.\n\nThe GPUs themselves were spotted at CES, but only those made by AMD\u2019s partners, and they didn\u2019t come with any specifications. So, at this stage, it\u2019s been revealed that the RX 9070 XT comes with three fans in its Gigabyte design. That\u2019s\u2026 not a lot.\n\nBut wait \u2014 there\u2019s hope, or so I thought. AMD told Digital Trends that RDNA 4 would be released \u201cin a matter of weeks,\u201d and that the company thought that the new RX 9000 series deserved its own event. But only silence has followed.\n\nThe first update came not from AMD itself, but from B&H. The retailer put the RX 9070 XT up for sale with a January 22 preorder date. The cards had been taken down, but then they reappeared with a release date of March 22. Finally, this tracks.\n\nRadeon 9000 series hardware and software are looking great and we are planning to have a wide assortment of cards available globally. Can\u2019t wait for gamers to get their hands on the cards when they go on sale in March! \u2014 David McAfee (@McAfeeDavid_AMD) January 20, 2025\n\nDavid McAfee, AMD\u2019s vice president and general manager of the Ryzen CPU and Radeon graphics division, revealed on X (Twitter) that the cards will go on sale in March. McAfee later added that AMD is holding onto the GPUs a little while longer in order to optimize their software stack, including FSR 4.\n\nMeanwhile, various leakers and tipsters are having a field day with AMD\u2019s troubled RDNA 4 launch. Recent whispers point to AMD still holding off to see how Nvidia fares. At this rate, AMD will likely get to see the RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 5070 in their full glory before it launches the RX 9070 XT.\n\nAMD wanted to announce its new graphics cards alongside Nvidia, but it clearly didn\u2019t have a solid plan for actually releasing them. Now, we\u2019ve had to cobble together various ideas about the cards from leaks, board partners, and social media posts, which doesn\u2019t inspire a lot of confidence.\n\nI\u2019m losing faith, and I\u2019m not alone\n\nAs soon as I saw David McAfee announce that RDNA 4 wouldn\u2019t be here until March, I knew what was coming \u2014 and I wasn\u2019t wrong. PC gaming enthusiasts, including both AMD and Nvidia fans, weren\u2019t happy with the way it\u2019s all gone down.\n\nScrolling through the hundreds of comments under McAfee\u2019s post reveals just how badly the general public wants to know what\u2019s going on.\n\nNot even, a proper announcement with slides of performance, features. Could be even \"price will be reveled at, a later date\". This is so bad PR\u2026 i have no words. \u2014 Tomasz Gawro\u0144ski (@GawroskiT) January 20, 2025\n\nSitting at over 500 likes, a comment from GawroskiT on X makes a dig at AMD\u2019s PR team. \u201cNot even a proper announcement. [\u2026] This is [such] bad PR. I have no words.\u201d\n\nAnother user, PlaysRingle, promises to ditch AMD for Nvidia based on how things are going. \u201cAMD is going to make me upgrade my RX 7900 XTX to an RTX 5080. I can\u2019t keep defending AMD when it keeps doing these things.\u201d\n\nI know that I\u2019m being fairly critical of AMD here myself, but I can\u2019t help feeling bad when reading these comments and seeing the reactions. Some of it is really quite harsh, such as this comment from noremac258: \u201cDoes AMD ever not fail to capitalize on an opportunity? [\u2026] AMD\u2019s graphics division is a disaster.\u201d\n\nWhat ARE you guys doing? What sort of \"marketing\" is this \"stealth\" reveal??? Your CES presence was so uninformative you'd have been better off not showing up at all, and all we get since then is THIS? \u2014 DGBurns (@davidgburns) January 21, 2025\n\nI tried to find more supportive comments, but there are very few of those to be found. However, Hardware Unboxed made a separate post defending AMD, which is what prompted McAfee to clarify that the delayed launch comes down to software optimization.\n\nAMD delaying the launch of RDNA4 to March is the right move. The last thing they want is stuffing up the launch yet again, which they risk doing if they launch before Nvidia. And very few people would have bought a 9070 XT just because it launched a week or two before the 5070.\u2026 \u2014 Hardware Unboxed (@HardwareUnboxed) January 20, 2025\n\nI know that X is a tough crowd, so I decided to check Reddit for more reactions. Long story short \u2014 it wasn\u2019t pretty.\n\nThe comments under this post, sharing that RDNA 4 won\u2019t arrive until March, are still harsh. One commenter said: \u201cNvidia\u2019s release was looking rather underwhelming, so AMD had to pull out all the stops to make sure they miss the opportunity this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI perceive this as having no confidence in your own product. [AMD] had the opportunity here to seize this midrange market segment by coming out first,\u201d said another user, pointing out that waiting for Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5070 might backfire.\n\nIn search of people who are more in favor of AMD than Nvidia, I ventured into the r/AMD community. This post quickly showed me that people aren\u2019t willing to cut AMD any slack.\n\nOther than the top comment thread pictured above, all the other highly-rated comments criticize AMD. \u201cAbsolute incompetence from AMD\u2019s GPU division, again,\u201d says one poster. \u201cDoesn\u2019t a significant amount of retailers already have the cards in stock? What a fumble,\u201d adds another.\n\nI could go on, but you get the gist. It\u2019s clear that people aren\u2019t pleased, and while the internet at large is hardly ever satisfied, some of this might\u2019ve been avoided if AMD had been more forthcoming about the RX 9000 series. People are frustrated with the delay, but also with the lack of information.\n\nAMD could still make the RX 9070 XT a success\n\nThings are looking a little bleak for RDNA 4 right now, but the internet is quick to forget. It\u2019s still entirely possible for AMD to turn this around and make the launch of the RX 9000 series a success.\n\nMy opinion is that sharing some information would be better than sharing next to none; even a basic spec sheet would go a long way. Although McAfee plays a key role in AMD\u2019s GPU strategy, most fans don\u2019t check his X account on a daily basis. Those people are either kept in the dark or they\u2019re left to rely on third parties to tell them what\u2019s going on.\n\nLetting the general public figure out AMD\u2019s plans based on social media means that a lot of people who might have otherwise been happy to wait will now be influenced by people who are decidedly not happy. If there are hundreds of comments all saying that AMD is doing a bad job, it\u2019s easy to start believing it yourself if you don\u2019t have anyone telling you otherwise.\n\nUnfortunately, right now, AMD is really not doing much to dispel that notion. A quick X post, even when coming from an AMD executive, doesn\u2019t cut it.\n\nAside from some marketing efforts to drive up the hype, I think it\u2019s now more important than ever for AMD to lean into that performance-per-dollar metric that makes GPUs like Intel\u2019s Arc B580 such a great deal. The fact is that the RX 9070 XT might still be an exceptional GPU even if it won\u2019t be able to beat all of its Nvidia rivals.\n\nMost people won\u2019t be spending $2,000 (or more) on an RTX 5090. The GPU market needs graphics cards that provide value while being able to run the latest games, and to that end, AMD\u2019s usually done a pretty good job. Strangely enough, some of its best GPUs are the ones that didn\u2019t get a lot of love from the marketing department, such as the RX 7900 GRE \u2014 but that\u2019s no reason for the RX 9070 XT to also be launched with so little fanfare.\n\nIn the consumer graphics market, AMD is a small fish; Nvidia is a massive shark. Following a troubled launch, AMD may therefore now face an uphill climb with the RX 9070 XT \u2014 but I\u2019m still hopeful.\n\nIf AMD gets the pricing right, the RX 9070 XT might still turn out to be an amazing card. On the other hand, if it\u2019s too expensive when compared to its Nvidia rivals, it might end up being overlooked regardless of AMD\u2019s marketing efforts. And let\u2019s hope that those efforts actually begin soon, because so far, Nvidia\u2019s winning the battle \u2014 but AMD could still walk away unscathed from the war.",

His love of Dodge Challengers \u2013 he has multiple ones, including a Hellcat \u2013 is a manifestation of his need for speed. And so is his work steering the design of IBM Power CPUs over the decades, and in the past several years, helping AMD deliver the past two generations of Instinct GPUs as its corporate vice president of GPU platforms.\n\nAs far as we know, AMD has just turned in a gangbuster year for GPU sales, thanks in large part to the adoption of its \u201cAldebaran\u201d MI200 series and more recently its \u201cAntares\u201d MI300 series. We expect for AMD to sell more than $5 billion in GPU accelerators into the datacenter in 2024, somewhere close to 10X the revenues it derived from GPUs in 2023. AMD has not yet put out a forecast for datacenter GPU sales for 2026, but we expect it to do so when it announces its fourth quarter 2024 financial report on February 4. We would not be surprised to see revenues this year double or triple, given the demand that is out there for accelerators and the dearth of supply.\n\nWe sat down recently with McCredie to talk some shop on accelerator engines and what may be in store for future AMD GPUs.\n\nTimothy Prickett Morgan: On the most recent Top500 supercomputer rankings from November 2024, if you just look at new machines added to the list, which is how I am starting to analyze the Top500 these days, systems with the combination of AMD GPUs and AMD CPUs represented 72 percent of peak theoretical FP64 performance. Machines using a variety of CPUs plus Nvidia GPUs represented 27.2 percent of the peak FP64 oomph. This was the first time we have seen AMD beat Nvidia, and this was due in large part to the \u201cEl Capitan\u201d supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore and its smaller siblings.\n\nOn the prior June 2024 rankings, a little more than 54 percent of the new capacity at FP64 precision was for machines using a combination of Nvidia \u201cGrace\u201d CPUs and \u201cHopper\u201d CPUs, and other machines using a variety of CPUs and Nvidia GPUs comprised another 25.6 percent of installed FP64 capacity.\n\nIs this back and forth between Nvidia and AMD a leading indicator that the upper echelons of the HPC market will normalize towards half and half at some point?\n\nBrad McCredie: I think that HPC capacity does need to be investable. You have to design double precision and a double precision data pass. You have to do things to support the HPC ecosystem. You can give the HPC ecosystem something else and tell them to deal with it, and I think that\u2019s happened with other vendors in the past. We are choosing to design for HPC customers. And if you look at our roadmap, we have really robust, double precision math all the way out.\n\nBy the way, our chiplet architecture makes it easier for us to make that decision. We are not building large, monolithic chips. And this is giving us a lot of flexibility to cater, and there will be a couple of things that are going to be very interesting as you start looking forward. HPC is so important in the world, and the machines need to be Swiss Army knives. They have got to do AI, they have got to do HPC. They have got to do both well. And with the chiplet architecture, we can actually design these machines with various ratios of these two types of compute.\n\nTPM: Are you going to re-architect for that? Because current GPU designs do not do this. They have vector and matrix math in specific capacities in a chiplet and you scale up the chiplets in a socket. You could break these two into separate chiplets and dial them up and down separately. . . .\n\nBrad McCredie: We are shifting pieces of the architecture to enable us to have that flexibility.\n\nTPM: Interesting. My observation, at least this time around, would be that AMD is designing a device that\u2019s great at HPC as we know it \u2013 64-bit precision and 32-bit floating point \u2013 and that can do a good job on AI. By contrast, Nvidia is designing an AI processor that is good enough for HPC.\n\nA \u201cBlackwell\u201d B200s delivers 45 teraflops at FP64 precision on the tensor cores \u2013 and we don\u2019t even know what the vectors in the CUDA cores do in terms of FP64, or how many CUDA cores are on the GB200 die. A single \u201cHopper\u201d H100 does 33.5 teraflops on its CUDA vector cores and 67 teraflops on its tensor cores. Nvidia has FP8 and FP4 flops going through the roof for AI workloads, but has cut back on FP64 radically in the Blackwell socket compared to the Hopper socket.\n\nBrad McCredie: Our take is that if you have the right chiplet strategy, you don\u2019t have to polarize that decision. I think not having to make that choice is the key.\n\nTPM: Well, the Instinct MI300X has 81.7 teraflops of FP64 on the vectors and 163.4 teraflops on the tensor cores, so that is a big advantage for straight HPC workloads.\n\nI don\u2019t think Nvidia is as worried about the HPC community because Hoppers are still available \u2013 like the \u201cKepler\u201d K80 when the \u201cMaxwell\u201d GPUs, the first accelerators that Nvidia created for AI workloads, came out more than a decade ago.\n\nBrad McCredie: I think you have to give the HPC community the hardware that they need to do their computations. So you have to look at the data formats between AI and HPC. There\u2019s a difference there. The system structures are changing as well between the two. And I think some flexibility there is important as well.\n\nI think everybody loves having the network hanging off of the accelerator. I think we need some flexibility between a flatter, broader network that HPC likes compared to the pod architecture that AI likes. Creating some flexibility between these options is something we are going to be looking at to enable systems optimized for various workloads.\n\nTPM: Can you ramp up the amount of Infinity Fabric coming off of the GPUs? Because that is an area where I wish there was more. Looking at the benchmarks, that bandwidth coming off the accelerator seems to be more important for AI training than AI inference. NVLink and NVSwitch didn\u2019t seem to help all that much on certain AI inference workloads in the tests you have done compared to using Infinity Fabric.\n\nIn any event, I can envision one of the one of the dials you might turn on a chiplet is to have a lot more Infinity Fabric for a training GPU than for an inference GPU and keep everything else more or less the same so you can cross link more devices and have a bigger memory domain higher bandwidth links between devices. Or is that just too much change?\n\nBrad McCredie: AI is obviously extremely large market, and there\u2019s a lot of things going on in AI. There are more and more papers being written about it, and you really can break inference into prefill and decode \u2013 and they have different compute needs. The general thought is that decode is much more memory bandwidth heavy, prefill is much more compute heavy. Each one has various memory bandwidth and compute needs . . . .\n\nTPM: . . . so you can make a workflow on a device or a workflow across different devices on a system board. You pour the data in one end, and it accelerates here when it needs it, and then pass it over to there . . .\n\nBrad McCredie: Well, interesting things are happening is all I will say. And I think this will all have an impact on architectures as we go forward.\n\nTPM: I also think it is time to break the tyranny of having the memory so close to the GPU using electric wires. I would love for more memory to be able to be hooked into a GPU from a slightly farther distance using optical links rather than having to pay the higher costs of stacking that memory up and keeping it a few millimeters away. Thoughts?\n\nBrad McCredie: It\u2019s a challenge, to be sure. If you think about how much we\u2019re packing into a GPU, we have blown through the reticle on the base silicon. So all of these devices are getting bigger, and cooling is becoming critical.\n\nTPM: And hence why I said that I want the distance between the memory and the compute device to get larger so we don\u2019t have these secondary heating effects that can corrupt the memory.\n\nBrad McCredie: What you are describing is a hairball, and it is not the first time the conversation has been had. [Laughter]\n\nThat was not an insult. I know that you know. But if you look at things that have advanced computing over the past, I think we could have a great discussion debating how much performance came from the transistor speeding up versus how much performance came through integration. I think it would be a very good discussion. On CPUs, the caches used to be separate, and then the northbridge and the southbridge came onto the die. How much of the performance came from just getting all those components onto the same die, versus from the transistor wiggling faster?\n\nI think betting against integration and keeping things close is a tough bet to place. I think we\u2019re going to still continue to find more stacking. I think we\u2019re going up instead of out, but don\u2019t get the wrong idea, I don\u2019t have anything written in stone tablets. There\u2019s still going to be a place for faster, lower power interconnects, no matter what. The question is: Where are we going to draw the dividing lines and where are we going to put the interfaces?\n\nTPM: That decision will be driven by money. . . .\n\nBrad McCredie: That decision is going to be driven by performance, which, to me, still regulates straight to money.\n\nTPM: OK, here\u2019s a question that has nothing specific to do with technology. You steered Power CPU design at IBM for a long time, and you have steered a few generations of AMD GPUs. Are you having fun?\n\nBrad McCredie: Yes, I am having fun. Obviously, building CPUs is cool, but there was so much code that had gone before and all these legacy things that hamstring our efforts. But this AI workload is incredible, and every bit of network bandwidth, network latency, compute capacity and performance, and memory capacity and performance \u2013 everything you put into the design gets consumed. I have never seen a workload like this.\n\nTPM: Is it getting harder to make these compute engines?\n\nBrad McCredie: Look at all of the microcosms for our industry. Obviously technology scaling \u2013 Moore\u2019s Law and blah, blah, blah \u2013 did it get harder? Yes, and the process guys had to make FinFET 3D transistors. But this industry is just so amazing. Of course we have to find new ways to do things even at the higher levels. But, you know, we are bringing in more networking, and that is because we are parallelizing more for the first time. We finally have got a really parallel workload.\n\nWe are going for the 3D packaging to get more silicon area into a space and then bringing in the cooling. I don\u2019t know if harder is the right word, but we are doing it in different ways. But here is the thing. As my college professor used to always say: \u201cAlways stay close to performance, Brad, because everybody always needs to go faster.\u201d And so every day, we are just finding new ways to go faster.\n\nSign up to our Newsletter Featuring highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to your inbox with nothing in between.\n\nSubscribe now",

A new leak from a US retailer points to a late March date for this new AMD graphics card to become available for pre-orders.\n\nAMD has already confirmed that the Radeon RX 9070 XT release date will be in March, but hasn\u2019t provided a specific day for the launch yet. While this new Radeon GPU isn\u2019t expected to be the best graphics card out there when it launches, it\u2019s still expected to serve as a strong competitor against mid-tier Nvidia RTX 50-series cards such as the RTX 5070, with hopefully a competitive price tag to match.\n\nAs with the last RX 9070 XT pre-order rumor, this data was revealed via the B&H retail site. Four models of Asus-branded RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT cards are now listed with a new pre-order time and date of 9am on Sunday, March 23. That\u2019s a week before the end of the month, and suggests that the final 9070 XT launch will be right at the end of Q1 2025.\n\nNo other information, including specs or photos, is listed for any of the four cards listed on the B&H website, although we managed to get our hands on several AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics cards at CES, including the Asus TUF Gaming variant of the RX 9070 XT.\n\nDespite announcing the new card at CES 2025 earlier this month, AMD hasn\u2019t said too much about these new graphics cards just yet. It hasn\u2019t yet released the official AMD Radeon RX 9070 specs to the public, either. As always with leaks and rumors, bear in mind that this date hasn\u2019t been officially confirmed by AMD either, so take it all with a grain of salt, and keep a close eye on future updates.\n\nIn the meantime, check out our Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 review for our first, real-world testing of a next-gen graphics card, which is likely to be a long way in front of the performance of AMD\u2019s next GPUs.",

Surely, AMD would wait until the Monday (March 24) if this was the plan.\n\nAlso, bearing in mind that the previous date B&H posted was January 23, it feels like what might have happened here is that a staff member working on the product listings just replaced the name of the month in the date, and left the day the same (though why an update was posted at all to the RDNA 4 listings, when nothing\u2019s official, is a good question).\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

(If you can \u2018play now\u2019 though, then the GPUs would surely be on sale). Team Red had a bunch of marketing stuff scheduled for Reddit (as flagged up here) around this, which accidentally still went ahead somehow (with these ads appearing in a few different countries in Europe, seemingly being published in German, Italian, and Polish).\n\nThe not-unreasonable conclusion folks are reaching is that AMD did have something planned for January 23, especially as there were a lot of rumors this was the case (albeit some mentioned January 24, though it was all in the same ballpark of the week we find ourselves in now). But all this has now been put off to March, although officially, as mentioned, AMD has never said anything concrete for the RX 9070 launch outside of it being Q1 2025.\n\nThe rumors around RDNA 4 have taken some very strange turns indeed, then, but the good news is that it seems these next-gen graphics cards will be worth waiting for. Even if we do have to hang on until later in March, rather than seeing the RX 9070 GPUs emerge earlier in the month \u2013 and really, I wouldn\u2019t be swayed at all by the new B&H pre-order date for all the reasons mentioned.",

            "content": "Nvidia (NVDA -4.05%) is the undisputed leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market these days. It has been generating fantastic growth in both its revenue and earnings, and the expectation that there's much more growth ahead is why many investors aren't shying away from buying the stock, despite its high valuations.\n\nTwo of Nvidia's key rivals, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, are hoping to chip away at its market share. While it's possible that some of its customers may want to diversify their supply chains and explore cheaper options, Nvidia's recent announcement of its new graphics cards is a sign that it isn't about to relinquish any of its market share easily.\n\nNew Nvidia cards are cheaper than expected\n\nOne way AMD and Intel could potentially win over customers is by offering them more modestly priced chips. While Nvidia's high-performing chips are in heavy demand, they don't come cheap. Tech companies developing AI models and chatbots have shown that they are willing to pay a premium for the chips, but price could play a bigger role in purchasing decisions down the road, especially if AMD or Intel can prove that their chips aren't significant downgrades from Nvidia's latest offerings.\n\nBut Nvidia is showing that it's willing to be a bit more aggressive on price. On Jan. 6, the company unveiled its latest GeForce RTX 50 cards, and what took some analysts by surprise was that many of them will be priced lower than the previous RTX 40 series, despite offering significant performance upgrades.\n\nNvidia also announced Project Digits -- the first desktop computer it will make. But at a price tag of $3,000, it isn't cheap, and is designed primarily for programmers.\n\nNvidia's strong margins allow it to be aggressive\n\nWhen a company is as big and profitable as Nvidia is, it's in an excellent position to compete on price and also pursue more aggressive opportunities. Not only has the company drastically grown its revenue over the years, it has done so while increasing its profit margins.\n\nWith such strong margins, the company can afford to offer some of its wares at lower prices, knowing that it can still maintain a high level of profitability. Doing so could potentially thwart competitors, as chips from AMD or Intel may not be comparatively cheap enough to win over customers.\n\nThere are reports that AMD is holding back the official launch of its new Radeon RX 9000 series chips due to Nvidia's announcement and the pricing pressure that has come as a result of it.\n\nShould investors load up on Nvidia's stock?\n\nNvidia's stock has plateaued in the past three months, and investors appear to be having some hesitancy about buying it at its current levels. The company, which has a market cap of $3.4 trillion, is trading at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 32, which is slightly higher than the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's average of 30. However, given the growth beast that Nvidia is, a bit of a premium over the average tech stock may certainly be warranted.\n\nGiven the long-term growth opportunities ahead for Nvidia, it's hard not to like the stock as a long-term buy. The company's financials are in excellent shape, and with Nvidia looking to be more aggressive on pricing and expanding its growth opportunities, it's not unreasonable to expect that its sales and profits can go even higher in the years ahead. Overall, it could be a good growth stock to buy and hold onto, despite its high valuation.",

This is in accordance with the brand\u2019s latest announcement, leaving more time to stock up on cards.\n\nRadeon 9000 series was expected in January \u2013 likely the 23rd going by the recent Reddit ads \u2013 before getting rescheduled to an unknown later date. Following users\u2019 disappointment, AMD\u2019s David McAfee ended up giving a vague March time frame, explaining the reason is to improve its software stack while bringing FSR 4 to more games.\n\nRegardless, this fluid release date has been clarified by B&H, which listed a bunch of custom Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards. According to the American retailer, models should become available to pre-order on March 23, i.e. two months after the reported initial date.\n\nThat said, this could be a placeholder since the 23rd falls on a Sunday. Also, note that none of these models seem to be a reference AMD design, as they come from Asus Prime and TUF Gaming series.\n\nThis means that an official announcement with specs and pricing should come sometime in early March. For the time being, rumours talk about 16GB of 20Gb/s GDDR6 memory on both RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT, with the only difference residing in the core configuration. The former is expected to carry 3,584 cores clocked at 2.52GHz boost, with the latter rocking 4,096 cores at 2.97GHz.\n\nWith that in mind, the performance delta between the two could be around 16%, which is roughly the same gap from RX 7900 XT to RX 7900 XTX. Funnily enough, looking at AMD\u2019s product segmentation slide, RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT should both slot below RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX, respectively. But as usual, we must wait for reviews to be sure. What is official is that AMD isn\u2019t targeting the high-end this generation, leaving Nvidia as the only option for enthusiasts.",

Coincidentally, about a month later in November 2022, the world was introduced to ChatGPT, sparking a generational movement among investors who were chasing anything and everything related to artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmong opportunities in the AI realm, perhaps none have witnessed more gains than semiconductor stocks. Since October 2022, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has returned 194% -- absolutely dominating the Nasdaq Composite's return of 88% and the S&P 500's gain of 68%.\n\nChief among the chip stocks is Nvidia, which has soared by 1,100% since the beginning of the current bull market. By contrast, Nvidia's top rival, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.92%), has returned 110% over the course of the bull market. This isn't anything to turn your back on, but it's not even in the same league as Nvidia. With that said, I think shares of AMD could be on the brink of their own Nvidia-esque run.\n\nLet's dig into why Nvidia has been all the rage among chip stocks over the last two years and analyze why AMD could be headed much higher over the course of the next few years.\n\nNvidia had a first mover advantage, but...\n\nThroughout the AI revolution, Nvidia's bellwether has been its computing and networking business. Specifically, the company's Hopper and Ampere graphics processing units (GPUs) have seen historical demand. GPUs are the engine that power generative AI applications. And for much of the last two years, Nvidia was the only major player in town.\n\nAs it stands today, Nvidia owns 90% of the GPU market. Although a lead like that might discourage you from even considering an alternative to investing in Nvidia, I would encourage you to keep an open mind.\n\n...AMD could be closing in on Nvidia's lead, and...\n\nIn December 2023, AMD released the MI300X data center GPU. While this was nearly a year after Nvidia had already been dominating the GPU market, AMD has witnessed some considerable success that I think is going overlooked.\n\nFirst off, hyperscalers including Meta Platforms, Oracle, and Microsoft are all augmenting their Nvidia architecture with AMD's MI300 accelerators. Acquiring customers of this caliber is impressive, but AMD's financial trends are what really have me excited.\n\nSince the release of the MI300 architecture, AMD has seen its data center GPU business grow from effectively nothing into a multibillion-dollar operation, and it has continued to accelerate quarter after quarter. Meanwhile, Nvidia's data center operation is actually beginning to show signs of slowing down.\n\nThis pace of growth has provided AMD with an estimated 10% share of the GPU market -- effectively making it an outright duel between AMD and Nvidia.\n\n... investors may want to buy AMD stock hand over fist now, before it's too late\n\nWhen the current bull market began in October 2022, Nvidia's market capitalization was just $280 billion. Today, the company is valued at over $3.3 trillion, more than tenfold what it was worth just two years ago.\n\nInterestingly, AMD's current market cap of $200 billion is not that far away from where Nvidia was valued before it went parabolic. In my eyes, investors are really discounting AMD's potential over the next few years as the company continues scaling up its data center business.\n\nWith successor GPUs already scheduled for release between this year and 2026, AMD is in a good position to continue disrupting Nvidia. As such, investors looking for more growth could eventually sour on Nvidia and turn to alternatives such as AMD.\n\nI still see Nvidia as a great opportunity, but I think the days of 1,000%-plus gains are in the rearview mirror. By contrast, I think AMD is in the early stages of its own epic run. I see AMD as a bargain opportunity right now, and I think it will be significantly higher three years from now as its chapter in the AI storyline continues to unfold.",

We also have a wide range\u2026January 22, 2025\n\nSo, AMD is tuning graphics drivers to work as well as possible with the incoming RX 9070 offerings, and to bring more PC games into the fold of being supported by FSR 4.\n\nFurthermore, the exec from Team Red also indicates that building up stock is part of the equation when it comes to pitching the launch of RDNA 4 GPUs later in Q1, rather than earlier.\n\nAnalysis: A new tack from AMD \u2013 don\u2019t rush, get it right?\n\nThis second announcement in short order from McAfee appears to serve a few possible purposes. Of course, on a surface level, it\u2019s good to be kept up to date with what\u2019s going on, and to hear why Team Red is taking more time on this. And I think this is something AMD needed to clarify, as there were a lot of rumors bubbling around what\u2019s happening behind closed doors with RDNA 4.\n\nOne of the more frustrating elements of the \u2018delay\u2019 of RDNA 4 \u2013 which isn\u2019t strictly a delay, seeing as AMD only ever said Q1 2025 for the launch, and that can be as late as March (though admittedly, not any later) \u2013 was the apparent appearance of multiple RX 9070 models at retailers. Seasoning needed to be sprinkled over those sightings, naturally, but there were a number of photos, all of which looked authentic enough (it seemed unlikely they were all fakes somehow). These led to some bewilderment and frustration as to why AMD isn\u2019t just \u2018getting on with it\u2019 as it were.\n\nMcAfee indirectly addresses this with his latest comment, in the mention of some retail partners having \u201cstarted building initial inventory\u201d but that there\u2019s much more to come. This explains those photo leaks and also assures us that there\u2019ll be plenty of RDNA 4 stock on hand \u2013 also playing into, and capitalizing on, the worries that Nvidia won\u2019t have a decent level of inventory for its RTX 5000 graphics cards (at least not initially for RTX 5090 and 5080 models).\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

Granted, the fact that the RTX 5070 should already be out in February, and fully tested, to allow for better pitching of the price of the RX 9070 and its XT sibling, is obviously a benefit here too. (If AMD hasn\u2019t yet finalized the price \u2013 which, given the overall picture, seems likely to be the case).\n\nYouTube Watch On\n\nThis main thrust of making the RDNA 4 launch a high-quality affair also chimes with what Moore\u2019s Law is Dead (MLID) just shared in his latest video (see above). The YouTuber notes that AMD has switched strategy under Jack Huynh (Senior VP of Computing and Graphics) to avoid rushing out products when the market \u2013 or launches from rivals \u2013 demands them to arrive, and instead, take the time to get the hardware fully right.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t argue with that strategy because, well, it fully makes sense, and MLID\u2019s sources also make it clear that they aren\u2019t worried that RX 9070 models might disappoint.\n\nSo, while I\u2019d like to buy a new mid-range GPU sooner rather than later, I\u2019m just going to have to be patient, as will everyone else. Because even if that is a bit frustrating, if RDNA 4 pans out very well as a result, it will, of course, be worth the wait.\n\nVia VideoCardz",

            "content": "Updated AMD has confirmed at least some of its microprocessors suffer a microcode-related security vulnerability, the existence of which accidentally emerged this month after a fix for the flaw appeared in a beta BIOS update from PC maker Asus.\n\nAll we know for now is that the security issue is a \"microcode signature verification vulnerability.\" Microcode is information typically loaded into the processor by the system firmware or operating system at boot time that dictates the way various parts of the chip work, to put it simply. Microcode can be used to add and fix functionality within the processor without having to physically replace the component, which is convenient.\n\nCrucially, the format of the microcode is usually proprietary to the maker of the processor (in this case, AMD) so people generally can't come up with their own microcode and heavily customize their CPUs. There are also defense mechanisms in place to ensure only official microcode can be loaded, which usually includes checking the digital signature of the code before it's loaded.\n\nWe're speculating here but a microcode signature verification vulnerability may involve being able to load into an AMD processor microcode that should be rejected, but isn't, and thus someone may be able to tweak the way their CPUs function, or stop the thing from working entirely. Usually microcode can only be loaded by a privileged process, such as the OS kernel or BIOS firmware, and while something or someone malicious on your system with that level of access is already pretty bad, you probably don't want them to start screwing with a microcode-related vulnerability either.\n\nSo far, it's not looking too critical, and it's the manner in which info is leaking out that is the story here.\n\nUncovered\n\nOur attention was drawn to the AMD flaw by a public mailing list post from Tavis Ormandy, a top bug-finder at Google's Project Zero. He pointed out that Asus had emitted a beta BIOS update for its gaming motherboards that mentioned a fix for the aforementioned AMD vulnerability in its release notes \u2013 crucially, before AMD had a chance to distribute an official advisory about said vuln.\n\nThose notes have since been edited to remove a reference to AMD's microcode issue, though they still acknowledge the patching of a separate memory overflow security flaw in PeCoffLoader.\n\n\"It looks like an OEM leaked the patch for a major upcoming CPU vulnerability, ie: 'AMD Microcode Signature Verification Vulnerability,'\" Ormandy wrote on Tuesday. \"I'm not thrilled about this. The patch is not currently in linux-firmware, so this is the only publicly available patch.\"\n\nAMD confirmed to The Register some of its products have an issue that needs fixing, and that a patch will be released and disclosed as normal shortly. As suspected, it also clarified that exploitation requires highly privileged access.\n\n\"AMD is aware of a newly reported processor vulnerability. Execution of the attack requires both local administrator level access to the system, and development and execution of malicious microcode,\" the Ryzen giant told us.\n\nAMD\u2019s remarks to The Register suggest it\u2019s more worried that its customers could fall for fake fixes than the impact of the problem itself.\n\n\"AMD has provided mitigations and is actively working with its partners and customers to deploy those mitigations,\u201d the biz told us. \u201cAMD recommends customers continue to follow industry-standard security practices and only work with trusted suppliers when installing new code on their systems. AMD plans to issue a security bulletin soon with additional guidance and mitigation options.\"\n\nHowever, the chip designer hasn\u2019t yet revealed which of its products are impacted.\n\nWhile the world waits for that guidance, speculation about the flaw has begun.\n\n\"Is this fix effective, or can it be bypassed via a downgrade attack?\" asked Demi Marie Obenour, a software developer for Invisible Things on the same security mailing list. She suggested that although exploitation is likely limited to highly privileged users and software, the bug could be used to undo super-low-level system security protections.\n\n\"Since microcode loading can (hopefully!) only be done in ring 0 and SVM root mode, this means that one needs OS kernel access to perform an exploit. However, if an attacker could load arbitrary microcode, they could compromise SMM, SEV-SNP, and DRTM, so this is still pretty bad.\"\n\nHey, worse things can happen. \u00ae\n\nUpdated to add on February 4\n\nGoogle has released details of the security issue here, noting as we anticipated that it allows someone with root-level access on a box to change the AMD processor microcode:\n\nThis vulnerability allows an adversary with local administrator privileges (ring 0 from outside a VM) to load malicious microcode patches. We have demonstrated the ability to craft arbitrary malicious microcode patches on Zen 1 through Zen 4 CPUs. The vulnerability is that the CPU uses an insecure hash function in the signature validation for microcode updates. This vulnerability could be used by an adversary to compromise confidential computing workloads protected by the newest version of AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization, SEV-SNP or to compromise Dynamic Root of Trust Measurement.\n\nAMD has released an advisory here for those who want to patch against this threat.",

This is the first time the company has made such a move, and while there are other reasons for it, AMD's Corporate VP and GM David McAfee claim that the delayed launch is attributed to \"last-minute\" optimizations, as the firm is determined to make the RX 9070 series debut flawless.\n\nI really appreciate the excitement for RDNA4. We are focused on ensuring we deliver a great set of products with Radeon 9000 series. We are taking a little extra time to optimize the software stack for maximum performance and enable more FSR 4 titles. We also have a wide range of partners launching Radeon 9000 series cards, and while some have started building initial inventory at retailers, you should expect many more partner cards available at launch. - AMD's David McAfee\n\nWell, it seems like AMD's software stack will see a lot warmer reception this time, and by the looks of it, FSR 4 will indeed debut with support in several mainstream titles, unlike the previous generations, where on-launch-supported titles were pretty confined. Along with this, RDNA 4 will also see refined drivers, which could mean that we won't see any significant bugs or performance issues attributed to Team Red's software stack. Overall, AMD looks optimistic about the RX 9070 series GPU launch and is planning on nailing it.\n\nInterestingly, AMD has also revealed that inventory levels at launch will be decent, as a wide range of retailers have started building up the SKU inventory. Unlike NVIDIA, which is said to have a confined RTX 50 series supply, it seems like Team Red might gain an edge in this particular department since having ample supply around the launch period means that consumers won't face much hassle in getting their desired AIB models, further fueling the sales traction for RX 9070 series GPUs.\n\nExpect big things with the upcoming Radeon RX 9070 XT and non-XT counterpart since AMD has pushed the accelerator to provide one of the best perf/$ value out of their mainstream GPU offerings.",

            "content": "It\u2019s time for the ultimate showdown between AMD and Nvidia, as Radeon RX 7900 XTX takes on GeForce RTX 5090. While this is technically a battle of old versus new, there\u2019s currently no modern replacement for the RDNA 3 graphics card at present nor will there be until later this year. As such, there\u2019s no opponent more worthy for the Blackwell architecture in its mightiest form.\n\nMuch separates these two flagships with the odds unavoidably stacked in GeForce RTX 5090\u2019s favour in part thanks to its more-advanced specifications. However, its advantages come with an intimidating four-figure cost and Radeon RX 7900 XTX could offer greater value in some areas. Pitting them against one another, let\u2019s see which is more worthy of serving as king of the GPU hill.\n\nSpecs\n\nMake no mistake, the GB202 GPU at the heart of GeForce RTX 5090 is enormous at 744mm\u00b2 and appears all the larger put next to Navi 31 XTX\u2019s 529mm\u00b2 die. This size of Nvidia\u2019s champion affords it more room to cram transistors, almost doubling its rival with 92.2b to the 57.7b offered by AMD\u2019s contender. Manufacturing processes naturally play a part too, with Team Green benefitting from TSMC\u2019s more advanced 4N node compared to Team Red\u2019s mix of older N5 and N6 nodes.\n\nMuch as battles of specification can boil down to a numbers game, it\u2019s difficult to quantify the quality of particular components. There\u2019s no avoiding that Nvidia has history on its side here, with more mature designs for its ray tracing cores and AI accelerators. For context, this is a battle of GeForce\u2019s 4th Gen RT cores and 5th Gen Tensor Cores against Radeon\u2019s 3rd Gen and 2nd Gen equivalents. This translates to some profound differences in performance as illustrated by benchmarks below.\n\nGeForce RTX 5090 Radeon RX 7900 XTX Released Jan 2025 Nov 2022 Codename Blackwell Plum Bonito GPU GB202 Navi 31 XTX Transistors 92.2 billion 57.7 billion Die size 744mm\u00b2 529mm\u00b2 Cores 170 SMs 96 CUs RT units 170 96 AI engines 680 5th Gen Tensor 192 AI Accelerators Base clock 2,017MHz 1,929MHz Boost clock 2,407MHz 2,498MHz Memory 32GB GDDR7 24GB GDDR6 Mem. clock 28Gb/s 20Gb/s Mem. interface 512-bit 384-bit Mem. bandwidth 1.7TB/s 960GB/s TOPS 3,352 \u2013 TBP 575W 355W Launch MSRP $1,999 $999\n\nThere\u2019s simply no beating GeForce RTX 5090\u2019s memory configuration, try as Radeon RX 7900 XTX might. Nvidia\u2019s graphics card boasts 32GB of GDDR7 VRAM clocked at 28Gb/s, besting the size and speed of its rival\u2019s 24GB of GDDR6 running at 20Gb/s. Compounding its lead, the Blackwell flagship rides on a wider 512-bit memory interface too, resulting in a total bandwidth of 1.7TB/s. By comparison, RDNA 3\u2019s best arrives with a 384-bit bus and can only muster half the bandwidth at 960GB/s.\n\nOne category in which Radeon RX 7900 XTX enjoys a win over GeForce RTX 5090 is TBP (Total Board Power). The former\u2019s request of 355W is downright frugal next to the latter\u2019s demands of 575W. This makes AMD\u2019s star player much easier to satiate that Nvidia\u2019s, although you will need a suitably beefy power supply for either pixel pusher in the region of 750-1,000W.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s discuss price. Featuring top-of-the-line specs from their respective time periods, it should come as no surprise that GeForce RTX 5090 and Radeon RX 7900 XTX come at substantial cost. As the new kid on the block, you won\u2019t find Nvidia\u2019s latest and greatest graphics card anywhere remotely below its eye-watering $1,999 MSRP. However, you\u2019ll often find AMD\u2019s alternative below its launch price, boosting its relative value.\n\nPerformance\n\nBoth GeForce RTX 5090 and Radeon RX 7900 XTX have proven their mettle in the Club386 test bench, complete with a 7950X3D that provides ample room for each graphics card to show their stuff. These scores and frame rates are as fresh as they come, using the latest available drivers for each at the time of writing.\n\nIn addition to a more robust helping of synthetic tests, the Club386 benchmark suite below also includes gaming performance at FHD (1080p), QHD (1440p), and UHD (2160p). I\u2019ll also be examining how well AMD and Nvidia\u2019s upscaling solutions fare in one of the most demanding ray traced workloads on the market today.\n\nApplications & AI\n\nCombining the samples per minute of all three scenes in Blender\u2019s benchmark suite, GeForce RTX 5090 takes a clear lead over Radeon RX 7900 XTX. With respective totals of 15,101 and 4,330, Nvidia\u2019s performance almost quadruples AMD\u2019s making the former the preferred choice for creatives in the field of 3D graphics.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Nvidia performs well in Geekbench AI. GeForce RTX 5090 delivers a half-precision score of 66,821, besting Radeon RX 7900 XTX\u2019s result of 43,047 and giving it a lead of 55%.\n\nIf there was any doubt that the Blackwell flagship was the card to get for the best performance in all things artificial intelligence, this should put it to bed. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that this performance bump comes with a 100% increase in cost.\n\nThe gaps in AI between architectures become all the more apparent in Procyon\u2019s AI Text Generation benchmark. Using a Llama 3.1 model, GeForce RTX 5090\u2019s score of 6,477 almost doubles the 3,525 result of Radeon RX 7900 XTX. Factoring cost into the equation, Nvidia\u2019s higher pricing scales almost linearly with performance.\n\nIn our final set of artificial tests, 3DMark paints a particularly painful picture for AMD. Regardless of rendering, rasterised or ray traced, GeForce RTX 5090 is leagues ahead of Radeon RX 7900 XTX.\n\nLooking more closely at the results, Nvidia enjoys its biggest win in the ray traced realms of 3DMark Speed Way with a superior score that\u2019s 118% higher than AMD. While the gap narrows in 3DMark Steel Nomad, it still amounts to a triple-digit difference of 105% in rasterised capabilities.\n\nThese victories sadly aren\u2019t indicative of average differences in real-world frame rates, but the general notion that GeForce RTX 5090 is a much-more capable graphics card than Radeon RX 7900 XTX holds true. You\u2019d certainly hope so given the difference in age and price between the two.\n\nGaming\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Mirage gives GeForce RTX 5090 and Radeon RX 7900 XTX a suitable playground to showcase their rasterised rendering might. Running this game with these graphics cards at FHD almost feels like a waste, as each punch north of 200fps on average. It\u2019s also the resolution that sees AMD achieve frame rates closest to Nvidia, as just 32fps separates the two. This pattern will repeat itself throughout the suite.\n\nMoving up to QHD, GeForce RTX 5090 maintains an average frame rate north of 200fps while Radeon RX 7900 XTX turns in a lower but nonetheless respectable 167fps. Unsurprisingly, both cards deliver a suitable frame rate for a high-refresh rate gaming experience without need for upscaling at this resolution.\n\nRunning through Baghdad at 4K creates a more pronounced difference in performance. GeForce RTX 5090 strides confidently in the triple-digits with a 150fps average, while Radeon RX 7900 XTX just about manages the same feat with 104fps.\n\nThese numbers naturally show Nvidia\u2019s card is faster but the value of its uplift, ranging between 16-44%, does come into question considering it\u2019s much more expensive.\n\nBooting up Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail delivers differences in frame rate similar to Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage. Across all three resolutions, GeForce RTX 5090 dominates with leads of 16-64% relative to Radeon RX 7900 XTX\u2019s frame rates.\n\nAMD does once again manage to keep its head above triple-digit water but only Nvidia can keep both minimum and average frame rates greater than 100fps at higher resolutions.\n\nGeForce RTX 5090 sets pace as we shift gears to the ray traced races of Forza Motorsport. The difference in calibre between these cards at this kind of rendering is apparent at FHD, with 57fps separating Radeon RX 7900 XTX from its rival.\n\nThe gap widens as the weight of the workload at QHD and UHD presses down on the pixel pushers. Nvidia\u2019s contender keeps a cooler head, outright lapping AMD\u2019s champ at the latter resolution and coming perilously close to doing so again at QHD.\n\nTake note that Radeon RX 7900 XTX falls short of what I deem a playable frame rate in racing games, failing to hit that all-important 60fps average. Meanwhile, GeForce RTX 5090 barrels ahead with a comfortable 87fps result.\n\nIt\u2019s almost dizzying seeing average FHD frame rates of 400fps+ from GeForce RTX 5090 and Radeon RX 7900 XTX in Mount & Blade II Bannerlord. Each card performs excellently at QHD too, delivering 367fps and 300fps respectively.\n\nThe battle naturally turns bloodier at UHD, where GeForce RTX 5090 proudly beats its chest with a 270fps result to Radeon RX 7900 XTX\u2019s 163fps. This glorious victory of sorts makes Nvidia\u2019s card the better by a whopping 65%.\n\nMore horsepower only matters if there\u2019s road to run on and it\u2019s clear GeForce RTX 5090 is hungry for more in Rainbow Six Extraction. The card\u2019s 1% lows fall slightly between FHD and QHD, but average frames are practically identical with just 3fps separating the two resolutions. By comparison, Radeon RX 7900 XTX is breathing down its rival\u2019s neck at first but the higher resolution creates more space between each card.\n\nOnce again, UHD creates a chasm between the cards as GeForce RTX 5090\u2019s 248fps average runs circles around the 156fps of Radeon RX 7900 XTX. Every frame matters in fast-paced first-person shooters, particularly of the competitive variety. This makes the additional 59% offered by Nvidia quite attractive, particularly in combination with Nvidia Reflex tech.\n\nDLSS vs. FSR\n\nAfter experiencing the likes of Alan Wake 2 and Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s path tracing modes, I\u2019m an unabashed champion of ray tracing. However, the breath-taking qualities this kind of rendering demands place enormous strain on even the very best graphics cards. Running the likes of CD Projket Red\u2019s Ray Tracing: Overdrive preset at native 4K isn\u2019t something I\u2019d recommend, even on a GeForce RTX 5090. It surprises me to learn that such a feat is very much doable at FHD and even QHD, with average frame rates above 60fps.\n\nSadly, Radeon RX 7900 XTX simply doesn\u2019t have the mustard for this kind of task. Cyberpunk 2077 is playable at a push at FHD with this graphics card pushing 33fps on average, but QHD and UHD are out of the question as the pixel pusher sputters single-digit frame rates at the latter resolution.\n\nWhat strikes me most about these results is that GeForce RTX 5090 can deliver comparable performance to Radeon RX 7900 XTX while handling four times the pixels (UHD vs. FHD). Running the same resolution, Nvidia enjoys a 215% lead. Staggering stuff.\n\nEmploying each graphics card\u2019s super resolution solutions massively improves Radeon RX 7900 XTX performance but FSR simply isn\u2019t enough to keep up with GeForce RTX 5090 using DLSS. Upscaling finally earns AMD its first 60fps victory at FHD but it also turns Nvidia\u2019s two-pair hand into three-of-a-kind.\n\nMuch as these graphs illustrate the quantity of frames GeForce RTX 5090 offers, they don\u2019t demonstrate their quality. DLSS remains a step ahead in this regard boasting superior image quality to FSR due to fewer artefacts and a generally sharper image. This in part thanks to machine learning and the results above use the longstanding \u2018Convolutional Neural Network\u2019 model but Nvidia is introducing a new \u2018Transformer\u2019 model that further boosts image quality with a performance penalty, widening the gap in technologies further.\n\nClub386 will take a more in-depth look at the differences between the two models in due course, so stay tuned.\n\nAs a final coup de grace, GeForce RTX 5090 deploys MFG (Multi Frame Generation) to raise its frame rates into the stratosphere. Radeon RX 7900 XTX\u2019s single frame generation does give its performance a welcome lift but there\u2019s simply no catching up to its rival now.\n\nThese frame generation technologies incur a small penalty to latency, affecting the perceived smoothness of the overall framerate. Features like Nvidia Reflex and AMD Anti-Lag attempt to minimise this but they can\u2019t remedy the other soft requirement of a high base frame rate. With these variables in mind, GeForce RTX 5090 once again emerges as the only appropriate graphics card for all three resolutions while Radeon RX 7900 XTX only manages to achieve an ideal experience at FHD.\n\nFinally, a quick word on percentages: GeForce RTX 5090 leads Radeon RX 7900 XTX by 306-491% in this scenario.\n\nVitals\n\nBoth AMD and Nvidia build excellent reference design coolers for their respective graphics cards that keep any sign of thermal throttling well at bay. However, Radeon RX 7900 XTX is the cooler of the two pixel pushers, as GeForce RTX 4090 runs 9\u00b0C under load.\n\nDespite running hotter, GeForce RTX 5090 is the quieter graphics card next to Radeon RX 7900 XTX. There\u2019s 5.5db between them but you shouldn\u2019t hear either kicking up a fuss louder than your system\u2019s fans.\n\nGiven the differences in temperature observed earlier, I am curious if it\u2019s possible to push fan speed more aggressively on GeForce RTX 5090 to make it more of a match.\n\nWith great performance comes great power consumption, as GeForce RTX 5090 demonstrates with its astonishingly large draw of 707W under load. By comparison, Radeon RX 7900 XTX\u2019s 482W reading is 32% lower. Beefy power supplies are a must on either graphics card but especially so with Nvidia\u2019s new flagship.\n\nThankfully, both GeForce RTX 5090 and Radeon RX 7900 XTX don\u2019t pull a massive amount of watts while idle.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt should come as no surprise that GeForce RTX 5090 is more performant than Radeon RX 7900 XTX, as its predecessor was before it. However, the gap between AMD and Nvidia\u2019s respective flagships is now even larger in terms of raw performance and features.\n\nIf you can realistically afford either graphics card, there\u2019s little reason to opt for Radeon RX 7900 XTX over GeForce RTX 5090. The latter is more performant in applications and games, boasts more robust specifications, and offers a more advanced feature set through DLSS 4. Just note that the additional $1,000 expenditure won\u2019t always translate into a 1:1 boost in frame rates.\n\nRadeon RX 9000 Series graphics cards are en route, but it seems doubtful that its highest SKU will be able to challenge GeForce RTX 5090. For the foreseeable, Nvidia\u2019s flagship is the undisputed king of the hill.\n\nGeForce RTX 5090 \u201cGeForce RTX 5090 is the absolute pinnacle of PC gaming.

We are focused on ensuring we deliver a great set of products with Radeon 9000 series. We are taking a little extra time to optimize the software stack for maximum performance and enable more FSR 4 titles. We also have a wide range\u2026January 22, 2025\n\nThat should bring some exciting competition to the space, as on top of the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 50-series cards Intel is rolling out its second-gen \"Battlemage\" line of Arc desktop graphics cards this year. Our own Jason England went sim racing with the Intel Arc B580 GPU at CES 2025, and all signs suggest these new Intel cards deliver compelling performance for GPUs that cost under $1,000. The B580, for example, retails for around $250, which is a far cry from the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090's $1,999 price tag.\n\nBut of course, Nvidia's leaning harder into AI, robotics and data centers than PC gaming, so those 5090s are probably intended to be luxury goods more than practical gaming gear. And if AMD can bring its Radeon RX 9000 series cards to market at prices that feel affordable, with compelling performance using FSR 4 upscaling, the company could potentially undercut Nvidia's mid-grade cards and make a lot of friends among PC gamers who can't afford to drop a thousand bucks or more on a graphics card.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

Late on Wednesday, he clarified that the company wants its partners to deliver as many custom boards to retailers as possible to ensure widespread availability on release day. In the meantime, AMD will polish its drivers to ensure the new products are among the best graphics cards straight out of the gate.\n\n\"We are focused on ensuring we deliver a great set of products with Radeon 9000 series,\" McAfee wrote in another X post. \"We are taking a little extra time to optimize the software stack for maximum performance and enable more FSR 4 titles. We also have many partners launching Radeon 9000 series cards, and while some have started building initial inventory at retailers, you should expect many more partner cards available at launch.\"\n\nSo far, AMD has disclosed that its Radeon RX 9070 and Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics cards are based on the RDNA 4 architecture and are positioned for performance-mainstream market segments, something that is indirectly confirmed by a rather moderate die size of the Navi 48 graphics processing unit. The company has not disclosed the actual specifications of these add-in-boards \u2014 even though there are rumored specs \u2014 so it is hard to make educated guesses about the performance of these products.\n\nAs it turns out, AMD intends to spend the next 1.5 \u2013 2 months finessing drivers for its RDNA 4 architecture and probably ensuring that FSR 4 technology works with a higher number of games. This will promote out-of-box performance of the new graphics cards and will likely demonstrate a decent uptick compared to predecessors with FSR 4 enabled. It is expected that FSR 4 will support frame generation technology and this capability significantly improves performance on paper.\n\nAMD's partners will also have a couple of extra months to learn how to better enhance performance of AMD's Radeon RX 9070 and Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics processors, so perhaps some AIB models will feature significant performance enhancements achieved by factory overclocking the GPU.\n\nFinally, with positive reviews and plenty of factory-overclocked models, AMD hopes to grab a larger chunk of the market from its rival Nvidia, which initially focuses on the highest end of the market with its GeForce RTX 50-series products. Of course, it remains to be seen whether AMD indeed manages to occupy a significant part of the market without a real halo product.",

At least not in the grand scheme of things, but they're certainly further off than we originally expected. Now, AMD is giving us more information about why exactly that is.\n\nAccording to AMD VP and GM David McAfee, the company is \"taking a little extra time to optimize the software stack for maximum performance and enable more FSR 4 titles.\"\n\nThe Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT were expected to launch at CES 2025, but instead AMD didn't give a release date and revealed very few details about the new GPUs. We only got an RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT release date a couple of days ago when McAfee said they'll \"go on sale in March\".\n\nAside from speculation about possible changes of plans regarding the GPUs\u2014switching from a chiplet to non-chiplet design\u2014many have suspected that the main reason for the delayed launch was Nvidia's announcement of surprisingly cheap price tags for the upcoming RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti, which the AMD GPUs will almost certainly be competing against.\n\nThis reason, at least, is not speculation. AMD's Frank Azor confirmed as much to us at CES, saying the RTX 50-series announcement \"went into our decision\" to hold off on dishing out the deetz on the new desktop GPUs. Although, Azor clarified that it wasn't the only factor, saying \"it isn't any one thing.\"\n\nI really appreciate the excitement for RDNA4. We are focused on ensuring we deliver a great set of products with Radeon 9000 series. We are taking a little extra time to optimize the software stack for maximum performance and enable more FSR 4 titles. We also have a wide range\u2026January 22, 2025\n\nThere are many reasons why such a thing could cause a delay, least of which being needing time to let the dust settle around the RTX 50-series cards and figure out a new price point. And if this meant reducing the price of the GPUs to better compete with the RTX 50-series, this could have caused problems with board partners that had already bought up a load of GPUs at the original higher price.\n\nNow, however, Azor seems to be implying the delay is to do with getting \"maximum performance\" out of the cards. Of course, that's something we'd hope the company was aiming for anyway, but if it takes a little extra time to achieve, so be it.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

Improving performance and getting more FSR 4 titles up and running could be one of the \"multitude of different things\" Azor originally mentioned. Plus, of course, any improvements will help improve the AMD chips' value proposition against the 50-series chips.\n\nSo, it does track\u2014could track, at least. But that doesn't detract from the fact that the RX 9070 and RX 9070 were delayed, which doesn't exactly scream confidence in the product. We won't know until we get our hands on the GPUs for testing. We were hoping that'd have been following CES, but alas, \"maximum performance\" calls.",

They will, inevitably, be considerably more expensive than the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. If you recall, the original MSRP for the 7950X3D was 55% more than the 7800X3D (in the US).\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\nAnalysis: An easy choice for gamers, it seems\n\nSo, you might be thinking \u2013 you only get the same performance from a pricier CPU \u2013 what gives with that? Well, remember, this is gaming frame rates we are talking about specifically.\n\nThe Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D are designed as dual-use processors, which are excellent for creatives (and can easily cut through other heavyweight tasks), as well as providing great gaming performance. Although given the 3D V-Cache flagship\u2019s spec this time around, some folks might have expected better performance in PC games \u2013 though AMD is clearly priming us not to, and this appears to be what this bit of marketing info is all about.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nRegarding that spec, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D not only provides 16-cores (and 32-threads), versus the 8-cores (16-threads) of the 9800X3D, but it also has a 5.7GHz boost clock, plus more of that crucial 3D V-Cache (144MB versus 104MB).\n\nHowever, it seems despite this extra pep, the situation will remain the same as it was with the previous-gen X3D chips, where the 7950X3D and 7800X3D were pretty much the same in terms of gaming performance in the main, give or take a bit. At least, after any CPU configuration gremlins were ironed out, because it\u2019s true that in the past, the 7950X3D could be held back in some situations because it has two CCDs. (This means two separate Core Complex Dies, or chiplets, only one of which has 3D V-Cache \u2013 and sometimes a thread for a running game might be shoved over to the second chiplet, causing some latency. This didn\u2019t happen with the 7800X3D as it only has one CCD).\n\nYou don\u2019t really need to get into the technical weeds here, though \u2013 all you really need to know is what AMD is serving up as a headline here. If you\u2019re gaming, the Ryzen 9800X3D is the CPU for you, purely because it\u2019ll be much more affordable, and gives you about the same performance with PC games as the Ryzen 9950X3D.\n\nHowever, if you need the best all-round performance, for heavyweight apps as well as gaming, then the Ryzen 9 X3D models are for you. Yes, you\u2019ll pay the price for them no doubt, but it\u2019s likely those initially towering MSRPs will come down considerably as time passes (as happened with the Ryzen 7950X3D).\n\nThe other point to consider is right now, the Ryzen 9800X3D remains difficult to find (at or near its MSRP), as it\u2019s very popular. So some PC gamers might look at the new Ryzen 9 3D V-Cache processors when they arrive just so they can pull the trigger on an X3D purchase for their new gaming PC (or upgrade). Depending on where pricing shakes out \u2013 as noted, the last-gen flagship\u2019s 55% premium over the Ryzen 7 model represented a pretty steep ask.\n\nVia Tom\u2019s Hardware",

However, AMD's Product and Business Development Manager Martijn Boonstra claims that the 9950X3D & 9900X3D won't feature much of a difference in gaming performance, citing the difference in core/thread utilization in titles out there.\n\nNew chips will provide similar overall gaming performance to the 9800X3D. There will be some games that perform a bit better (if the game engine utilizes more cores and threads), and some games will perform a little worse (if the game engine favors a 1CCD configuration), but on the whole, the experience is comparable. - AMD via VideoGamer\n\nWell, this is indeed a subjective statement, given that the upcoming 3D V-Cache CPUs will outperform the 9800X3D in scenarios where there's a need for higher core utilization, but however, modern-day titles work perfectly fine with an eight-core environment, which is why it is claimed that for a majority of users, switching from the 9800X3D to the newer 9950X3D & 9900X3D CPUs won't be benefiting at all. And because 3D V-Cache configurations mostly favor gamers, it would be interesting to see how the upcoming X3D CPUs perform in the market.\n\nIn terms of specifications, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D features 16 cores and 32 threads with two CCDs and a single IO die, offering up to 144 MB of total cache. That's 64 MB from the Zen 5 CCDs and 64 MB from the X3D stack. The Ryzen 9 9900X3D CPU has a 12-core/24 threads configuration, offering a total cache of up to 140 MB. The extra cores on the newer models will help bring performance differences from the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, but that might not be too visible in gaming workloads.\n\nThe Ryzen 7 9800X3D has gained massive sales traction in the markets, not just due to its gaming performance, but Intel's disappointing ARL-S launch has played an enormous part in it. It has reached the point that major retailers have run out of stock, and individuals are selling the X3D CPU at inflated prices. Whether or not the upcoming 9950X3D and 9900X3D CPUs will see a similar reception is the question for the future, but the release will help in distributing the demand for 3D V-Cache processors on the market.",

There will be some games that perform a bit better (if the game engine utilizes more cores and threads), and some games will perform a little worse (if the game engine favors a 1CCD configuration), but on the whole, the experience is comparable\".\n\nHe continued, adding: \"Ryzen 9000X3D Series desktop processors are perfect for gamers and content creators alike. Whether you are already on the AM5 platform, on AM4 or another platform, these products are sure to impress\".\n\nIf you're working on tasks that require more CPU cores, then the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D will be a better choice over the 9800X3D, while having fantastic gaming performance that won't have you wondering if you should've gone with the 9800X3D. 3D V-Cache favors gaming more anyway, but professional and content creation workloads will favor the higher core and thread count on the 9950X3D and 9900X3D.\n\nAMD's new Ryzen 9 9950X3D will feature a whopping 16 cores and 32 threads at up to 5.7GHz, while the 9900X3D will have 12 cores and 24 threads at up to 5.5GHz.

            "content": "With all the mobile hardware platforms released at the beginning of this year, I\u2019m sure many of you are wondering what\u2019s what, so I\u2019m putting together a few articles explaining the latest AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm hardware available in laptops this year.\n\nThis first article covers the AMD hardware launched in 2025, as well as the AMD Strix Point platform launched in 2024, as that is still very much relevant today in many excellent devices, some brand new for 2025.\n\nThe platforms we\u2019re discussing further down are the following:\n\nAMD Strix Halo (Ryzen AI 300 Max) \u2013 a performance platform with a powerful processor and a massive iGPU, meant to be implemented in enthusiast laptops without a dGPU;\n\n\u2013 a performance platform with a powerful processor and a massive iGPU, meant to be implemented in enthusiast laptops without a dGPU; AMD Fire Range (Ryzen 9000 HX) \u2013 a high-performance enthusiast platform meant for full-size notebooks, paired with a dGPU;\n\n\u2013 a high-performance enthusiast platform meant for full-size notebooks, paired with a dGPU; AMD Strix Point (Ryzen AI 9 300) \u2013 a mid-level platform with decent CPU/iGPU specs, mostly meant for ultraportables and premium all-around laptops;\n\n\u2013 a mid-level platform with decent CPU/iGPU specs, mostly meant for ultraportables and premium all-around laptops; AMD Krackan Point (Ryzen AI 7/5 300) \u2013 a lower-tier variation of Strix Point, with more limited CPU/iGPU specs, meant for either mid-range portable designs or affordable full-size laptops;\n\n\u2013 a lower-tier variation of Strix Point, with more limited CPU/iGPU specs, meant for either mid-range portable designs or affordable full-size laptops; AMD Hawk Point Refresh (Ryzen 200) \u2013 rebadge of the previous Hawk Point platform, with previous-gen CPU/iGPU specs, mostly meant for affordable devices;\n\n\u2013 rebadge of the previous Hawk Point platform, with previous-gen CPU/iGPU specs, mostly meant for affordable devices; AMD Bold Eagle Point (Ryzen AI 400) \u2013 to be updated \u2013 coming later in the year, a refresh of Strix Point with Z5/Z5c cores and RDNA3.5 graphics, but supposedly SLC memory.\n\nAMD Strix Halo \u2013 Ryzen AI 300 Max+, Max, and Max Pro\n\nIn a few words, the Strix Halo platform includes APUs with a powerful CPU and a massive iGPU, both built on AMD\u2019s latest technology.\n\nThe available SKUs include a processor with up to 16 Zen5 Cores and 32 Threads, alongside a Radeon iGPU with up to 40 RDNA 3.5 Graphics Cores. For comparison, the fastest AMD Strix Point Ryzen AI 9 370 HX APU includes 4x Zen5 Cores and 8x Zen5c Cores with 24 Threads, and a Radeon 890M iGPU with 16 RDNA 3.5 Compute Units.\n\nHowever, Strix Point processors are mostly paired with some sort of Nvidia dGPU in most available laptops, while the Strix Halo hardware is designed to run on its own, without a dGPU. That\u2019s the whole point of that massive 40Cores integrated graphics chip.\n\nAMD offers quite a wide range of APUs in this lineup, though, with a 1x to 2.5x performance gap between the bottom and top-tier SKUs. They also offer a consumer Ryzen AI Max series of APUs, as well as a Ryzen AI Max Pro subseries meant for business and workstation laptops, with a couple of extra features required in professional environments.\n\nSo here are the available AMD Strix Halo SKUs:\n\nAMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 (and Pro 395): CPU \u2013 16Cores (Zen5), 32Threads, up to 5.1 GHz, 80 MB cache; GPU \u2013 Radeon 8060S, 40 CUs, up to 2.9 GHz;\n\nAMD Ryzen AI Max 390 (and Pro 39): CPU \u2013 12Cores (Zen5), 24Threads, up to 4.9 GHz, 76 MB cache; GPU \u2013 Radeon 8050S, 32 CUs, up to 2.8 GHz;\n\nAMD Ryzen AI Max+ 385 (and Pro 385): CPU \u2013 8Cores (Zen5), 16Threads, up to 5.1 GHz, 40 MB cache; GPU \u2013 Radeon 8050S, 32 CUs, up to 2.8 GHz;\n\nAMD Ryzen AI Max+ 380 (and Pro 380): CPU \u2013 6Cores (Zen5), 12Threads, up to 5.1 GHz, 22 MB cache; GPU \u2013 Radeon 8040S, 16 CUs, up to 2.8 GHz.\n\nThe flagship AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 comes with 16Cores/32 Threads running at up to 5.1 GHz max boost, alongside 80 MB of Cache memory and an XDNA2 NPU that goes up to 50 TOPS. This is one of the most powerful processors currently available in the mobile space, with early rumors suggesting benchmark scores of around 19k points in Geekbench 6. That\u2019s on par with AMD Ryzen HX or Intel Core HX implementations, and those are generally found in full-size notebooks with higher sustained TDP settings.\n\nOn the GPU side, the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 comes with 40 RDNA 3.5 compute cores as part of the Radeon 8060S iGPU.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about this SKU is the variable TDP recommendation between 45-120W, suggesting a wide range of potential power settings between implementations. I\u2019d expect this APU to be mostly found in higher-performance chassis or enthusiast compact devices (such as the ROG Flow Z13), and even if you might be able to configure this in some portable notebooks (especially in the business segment, like the HP ZBook Ultra 14), I\u2019d keep my expectations of sustained performance realistic, as this will perform a lot differently at 45W than at 100+W.\n\nThe other SKUs scale down in CPU and GPU Cores. The Ryzen AI Max 385 in particular is an interesting middle-grounder, with an 8C/16T processor, 32 CUs on the Radeon 8050S GPU. I hope we\u2019re going to see this implemented in a handful of competitive laptops.\n\nVery few Strix Halo units have been announced so far (Asus Flow Z13, HP ZBook Ultra 14), and we\u2019ve compiled a dedicated article on AMD Strix Halo laptops over here.\n\nAMD Fire Range HX \u2013 Ryzen 9 900oHX and HX3D\n\nFire Range follows up on AMD\u2019s Dragon Range as their high-performance enthusiast platform, meant for full-size full-power gaming/work laptops. You\u2019re mostly getting a big processor here, with a measly iGPU on the side, which hardly matters for anything as this hardware is always offered alongside dGPUs, most from Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell RTX 5000 series.\n\nThe available SKUs include either a processor with 16 Zen5 Cores and 32 Threads, or a lower-tier variant with 12 Cores and 24 Threads. The top SKU implements AMD\u2019s 3D V-Cache technology, for a boost in gaming performance.\n\nHere are the available Fire Range SKUs:\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9955HX3D: CPU \u2013 16Cores (Zen5), 32Threads, up to 5.4 GHz max boost, 144 MB cache with X3D memory;\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9955HX: CPU \u2013 16Cores (Zen5), 32Threads, up to 5.4 GHz max boost, 80 MB cache;\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9850HX: CPU \u2013 12Cores (Zen5), 24Threads, up to 5.2 GHz max boost, 72 MB cache.\n\nNow, as far as performance goes, I wouldn\u2019t expect significant gains compared to the previous Dragon Range Ryzen 9 7945HX3D or 7945HX, at least based on the little we know so far from the desktop side of Zen5-based platforms. Nonetheless, this is still gong to be the fastest mobile platform of this generation, and we should see efficiency gains as well, for what that\u2019s worth on this sort of platform.\n\nWhat I do hope for is wider adoption of this hardware into actual laptops. At the beginning of 2025, the offer is still very limited, with only some mid-range SKUs announced so far (Asus ROG Strix G, Lenovo Pro 5) and very few configurations that actually pair the AMD platform with higher-tier modern graphics, such as the MSI Vector A18 HX that can be specced up to a Ryzen 9 9955HX with a GeForce RTX 5080 GPU. But most other only go up to an RTX 5070 for some reason, including the Strix G which is the only model touted with the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D processor (for now).\n\nI\u2019ve put together a dedicated separate article list on all available notebooks with AMD Fire Range Ryzen 9 HX hardware.\n\nAMD Strix Point \u2013 Ryzen 9 AI 300\n\nThis hardware was released mid-2024 and is already available in a multitude of notebooks, either portable chassis that are built entirely on the AMD hardware, or premium all-rounders that pair the AMD processor with dedicated graphics. However, a handful of brand new SKUs were released in 2025 as well.\n\nWe\u2019ve already covered Strix Point in multiple articles and reviews, so I\u2019m not getting in-depth about it here.\n\nIt\u2019s important to know that Strix Point is a hybrid APU design, bundling a versatile processor with Zen5 and Zen5c efficient cores alongside a Radeon iGPU with up to 16 RDNA 3.5 graphics cores. That\u2019s a competent combo for a multi-use portable chassis, allowing it to tackle media creation and even light gaming. But the most interesting Strix Point implementations are premium all-rounders such as the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, Zephyrus G16, or the Razer Blade 16, as well as a bunch of micro-computers from GPD. They\u2019re all listed and discussed in this article.\n\nAnyway, here are the most widespread available Strix Point SKUs:\n\nAMD Ryzen AI 9 370 HX: CPU \u2013 12Cores (4x Zen5, 8xZen5c), 24Threads, up to 5.1 GHz, 36 MB cache; GPU \u2013 Radeon 890M, 16 CUs, up to 2.9 GHz;\n\nAMD Ryzen AI 9 365: CPU \u2013 10Cores (4x Zen5, 6xZen5c), 20Threads, up to 5 GHz, 34 MB cache; GPU \u2013 Radeon 880M, 12 CUs, up to 2.9 GHz.\n\nAMD Krackan Point \u2013 Ryzen AI 7/5 300\n\nWhile Strix Point only includes Ryzen AI 9 premium-tier APUs that are implemented in higher-tier and quite expensive laptops, Krackan Point is the continuation of the series with mid-tier Ryzen AI 7 and Ryzen AI 5 APUs, and is implemented in a wider range of products.\n\nKrackan Point and Strix Point are built on the same fundaments, with a mix of Zen5 and Zen5c processor cores, RDNA3.5 graphics cores, and an XDNA2 NPU. But Krackan Point platforms just offer less of everything.\n\nHere are the available Krackan Point SKUs:\n\nAMD Ryzen AI 7 350 (and Pro 350): CPU \u2013 8Cores(4x Zen5, 4xZen5c), 16Threads, up to 5.0 GHz, 24 MB cache; GPU \u2013 Radeon 860M, 8 CUs, up to 3.0 GHz;\n\nAMD Ryzen AI 5 340 (and Pro 340): CPU \u2013 6Cores(3x Zen5, 3xZen5c), 12Threads, up to 4.8 GHz, 22 MB cache; GPU \u2013 Radeon 840M, 4 CUs, up to 2.9 GHz.\n\nWhile the CPU performance of these APUs is still fine for multitasking and daily use, the GPU is significantly downgraded from the Radeon iGPUs in the Strix processors, with 8 Compute Units on the Ryzen AI 7 and merely 4 Compute Units on the Ryzen AI 5. You better no expect much in graphics capabilities if you decide on a Ryzen AI 5 340 configuration.\n\nOn the other hand, laptops built on Krackan Point hardware target a mid-range price range of 600-1000 USD, whereas Strix Point laptops were rarely available even on occasional discounts. Many of you are shopping in that price range, so at least now you get the option of a modern platform with solid day-to-day capabilities and long runtimes on battery, alongside those previous-gen platforms that aren\u2019t as efficient, but could offer better performance for the money.\n\nHere\u2019s a dedicated separate article on available AMD Krackan Point laptops and thoughts on their general performance.\n\nAMD Hawk Point Refresh \u2013 Ryzen 200\n\nAs the name suggests, Hawk Point Refresh is a rebadge of the existing Ryzen 8000 H/HS Hawk Point platform, which on its own was a rebadge of the Ryzen 7000 H/HS Phoenix platform.\n\nThe APUs part of this renamed Hawk Point series are rebranded as Ryzen 200, which is rather confusing as the naming might suggest similarities to the Ryzen AI 300 chips. However, Ryzen 200 APUs are still built on older AMD technology, with Zen4 and Zen4c cores and Radeon iGPUs with RDNA 3 graphics cores. I\u2019m not bashing the technology, which is still competent even today for the kind of mid-range and affordable notebooks that will implement this Ryzen 200 hardware, I\u2019m just pointing out of the potential naming confusion, just to make sure you understand what you\u2019re buying with this hardware.\n\nOne positive aspect about this refresh is that we already know what to expect in overall capabilities and performance by looking at reviews of their predecessors. For instance, the new Ryzen 9 270 is a rebadged Ryzen 9 8945HS, the Ryzen 7 250 is a rebadged Ryzen 7 8845HS, while the Ryzen 5 250 is a rebadge of the Ryzen 5 8645HS. You\u2019ll find plenty of info on those online.\n\nAnyway, here are the Hawk Point Refresh SKUs that will be mostly available in actual products, with the complete list detailed in the image further down:\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 270: CPU \u2013 8Cores(8x Zen4), 16Threads, up to 5.2 GHz, 24 MB cache; GPU \u2013 Radeon 780M, 12 CUs, up to 2.8 GHz;\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 250: CPU \u2013 8Cores(8x Zen4), 16Threads, up to 5.1 GHz, 24 MB cache; GPU \u2013 Radeon 780M, 12 CUs, up to 2.8 GHz;\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 250: CPU \u2013 6Cores(4x Zen4), 12Threads, up to 5 GHz, 22 MB cache; GPU \u2013 Radeon 760M, 8 CUs, up to 2.6 GHz;\n\nAMD Ryzen 3 210: CPU \u2013 4Cores(1x Zen4 3x Zen4c), 8Threads, up to 5 GHz, 22 MB cache; GPU \u2013 Radeon 740M, 4 CUs, up to 2.5 GHz;\n\nYou should generally expect to find this Ryzen 200 hardware in entry-level configurations of portable designs or affordable mid-sized laptops, sometimes paired with entry-level dGPUs. However, unless you\u2019re particularly interested in a new 2025 chassis, I\u2019d look into existing 2023/2024 Hawk Point configurations first, as those are basically the same hardware and will most likely sell at discounts.\n\nI might put up a detailed list of laptops built on AMD Ryzen 200 hardware in a separate article, if there\u2019s enough interest.\n\nThat\u2019s about it for now, but look for updates in the future, as new AMD mobile platforms are released.\n\nIn the meantime, looking for your thoughts and feedback on all this 2025 hardware. Strix Halo is especially interesting to me this year, and I look forward to getting my hands on devices built on this hardware.",

Once regarded as the leading contender to chip away at Nvidia\u2019s dominance in the AI chip market, its potential to make a substantial impact has diminished.\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving strong buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nThis is a point picked up by Barclays analyst Thomas O\u2019Malley, who explains the factors contributing to AMD\u2019s struggles.\n\n\u201cThanks to NVDA\u2019s system-level architecture expertise, software/application moat, and networking dominance, as well as the rise of hyperscale custom ASICs, AMD\u2019s DC GPU prospects don\u2019t appear as bright as once expected this time last year,\u201d O\u2019Malley opined.\n\nThat said, due to the ongoing surge in AI investment, O\u2019Malley believes AMD should comfortably achieve year-over-year growth of a few billion dollars for its MI series accelerators, believing that investor expectations have \u201ccome down to that ballpark as well.\u201d\n\nHowever, O\u2019Malley also makes the case that AMD won\u2019t probably have any substantial opportunities to compete for additional market share until the \u201carchitectural expertise\u201d gained from the ZT Systems acquisition is integrated into its roadmap and the considerable software gap with NVIDIA is \u201cmaterially lessened.\u201d\n\nWhile AI has become the focal point, it is not the be-all and end-all. O\u2019Malley also highlights AMD\u2019s ongoing market share gains in the x86 PC and server segments as \u201canother reason to like the name here.\u201d The analyst anticipates AMD will further expand its share in 2025, supported by an impressive PC and server CPU roadmap, while Intel continues to grapple with structural challenges in its internal processes. O\u2019Malley expects AMD\u2019s Client business to outpace Intel\u2019s by 7% in 2025 and 6% in 2026. Similarly, he sees AMD\u2019s Server CPU business surpassing Intel\u2019s by 10% in 2025 and 6% in 2026.\n\nWith sentiment so downbeat, O\u2019Malley notes that \u201crecent trading performance places AMD at a steep discount to other accelerator-exposed names.\u201d In fact, O\u2019Malley also points out that despite AMD holding the third-largest AI compute revenue base currently, the company trades at a valuation comparable to Intel based on his 2026 forecasts, which already factor in over $10 billion in DC GPU revenue for that year. O\u2019Malley\u2019s insights on this matter are quite illuminating.\n\n\u201cClearly the concern here is that 2025 could be flat, and at that rate 2026 is surely not doubling Y/Y, but we would make the point here that valuation implies that expectations for a more challenged path forward in AI are already in the stock, and the name undoubtedly deserves more credit than peers with far less AI exposure,\u201d the analyst explained.\n\nWhat does this mean for investors? O\u2019Malley gives AMD stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, with a $140 price target suggesting a potential 12% gain in the coming months. (To watch O\u2019Malley\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThe consensus price target reflects greater optimism, standing at $172.24, which suggests a potential one-year return of ~39%. The overall consensus is based on 21 Buy ratings, 10 Hold ratings, and just 1 Sell, leading to a Moderate Buy recommendation.

It had nothing to do with what was available at the time for me to review, either; Taiwan-based MSI has long partnered with Intel for processors.\n\nEven when MSI started using chips from AMD \u2014 the Intel competitor less than two miles away in Santa Clara, California in its gaming laptops \u2014 many of MSI laptops still only came with an Intel option.\n\nBut this year at CES in Las Vegas, an AMD chip was listed on nearly every one of the little display cards that sat next to new MSI laptops.\n\nThis was a huge departure from what MSI has done in the past \u2014 and maybe a sign that Intel may be up for a fight if it wants to continue its domination of the mobile gaming space.\n\n\u201cThe [AMD] X3D solution largely benefits gamers, so we brought the technology to our gaming flagship Raider series.\u201d \u2014 An MSI rep to Laptop Mag on why AMD chips are coming to MSI laptops\n\nMSI reps tell Laptop Mag via email it still considers Intel \u201cthe leader in the professional industry,\u201d but now that AMD has expanded its mobile chip catalog, MSI wanted to give more options to different types of users.\n\nThe popular AMD Ryzen X3D processor, which can produce higher frame rates and smoother game play for demanding AAA games, is one example of an AMD chip that MSI wanted to utilize in its laptops.\n\n\u201cThe X3D solution largely benefits gamers, so we brought the technology to our gaming flagship Raider series.\u201d\n\nStay in the know with Laptop Mag Get our in-depth reviews, helpful tips, great deals, and the biggest news stories delivered to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nMSI went beyond its Raider laptop series this year at CES, announcing the following new configurations (in addition to Intel options):\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9955HX3D for the Raider\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9955HX for the Vector\n\nAMD Ryzen AI 7 350 for the Pulse\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 8945HX for the Crosshair\n\nOf course, none of those AMD Ryzen chips were around at CES last year. MSI debuted new Raider , Vector, Pulse, and Crosshair gaming laptops with Intel 14th-gen or Core Ultra processors \u2014 though the company released an AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX3D version of its Raider gaming laptop later in 2024.\n\nThe MSI Cyborg gaming laptop at CES 2025. The laptop, which used to only come with an Intel chip, debuted with an option for up to an AMD Ryzen 7 260 chip. (Image credit: Future)\n\nStill, the AMD Ryzen 8000 series existed last year, yet MSI did not include that configuration in its Crosshair gaming laptop or any of its higher-tier gaming options. Its nostalgic '90s budget Cyborg launched with only an Intel option last year , but this year it will feature up to an AMD Ryzen 7 260 chip.\n\nThe new Katana gaming laptop is listed with either an AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS option or the new Intel Arrow Lake processor this year at CES, too. The Stealth is also getting a boost to an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 (up from the Ryzen AI 9 365 version Laptop reviewed in November 2024).\n\nThe only gaming laptop without an AMD option is the Titan 18 HX Dragon Edition Norse Myth. As MSI tells Laptop Mag, the Dragon Edition is a special edition laptop that will be available in limited quantities.\n\nAMD in MSI laptops is a huge win for gamers\n\nThis many AMD configurations is a huge win for gamers. Anyone who might have wanted an MSI gaming laptop but opted not to buy one because it didn\u2019t come with an AMD chip can now include MSI in their decision process. From high-end to budget options, there\u2019s a configuration for almost anyone. There\u2019s no shortage of choices. But it also feels like there is a rift between gaming laptop makers and Intel, one that perhaps has been growing for a while, and we\u2019re just now starting to see its width.\n\nBetween AMD making significant leaps in mobile gaming and Intel tripping over hurdles (remember the great 14nm saga of 2021 ?), a tug-of-war between the two chipmakers has been playing out in yearly laptop announcements. My own memories stretch back to MSI\u2019s budget-priced Bravo 15 (2020) , but the company has been working with AMD since before it released that laptop \u2014 yet it\u2019s been slower to adopt a full slate of AMD-powered products, as we\u2019ve seen from past announcements.\n\nNow that MSI has gone the whole hog with AMD configurations, it will be the company to watch once gaming laptop reviews start flowing \u2014 not just for the quality of those products, but how they compare to their Intel counterparts.",

It\u2019s widely believed that the GPU will operate in the same price and performance brackets as Nvidia\u2019s upcoming RTX 5070, and RTX 5070 Ti, which launch in February.\n\nDespite this, reports indicate that stock of the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT have already landed at retailers and are already in the hands of reviewers and critics, with outlet eTeknix confirming it has received review samples of the upcoming graphics cards.\n\nPlay\n\nThe entire scenario raises more than a few eyebrows, sparking speculation that AMD delayed the official launch to directly respond to competition from Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5070 and 5070 Ti and allowing the company to directly compare Team Green\u2019s new GPUs to its new products. It\u2019s also speculated that pricing pressure from Nvidia has caused AMD to delay the official release of the RX 9070 lineup.\n\nWith details of the new AMD graphics cards as scarce as they are, the RX 9070 lineup launch messaging has been messy and confusing. A report from June 2024 indicates that Nvidia currently holds 88% of the total discrete GPU market, with AMD sitting at just 12%.\n\nWith no other company challenging Nvidia at the mid-range or high-end of the consumer graphics card market, AMD needs to play its cards right to chip away at Nvidia\u2019s staggering market dominance.\n\nFor more on the subject, dive into our AMD vs. Nvidia comparison or check out what AMD GPUs are currently available.\n\nSayem is a freelancer based in the UK, covering tech & hardware.

AMD's David McAfee posted on X that the new GPUs will officially go on sale in March.\n\nThe VP and GM of AMD also stated that gamers could expect a \"wide assortment of cards\" to be available globally. AMD's software solution for the Radeon 9000 series is also purportedly \"looking great,\" so we should expect launch day and review day drivers to be stable.\n\nRadeon 9000 series hardware and software are looking great and we are planning to have a wide assortment of cards available globally. Can\u2019t wait for gamers to get their hands on the cards when they go on sale in March!January 20, 2025\n\nThe RX 9000 series was officially announced during CES 2025, featuring the Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT. AMD purposefully kept most of the GPU specs hidden but confirmed that the new GPU lineup will run on AMD's next-generation RDNA 4 architecture, which is built on TSMC's 4nm process and features 2nd gen AI accelerators, 3rd gen ray tracing accelerators and a 2nd generation radiance display engine.\n\nDespite not revealing the RX 9070 series during its CES 2025 presentation, AMD's board partners showed off a plethora of graphics card models based on the upcoming RX 9070 series, giving us a sneak peek at what these new GPUs will look like. All of the AIB-partner cards shown came with triple-fan cooling solutions, with most sporting a triple 8-pin power connector design, hinting that AMD will be ditching the new 16-pin 12V-2x6 power connector for another generation. Though there might be some exceptions, ASRock's RX 7900 XTX WS GPU takes advantage of the 12V-2x6 power connector, so we can't rule out the same behavior repeating itself with the RX 9000 series.\n\nThe new GPUs are officially focused on the mid-range GPU market. AMD confirmed in a slide interpreting the GPU's new numbering scheme that the RX 9070 series would be a direct successor to the RX 7900 XT/GRE and the RX 7800 XT, as well as direct competitors to the RTX 4070 series (in general). As a result, it is expected that Nvidia's new RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti will be the primary competition of the RX 9070 series.\n\nAfter CES, we saw new rumors suggesting that the RX 9070 XT has 4,096 cores, 64 CUs, and 16GB of VRAM. The RX 9070 likewise has 3,584 cores, 56 CUs, and 16GB, with both GPUs operating on a 256-bit interface and utilizing GDDR6 memory. Take these details with a grain of salt, but this close to launch it is likely that these specs could be close to the real deal. IGN has already confirmed that the RX 9070 has 16GB of VRAM.",

            "content": "Overview\n\nThe used AMD Ryzen 9800X3D and MSI MAG X870 Tomahawk WiFi motherboard we purchased are heavily damaged and likely totally dead. We bought them from the Reddit user, who posted it to r/pcmasterrace after the incident.\n\nThe user said this:\n\n\u201cI built a new PC last night, and I couldn't figure out why it wouldn't POST. When checking for bent pins, I found that it killed itself. :(\u201c\n\nThe situation immediately reminded us of the 7800X3D failures following its launch. Since that came down to a fix in the motherboard BIOS, other users naturally started asking questions. When asked about BIOS, the user said:\n\n\u201cI don't know what the BIOS rev. was because it never worked, unfortunately. It has whatever BIOS it shipped with.\n\nIt burned up before I ever entered the BIOS. The socket was brand new when I put the chip in, no bent pins or anything.\n\nEdit: Since people have many theories about pins being bent, here are some more photos: https://imgur.com/a/b5x4BVh\n\nThe plastic is melted and I think this deformed them. It's a chicken or egg thing.\n\nThis was not watercooled and there was no water around this PC.\n\nI don't see any stickers with the BIOS rev on it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above images are some photos the user provided. As you can see, it\u2019s bad. But we have our own evidence and microscope shots to get into because the Reddit user was willing to sell us the components.\n\nThe root cause last time, back with the 7800X3D, mainly came down to excessive voltage over an extended period of time, possibly in conjunction with poor internal thermal protections, and motherboard overcurrent protection (OCP) being set way too high. This led to dielectric layer breakdown at the transistor level in a runaway failure state, causing shorts and internal temperatures hitting the point of melting silicon.\n\nIn simple terms, too big zap force make CPU go boom.\n\nUltimately, the issue was fixed via BIOS updates leveraging stricter controls around VSOC, as handed down from AMD to the board manufacturers.\n\nBut this new failure likely isn\u2019t the same.\n\nA lot of the internet pointed toward some potential user-caused damage from improper installation. We had some tell us not to buy the part as they were worried we\u2019d be paying for someone\u2019s mistake. While we really appreciate the concern, it\u2019s the audience that puts us in a position to be able to afford to buy out catastrophic failures like this when they happen. We view it as part of the business: If there\u2019s a chance of something educational coming out of it, we want to be there to learn it. Worst case, some guy installed his CPU wrong and he gets helped out, never makes the mistake again, and we all get some cool shots of a crazy failure.\n\nBest case: You never know when someone has discovered the next massive failure that could affect thousands of users in an anti-consumer cascade, like Intel\u2019s instability, and it\u2019s important for us to treat all of these events seriously and get the parts before they disappear into the hands of manufacturers with motive and opportunity to hide the results. Third-party investigation is important to transparency.\n\nSo, that\u2019s why we\u2019re OK with spending money on something that unveils nothing every now and then, because every time it unveils something important, we can help keep a company honest. And when it doesn\u2019t, someone at least got a bailout.\n\nLet\u2019s get into the damage report.\n\nDamage Report\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bottom of the 9800X3D (read our review) has two major burn sites with discoloration, charring, a hardened, enamel-like substance, and individual points of concentrated scorching where the tips of the LGA socket pins were located. Also, it smells bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe motherboard\u2019s socket has damaged areas directly matching the pattern from the bottom of the CPU. The pins themselves are slightly bent out of alignment and discolored, with a few showing an intense bluing as seen on heat-treated metal. Solder from under the socket flowed up onto some of the pins, and the bed of plastic is scorched, appearing molten. There\u2019s also one pin near the bottom that\u2019s badly bent over, without visible burn marks. It, too, smells bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plastic edge of the socket is damaged in two major locations. The bottom left corner shows marring along a slight angle on both the left and bottom borders of the socket area. Along the bottom edge, the plastic alignment pin is clearly misshapen, appearing crushed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving to the bottom of the socket actuation mechanism (SAM, as AMD calls it, also known as ILM in Intel-speak), the hole in the base shows two points of physical wear accompanied by discoloration on the PCB itself. This area differs in design between the AM5 socket manufactured by Foxconn, which this is, and the other AM5 socket, made by Lotes. We\u2019ll get into that later.\n\nA final sign of damage is a missing chunk of plastic between pins 3 and 4 on the ATX 24-pin header, which we wouldn\u2019t have expected.\n\nIn technical terms, this board is f***ed up.\n\nWe haven\u2019t observed any damage to the back side of the board underneath the socket or anywhere else. That includes the top part of the SAM, which some people thought looked bent in the user\u2019s photos. It is not bent. That may have been lighting and those users are incorrect.\n\nThe CPU and motherboard are irreversibly and catastrophically damaged.\n\nKnowing all of the aftermath, we need some testimony.\n\nOther key pieces of first-hand testimony from the Reddit user include the following:\n\nIn reference to the pins, the user said, \u201cThey were definitely not bent prior to installing the CPU. The CPU is bulging where it's burnt and the mobo socket is slightly melted.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if all power cables were plugged in, the user replied, \u201cYes everything was in place. I checked all connections when it wouldn't post and everything was fine. Nothing was in the socket when I put the chip in. That was the first time it was ever opened.\n\nI did not update BIOS prior to trying to boot.\u201d\n\nThis is about the time we stepped in, offering to purchase the parts from the user for their full retail price.\n\nHypothesis\n\nGrab a GN Soldering & Project Mat for a high-quality work surface with extreme heat resistance. These purchases directly fund our operation, including our build-out of the hemi-anechoic chamber for our acoustic testing! (or consider a direct donation or a Patreon contribution!)\n\nMoving on to our hypothesis, we thought that the cause of this failure was a dead short to ground, and not an inherent flaw in the CPU or the motherboard BIOS.\n\nWe thought this could have happened two ways and kept an open mind.\n\nOption one would be a defect in the socket or the motherboard as a whole \u2013 manufacturers can always screw up. If the factory misaligned the socket in relation to the underlying PCB, or damaged the plastic surround of the socket, then it could have led to misalignment and a short.\n\nOption two is improper installation. If the user installed the CPU into the motherboard in such a way that caused the outer socket damage and misalignment of the CPU in relation to the socket pins, then that would be sufficient to cause a short as well.\n\nDetailed Support and Evidence\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the issue was caused by something else we can\u2019t account for, but given the evidence we have, we believe that improper installation is the most likely cause.\n\nNow for the details and evidence to support our hypothesis.\n\nThe CPU appears to have been installed with an offset within the socket by ~1.01mm diagonally to the left and down at the bottom edge where the socket\u2019s lower guide pin is. This is enough to cause the pins to mate with the wrong pads.\n\nTo determine this, Jeremy on our team took a measurement based on converting the known width of the guide pin (1.3mm) and then pixel measuring the microscope shots by pixel counting.\n\nIt took a while. There\u2019s a lot of pixels.\n\nThis got us the distance between where the CPU\u2019s guide cutout is supposed to sit versus where the plastic is crushed on the guide pin, then we converted it to millimeters. It\u2019s not exact, but it\u2019s very close, and establishes the basis of our hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is generally supported by the marred edge of the socket at the bottom left, and possibly faint rounding off along almost the entire bottom interior edge. This would also result in the bottom edge of the CPU being raised away from the socket in the Z-axis, adding light or poor pin-to-pad contact into the mix, i.e., higher resistance.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking a closer look at the bottom of the CPU shows that it was rotated by 1.0-1.4\u00b0 clockwise, relative to the socket, when the burn occurred. This is based on the pattern of pinpoint scorch marks left by the pins. We carefully inspected the burn marks on the pads where you can see the point of contact, which is evident not only from the natural scratches caused by contact, but by the residue surrounding the burn sites. They should contact the pins in parallel rows, but the marks clearly show an angle. As you go along the pins, you see it diverging. Measuring in software, we came to the 1-1.4 degree offset.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the burned pins in the socket shows that all of them are VDDCR (core voltage) pins that are down and/or left of VSS (ground) pins. If the CPU was shifted down and left in relation to the socket, then the burned VDDCR pins would have been in contact with VSS pads on the CPU, causing a catastrophic short circuit.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact that the top row of pins in the bottom half of the socket has no burns at all supports this, as those pins would have been in contact with the CPU substrate, not any pads. There\u2019s nothing else conductive to touch in that direction until you get across the gap to the upper field of pads.\n\nThat said, not all VDDCR pins that were nearby to ground got burned. We can speculate on a few reasons for this.\n\nThe skewed angle of the CPU in the Z-axis and the unknown pivot point would make the offset inconsistent across the 2D plane of pins. Also, it\u2019s possible that some pads on the single-CCD 9800X3D are not connected internally.\n\nThe marring and discoloration where the tip of the SAM (or ILM) touches the motherboard PCB is less conclusive evidence as compared to the rest.\n\nBest case scenario, it\u2019s just physical wear unrelated to the burning incident. Worst case, it\u2019s a location where core voltage was able to find another path to ground and scorched the PCB.\n\nFinally, the SAM doesn\u2019t show any signs of damage or bending that we can detect. It\u2019s made of springy steel that readily returns to its original state after flexing \u2013 assuming it isn\u2019t pushed past elastic deformation into plastic deformation, or in other words, made to permanently bend.\n\nWe think the area suspected of damage in the user\u2019s photo is an optical illusion \u2013 a reflection or light shining through the top of the case.\n\nThrough all of this, we want to make it clear \u2013 the user shouldn\u2019t be bashed for this. This sort of thing can happen to anyone, and that\u2019s especially true with newer platforms. We\u2019re grateful that the user was willing to sell us the parts to inspect, because we had fun working through the diagnostic.\n\nWe\u2019ll use it as a learning opportunity.\n\nConcern about SAM/ILM Styles\n\nAll of this led to one observation that we hadn\u2019t realized before that we\u2019d like to briefly cover.\n\nWe have a new concern about the two different styles of AM5 socket by Foxconn and Lotes. Research on this piece led us to realize that there are actually a lot of differences between them, in ways that should mostly be immaterial to functionality.\n\nFor example, the Foxconn socket has solid pins and solid plastic, while the Lotes socket has split pins and a more skeletonized plastic molding.\n\nThe discoloration on the burned motherboard where the tip of the SAM touches down raises our concern in general, even outside the scope of this piece, because the metal comes in direct contact with the PCB, directly on top of surface-level traces.\n\nWe don\u2019t think this is what happened here, however: Repeated socket actuations could theoretically cause the SAM to abrade through the mask and create a short.\n\nThe Lotes version of the socket has the insulation sheet run across this entire hole, adding a barrier of mechanical protection.\n\nWe aren\u2019t saying that the Foxconn socket will have problems, just that we would like to see more conformity to a single style between vendors.\n\nWe took a brand-new sample of the same model X870 Tomahawk motherboard and repeatedly opened and shut the SAM 16 times with a CPU in the socket to see if this area of the board would show similar wear or any change at all.\n\nAt the beginning of the test, we saw some disturbance of the protective sheet on the left, and a small spot of what looked like adhesive on the right, surrounded by an extremely faint discoloration. At the end of the process, it looked virtually unchanged, and nothing like the burned motherboard.\n\nThis pushes us to think these spots were subjected to heat, or maybe a direct short as we mentioned before.\n\nConclusion\n\nVisit our Patreon page to contribute a few dollars toward this website's operation (or consider a direct donation or buying something from our GN Store!)

First of all, it was a lot of fun to piece together a mystery. It also allowed us to possibly learn something major as you never know when some random PC builder might encounter something like the next Intel instability issue, where it might initially be perceived as user error but then proves to be a big, valid issue.\n\nIn this case, this issue doesn\u2019t seem to be something for people to worry about, though users should pay attention to how they're installing their CPUs. It\u2019s possible that a situation like this could have happened if you tried to install the CPU with the motherboard oriented vertically. It\u2019s important to lay the system flat to install it properly and to be careful with where the guides are aligned. You can also slightly wiggle the CPU a bit once it\u2019s installed, but shouldn\u2019t do it hard, to see if there\u2019s something wrong.",

Can\u2019t wait for gamers to get their hands on the cards when they go on sale in March!January 20, 2025\n\nSo, the on-sale date for the initial RX 9070 XT and vanilla 9070 GPUs is March, which has put the cat among the GPU pigeons, to say the least, if you take a brief saunter through the replies on X (and other assorted feedback on Reddit).\n\nWhat\u2019s got folks annoyed? Well, firstly this is disappointing news based on the rumors that AMD was ready to launch these RX 9070 GPUs later in January to take the mid-range fight to Nvidia, getting in ahead of the release of RTX 5070 variants in February.\n\nOr at least that AMD was going to have a big reveal of RX 9070 graphics cards, possibly later this week, which surely won\u2019t happen now. There\u2019s no point having a big announcement late in January if these next-gen GPUs aren\u2019t turning up for what could be the best part of two months from now.\n\nPart of the problem is that a couple of AMD execs have been dropping hints that the RX 9070 announcement \u2018won\u2019t be long\u2019 and will be in the \u2018near future\u2019 which to me, and clearly others, suggested it\u2019s pretty imminent.\n\nGranted, all AMD has officially said is that RDNA 4 graphics cards will be launched in Q1 2025, and March still fits that, of course. But based on that timeframe, nothing about March marries with the hints of the full reveal being \u2018near\u2019 \u2013 indeed it couldn\u2019t really be any further away in this initial quarter of 2025.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

Never mind the theoretically delayed release date, or full reveal, beyond this, why even mention the GPUs at all at CES 2025? Or at least AMD could have made it clear with that teaser that these cards weren\u2019t imminent, which was very much the expectation. (Actually, most folks were, not unreasonably, expecting the full details and unveiling at CES, not a brief glimpse).\n\nWhatever the case, the underlying problem here is that it feels like AMD is bouncing around its RDNA 4 plans, changing directions and generally causing confusion among would-be buyers of the best GPUs as 2025 kicks off. Regardless of what the actual truth is concerning what might be going on behind closed doors at Team Red, based on what we can see, and the rumors flying around, it all feels very chaotic.\n\nWe must remember that these are just rumors, but there have been a lot of sightings of RX 9070 models in boxes, ready to go on shelves, at retailers. VideoCardz, which spotted AMD\u2019s post on X, further claims that reviewers have had sample RDNA 4 GPUs even before retailers had them shipped, and so we have all this info bubbling about, causing some bad feeling from gamers.\n\nIf stock really is in place now \u2013 as it appears to be, with a suitable handful of salt at the ready \u2013 why wait? This is where other chatter from behind the scenes comes into play about AMD having unfortunate problems with adjusting launch pricing, after being surprised by where Nvidia pitched its RTX 5070 models (which surprised us all, let\u2019s be honest). And issues therein in dealing with adjusting MSRPs and compensating retailers, although all of that is very much deep into rumor territory.\n\nThe trouble is, not a lot else except this scenario makes much sense, and the pieces of the puzzle (curtailed launch, then mostly radio silence following that, save for those mentioned vague hints of a full reveal \u2018soon\u2019) seem to fit well enough.\n\nThis also leaves AMD in a very weird position. Instead of being able to get in, ahead of the RTX 5070 which turns up in February, Team Red is going to wait until those rival mid-range graphics cards have been out, maybe for a month, so there could be a lot of defectors turning to Team Green. Well, assuming RTX 5070 stock isn\u2019t something of a washout, and that appears to be the main threat to douse Nvidia\u2019s next-gen GPU fire \u2013 that there\u2019ll only be a relative trickle of Blackwell graphics cards early in 2025.\n\nI didn\u2019t see the next-gen GPU wars panning out like this, that\u2019s for sure, and maybe AMD really does need to put out a full spec reveal and pricing announcement, sooner rather than later, even if the RDNA 4 on-sale date is March, and this leaves a big gap. Assuming that those MSRPs have even been decided yet, as this would at least allow gamers to know what to expect, perhaps persuading them to not give up and just go RTX 5070 in February, instead of waiting for the RX 9070 GPUs.\n\nHowever, already there are gamers saying that is forcing them away from a planned next-gen Radeon purchase to Nvidia Blackwell, though how much of that is an initial angry reaction, we shall have to see.",

Shares were down some 18% for the year, all the more surprising giving the overall bullish sentiment throughout the market (and for tech stocks in particular).\n\nAMD has yet to provide bulls with much cheer in 2025 either, with the stock trading sideways during the first few weeks of the new year. Will AMD be able to turn the tide during the rest of the year?\n\nDon\u2019t count on it, cautions investor Bohdan Kucheriavyi, who remains unconvinced that AMD will succeed in outperforming the market in 2025.\n\n\u201cAMD remains undervalued, but it\u2019s unlikely that its shares will be able to aggressively rebound to its all-time high levels in the foreseeable future,\u201d explains the 5-star investor.\n\nOf course, it is not all doom and gloom, continues Kucheriavyi. AMD delivered robust revenues of $6.82 billion in its last reportable quarter (Q3 2024), representing growth of 17.6% year-over-year. The investor acknowledges that this certainly seems to indicate strong demand for the company\u2019s AI chips.\n\nMajor hyperscalers clearly have confidence in AMD\u2019s products as well, adds Kucheriavyi, mentioning that both Microsoft and Meta are utilizing AMD\u2019s AI GPUs.\n\nAnd yet, there is a big elephant in the room, and its name is Nvidia. As Kucheriavyi states, AMD has simply not been able to emerge out from behind Nvidia\u2019s shadow.\n\n\u201cDespite a relatively good performance in recent quarters, AMD is still unable to take a significant portion of the AI GPU market from Nvidia,\u201d details the investor.\n\nMaking matters worse, says Kucheriavyi, some of AMD\u2019s customers are hard at work designing their own AI chips. If these hyperscalers were to successfully switch to their own hardware, the investor notes, this could mean even less opportunity for AMD to shine.\n\nUnable to justify a long position in AMD, Kucheriavyi is reiterating a Hold (i.e. Neutral) rating. (To watch Bohdan Kucheriavyi\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nWall Street, on the other hand, appears to think that AMD will perform quite well in 2025. With 21 Buy, 10 Hold, and 1 Sell ratings, AMD enjoys a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Its 12-month average price target of $172.24 would yield gains of over 40% in the year to come.

Can\u2019t wait for gamers to get their hands on the cards when they go on sale in March!January 20, 2025\n\nThe news comes from the X account of AMD's consumer CPU and GPU boss, David McAfee, who said, \"Radeon 9000 series hardware and software are looking great.\"\n\nAs we reported last week, these news RDNA 4-based GPUs didn't seem imminent following the launch that wasn't a launch at CES. What's more AMD's promise at the show that we'd see the 9070 and 9070 XT some time in Q1 allows for a launch right up to the end of March. So, it all makes sense.\n\nOf course, it does all still beg the question of why not sooner? After all, AMD's previous generation of GPUs, the Radeon RX 7000 cards, were out right at the end of 2022. The company has already missed its usual two-year cadence for new GPU families.\n\nThere's no official answer to that question. But a number of factors are likely at play. First, there's a good chance that the GPUs that are about to launch weren't AMD's original plan for this generation.\n\nAMD went for a chiplet design for RDNA 3 and the Radeon RX 7000 family and the expectation for RDNA 4 was a refinement of that approach. As we no know, AMD didn't go with chiplets for RDNA 4 and if that wasn't what was initially intended, then no doubt that put the whole proces behind schedule.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThen there was Nvidia's price bomb dropped at CES. Aside from the $2,000 RTX 5090, Nvidia's new graphics cards were cheaper than many observers expected. OK, at $549, the RTX 5070 still isn't exactly cheap for a mere '70 series model. But it may have been positioned lower than AMD was expecting.\n\nIf so, AMD may have needed some time to adjust. Which AMD's Frank Azor admitted to in our backstage chat at CES about the cards' non-appearance at the show. Perhaps that meant just reconsidering the positioning of the 9070 and 9070 XT. But it may also involve complications like rebates for board makers or other channel partners who signed up based on a different, higher pricing structure.\n\nAt $549, the Nvidia RTX 5070 still isn't exactly cheap, but it might be cheaper than AMD was expecting. (Image credit: Nvidia)\n\nOr maybe March was the plan all along, though we do rather doubt that. AMD very much gave the impression at CES that it had pulled a full RDNA 4 reveal at the last moment.\n\nStill, none of this will matter if the new cards are as good as the rumours. Ah, yes, those rumours. Allegedly, the 9070 XT's performance is about on par with an Nvidia RTX 4080, maybe a little faster for raster, maybe a little slower for ray tracing, but in that ball park.\n\nNow, when you consider that the performance uplift of the new RTX 5080 looks modest, perhaps 15% or so going on Nvidia's own data and excluding 4x Frame Gen (and you really should exclude 4x Frame Gen from these kinds of broad performance comparisons), then it's apparent that AMD's new cards could be quite competitive.\n\nIf they also come in at the rumoured price levels, some of which have the 9070 XT at $480, then factor in AMD's much-improved ML-based FSR 4 upscaling, well, you have quite the proposition.\n\nAll of which will make the wait for March quite a long haul. There's quite a lot riding on this and expectations are now so high the risk of disappointment is obvious enough. But here's hoping RDNA 4 is every bit as good and every bit as cheap as all those rumours.",

This announcement comes after speculation around the GPUs' release, which has already been pushed to this month based on early appearances of the GPUs at retailers and a vague 'Q1 2025' window spoken of during CES.\n\nWhen contacted, AMD pointed out that \"launch preparations are underway\" but would not elaborate further, echoing this past week's 'Meet the Experts' webinar's 'stay tuned' mantra. Observers in the industry say that the delay could be because of incomplete driver development or the company's attempt to merge AI-powered FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 across a wider range of games.\n\nIt may also represent strategic stockpiling. The analysts said it would help if AMD were attempting to increase its share of the competitive GPU market. A delayed release could help AMD improve supply chains and ensure the product is available when launched.\n\nThis timing also might serve as a better look for AMD both at competitor pricing and performance metrics of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5080 and 5070/Ti. Recent reports claim that AMD's RDNA 4 GPUs will be positioned as a high-demand product that appeals to gamers and creators due to their reasonably priced cards and enhanced AI features.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

The one-month return of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was1.89%, and its shares lost 30.29% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On January 17, 2025, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stock closed at $121.46 per share with a market capitalization of $197.106billion.\n\nWhite Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"During the year, we sold half of our stakes in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nu Holdings as they reached their intrinsic values. However, the decline in these stocks toward the end of the year provided us with an opportunity to add to our positions. In AMD\u2019s case, the market has been disappointed by the company\u2019s potential shortfall in AI chip revenues, which were previously forecasted to reach $10 billion in 2025. However, the factors required to justify the investment when the stock is priced at $220 per share are vastly different from those needed when the stock is at $120 per share. Yes, AMD\u2019s AI chips and associated software are not competitive with Nvidia but this is now known and in the valuation. We believe this hyperfocus on AI ignores AMD\u2019s other businesses where they continue to take advantage of Intel\u2019s missteps. Importantly, AMD retains the potential to capture a small share of the AI chip market, which, given the market's massive size, could be highly impactful for the company.\"\n\nIs Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

AMD did state that they were focused on offering more information at a dedicated event which was scheduled very soon.\n\nThe red team did, however, present the media with a slight preview of what the RDNA 4 architecture and the respective Radeon RX 9000 GPU lineup would look like. We got to see the new architectural highlights, the new product positioning/branding, and a range of custom models. It looks like AMD's AIBs were anticipating more action surrounding the RDNA 4 launch, but according to the latest from AMD, it looks like that action is coming later this quarter.\n\nAMD's David McAfee has now confirmed that the Radeon RX 9000 cards will be available for sale in March. He also mentions that both the hardware and the software are looking great. Following is the post on a social platform, X:\n\nRadeon 9000 series hardware and software are looking great and we are planning to have a wide assortment of cards available globally. Can\u2019t wait for gamers to get their hands on the cards when they go on sale in March! \u2014 David McAfee (@McAfeeDavid_AMD) January 20, 2025\n\nAMD's slides mentioned Q1 2025 as the launch timeframe for its RDNA 4-based Radeon RX 9000 GPUs, so it looks like they are indeed going to meet that target. Earlier rumors had stated a late January launch for the Radeon RX 9070 XT and Radeon RX 9070. While AMD never confirmed the late January launch, it looks like AIBs and retailers were indeed expecting or provided details regarding an earlier launch which changed very recently.\n\nThere are still plenty of retailers who are listing 23rd-25th January availability or pre-order dates for these cards, though based on AMD's confirmation, that won't be the case. Even some reviewers who received the cards early on received similar information.\n\nSo the question is what happened? Well, it looks like AMD may have gone back and made some changes to the product positioning of their cards, like offering better supply or making the price points more competitive against NVIDIA's recently revealed RTX 50 series. Current rumors suggest that the Radeon RX 9070 XT will be around the RTX 4070 Ti or RTX 4080 in terms of performance, so they would likely end up around RTX 5070 and 5070 Ti levels if not more. But the competition will have their cards out in February, which would mean that AMD would have to wait at least a month more for their cards to hit shelves. AMD has also debunked several performance leaks, hinting at higher performance.\n\nAMD may also offer bundled deals with their high-end Ryzen 9 9000X3D CPUs which will also hit stores in March 2025. With Ryzen 9000X3D, AMD can offer a great gaming experience using their own CPU and GPU hardware.\n\nFurthermore, AMD is also introducing FSR 4, which will compete with DLSS 4. AMD has touted ML-based models and their exclusivity with RDNA 4-based GPUs such as the Radeon RX 9070 XT, but they may open support on older GPUs if they want to keep up with the MFG solution. So, in one way, AMD can say while their competition offers more generated frames, they offer ML-based frame-generation support not only on their older hardware but also on the competitor's graphics cards. NVIDIA has also hinted at frame-gen support for older GPUs recently, so we will see how that pans out.\n\nWith that said, AMD is still very much in the graphics race. They will be competing against NVIDIA in the high-end/mainstream segment, while Intel has some competitive hardware in the form of Arc B-series graphics cards in the entry-level segment. AMD also has the Radeon RX 9060 series GPUs on the horizon, so we will see how those end up, but we can't wait to try out the RDNA 4 architecture in the coming months.\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9000 GPU Lineup (Preliminary):",

This timing follows NVIDIA's release of the GeForce RTX 5070 series, causing some frustration in the gaming community. The new architecture features advanced AI, improved ray-tracing, and enhanced media capabilities.\n\nAMD has confirmed the release date or window for its first RDNA 4 desktop gaming GPUs. AMD's David McAfee, who helps head up the company's Ryzen and Radeon groups, has taken to social media to confirm that the Radeon 9000 Series will go on sale in March 2025.\n\nThe Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 combo, announced earlier this month at CES 2025, is expected to kick off the launch. However, the timing is causing many within the PC gaming community to express frustration with what is being viewed as a delay. Launching in March means AMD's GPUs will arrive after NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti combo - RDNA 4's main competition.\n\nAMD's new RDNA 4 architecture includes advanced AI hardware for the new FSR 4 Super Resolution and Frame Generation, improved ray-tracing performance, enhanced creator media encoding capabilities, and optimizations to RDNA's Compute Units. No official benchmarks are available; however, quite a few companies have already showcased their upcoming Radeon RX 9070 XT cards.\n\n2\n\nVIEW GALLERY - 2 IMAGES\n\nSome retailers are already reporting that they have stock, which is causing rumors to swirl and people to speculate that AMD has delayed RDNA 4's launch for several reasons. One, NVIDIA's pricing for the RTX 5070 ($549) and RTX 5070 Ti ($749) caught the company off-guard, so it pulled the RDNA 4 reveal at CES and is currently re-evaluating its launch plans and pricing to remain competitive.\n\nOn the other hand, March 2025 aligns with the Q1 2025 launch window AMD teased at CES, and David McAfee adds that hardware and software \"are looking great\" and that a wide range of cards will be \"available globally\" at launch. If rumors of RTX 4080-like performance for the Radeon RX 9070 XT turn out to be accurate and RDNA 4's ray-tracing capabilities showcase a massive improvement, there's much to be excited about. It's just a shame that the expected late-January launch is now sometime in March.\n\nLook at all the RDNA 4 GPUs we went hands-on with at CES.",

They have identified genes on chromosomes 1 and 10 that play an integral role in 90% of all AMD cases.\n\nThe team has made the greatest progress in cases associated with a mutation on chromosome 1, the most prevalent form of AMD. This mutation causes the immune system to attack the macula, the specialized, light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye. With the macula compromised, patients have difficulty focusing on objects directly in front of them, limiting their ability to read, drive, and recognize faces.\n\nThis genetic understanding allowed the SCTM to develop its first gene therapy, which reintroduces a protective form of the mutated protein. The therapy is in clinical trials.\n\nBUILDING ON EXPERIENCE\n\nHageman explains that, unlike AMD, glaucoma has been loosely tied to more than 80 genes, which complicates developing a therapy based solely on genetics. But lessons learned in his work with AMD as director of the Alan S. Crandall Center for Glaucoma Innovation\u2019s Translational Research Initiative can inform the search for new glaucoma therapies.\n\nGlaucoma is a disease of the optic nerve and retina. The first line of treatment is prescription eyedrops that are ineffective for 40% of patients.\n\nSimilar to his research approach with AMD, Hageman\u2019s team is again collaborating with a major American pharmaceutical company. In this case, the team is examining the biological pathways, or molecular changes in cells, that contribute to the progression of glaucoma. The company has so far sequenced more than 7,000 proteins from more than 3,000 genotyped healthy and diseased donor eyes.\n\nThe end goal of this project is wider than developing new drugs. Hageman believes there is a chance there may be drugs already approved by the FDA for other illnesses that could be used off-label to mitigate the progression of glaucoma.\n\n\u201cYou never know what pathway might come to our attention,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never know where an existing drug might already be available that could benefit a patient with glaucoma.\u201d\n\nHageman believes that new therapies are within reach with the resources available at the University of Utah, the SCTM\u2019s excellent team of researchers and collaborators, and continued support from philanthropists.\n\n\u201cThere is hope,\u201d said Hageman. \u201cIt is going to take some time, but we know what we need to do, have the resources to expedite discovery, and the talent to make new therapies possible.\u201d",

            "content": "AMD has apparently priced its elusive new Radeon RX 9070 gaming GPU range too high to compete with the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 5000 series, which is reportedly the reason why there\u2019s no word on the specs, price, or release date yet. The new AMD Radeon RX 9070 graphics cards were announced at CES with curiously little fanfare, despite plenty of graphics cards from various manufacturers being on display. The reason, according to this rumor, is that the company is now stuck in a pricing quagmire as retailers already have stock of the cards.\n\nWhile Nvidia is expected to take the award for the absolute best graphics card when the RTX 5090 release date arrives shortly, we were hoping that AMD would at least be able to answer the RTX 5070 with a competitively-priced alternative. However, given Nvidia\u2019s current dominance in the market, AMD is going to have to price the new Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT very competitively.\n\nAs always with rumor and speculation, bear in mind that none of this has come directly from AMD, so take it with a grain of salt. This particular rumor comes from a moderator on the PC Games Hardware forums called Pokerclock, who shared some findings in a post on the forum.\n\n\u201cApparently,\u201d says Pokerclock, \u201cthere is no agreement (both AMD and retailers in particular) on the price at which these graphics cards should be sold, because the originally planned price range appears to have been set far too high in view of the looming competition from Nvidia. The problem is that price corrections for deliveries that have already been made can sometimes be difficult.\u201d\n\nWe can confirm that the cards definitely already exist, as we saw loads of them at CES, and shared several Radeon RX 9070 photos from the tradeshow, from the likes of Asus, Sapphire, PowerColor, Gigabyte, and XFX, as well as AMD reference cards.\n\nOne way AMD could fix the apparently high pricing is to offer cashback or marketing deals in return, enabling retailers to still offer the cards at new prices set by AMD. However, Pokerclock also claims that \u201cthere are reports in dealer circles that AMD is already several months behind on cashback payments and that this is already leading to liquidity problems in some places.\u201d\n\nNvidia recently announced the RTX 5070 price at CES, and it matches the current RTX 4070 price while undercutting its original $599 launch price by $50. CES also saw Nvidia announce DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Gen, with CEO and founder Jensen Huang claiming it made the RTX 5070 as fast as the RTX 4090. That\u2019s a bit of a stretch, as it requires your game to support Multi Frame Gen, but we found the new budget card actually beat the current flagship in Marvel Rivals in our recent RTX 5070 vs 4090 test.\n\nAccording to the latest leaks, the Radeon RX 9070 XT performs similarly to the RTX 4070 Ti, and we were also really impressed by AMD\u2019s new AI upscaling tech in our FSR 4 test in Ratchet & Clank. However, AMD will really need to improve its ray tracing performance and make sure FSR 4 is implemented in as many games as possible if it really wants to compete with the new RTX 5070, and it will also need to price its new GPUs seriously competitively. If they\u2019re priced too high they\u2019ll be dead in the water.\n\nHopefully, we\u2019ll find out more details about AMD\u2019s new GPUs soon, but in the meantime, check out our guide to the new Nvidia RTX 5000 series to see what\u2019s coming soon from its nearest competitor.",

Nvidia\u2019s dominance in AI has left little room for AMD to carve out a significant foothold, despite its efforts to innovate and diversify its offerings. Moreover, AMD\u2019s relatively slower product rollout cycle and limited AI-specific capabilities have exacerbated its struggles to keep up with Nvidia\u2019s aggressive pace.\n\nYet, despite lurking in Nvidia\u2019s industry-dominating shadow, one investor, known by the pseudonym On the Pulse, is not buying the market\u2019s pessimism regarding AMD.\n\n\u201cAMD\u2019s new AI accelerators in 2025 could boost sales, profit growth, and gross margins making it a compelling investment,\u201d asserts the 5-star investor.\n\nOn the Pulse explains that the combination of skyrocketing demand and limited GPU supply is exactly what AMD needs.

AMD's Corporate Vice President and General Manager, David McAfee, just announced on Xwitter that that he \"can't wait\" for the launch of the cards in March. Indeed, that means that we're still a little under six weeks (40 days) away from retail availability of AMD's next-generation graphics cards.We went straight to the source and asked AMD for further comment about the release, but the company was coy with details. We were told that \"launch preparations are underway,\" and that \"more information [is] coming soon.\" That echoes AMD's statements last week where the company asked press and partners to \"stay tuned\" in a \"Meet the Experts\" webinar.If we were to speculate, there could be all kinds of reasons that AMD isn't ready to launch the new GPUs . Despite what McAfee says, it's possible that the drivers aren't fully baked yet, and it's also possible that AMD is wheeling and dealing to get the new AI-powered FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 into more games.Alternatively, AMD may simply be holding its horses to build up stock; if the cards are good and the rumored pricing holds true, these GPUs could be in high demand.

The analyst pointed to build plans from original design manufacturers to justify the increased pessimism.\n\nThe Wolfe analyst pegs AMD's data center GPU revenue between $1.5 billion and $2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024. For 2025, the forecast was lowered to just $7 billion, far below the $10 billion analysts are generally expecting. That annual forecast basically predicts that AMD's data center GPU revenue isn't going to grow much quarter to quarter this year.\n\nOf course, take any analyst opinion with a grain of salt. We're less than three weeks into the new year, and the AI industry moves extremely quickly. AMD has some compelling AI accelerators on the market, and they're clearly winning over customers. Oracle is using AMD's MI300X GPUs for its cloud data centers, and Vultr, a smaller cloud provider, has chosen the same AMD GPU to build its AI offerings around.\n\nOne headwind AMD and all other non-Nvidia competitors face is the maturity of Nvidia's software ecosystem. Nvidia GPUs support a proprietary software layer called CUDA, which has been around for a long time and is widely used across industry and academia for accelerated computing tasks. Even with capable hardware from AMD, the path of least resistance for those building out AI clusters is still Nvidia.\n\nSoftware is a big reason Intel's efforts at breaking into the AI accelerator market have largely failed so far. Intel has an added complication in that its Gaudi AI chips are not traditional GPUs, so the architecture also acts as a hurdle. AMD has fared much better than Intel, but it's still far behind Nvidia.\n\nNew AI chips could help\n\nThe software situation should improve over time, and new chips from AMD could help boost sales this year if they're well received by the market. The MI325X is expected to be widely available from system manufacturers in the first quarter, although that chip uses the same architecture as the previous MI300X.\n\nThe next-generation Instinct MI350 family is expected to launch sometime in 2025, likely later in the year, and AMD is promising big performance improvements. Based on a new architecture, AMD claims that the MI350 family provides up to 35 times the AI inference performance compared to the MI300 family. The MI400 family will then come in 2026, built on another brand-new architecture.\n\nEven with a quick pace of product launches, AMD is up against an equally quick Nvidia and will continue to struggle against its software disadvantage. While AMD's AI chip sales this year are yet to be determined, any shortfall relative to expectations could send the stock tumbling.",

            "content": "AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is incredible, and I don't think we need to post our gaming benchmarks again to prove this. That said, we still need to make sure the owners of Ryzen 9800X3D can leverage its full potential and there is no better way than to get a motherboard that can push it to its limits.\n\nWhile it's not entirely necessary to overclock the 9800X3D to achieve the pinnacle of the gaming experience, you would be limiting yourself to a CPU that is made for it. Whether you want to overclock it or not, it's crucial to understand that the Ryzen 7 9800X3D needs to be fed stable power to maintain higher clock speeds.\n\nUnlike previous X3D chips, the 9800X3D can achieve incredibly high clock speeds; therefore, strong power delivery is the need of the hour. However, you don't have to spend $700 on a motherboard and can achieve this even on budget AM5 motherboards. Whether your budget is $200 or $500, we have a great pick for every price tag that will ensure the best performance and thermals outside the box.\n\nA Quick Glance at the List\n\nThings to Consider When Buying a Motherboard for AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D\n\nOverclocking support: It will be a huge disappointment if you miss the overclocking capabilities of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. This is the first time AMD has unlocked the full OC potential of X3D chips and going with a motherboard with robust VRM should be a no-brainer. It's recommended to look for a good number of power phases with big heatsinks for stable overclocking.\n\nCooling: Motherboards with large heatsinks will always help your system run cooler than those that have smaller ones. Apart from having well-grooved and dense heatsinks on the VRM, look for heatsinks on the M.2 slots and chipset as well. After taking care of the PCB cooling, look for how many fan and cooling headers you are getting. The motherboard should support at least 4-6 chassis fans and at least one AIO for supporting sufficient cooling devices.\n\nOnboard Features: Onboard features include troubleshooting functions as well as additional stuff like EZ DIY design and headers for connectivity. Overclocking CPU and memory can sometimes lead to boot errors or malfunctions. This can be easily resolved with Debug LEDs, Error Code, and Clear CMOS button. To speed up this process, good motherboards are equipped with Power and Reset buttons as well, which let you do all the experiments quickly while your chassis side panel is open.\n\nBudget: Decide how much you are willing to spend on the motherboard alone and secure the rest of the cash on other components. It's always better to go with a better motherboard for easy upgrades, but keep in mind that the direct impact of a motherboard on gaming performance won't be noticeable in most cases. Hence, even if you settle with the most basic chipset, you will be good for doing as long as you are deploying a decent cooling solution for the Ryzen 7 9800X3D.\n\nTop Motherboard Picks for AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D\n\nBest Overall\n\nASRock X870E Taichi: Amazon\n\nPowerful, DIY-friendly, and beautiful: The X870E Taichi does everything to perfection and costs lower than its competitors from other vendors. Chipset: X870E, VRM: 24+2+1, Memory Support: 256GB, 8200 MT/s, Storage: 4x M.2, 6x SATA, Connectivity: 5GbE LAN, WiFi 7, Bluetooth 5.4\n\nPros Cons + Best thermals out of the box - CMOS battery is under the heatsink + Leading overclocking performance - Somewhat expensive + Plenty of onboard functions + Tons of connectivity features\n\nOut of all our tested X870/X870E motherboards, the ASRock X870E Taichi was way ahead of every model in most aspects. This was especially true in the VRM performance, which allowed Taichi to secure the number-one position. The X870E Taichi isn't just the best option to go for the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, but is technically the best possible X870E motherboard for any AMD Ryzen 9000 processor, including the flagship Ryzen 9 9950X.\n\nThrough its solid 27-power phase VRM, coupled with dense and well-grooved heatsinks, the Taichi can sustain lower temperatures on both stock and OC modes, allowing users to harness their CPU's potential to the max. So, you not only get higher clock speeds for higher performance but also less heat generation, which is ideal for longer operations at high clock speeds.\n\nThankfully, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is fully unlocked, unlike its predecessors, making way to experiment more with the clocks to test its limits. Of course, this isn't what the X870E Taichi brings to the table. Onboard troubleshooting features, excellent compatibility, modern connectivity, and EZ DIY design make it a perfect choice for modern high-end gaming builds.\n\nBest Alternate\n\nChipset: X670E, VRM: 18+2+2, Memory Support: 192 GB, 8000 MT/s, Storage: 4x M.2, 6x SATA, Connectivity: 2.5 G LAN, WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2\n\nPros Cons + More affordable than the X870E counterpart - Slightly downgraded compared to X870E counterpart + Excellent power delivery and overclocking capabilities + Plethora of USB ports at rear I/O + Onboard troubleshooting options\n\nThe X870E chipset isn't the last option. It does offer slightly better specifications and memory support than the X670E, but the overall features are somewhat similar. This is why the ASUS ROG X670E-E is probably one of the best high-end boards for the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which offers a competitive VRM with 22 power phases, decent connectivity, and plenty of onboard features.\n\nCompared to the X870E-E, it is $60 cheaper, and while it does bring slower wireless connectivity and no EZ DIY design, these things shouldn't matter much if you are looking to just maximize the potential of the 9800X3D. We, anyway, have the X870E Taichi for $500, which is better than the X870E-E WiFi for the same price, which is why going with the X670E-E makes more sense as an alternative.\n\nThe ROG Strix X670E-E stands out at the rear I/O. There are only a handful of motherboards that are packed with so many USB ports. The motherboard brings a total of 12x USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports with Type A and Type C ports combined. Plus, there is a single USB 3.2 Gen2x2 USB Type C port for high-bandwidth devices as well. And if you want more, you can use the front panel headers, which include the Thunderbolt 4 port, and several USB 2.0 and 3.2 headers for the case front panel connectors.\n\nBest High-End\n\nChipset: X870E, VRM: 18+2+1, Memory Support: 256 GB, 8400 MT/s, Storage: 4x M.2, 4x SATA, Connectivity: 5G and 2.5G LAN ports, WiFi 7, Bluetooth 5.4\n\nPros Cons + 22 USB ports(front+rear) - Not the best location for the Smart button at the rear I/O + EZ Toolless design - Somewhat expensive + Distinguished VRM performance + Plenty of onboard features\n\nIn the high-end category, there are plenty of competitive boards that make choosing the best one a bit difficult task. While there isn't any \"bad\" motherboard, not every board will offer you the same number of specs and features, and it boils down to what offers you the most for the money. As far as the overall package is concerned, the MPG X870E Carbon WiFi nails it.\n\nFrom offering a powerful VRM that keeps high temperatures at bay to incredible connectivity and aesthetics, the Carbon WiFi is one of the best high-end X870E boards to buy for Ryzen 9800X3D as well as other higher-end Zen 5 chips. In our testing, it came out to be the second-best board in thermals after ASRock X870E Taichi, thanks to its robust 21-power phase VRM.\n\nBut connectivity is unmatched. This is perhaps the only board on the list to feature dual LAN ports: 1x 5G and 1x 2.5G, along with WiFi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4. Furthermore, there are nearly two dozen USB ports for peripheral connectivity, which include both the rear I/O and front panel headers. At the rear I/O alone, there are 9x USB Type A 10G ports, 2x USB-C 40G, and 2x USB-C 10G ports.\n\nThe board is also decorated with beautiful heatsinks and RGB lighting on the I/O shroud and M.2 heatsink that can be customized via popular RGB software. For troubleshooting and stuff, there are EZ Debug, EZ Error Code, Power, and Reset buttons, and an additional PCI-E 8-pin connector at the bottom for supplying more power to the PCI-E x16 slots.\n\nBest Mid-Range\n\nChipset: X870E, VRM: 16+2+2, Memory Support: 256 GB, 8200 MT/s, Storage: 4x M.2, 4x SATA, Connectivity: 2.5G LAN, WiFi 7, Bluetooth 5.3\n\nPros Cons + Well-organized - CMOS battery is under the heatsink + EZ DIY-friendly design + Decent overclocking performance + Onboard troubleshooting features\n\nThe X870E AORUS PRO ICE is a wonderful solution that neither breaks the bank nor compromises its functionality and features. Packed with brushed aluminum heatsinks over the VRM, chipset, and M.2 slots, it exudes a premium aesthetic that meets the versatile functionality of the board through the EZ DIY-friendly design.\n\nYou can simply add a WiFi antenna, an M.2, or a GPU with the EZ-Plug and Play functionality that makes life easier. Of course, you will receive a top-notch VRM for overclocking, big heatsinks with embedded copper heat pipes, and excellent connectivity. The board is well-organized regarding the headers and onboard features, separating the troubleshooting features on the top-right for easy access and grouping multiple fans, RGB/ARGB, and front panel headers for easier connection.\n\nIt's the right choice for Ryzen 7 9800X3D to build a well-balanced gaming system, where you would be able to add almost any modern device without having to check compatibility, making upgrades easier down the line. However, if you are short on cash, consider the next options that will be close to ideal for 9800X3D as well.\n\nBest Budget\n\nChipset: X670E, VRM: 14+2+1, Memory Support: 256 GB, 7800 MT/s, Storage: 4x M.2, 4x SATA, Connectivity: 2.5G LAN, WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3\n\nPros Cons + Very affordable - Limited onboard troubleshooting options + Native PCI-E Gen 5.0 support - Downgraded connectivity compared to X870E + EZ Debug LEDs - Not ideal for strong overclocking + Decent overclocking capabilities\n\nUsers who don't care about pushing the limits of Ryzen 9800X3D will find themselves content with MSI's MAG X670E Tomahawk WiFi from the previous generation. It will be compatible with the 9800X3D outside the box with the latest AGESA BIOS update and has most of its features on par with modern motherboards, including the X870/X870E chipset.\n\nThere are some downgrades you should expect since WiFi 7, EZ DIY design, and higher memory support were introduced on the latest 800 chipsets, but if you take a look at its power delivery, component compatibility, and connectivity, they are perfect for any Ryzen 9000 CPU. You will be just fine with overclocking and stuff but don't expect it to break records.\n\nOne of the major reasons to opt for this board is its significantly lower price compared to the X870E iteration. You will get many similar features on this one, which will ensure you can reach optimal performance outside the box. While it doesn't have fancy onboard features, it does have the handy EZ Debug LEDs for troubleshooting basic hardware problems. Thankfully, with PCI-E 5.0 support, you will be able to add a next-gen GPU with a PCI-E 5.0 interface or any of the latest PCI-E 5.0 SSD to achieve high transfer speeds.\n\nBest Entry-Level\n\nChipset: B650E, VRM: 14+2+1, Memory Support: 256 GB, 8200 MT/s, Storage: 4x M.2, 4x SATA, Connectivity: 2.5G LAN, WiFi 7, Bluetooth 5.3\n\nPros Cons + Incredibly affordable - Not suitable for intensive overclocking + Can overclock both CPU and memory - Several downgrades over X670 and X870 chipsets + Has Debug LEDs - Lackluster thermal performance + Native PCI-E 5.0 support for GPU and M.2 - Not much for troubleshooting\n\nOne of the reasons why the Ryzen X3D processors stand out is because you can have leading gaming performance even on the cheapest motherboards. While the B650E PG Riptide WiFi isn't the cheapest AM5 motherboard, it surely is the most affordable one on this list with a price tag of less than $200. If you care about achieving the highest FPS per dollar, then this is for you.\n\nThe B650E chipset is fairly decent when it comes to modern PC hardware compatibility since you are getting native PCI-E 5.0 support. There are several tiers in the B650E motherboard lineup as well, but we believe that if you are paying over $200, it's best to go with either the X670E or the X870E motherboards. Since this is for scaling down the overall expense to as minimal as possible while helping the 9800X3D achieve its full potential, you shouldn't expect leading specs and features on this one.\n\nYou won't get the best VRM, onboard features, connectivity, or aesthetics, but they are surely sufficient for most PC users, considering many of those modern specs are hardly utilized at the highest levels. The B650E Riptide Wi-Fi will save you quite a good amount of cash, allowing you to direct it into a better GPU or more RAM, which will have more impact on performance than getting a more expensive motherboard.\n\nFAQ\n\nIs it necessary to get an X870/X870E chipset for AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D?\n\nIt's not necessary to have the X870 or the X870E chipset motherboard to achieve the best performance with 9800X3D. Since the X670/X670E can do a similar job, you don't have to spend more on the latest chipset except if you want WiFi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, and some additional stuff like EZ DIY design.\n\nIs a high-end AM5 motherboard worth it for overclocking the Ryzen 7 9800X3D?\n\nIt depends on what you are seeking from the 9800X3D. If you aim to achieve the highest clock speed possible, then you should get the high-end X670E/X870E motherboards, but if you want stable performance while also having the freedom to overclock the 9800X3D a bit, you don't need a high-end board.\n\nDo I need support for a higher memory speed on AM5 motherboards?\n\nUnfortunately, DDR5 memories struggle to reach high clock speeds on AM5 motherboards. The maximum memory clock support between 600 and 800 chipsets might seem significant in some cases, but you will hardly be able to get even close to the maximum supported frequency on 600 chipset motherboards, let alone the 800-chipset boards.",

The RX 9070 XT features 16GB GDDR6 memory and FSR 4 support. AMD's strategy could offer a cost-effective alternative to NVIDIA's offerings, enhancing competition in the GPU market. AMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT, rumored at $599, aims to challenge NVIDIA's RTX 5070 Ti, priced at $749, with similar performance and improved ray tracing. The RX 9070 XT features 16GB GDDR6 memory and FSR 4 support. AMD's strategy could offer a cost-effective alternative to NVIDIA's offerings, enhancing competition in the GPU market.\n\nAMD's next-gen Radeon RX 9070 XT could be priced at $599, acting as a GeForce RTX 5070 Ti killer for $150 less... heating up the PC gaming scene like crazy to start 2025 with an RDNA 4 bang.\n\nIn his latest video, Tom from Moore's Law is Dead says that he believes AMD could have $599 pricing on the flagship Radeon RX 9070 XT, which would make the RDNA 4 card an \"RTX 5070 Ti\" killer for $150 less. It will have similar performance to the RTX 5070 Ti, use around 300W of power, have 16GB of GDDR6 memory, hugely improved ray tracing (RT) performance, and new FSR 4 support.\n\nNVIDIA's new GeForce RTX 5070 Ti starts at $749, which makes it a bigger ($150) pill to swallow over the RX 9070 XT... that is, if AMD prices it at $599. Yes, AMD could make its new Radeon RX 9000 series graphics cards cheaper than NVIDIA's new GeForce RTX 50 series, but GeForce RTX gamers can enjoy superior AI upscaling technology with DLSS 4, and more.\n\nAMD has some wicked improvements in ray tracing (RT) performance for its new RDNA 4-based Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs, with huge uplifts in RT performance over RDNA 3-based Radeon RX 7000 series cards.\n\n$599 pricing on the Radeon RX 9070 XT mixed with $479 pricing on the Ryzen 7 9800X3D... makes for quite the potent mix for just over $1000 with what should be an incredible mix of CPU and GPU. You don't need to buy an overly expensive motherboard for the 9800X3D or RX 9070 XT, and you can get away with an air cooler or lower-end AIO cooler.\n\nIf you went with an Intel + NVIDIA combo with the flagship Core Ultra 9 285K and its $590+ MSRP, mixed with the flagship GeForce RTX 5090 for $1999... you're looking at $2600+ and that's without the required 360mm AIO cooler for another couple of hundred dollars, which is required as Intel processors run hot, hot, hot.\n\n3\n\nVIEW GALLERY - 3 IMAGES\n\nAMD could market this mix of the cheaper Ryzen 7 9800X3D with the cheaper Radeon RX 9070 XT as the ultimate Team Red gaming bundle, especially with better rasterization performance, and greatly improved ray tracing performance. Priced at $599, AMD could get aggressive toward NVIDIA with marketing against the RTX 5070 Ti being $150 more, but the new RDNA 4 card provides the same (and sometimes more) performance, while being cheaper.\n\nThe next couple of weeks are going to be WILD watching both sides -- NVIDIA and AMD -- launching their respective next-generation graphics cards.

            "content": "With the earnings season now underway, we\u2019ll soon find out how publicly traded companies finished 2024. So far, analysts have set a high bar, projecting year-over-year growth of 11% or more. If achieved, this would make Q4 2024 the strongest quarter for earnings growth since 2021.\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving strong buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nAgainst that background, we can look at one of the driving themes behind the success of the past few years \u2013 artificial intelligence (AI). AI hasn\u2019t just grabbed the headlines and the hype, it has also provided a solid technological base for a fundamental change across a wide array of industries, from the digital world to healthcare to finance to education to entertainment. No matter where you look these days, AI is there.\n\nThis wave of innovation hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by market analysts. Many are keeping a close eye on AI stocks, seeking insights into what lies ahead for investors. Among them is Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter, who has highlighted two AI giants that deserve particular attention as this earnings season unfolds.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Buchalter\u2019s top picks, are key players in the semiconductor space and integral to the AI revolution. Both companies are known for their high-end, AI-capable processors. Nvidia has been the industry leader for several years now, while AMD is making a concerted bid to expand its market share.\n\nAs both companies approach their upcoming earnings reports, Buchalter\u2019s analysis sheds light on what investors can expect, focusing on their growth trajectories and competitive positioning. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nNvidia\n\nFirst up is Nvidia, the undisputed heavyweight of the semiconductor industry, with a $3.37 trillion market cap that crowns it as Wall Street\u2019s second-most valuable player, just behind Apple. Nvidia has reached that dizzying height after an astounding 450% share price gain over the past three years \u2013 a period that coincides with the AI boom.\n\nThe company built its reputation on high-speed processors, the GPUs that became so popular in the gaming industry \u2013 but those chips also proved adaptable to a wide range of other high-end computing applications, including high-speed computing, data center server stacks, and AI, particularly generative AI. Today, the company\u2019s data center business segment, which is closely tied to AI, accounts for the bulk of Nvidia\u2019s revenues, and the company commands 80% or more of the AI chip market.\n\nNvidia continues to benefit from continued demand for both its latest Blackwell series accelerators and its existing Hopper series. The Blackwell chips were announced last March but faced delays in production and delivery. Nvidia has begun to ship out Blackwell sample packs, and the company states that demand for the new chips is strong.\n\nLooking ahead, Nvidia is expected to release its fiscal 4Q25 results at the end of next month, with Wall Street anticipating ~$38 billion in revenue and $0.85 in EPS. If these forecasts hold, they\u2019ll mark an 8.4% increase in revenue and a 5% climb in EPS from the $35.08 billion and $0.81 recorded in fiscal 3Q25.\n\nTurning to the Cowen view, we find analyst Buchalter is upbeat on Nvidia, citing the company\u2019s consistent solid earnings and the high demand for its product lines.\n\n\u201c[We] anticipate a solid print & guide with a continuation of the company\u2019s recent trend to come in ~$1-2B above consensus on both. Our checks indicate that the Blackwell (largely B200 at this point with GB200 beginning more materially in AprQ/JulQ) ramp is progressing well, and we are observing some suppliers shifting allocation from Hopper-based platforms to Blackwell (indicating the health of the ramp and demand). With Blackwell demand still well in excess of supply, and the supply chain not yet shifted to Blackwell Ultra, we view NVIDIA revenue as largely on cruise control for F1H26,\u201d Buchalter opined.\n\nTo this end, Buchalter rates Nvidia stock as a Buy, designates it as a Top Pick, and sets a $175 price target, implying a potential one-year upside of 27%. (To watch Buchalter\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nOverall, Nvidia has picked up 39 analyst reviews, with a breakdown of 36 Buys and 3 Holds to give the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are currently priced at $137.71 and their $176.86 average target price points toward a 28% upside in the next 12 months. (See NVDA stock forecast)\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n\nThe second stock we\u2019ll look at, AMD, may not be in Nvidia\u2019s league, but it is a solid operator in its own right. AMD has a strong reputation in the chip industry and, over the past year, has been making a concerted effort to erode Nvidia\u2019s market share. The company\u2019s challenge is built on its own lineup of high-quality chipsets, particularly its high-end PC processors and AI-capable accelerator chips.\n\nEarlier this month, AMD announced several new products in line with this challenge. These include several new Ryzen chips for both business and consumer PCs \u2013 all of which are designed to power next-generation AI applications. The new chips include the AMD Ryzen AI Max, AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series and AMD Ryzen 200 Series processors on the consumer side, and the AMD Ryzen AI Max PRO, AMD Ryzen AI 300 PRO and AMD Ryzen 200 PRO Series on the commercial side. In addition, the company also announced a stronger partnership with Dell. The Dell agreement will see the PC maker put AMD Ryzen AI PRO processors into new Dell Pro computers. This will mark the first shipment of Dell\u2019s commercial PCs with AMD Ryzen AI PRO processors.\n\nThese announcements mark an important expansion in AMD\u2019s push to expand its AI offerings. The company already has support from important customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Oracle, all of which are major enterprise consumers of high-end AI processors.\n\nWe should note that AMD has experienced sequential gains in both revenues and earnings over the last two quarterly results. In late October, when the company released its third-quarter 2024 results, the top line reached $6.82 billion, marking an 18% year-over-year increase and surpassing the forecast by $110 million. At the bottom line, the non-GAAP EPS of 92 cents was in line with expectations.\n\nLooking ahead, AMD is set to release its fourth-quarter 2024 results on Tuesday, February 4. Wall Street expects $7.53 billion in revenue and an EPS of $1.09, reflecting a sequential 10% increase in revenue and an 18% rise in EPS compared to Q3 2024.\n\nEven though AMD\u2019s results have been ticking upwards, and its product lines are finding solid demand, the company\u2019s stock price has been falling. AMD shares are down 23% in the last 12 months.\n\nThat, however, leads Cowen analyst Buchalter to see AMD as an opportunity. Noting that the stock has underperformed, the analyst also cites AMD\u2019s success in expanding its market share.\n\n\u201cWe expect a sold [sic] in-line print/guide against a very high bar that\u2019s being set by the fervent backdrop surrounding AI and the \u2018insatiable\u2019 demand for compute and recent momentum in the ASIC space. The stock has underperformed over the last three months as AMD\u2019s progress has been steady, but not necessarily step-function like its AI-compute peers. Our checks point to continued positive demand for MI300/325 products at AMD\u2019s lead-customers. That said, a more seasonal gen-purpose Server CPU and stubborn softness in Embedded (and typically weak 1Q25 seasonality in Client) are partially muting AMD\u2019s ongoing share gains (eg. AMD\u2019s significant enterprise PC win with Dell). As a result, we take our above-Street estimates down slightly while maintaining our AI accelerator estimate of $5B/$10B/$15B for 2024/2025/2026,\u201d Buchalter stated.\n\nThese comments back up Buchalter\u2019s Buy rating on AMD, which he complements with a $150 price target that suggests a share appreciation of 23.5% on the one-year horizon.\n\nAll in all, AMD\u2019s consensus rating is a Moderate Buy, based on 32 recent analyst reviews that include 21 Buys, 10 Holds, and a lone Sell. The stock is trading for $121.46 currently, and shows a ~42% one-year upside based on the average price target of $172.24.

With up to 128GB of unified memory, up to 16 cores and 32 threads, and a boost clock that ranges from 4.9GHz to 5.1GHz this Ryzen series has earned its \"Max\" name.\n\nBut we gave the Ryzen AI Max chips Best-in-Show for more than just its beefy tech specs.\n\nAsus ROG Flow Z13 with Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nThe Asus ROG Flow Z13 features a Ryzen AI Max APU chipset onboard, designed to make this a powerful gaming tablet on its own. You can also connect it to the XG Mobile eGPU with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 or RTX 5090 to make it a gaming powerhouse.\n\nAMD showcased the Flow Z13 at CES, running Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart on the Ryzen AI Max chipset. While Rift Apart is not the most graphically demanding game, the Flow Z13 kept up with the fast-paced teleporting combat without any frame drops or stuttering.\n\nWhile the Flow Z13 was plugged into AC power for the gaming demo, so we can't say if you'll see a massive framerate dip on battery power only, the fact the Flow Z13 can provide a smooth 60+fps gameplay experience at 1080p is a solid win for the Ryzen AI Max and AMD's commitment to iGPU gaming.\n\nHP ZBook Ultra 14 G1a with DaVinci Resolve\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nThe HP ZBook Ultra 14 G1a was our Best Laptop of CES 2025. There was plenty of stiff competition for this coveted spot, but the ZBook Ultra blew us away with its powerful performance and ultra-light build, weighing under 4 pounds.\n\nStay in the know with Laptop Mag Get our in-depth reviews, helpful tips, great deals, and the biggest news stories delivered to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAt the AMD suite at CES 2025, we watched the ZBook Ultra chew through an transcription test in just seconds utilizing its powerful AMD Ryzen AI Max Pro's 50 TOPS NPU in Black Magic's DaVinci Resolve. Editors can also make changes to the transcript, either before or after dropping it into the video, though according to reps from AMD the transcription AI is generally pretty accurate.\n\nWhile a powerful desktop workstation is still going to be faster at basically any video editing workload, the easy portability of the ZBook Ultra makes it fantastic for editing in the field. Tasks that used to take hours are down to just minutes of time.\n\nIs Ryzen AI Max \"Strix Halo\" the one chip to rule them all?\n\nSystems featuring the Ryzen AI Max APUs are expected in Q1 2025, with the Asus ROG Flow Z13 and HP ZBook Ultra 14 being the first two products announced for the consumer and professional lines of the chip.\n\nIf the Ryzen AI Max's powerful gaming and workstation performance, and unified memory, have put Apple's M-series silicon in mind, there is a good reason for that. In an interview with Engadget, AMD's Joe Macri credited Apple for proving people will buy powerful computers without discrete graphics. Additionally, AMD compares the Ryzen AI Max chip's performance to Apple's M4 Pro silicon. So there are plenty of reasons for the Apple comparisons.\n\nIntel's Lunar Lake chips also have unified memory, with 32GB of RAM soldered right onto the CPU package. However, AMD's Ryzen AI Max offers a truly bonkers 128GB of unified memory, of which up to 96GB can be dedicated to the GPU.\n\nWith Qualcomm gunning for MacBook users with its new suite of creative applications and AMD aiming at M-series performance, we could see an interesting shakeup in the Apple market this year.",

            "content": "A lot is going right for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.92%) right now. The company has been gaining share in the PC CPU market, its server CPUs have been selling well, and its AI accelerators have quickly turned into a multibillion-dollar business.\n\nThe gaming business is another story. AMD's gaming revenue crashed 69% year over year in the third quarter of 2024 to just $462 million. For comparison, the data center segment produced $3.5 billion in revenue during the same quarter.\n\nThere are two issues at play. First, AMD supplies semi-custom chips for the major game consoles. The current generation of game consoles are now in the latter part of their life cycles, so it makes sense that demand is slumping.\n\nThis source of revenue should bounce back sometime in the next few years, depending on when Sony and Microsoft launch new consoles. The next-generation consoles will likely be powered by AMD chips.\n\nSecond, AMD remains in a distant second place behind Nvidia in the gaming GPU market. While AMD doesn't break out gaming GPU revenue, the company disclosed in its earnings call that gaming GPU sales were down year over year in the third quarter. The company partially blamed the upcoming launch of its next-generation graphics cards as a reason for the decline, but Nvidia managed to grow gaming revenue during its most recent quarter despite also prepping new products.\n\nThe situation could get worse this year\n\nAMD's new Radeon RX 9000 series graphics cards could help boost gaming revenue when they launch sometime in the first quarter, but the company will be up against brand-new RTX 50 series graphics cards from Nvidia. Nvidia's new cards bring some fancy AI-powered tech, and there's little reason to believe AMD's competitive position will meaningfully improve in the pricier portions of the market that Nvidia tends to dominate.\n\nAMD has historically been far more competitive in the lower-end portion of the market, where prices stay below $300. AMD's RX 7600 card is the company's most recent budget option, although older-generation graphics cards like the RX 6600 remain widely available. Nvidia has been largely ignoring this part of the market -- even the four-year-old RTX 3060 still sells for around $300.\n\nAs AMD battles Nvidia in the high end of the market, a surprising comeback from Intel (INTC -4.68%) will provide stiff competition in the low end. Intel entered the graphics card market in late 2022 with its Arc Alchemist cards, but software issues derailed the effort. The company didn't give up, and its second-generation Battlemage cards are far more potent.\n\nIntel's B580 was called \"the new $249 GPU champion\" by reviewers at Tom's Hardware. The company has greatly improved its software drivers and brought enough performance gains to the table to make its new midrange graphics card a highly attractive option for gamers on a budget. The B580 wipes the floor with AMD's similarly priced RX 7600, and it even edges out the pricier RX 7600 XT on average.\n\nIntel also offers the $219 B570, which reviewers at Ars Technica called \"the cheapest good graphics card.\" Intel has packed in enough performance at a low-enough price to make the B570 a compelling option for the most cost-conscious PC gamers.\n\nThis is the environment that AMD finds itself in as it prepares to launch its new RX 9000 graphics cards. The company will likely start with higher-end cards and then fill in its lineup over time, giving Intel months as the undisputed budget gaming king. While Intel won little market share last time around, its Battlemage graphics cards are poised to be big winners. They're reportedly selling out everywhere, and prices are elevated due to high demand.\n\nA minor headwind\n\nAMD is far more diversified today than it was even a few years ago. The gaming business is still important, but the company's PC CPU, server CPU, and AI accelerator businesses are capable of driving growth even if gaming sales continue to lag.\n\nStill, gaming could continue to drag down the company's results this year, even with the RX 9000 launch looming. With Nvidia dominant in the high end and Intel making a play for the low end, AMD could see its graphics market share contract further in 2025.",

(NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other growth stocks.\n\nKevin Mahn, President & CIO at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, recently appeared on CNBC on January 6 to discuss the current market momentum and emphasize the need for investors to be selective in 2025 to find growth opportunities. He highlighted that while the MAG7 have led the market recently, their leadership may not continue. Mahn referenced historical data, noting that since 1950, there have been nine instances where the market rallied by 20% or more, with the market rising in eight of those cases. However, he pointed out that gains in the following year averaged only 3.6%, indicating a need for careful selection. He also acknowledged recent market trends, including a decline in the S&P 500's performance and a potential shift in investor sentiment following events like the Santa Claus Rally.\n\nHe predicted a path of lower interest rates, expecting 50 basis points of cuts this year instead of the previously anticipated 100 basis points. Mahn suggested that this environment would create favorable conditions for stocks and bonds but urged investors to diversify beyond mega-cap tech stocks into sectors like biotech and aerospace. Earlier on January 3 as well, Mahn noted that after two consecutive years of gains, a third year of strong performance appears unlikely. He remarked that it seems the Grinch got in the way of the Santa Claus rally this year.\n\nHe also addressed concerns from investors tempted to time the market or sell their holdings. He warned against trying to time the market, describing it as often futile. Instead, he advocated for rebalancing portfolios to align with long-term goals and risk tolerance. He suggested that the economic landscape is changing, with lower interest rates and stagnant economic growth expected moving forward. Mahn advised investors to take profits from sectors that previously led the market and consider reallocating those funds into different areas poised for future growth. He highlighted biotech as a promising sector, noting bipartisan agreement on the need to lower drug prices. This shift could lead large-cap pharmaceutical companies to seek new revenue sources, making smaller biotech firms attractive.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe first sifted through online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. We then selected the stocks with high 5-year revenue growth and high analysts' upside potential.

However, X (formerly Twitter) user MEGAsizeGPU shared on the platform that this budget CPU, expected to be more affordable than the AMD Ryzen 5 7500F launched in July 2023, is now on sale in China.\n\nPC builders, at least those living in China, can now get the Ryzen 5 7400F for CNY 849, which translates to $115.90 (including 13% VAT) based on the exchange rate at the time of writing. If we disregard the sales tax, that could bring the processor's price to around $100.\n\nThis makes it far more affordable than the current cheapest AM5 processor, the Ryzen 5 7500F, available on Amazon and Newegg for around $165 or more. However, that assumes that AMD will sell it in the U.S. market for the same price. But if it does so, the $50 price difference will allow more budget builders to upgrade to the AM5 chip much more affordably without sacrificing too much performance.\n\nThe Ryzen 5 7400F has almost the exact specifications as the Ryzen 5 7500F. Both chips have the same 3.7 GHz base clock and 65-watt TDP, six cores/12 threads, and 6MB L2 cache + 32MB L3 cache. The difference is the lower 4.7 GHz boost clock on the Ryzen 5 7400F versus 5 GHz on the Ryzen 5 7500F.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nIt appears that the Ryzen 5 7400F will also be more affordable than the Phoenix-based Ryzen 5 8400F, and it\u2019s also expected to perform better because of the former\u2019s 32-MB L3 cache, which doubles what\u2019s available for the latter. Given that the Ryzen 5 8400F is currently priced around $150 on Amazon and Newegg, it would make the Ryzen 5 7400F one of the most affordable chips you can get today (assuming AMD keeps the price similar to China) that still performs reasonably well for the average gamer.\n\nUnfortunately, we haven\u2019t seen any listings for the Ryzen 5 7400F in the U.S. and Canada. We also don\u2019t know when it will arrive on store shelves and retail stores, but once they do, it will go perfectly well with the Intel Arc B580 GPU (if you know where to find one), allowing you to build the ultimate budget gaming PC for around $600.",

Despite that, by AMD's own estimates, it seems like it will probably perform around the same level as the GeForce RTX 5070. That's far off from the higher-end NVIDIA GPUs, which would seem to prove true the early rumors that AMD's next GPU generation would focus on the mid-range and skip the enthusiast market entirely.Those rumors originally originated with a fellow on the Chinese-language ChipHell forums, and now, another fellow on that site is saying the opposite for their successor. ChipHell poster zhangzhonghao is a well-known leaker with a long history of leaks (some more accurate than others), and he just posted up some information regarding the plans of \"agricultural enterprises\" in 2026.According to the leaker, AMD's next-generation GPUs based on its unified GPU technology known as \"UDNA\" will be fabricated on TSMC's N3E process . N3E is the second generation of TSMC's N3 process and reduces power consumption by 30-35% at a given performance level. Alternatively, it can offer 10 to 15 percent higher performance at the same power level. At this time, it is basically the bleeding edge of processor fabrication, although we imagine that next year both TSMC's N2 and Intel's 18A will be available.That's not all zhangzhonghao had to say about AMD's GPU plans, though. According to his post, AMD is going to shoot for the GPU performance crown once more. He specifically says that AMD will make a flagship GPU with a big GPU core once again , and while the machine translation is idiosyncratic, we believe what he's saying is that AMD CEO Lisa Su already announced this. We're not sure what he's referencing if that understanding is correct, but he also could be saying that it was formerly leaked on ChipHell.Besides the UDNA news, zhangzhonghao also shared some other AMD tidbits, as you have probably already seen in the screenshot above. AMD's next-generation desktop processors have already been leaked to feature a major revision to the cIOD chiplet, where the Ryzen 9000 \"Zen 5\" processors use the same cIOD from the Ryzen 7000 processors. According to zhangzhonghao, these chips will be fabricated using TSMC's N4C process, while the Zen 6 CCDs will be fabricated on N3E like the UDNA GPUs.Possibly even more exciting is that several APUs (processors with powerful integrated graphics) will supposedly be seeing the addition of 3D V-Cache. That seems to include AMD's just-announced Strix Halo processors as well as the SoC that will be used in Sony's PlayStation 6 . Contrary to the machine translation in the screenshot, the leaker says that he does not have information about Microsoft's Xbox plans, not that Microsoft itself is uncertain (although that could be the case regardless.)In any case, none of this hardware is going to show up until next year at the earliest, so there's plenty of time for what ultimately comes to market to change. These leaks are promising, though\u2014and doubly so if the Radeon RX 9070 XT ends up being a quality product. Even if you're a die-hard NVIDIA fan, competition is good for everyone.",

Its price tag is just 849 RMB/$116, making it a compelling option for budget users.\n\nAMD's Ryzen 5 7400F Zen 4 CPU Targets Providing Great Value For Budget Users, Coming In With a 6-Core Configuration\n\nIt seems like AMD isn't ready to give up on its Zen 4 CPU architecture, as just recently, the firm launched a new Ryzen 5 7400F CPU model intended to target the budget segment. Despite Team Red unveiling the processor, we never really had an idea of what to expect in terms of its retail pricing, but fortunately, the CPU has been listed on the Chinese marketplace (via @MEGAsizeGPU), revealing an impressive launch price of around $116, making it one of the cheaper options available in the lineup.\n\nThis pricing could certainly vary depending on how VAT taxes are applicable across each nation, so expect this CPU to retail somewhere around $100-$110. In terms of specifications, the Ryzen 5 7400F is a 6-core and 12-thread chip featuring a base clock of 3.7 GHz and a boost clock of 4.7 GHz. Compared to its superior counterpart, the Ryzen 5 7500F, the base clock is identical, but the boost is 300 MHz lower. Interestingly, the Ryzen 5 7400F won't have integrated graphics, and users will require a discrete GPU solution to power their displays.\n\nImage Credits: AMD\n\nAnother important point to note is that this model won't be available at retailers compared to other models, since AMD tends to distribute these SKUs first to system integrators, and then through the retail channels. So, the CPU will be featured first in pre-built PCs, but that won't be the best way to squeeze the most value out of it. Pair it up with a chipset such as the B650 or even the lower-end A620, and the processor will be one of the best options for budget builds out there.\n\nNews Source: Videocardz",

However, generational performance improvements will still be delivered through the latest Zen 5 architecture and a more advanced TSMC manufacturing process.\n\nAMD's Threadripper lineup continues to deliver high-performance processors for enthusiasts and demanding workstation users. The company is sticking with the same successful formula for the upcoming Threadripper 9000 series, codenamed \"Shimada Peak.\" These new chips have been spotted in shipping manifests, courtesy of Everest on X, providing an early look at core configurations and more.\n\nThe shipping manifest, sourced from NBD, a logistics company, reveals that AMD is preparing 96-core, 64-core, 32-core, and 16-core variants for the Threadripper 9000 series. Notably, all the listed SKUs share a 350W TDP, which is identical to the \"Storm Peak\" CPUs they are likely set to replace.\n\nAt the top of the lineup is the 96-core, 192-thread powerhouse, featuring a massive 12 CCDs, each with eight cores and 32MB of L3 cache. This adds up to a total of 384MB of L3 cache.\n\nThe design closely mirrors that of the existing Threadripper Pro 7995WX processor. However, the efficiency and performance gains from the Zen 5 architecture, coupled with a newer TSMC process node, offer significant improvements. Expect better performance-per-watt compared to the Zen 4 chips.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum is the 16-core variant, which features dual 8-core CCDs, delivering substantial power for tasks that require high single-thread and moderate multi-thread performance.\n\nOverall, the Shimada Peak series' core configurations appear to be tailored to meet the needs of a broad range of users, from professionals seeking maximum parallel processing power to enthusiasts looking for more mainstream options.\n\nWhile the shipping manifest references the SP6 socket (LGA-4844) introduced with AMD's EPYC 8004 series (codenamed Siena), it's unlikely the Threadripper 9000 series will use this socket. As Tom's Hardware points out, their electrical layouts are incompatible, despite the physical similarities between the SP6 and sTR5 sockets. Instead, these new CPUs should be compatible with sTR5 motherboards using the TRX50 or WRX90 chipsets.\n\nAMD's commitment to supporting the sTR5 socket for at least two generations is a welcome move, as previous socket transitions haven't always been this user-friendly. This compatibility offers a degree of future-proofing for those investing in such a high-end platform.\n\nThat said, AMD has not yet officially confirmed the Threadripper 9000 series, but these leaks align with rumors pointing to a launch later this year.",

It is stated that the next-generation Ryzen family, codenamed Medusa Ridge, will be featuring the Zen 6 CCD and will utilize the N3E process technology. The CPUs will also feature an upgraded IO die that will utilize the N4C process node, a cost-effective version of the N4P process technology. AMD uses the same IOD as the Zen 4 chips on its Zen 5 offerings, so an upgraded IO die will lead to better I/O & iGPU capabilities.\n\nPrevious reports suggest that the AMD \"Medusa\" range of Ryzen Desktop CPUs will retain AM5 socket compatibility and feature a singular CCD with up to 32 cores, a doubling of the core count versus previous Zen 4 CCDs.

This unified architecture will be based on the N3E process technology from TSMC, at least for gaming products as per the rumor.\n\nIt is also stated that the UDNA lineup will be the return of the enthusiast-grade options in the Radeon stack, which will be a good follow-up to the RDNA 4 \"Radeon RX 9000\" family which covers the mainstream segment. AMD's UDNA GPUs are expected to enter mass production by Q2 2026 and will feature a brand-new architecture design & will also be integrated into next-gen consoles such as the PS6.\n\nBesides the next-generation Ryzen & Radeon families, AMD will also be updating its 3D Stacking portfolio with new options available for both its next-gen Halo APU family, and Sony is expected to go onboard with 3D stacking with consoles too. It is stated that the specific packaging technology is not yet known. It is also unclear if the 3D stacking here means the different Core IP stacks or the 3D V-Cache technology, but we can expect a mix of both.\n\nAMD has a very strong portfolio of products coming out this year, especially on the mobility front, so next year, we will see the move to the next-generation Zen 6 and UDNA architectures, which are going to redefine the PC segment.\n\nNews Source: HXL (@9550pro)",

            "content": "Several months have passed since a Ryzen Threadripper 9000 (codenamed Shimada Peak) tip hit the rumor mill. However, a new one has emerged, featuring key specs on upcoming variants. Everest on X discovered a shipping manifest featuring 64-core and 32-core SKUs with a 350W TDP.\n\nThe Threadripper 9000 series is the successor to the existing Threadripper 7000 (codenamed Storm Peak) series. Up to now, we've seen mentions of the SKUs with 16, 32, 64, and 96 cores, the same as Storm Peak. We suspect that there should be a 24-core variant, too.\n\nAssuming AMD's recipe hasn't changed with Shimada Peak, we're likely looking at eight cores per CCD and a single I/O die. Therefore, the 16-core and 96-core variants that previously leaked would sport two CCDs and 12 CCDs, respectively. The 32-core SKU should have four CCDs, whereas the 64-core model may incorporate eight CCDs. The L3 configuration is unlikely to change, so 32MB per CCD. The 16-, 32-, 64-, and 96-core chips should have 64MB, 128MB, 256MB, and 384MB of L3 cache onboard, respectively.\n\nAlthough the shipping manifest lists the SP6 socket (LGA 4844), it's improbable that Threadripper 9000 would use it. AMD introduced the SP6 socket for the EPYC 8004 (codenamed Siena) series, which targets the server space. Despite their physical similarity, the SP6 and sTR5 sockets don't share the same electrical layout. As a result, Threadripper 9000 should be drop-in compatible with sTR5 motherboards with the TRX50 (HEDT) or WRX90 (workstation) chipsets, depending on whether AMD goes with vanilla or the Pro versions. PCIe 5.0 connectivity will stick with Shimada Peak. Of course, the motherboard will require a firmware update to accommodate the new chips.\n\nThe 350W TDP for the 64-core and 32-core models backs up previous rumors claiming the exact power specifications. If true, AMD the Threadripper 9000 series will have the same TDP (or the same maximum TDP at the very least) as AMD's outgoing Ryzen 7000 Threadripper chips. The main upgrade Threadripper 9000 will bring is the introduction of AMD's Zen 5 architecture, boosting per-core performance over the previous generation.\n\nAMD hasn't revealed any information about the Threadripper 9000 series. However, word around town is the new Zen 5-powered monsters could launch later this year.",

            "content": "Advanced Micro Devices stock had a terrible run on the market in 2024, losing almost 21% of its value, while the broader PHLX Semiconductor Sector index clocked healthy gains of 24% during this period.\n\nIn fact, AMD has been underperforming the broader semiconductor industry over the past five years. This is evident from the 141% gains clocked by AMD during this period as compared to the 170% jump in the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index in the last five years. AMD's below-par performance can be attributed to multiple factors.\n\nThe weakness in the personal computer market following the novel coronavirus pandemic, the soft demand for gaming consoles, and the chipmaker's failure to jump onto the artificial intelligence (AI) bandwagon while rival Nvidia ran away with this market have all contributed toward AMD's underperformance.\n\nWhile there is a good chance that AMD may be able to regain its mojo in the future thanks to multiple catalysts, this semiconductor stock could still end up underperforming two other companies that are benefiting from the rapid proliferation of AI. Let's take a closer look at those two names and see why they could end up overtaking AMD's market cap over the next five years.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR -4.63%) stock has surged a stunning 301% in the past year, leading to outstanding growth in its market cap. As the following chart shows us, Palantir's market cap has jumped significantly, and it is now very close to AMD's level.\n\nLooking ahead, it won't be surprising to see Palantir's market cap exceeding that of AMD within the next five years. A big reason why that may happen is that customers are lining up to deploy Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) so that they can integrate generative AI into their business processes to drive greater efficiency and productivity.\n\nAs a result, Palantir is now growing at a faster clip. Its revenue growth has improved in recent quarters on account of an increase in the customer count, while the increased adoption of AIP by existing customers is positively impacting its margin profile.\n\nAnalysts are expecting Palantir to deliver $2.8 billion in annual revenue for 2024, which would be a 26% jump from the prior year. The company's top line is expected to grow at 20%-plus rates for 2025 and 2026 as well.\n\nHowever, don't be surprised to see Palantir recording stronger growth than analysts are expecting on account of the rapid adoption of AI software platforms by both government and commercial customers. Palantir's overall customer base increased by 39% year over year in the third quarter of 2024 to 629. More importantly, its net dollar retention rate came in at 118% for the quarter, which was a solid improvement over the year-ago period's reading of 107%.\n\nThe net dollar retention rate compares the trailing-12-month revenue generated by Palantir's customers at the end of a quarter to the trailing-12-month revenue recognized from those same customers in the year-ago period. So, a reading of more than 100% means that its existing customers are adopting more of its offerings.\n\nAlso, the expansion in the net dollar retention rate is an indication that AIP is indeed driving stronger customer spending, as management pointed out on the previous earnings conference call. The good news for Palantir investors is that the AI software market is just taking off, and it could soar remarkably in the long run.\n\nABI Research estimates that the AI software market was worth $98 billion last year, and that figure could grow at an annual rate of 30% through 2030 to $391 billion. It is worth noting that Palantir has started matching this market's growth already, as its revenue in the third quarter of 2024 increased 30% year over year to $726 million. The company's earnings grew at a faster pace of 43% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAs Palantir's AI software business gains more momentum thanks to its quickly expanding customer base, there is a solid chance that it will be able to grow at a faster pace than the overall AI software market and gain more share in this space. This is precisely the reason why Palantir stock could continue soaring over the next five years. It may even be worth more than AMD as it is one of the leading players in the AI software platforms market.\n\n2. Arm Holdings\n\nArm Holdings (ARM -3.98%) is another stock that has witnessed a stellar jump in the past year, with gains of 100% as of this writing. Not surprisingly, the gap between Arm and AMD's market cap has closed down significantly in the past year.\n\nKnown for licensing its chip architecture and intellectual property (IP) to major chipmakers such as Nvidia, Samsung, Qualcomm, and consumer electronics giant Apple, Arm Holdings has a solid business model that should set it up for years of outstanding growth. Apart from receiving a licensing fee from customers who purchase its licenses to design chips, the British technology company also gets a royalty from each chip that's manufactured using its IP.\n\nInvestors should note that Arm is the dominant player in the smartphone market, as its architecture powers 99% of smartphone application processors. It is also a key player in the Internet of Things market, as well with 54% of IoT devices containing processors designed using its IP. And now, Arm Holdings is gaining ground in the cloud computing and networking equipment markets as well.\n\nIts share of cloud computing chips has increased to 15% in fiscal 2024 from 9% in fiscal 2022. Meanwhile, its networking equipment market share has jumped to 28% from 23% over the same period. This improvement isn't surprising as major chip designers such as Nvidia are using Arm's architecture to design server processors that are powering AI systems in data centers.\n\nMoreover, Arm's margin profile has also received a big boost thanks to the higher royalty that its latest generation Armv9 architecture commands because of its AI capabilities. This explains why Arm's earnings are expected to grow 31% in the next fiscal year to $2.04 per share, following a 23% increase in the current one to $1.56 per share. Even better, Arm is expected to sustain its outstanding momentum after a couple of fiscal years as well.\n\nIt won't be surprising to see Arm sustaining its momentum for a longer period and record healthy growth over the next five years. That's because the overall semiconductor market is expected to exceed $1 trillion in annual revenue in 2030 as compared to $627 billion last year. As the overall value of chips sold increases over the next five years, Arm should witness robust growth in its revenue and earnings thanks to its solid customer base and improving influence in the global chip market.\n\nAnd that's precisely why Arm could be worth more than AMD after five years, considering that the latter has to contend with stiff competition from the likes of Nvidia and may have to wait for a long time for segments such as gaming to step on the gas once again.",

Luckily the listings were screenshotted by longtime hardware leaker @momomo_us before they were removed.\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 XT: Specs\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\nThere haven't been any clear cut leaks, rumors, or reports about the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT's performance, or the performance of RDNA 4 in general. We can surmise, however, that the card won't be a 4K powerhouse thanks to its price point range.\n\nThe previous hope was that the flagship RDNA 4 GPU would be slightly faster than the 7900 XT.

Instead, AMD could be reaching for an overall much larger target audience by scaling back on the performance and therefore the price.\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9070 XT: What to expect\n\nRight now there isn't much concrete news on the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics card and on the RDNA 4 at large, due to AMD not having the time to elaborate on it during its CES 2025 conference.\n\nWhile there are plenty of rumors and a few scant official details including a possible preorder date - the latter thanks to an interview and retailer leaks - we don't have a clear picture as to what this card will be like right now in terms of exact pricing, specs, and performance.\n\nHopefully AMD will give us the low down on the RX 9070 XT and any other RDNA 4-powered graphics cards in the future.",

The new architecture focuses on optimization, with potential support for FSR 4 across RDNA 3 and 4. Power efficiency improvements may lead to cost-effective cooling solutions.\n\nAMD's next-gen Radeon RX 9070 XT shouldn't be much further from being detailed, with new gaming performance leaks arriving to tease what to expect from RDNA 4.\n\n3\n\nVIEW GALLERY - 3 IMAGES\n\nIn a new video from leaker Moore's Law is Dead, we're getting a look at the flagship RDNA 4-based Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics card being benched against the RX 9070 XT, and the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and RX 7900 XT graphics cards based on the RDNA 3 GPU architecture, as well the RX 7900 XT.\n\nPopular Popular Now: Skyblivion, the fan remake of Oblivion in Skyrim's engine, nears completion\n\nThe benchmarks include Black Myth: Wukong (RT on High, 1080p upscale to 4K), Hitman 3 (High settings), F1 23 (High settings), Shadow of the Tomb Raider (Ultra settings), and finally, Cyberpunk 2077 (RT + Ultra settings). You can see that the new RX 9070 XT either falls just short of the RX 7900 XTX, equals it, or just beats it (we're talking about 1FPS more).\n\n3\n\nNot great, not bad... but RDNA 4 is all about optimization and tweaks under hood, with MLID leaking out with ray tracing (RT) benchmarks of the new RDNA 4 GPU and that is far more surprising. With RT enabled, the new Radeon RX 9070 XT smokes the RDNA 3-based RX 7900 XTX and RX 7900 XT, and the RX 7900 non-XT almost doubles the performance of the RX 7800 XT, too.\n\nRDNA 4 will be exciting, but so too will be FSR, which an MLID source working for AMD leaked: \"What I (AMD) can tell you about FSR 4 is that we think people will be pleasantly surprised by the drastic quality uplift over FSR 3.1, and what you've seen so far at CES is only an alpha build! Oh, and although I heard the initial FSR 4 launch will only support RDNA 4, there is currently at least a plan to support RDNA 3 and RDNA 3.5 as well\".\n\n\"Eventually, we want there to be two branches of FSR 4 - one that fully leverages RDNA 4's hardware, and one that brings as many of the newer features as possible to RDNA 3/3.5 by leveraging their more limited (although better than RDNA 2) hardware\".\n\nAMD's new Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics card benchmarked leaked by MLID, we're looking at 304W for the flagship RDNA 4 GPU, and just 220W for the RX 9070. That should make for cheaper coolers, meaning cheaper prices for Radeon RX 9070 series \"RDNA 4\" graphics cards.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nConsumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025 revolved around AI. If not, it\u2019s all that exhibitors could show. Talking about the highlight of the show, it was undoubtedly the keynote from Jensen Huang. The keynote included new products to advance gaming, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and agentic AI. Huang kicked off his talk by reflecting on the company\u2019s 3-decade journey. Later on, he highlighted several significant advancements.\n\nTakeaways From CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s Keynote at CES 2025\n\nAs per Huang, AI has been advancing at an \u2018incredible pace.\u2019 It started with perception AI, meaning understanding images, words, and sounds. Then it came to generative AI, meaning creating text, images, and sound. And now, it\u2019s the era of physical AI, meaning AI that can proceed, reason, plan, and act. The AI giant introduced GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, which are powered by Blackwell architecture. These GPUs provide significant improvements in AI-driven rendering, enhancing gaming and creative workflows. Furthermore, Huang unveiled \u201cCosmos,\u201d which is a suite of foundational AI models capable of generating photorealistic video. The models have been designed in such a way that train robots and automated systems more efficiently, further advancing robotics and autonomous technologies.\n\nThe company and its partners have rolled out AI Blueprints for agentic AI, which includes PDF-to-podcast for efficient research and video search and summarization for assessing significant quantities of video and images \u2014 allowing developers to build, test, and run AI agents anywhere.\n\nAgentic AI- Road Ahead in 2025\n\nTechInformed interviewed experts from leading technology companies to explore predictions about Agentic AI. As per Steven Webb, UK chief technology and innovation officer, Capgemini, 2025 will see wider adoption of small language models (SLMs) and AI agents as an era of Agentic AI is fast approaching. Using multiple SLMs throughout a toolchain is expected to play a critical role in the AI evolution. This will include going beyond the already familiar LLMs such as GPT.\n\nFurthermore, Alan Jacobson (chief data and analytics officer at Alteryx) believes that 2025 will see the rise of Gen AI agents used to solve problems. This is an approach that is made possible by reducing costs and improving the performance and speed of LLMs. Frameworks for orchestrating Agentic AI work are expected to emerge. Notably, a large percentage of use cases are expected to start to employ this approach.\n\nStory Continues",

AMDGPU native context support for VirtIO to allow for using native OpenGL and Vulkan graphics drivers within guest virtual machines for better performance.VirtIO native context support was talked about back in March 2023 for better VM performance with AMD graphics by allowing the native hardware drivers to be used within supported VirtIO environments, which for now predominantly means QEMU and KVM-based VMs. Using the native hardware drivers can mean much better GPU performance within VMs rather than resorting to the likes of Virgl/Venus as the conventional open-source path for enabling 3D acceleration within guest VMs.\n\n\"This MR implements native context support for amdgpu: this enables to use native drivers (radeonsi, radeonsi_drv_video and radv) in a guest VM (QEMU+kvm is the only supported setup currently).\n\n\n\nBesides performance which seems better than virgl/venus (but I only tested 1 Vulkan game and a couple of GL ones so...) the main advantage I see is maintenance: the guest uses the same drivers, except that they don't speak directly to libdrm(_amdgpu) but instead go through a virtio/qemu transport layer. This can be see for in the enablement patches (last 2 of the series) which are quite small.\"\n\n\"With the current protocol Unigine Heaven and Superposition are more or less running at 99% the host speed.\"\n\nAMD engineer Pierre-Eric Pelloux-Prayer explains in the now-merged MR for this feature:One of the most exciting takeaways from this work:More details for those interested within this merge enabling the functionality for both the AMD Radeon drivers RadeonSI Gallium3D and RADV Vulkan.Update: More background information on the native context effort via VirtGPU DRM Native Contexts Show Potential For Good VM Gaming Performance",

In 2024, AMD declined by ~18%, sharply underperforming the Semiconductor Index (SOX), which posted a 19% gain.\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving strong buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nThis underperformance might seem puzzling at first glance. As a key player in the AI arena, the Lisa Su-led company is widely regarded as the most viable challenger to Nvidia\u2019s dominance in the AI chip market. However, the past year\u2019s stock performance reflects lingering market skepticism about the company\u2019s ability to truly capitalize on its AI potential.\n\nLooking at the company\u2019s situation, Loop Capital analyst Gary Mobley thinks that right now AMD is at the \u201ccross-section between the changing system hardware architecture of general-purpose compute and accelerated compute.\u201d\n\nMobley believes there are several key questions investors are mulling over right now: Can the progress being made in AMD\u2019s GPU-based data center system architecture compensate for the slowdown in the general-purpose CPU server market? Will NPU-driven (neural processing unit) edge AI applications result in a PC replacement cycle? And how effectively can AMD capitalize on Intel\u2019s struggles to accelerate market share growth in the PC and CPU-based general server sectors? Finally, how much of a challenge will Arm licensees pose to AMD in the traditional X86-based CPU market?\n\nThat\u2019s quite a list but Mobley\u2019s take is one the bulls will appreciate.\n\n\u201cOur view is that AMD will prove more triumphant in these market shifts versus what the equity markets seem to give the company credit for,\u201d the analyst opined.\n\nStill, as Mobley concedes, sentiment remains \u201cquite low.\u201d There are reasons for that, of course. PC sales saw out 2024 on a \u201csour note,\u201d which could lead to subdued PC-related revenue for AMD in the first half of FY25. Additionally, investor expectations for its AI GPU sales in FY25 have declined, dropping from around $10 billion four months ago to roughly $8 billion at the moment.\n\nYet, as is often the case, the depressed view could prove fruitful for those willing to see beyond the near term. \u201cGiven this low investor sentiment, and given the relatively low valuation, we like the risk-reward for the shares,\u201d Mobley remarked.\n\nOn that subject of valuation, currently, AMD shares are trading at 24.0x NTM non-GAAP EPS, which is below the SOX average of 29.0x. Meanwhile, the shares have been trading more like peers that have significant revenue exposure to mature markets like PCs, smartphones, and industrial sectors.\n\n\u201cIn our view,\u201d the analyst went on to say, \u201cshares should more accurately reflect: 1) some degree of success in accelerated computing (e.g., GPU-based data center compute, XPUs, etc.) and 2) idiosyncratic market share expansion opportunities in general-purpose compute within PC and general server markets.\u201d\n\nSo, down to business, what does this all mean for investors? Mobley rates AMD shares as a Buy, while his $175 price target suggest the shares will surge 47% over the coming months. (To watch Mobley\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nMost analysts are thinking along the same lines. Based on a mix of 21 Buys, 10 Holds and 1 Sell, AMD stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $173.28, the average price target makes room for 12-month returns of 46%.

            "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.92%), also known as AMD, has been a surprisingly underperforming tech stock over the past year. In 2024, it declined by 18% even despite its promising growth opportunities as a top artificial intelligence (AI) chip maker.\n\nOver the past five years, the stock has achieved gains of around 140%, and it has typically been a market-beating investment. Is it due for a big bounce-back year in 2025, or is there more trouble ahead for AMD?\n\nAMD's growth rate has been underwhelming\n\nThe name of the game in AI is growth. And that's been an area where AMD simply hasn't been delivering on lately. While the company is involved with developing AI chips, it has been lagging behind its key rival, Nvidia. While its chips may be more attractively priced, the company still has to show that demand for them will be strong.\n\nIt's little secret why Nvidia has been a red-hot investment while AMD has struggled. A look at their respective growth rates tells you the key reason behind their diverging stock valuations. While AMD's growth rate has been rising recently, it pales in comparison to Nvidia's stellar performance.\n\nFor AMD to rally this year, it needs to prove that its AI chips are competitive with respect to Nvidia. And for that to happen, its growth rate needs to improve -- drastically.\n\nDespite its sell-off last year, AMD isn't a bargain buy\n\nYou might assume that because of AMD's falling value and Nvidia's continuing to rise higher, the former might be a better value buy than the latter. However, while AMD stock may have been underperforming, that hasn't resulted in it being a cheaper option for investors today.\n\nRemarkably, due to Nvidia's phenomenal growth and impressive margins, it's still the better value buy when comparing the respective earnings multiples of these two tech companies.\n\nWhile AMD's price-to-earnings ratio has been improving in recent quarters, it still has a long way to go in getting to Nvidia's much lower multiple. The bottom line is this is another area where AMD will need to show improvement in order to win over growth investors.\n\nShould you buy AMD stock today?\n\nBoth AMD and Nvidia are promising AI stocks to own over the long term. AMD, however, still has to prove to investors that its AI chips offer formidable competition to Nvidia. If that happens, it should accelerate the company's growth rate and improve its earnings, which may shrink the gap on both of the charts above.\n\nAMD is a bit more of a contrarian pick these days, but for investors who are willing to take a chance on the growing business, buying it now can lead to some significant gains ahead -- but that's only if the company delivers on stronger earnings numbers in upcoming quarters. Nvidia is a solid stock and is the safer buy, but since it's already among the most highly valued stocks in the world, it may be running out of room to rise higher.\n\nIf you're a risk-averse investor, the best idea may be to simply hold off on buying AMD for the time being and see how well it performs as the year goes on. If its AI chips do lead to an accelerating growth rate, that could be a sign that the stock will bounce back this year and that it may soar even higher in the long run. If that doesn't happen and its earnings prove to be underwhelming, however, that could spell trouble and may lead to further declines for the stock.",

On January 14, Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments, appeared in an interview on Wealth at Yahoo Finance to share his outlook on the market and the sectors he expects to grow.\n\nMartin shared that strategists have been putting out their target price for the S&P 500 since November 2024, which happens to be particularly wide. However, in 2025, the market is seeing one of the lowest rates of standard deviation in a while. In addition to that, the rate of return based on the targets in November is around 10% which is in line with the long-term average of the S&P 500. Based on this, Martin concluded that analysts are conservative with their estimates and are not willing to make bets on the outliers.\n\nWith uncertain policies, inflation expectations, and interest rates, he believes that the market will either experience a \u201cdown market\u201d or a \u201cvery strong up-market\u201d by the end of 2025. Martin also added that he expects 15% overall earnings growth followed by a 10% rate of return, emphasizing that this combination may result in the contraction of multiples. He shared that the contraction may happen because of several factors, especially interest rates being higher than usual.\n\nMartin is extremely bullish on the financials, information technology, and communication services industries. He also expects some growth in the healthcare sector as the market broadens out. He also suggested that an optimal product portfolio will include names with strong fundamentals and sound financial performance. He added that diversification is particularly important and emphasizes the need for cash in emergency situations.\n\nAs Martin suggested, a safer portfolio is more diversified and involves names with stronger fundamentals. However, at the same time, some stocks are garnering immense traction from people on social media because of their growth potential and sound financial performance.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 11 stocks that will go to the moon we surfed through important threads and picked the 25 most popular stocks. We then examined the analyst upside for each stock and picked the top 11 with the highest upside as of January 14, 2025.

Likely to become the entry point, this low-range iGPU-less model should still pack a punch for its price.\n\nBased on Zen 4 Raphael architecture, Ryzen 5 7400F is a six-core 12-thread processor clocked at 3.7GHz base and 4.7GHz boost, manufactured using TSMC\u2019s 5nm node. As indicated by its F suffix, this CPU is deprived of any kind of iGPU portions, not even the basic dual RDNA 2 CUs found on regular Ryzen 7000 and 9000 chips.\n\nThis puts it at the bottom of AMD\u2019s AM5 stack, just behind the Ryzen 5 7500F, at least when it comes to non-APU solutions. Ryzen 5 7400F is 300MHz slower than the 7500F but packs the same 6MB of L2 and 32MB of L3 caches. Likewise, the TDP remains at 65W, which is understandable as the core layout is unchanged.\n\nAs usual with the Ryzen series, this CPU is also unlocked, allowing core and memory frequency overclocking on supported 600 and 800 series chipsets. That said, if you plan on pushing it above its original state, you may want to invest in a better cooler since the bundled Wraith Stealth will only suffice for default operation.\n\nWhile AMD only lists support for up to 128GB of DDR5 RAM in speeds topping at 5,200MT/s, we don\u2019t see any reason why this CPU would be lower than its peers. Thus, we expect real-world support to reach up to 192GB of RAM, alongside a 6,000MT/s speed sweet spot. Just note that the latter will depend on the type of module \u2013 single or dual rank \u2013 plus the number of DIMM slots in use. But hey, even if 128GB is the max, it\u2019s still more than enough for this budget chip.\n\nTalking of which, Ryzen 5 7400F in all logic should be set below the 7500F\u2019s $162. $150 or $140 seems about right, making it a compelling value-driven CPU. With entry-level motherboards available as low as $76, 7400F would be a great deal for many gamers since its main Gen 5 PCIe slot won\u2019t be a bottleneck.",

The study also found an increased number of genes linked to AMD, from 34 that were identified previously, to 60.\u201d\n\nThey also confirmed earlier beliefs that a history of smoking or alcohol use increases the likelihood of developing AMD. Although about 90% of the MVP are male enrollees, the researchers were able to confirm prior observations that women are more susceptible to AMD than men.\n\nSudha co-led the research with the late Robert Igo Jr., Dana Crawford and Jessica Cooke Bailey at the School of Medicine. They collaborated with Neal Peachey, associate chief of staff for research of the VA Northeast Ohio Healthcare System and professor of ophthalmic research at Cleveland Clinic Cole Eye Institute. The work was supported by grants to Peachey from the VA Office of Research and Development.\n\nThe study involved scientists from several VA medical centers, including Bryan Gorman and Saiju Pyarajan (both from VA Boston Healthcare System), Christopher Halladay and Wun-Shieh Wu (both from Providence VA Medical Center) and Pannos Roussos and Georgios Vodulakis (both from Mt. Sinai and Bronx VA), \u201cwho played key roles in integrating data from multiple health systems, cohorts and data types to create new knowledge of AMD biology,\u201d Sudha said.\n\nFor more information, contact Bill Lubinger at william.lubinger@case.edu.\n\nThis article was originally published Jan. 13, 2025.",

            "content": "Another fun one from Taipei since I noticed that a surprising number of folks were interested in the AMD Instinct MI325X 8-GPU baseboard handle. This is another feature of the AMD Instinct 8-GPU UBB that not many folks talk about, a small card that sits on the end opposite the UBB connectors.\n\nThis is the AMD SMC for its Instinct UBB\n\nSo far this week, I have taken apart several AMD Instinct MI300X and MI325X systems. Starting with my first one earlier this week, and when looking at a mechanical sample, I saw a slot for a card in front of the OAM slots that are used for GPUs.\n\nIn subsequent systems, the slot was populated with a card. This SMC is the management card for the UBB. It is designed to be replaced by simply removing a few screws, and then sliding the card out.\n\nUnder the heatsink is apparently an ASPEED AST2600 BMC. This is used as a management processor not for the entire server, but instead just for the UBB.\n\nFinal Words\n\nAfter taking apart several AMD Instinct MI325X systems this week, I found a number of these little features. It was actually a bit surprising just how many of these small features are built into the boards. AMD is not selling as many as NVIDIA\u2019s HGX platform, but it is leveraging UBB standards to help make it easier for systems vendors to easily integrate its 8-GPU platforms into systems. I probably did not have the full appreciation of this fact before this trip to Taipei as normally taking apart two 8-GPU systems is a lot for a week. This week, I think we have already taken apart 8-10 GPU servers so the differences and some of the nice integration features are really starting to pop out.\n\nHopefully folks like this quick look at a small feature. We should be getting back to the regular review schedule over the next few days. I have been learning a lot from taking apart systems from different vendors this week.",

            "content": "AMD has launched what may be the most affordable AM5 CPU (based on Raphael), the Ryzen 5 7400F. Like the Ryzen 5 7500F, the Ryzen 5 7400F is a hexacore binned-down version of the Ryzen 5 7600, with slower clock speeds. The chip appears to be designated for global availability it is expected to be priced lower than the Ryzen 5 7500F that currently retails for $160 at Newegg.\n\nIn July 2023, AMD introduced the Ryzen 5 7500F, which was the cheapest Raphael offering to date. With slightly slower clocks than the Ryzen 5 7600, it is still the go-to option for many budget builds. Plus, you can make up for the clock deficit, to some extent, with PBO 2 (Precision Boost Overdrive 2). Last year, AMD launched a handful of Ryzen 8000F-series processors, based on mobile Phoenix APU silicon. However, these processors have half the L3 cache of their Raphael counterparts which is shown to hamper performance in many scenarios.\n\nThe Ryzen 5 7400F offers six cores based on AMD's Zen 4 architecture alongside twelve threads. The processor retains the 6MB + 32MB cache layout, showing that it employs Raphael silicon under the hood. The base clocks stand at 3.7 GHz, similar to the 7500F, though the boost clocks take a 300 MHz hit at 4.7 GHz. With the help of PBO 2, you could potentially hit 5 GHz, but that requires manual tuning and some trial and error.\n\nThe CPU carries a default TDP of 65W and does not have an integrated RDNA GPU, so you will need a discrete graphics card for display. Like all Ryzen 7000 Raphael CPUs, the 7400F features 28 total PCIe lanes, 24 of which are usable. The boxed version of the Ryzen 5 7400F will be packaged with the standard AMD Wraith Stealth cooler, while the tray variant will require you to purchase a cooler separately.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally CPU Cores/Threads Die L2 + L3 Base/Boost Clocks Base TDP Unlocked Multiplier/PBO Ryzen 5 7600 6/12 Raphael 6MB + 32MB 3.8 GHz / 5.1 GHz 65W Yes/Yes Ryzen 5 7500F 6/12 Raphael 6MB + 32MB 3.7 GHz / 5 GHz 65W Yes/Yes Ryzen 5 7400F 6/12 Raphael 6MB + 32MB 3.7 GHz / 4.7 GHz 65W Yes/Yes Ryzen 7 8700F 8/16 Phoenix 8MB + 16MB 4.1 GHz / 5 GHz 65W Yes/Yes Ryzen 5 8400F 6/12 Phoenix 6MB + 16MB 4.2 GHz / 4.7 GHz 65W Yes/Yes\n\nAs of writing, the Ryzen 5 7400F is not listed at any major retailer but we expect the pricing to be in the ballpark of $150. This processor should offer an excellent and affordable starting point if you wish to upgrade to AM5. On the contrary, if you seek the best-in-class, Newegg is currently offering the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, the world's fastest gaming CPU, at MSRP if you bundle it with other items.",

            "content": "AMD announced the existence of its Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT today, noting Q1 2025 availability.\n\nSpecs are extremely limited right now. The company did picture several partner model cards in its announcement slide, including at least one that looks like a Yeston model, an ASRock model, XFX, and all the others listed. The cards pictured above are generally 3-slot coolers that are 2-3 slots thick.\n\nAMD says the GPUs will use its RDNA 4 architecture and will utilize a 4nm process from TSMC. AMD mostly described its specs with adjectives, which is unfortunately not particularly useful. Words like \u201coptimized compute units,\u201d \u201csupercharged AI compute,\u201d and \u201cimproved raytracing per CU\u201d don\u2019t tell us a whole lot. We\u2019ll have to wait for that information.\n\nLikewise, AMD announced that FidelityFX Super Resolution, or FSR4, will be released and has been built for RDNA 4. It intends to re-launch its Anti-Lag software solution that was intended to compete with Reflex, now in its Anti-Lag 2 iteration. We were not pre-briefed with any further information than this at the time of briefing.\n\nThe company is clearly self-aware, as it also presented a slide about its naming choices for the RX 9070 series. Go figure. The slide above shows that AMD intends to line-up the 9070 series, including both XT and non-XT models, with the RX 7900 XT down to the middle of the RX 7800 XT (read our review), whatever that means. The worst 9070 is apparently half of one RX 7800 XT -- or maybe that means 1.5 7800 XTs? All we\u2019re missing is a note telling us that the image is not to scale.\n\nAnyway, against NVIDIA, this roughly positions the 9070 series as comparable, according to this image, to the 4070 Ti (watch our review) and 4070 Super (read our review). We won\u2019t get out our scrying stones for this hastily thrown-together image since it\u2019s hard to judge without real numbers, but that\u2019s at least how AMD seems to be positioning it.\n\nThe company claims the change is to line-up with its Ryzen 9000 CPUs and says it will reserve 8000 naming for its mobile CPUs.\n\nAMD CPUs\n\nOur fully custom 3D Emblem Glasses celebrate our 15th Anniversary! We hand-assemble these on the East Coast in the US with a metal badge, strong adhesive, and high-quality pint glass. They pair excellently with our 3D 'Debug' Drink Coasters. Purchases keep us ad-free and directly support our consumer-focused reviews!\n\nOn the CPU side, AMD\u2019s two new desktop CPUs are predictable: The 9950X3D and the 9900X3D, which use the Zen 5 architecture that shipped at the end of last year and follow-up the wildly successful 9800X3D. The 9800X3D has been constantly out of stock due to the demand.\n\nThe 9950X3D is a 16C/32T part that advertises a maximum boost frequency of \u201cup to 5.7GHz,\u201d noting a 144MB total cache size. At the time of writing this, AMD has not provided pricing details or a specific release date beyond sometime within the next few months.\n\nFor comparison, the 9800X3D (read our review) has a total 104MB cache and $480 MSRP. The advertised boost of the 9800X3D is 5.2GHz, so the 9950X3D has a greater cache size and may benefit from higher boosting. The 144MB cache on the 9950X3D comes from the additional CCD in the configuration and could have some specific benefits that we\u2019ll explore in our eventual review.\n\nThe 9900X3D is a 12C/24T component that advertises up to a 5.5 GHz boost max. It has a 140MB total cache. The 9950X3D runs a 170W TDP, with the 9900X3D at 120W. The 9800X3D is also 120W. Because of this, the 9800X3D may benefit from additional power available during fully loaded workloads. There could be some shuffling of the CPU stack in specific benchmarks due to the power budget differences.\n\nAMD\u2019s updated chipset drivers should more intelligently park CCDs and, in theory, should make it easier to upgrade in-socket without needing to blow away the whole OS prior to moving from a single-CCD part to a dual-CCD part. We will still be using isolated SSDs for our reviews, but this should be a benefit for end users who may later seek to upgrade in-socket.\n\nAMD published some first-party claims. As usual, we\u2019ll have our own numbers soon -- as will basically all other reviewers -- and so you should wait for those prior to making decisions. To set the stage for what we\u2019re verifying against, AMD is claiming the following:\n\nAMD says this is \u201cthe world\u2019s best gaming processor,\u201d though note that they are comparing it to the 7950X3D (watch our review). The 9950X3D is shown as being on average 8% better across 40 games that AMD tested, with a range of no change to a 58% uplift over baseline compared to the 7950X3D.\n\nAMD also claims that it outperforms the 285K (read our review) by 20% on average across 40 games. We definitely believe this, based on numbers we ran for the 9800X3D and 285K already.\n\nIts first-party numbers also point to performance improvement in Blender, with lesser improvements in Photoshop and Premiere in PugetBench testing against AMD\u2019s own prior processor.\n\nHistorically, these CPUs do not necessarily provide significant improvements over the single-CCD X3D CPUs of the same generation. You might see rough equivalence or slight changes in specific games. The primary advantage would be for someone who does a lot of gaming but also wants the additional cores for production workloads.\n\nThe other historical challenge has been behavior with core parking, something we\u2019ve now detailed extensively. While core parking is still a \u201cthing,\u201d AMD says its new chipset drivers should resolve a lot of the past issues.\n\nAMD Z2 SOC\n\nAMD\u2019s Z2 SOC follows-up the Z1 and Z1 Extreme mobile solutions that were found on some handheld devices. AMD has also offered mobile chips like the 7840U and 8840U that have been in handheld devices and are comparable.\n\nThe Z2 is light on information: AMD again defers to descriptors like \u2018breathtaking\u201d and \u201cexhilarating speed,\u201d which we assume is the next speed setting for a Back to the Future movie.\n\nIt also gets into some business-y stuff, like the addressable market and increase in competition in this market.\n\nAs for actual news, the Z2 family comes in 3 variations currently known: The Z2 Extreme, Z2 Go, and the\u2026Z2 non-Extreme, non-Go.\n\nThe Z2 Extreme and Z2 are both 8C/16T parts with the same cache and a boost frequency separated only by 100 MHz. The actual change comes in the form of the integrated graphics. This is also where the Z1 and Z1 Extreme deviated most heavily. The configurable TDP allows up to 5W more driven to the Z2 Extreme, which will cost battery life but help power the GPU. The Z2 has a higher boost clock despite a lower cTDP, likely due to overall package budget allocation with the GPU change (and also density).\n\nThe Z2 Go is new. This is a 4C/8T part that only boosts to 4.3 GHz maximum advertised, only has 10 MB of cache, keeps the 15-30W cTDP, and keeps the 12 CUs. This CPU is far weaker than the others listed here, especially with that clock drop, so we\u2019re curious to see what types of devices make the best use of it. We\u2019ll also be curious to see battery life and if it can stick closer to that 15W number while still providing meaningful performance.\n\nThese are all listed for Q1 2025 availability, so we\u2019ll be busy on our team running handheld benchmarks once again here soon.

We don\u2019t really test mobile, but we certainly use high-end laptops for our travel and might try these out.\n\nThe 9955HX3D is a 16C/32T part that boosts up to 5.4GHz. It has 144 MB of cache and a TDP of 54W. The 9955HX is the same, but with less cache. The 9850HX is a 12C/24T part with lower boost, no X3D cache by mercy of its easier name, and the same TDP.\n\nAMD also spent some time on its new \u201cAI\u201d brand name mobile processors, but we\u2019ll leave that to someone else to cover as that\u2019s not really our area of focus.",

The company took a two-pronged approach to its initial unveiling, with Ryzen AI 300 mobile chips for laptops and Ryzen 9000 desktop chips for PC builders interested in gaming, creation, and beyond. These chips are now widely available.\n\nMore importantly for PC gamers, the company has unveiled a few of its Ryzen 9000X3D CPUs. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D launched first on November 15, 2024, and it's now expected to be joined by Ryzen 9 X3D siblings following a CES 2025 announcement.\n\nAMD also bolstered its mobile CPU lineup with the announcements of \"Fire Range\" HX/3D chips for gaming, AMD Ryzen AI 5 and 7 chips for mid-range Copilot+ PCs, and AMD Ryzen AI Max chips for premium Copilot+ PCs. Here's where AMD's Zen 5 landscape stands in 2025.\n\nRecent updates\n\nWhat's new with AMD's Zen 5 CPUs?\n\nAMD at CES 2025 Replay - YouTube Watch On\n\nAMD used its opportunity at CES 2025 to go big on Zen 5 processor news. The major announcement is the new Ryzen 9 9950X3D desktop CPU that AMD claims is \"the world's best processor for gamers and creators.\" It was revealed alongside the Ryzen 9 9900X3D.\n\nAMD's claim rides heavily on the back of its exclusive 3D V-Cache technology. AMD stacks the CPU's cache vertically on the die rather than around the die, which allows for increased cache space and lower latency. The cache is what the CPU uses for fast, frequent, and temporary storage, and the unique design significantly boosts performance in games. Part of the Zen 5 architecture redesign moved the cache below the CPU's cores, allowing the cooler to be more effective where it's needed most.\n\nWhile the Ryzen 7 9800X3D focuses primarily on gaming with its stacked cache, AMD has added a secondary cache to its new Ryzen 9 X3D CPUs. The max-frequency unstacked cache benefits creative work.\n\nImage 1 of 3 A look at the Ryzen 9 9950X3D's gaming performance compared to its predecessor, the 7950X3D.

(Image credit: AMD) AMD shows a 10% average increase in creative app performance compared to Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K. (Image credit: AMD)\n\nAMD focused on the Ryzen 9 9950X3D in its showcase. It's claiming that you can expect an 8% average increase in 1080p gaming performance compared to the Ryzen 9 7950X3D predecessor, as well as a 13% increase in creative apps compared to the same Zen 4 chip. Compared to the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K, AMD says you can expect a 10% average increase in creative apps.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

AMD has stated that it expects the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D to launch in Q1 2025.\n\n3D V-Cache is headed back to mobile CPUs\n\nA look at AMD's three new HX-series chips, including the flagship 9955HX3D with 3D V-Cache. (Image credit: AMD)\n\nWhile the desktop Ryzen 9 9950X3D CPU stole a lot of attention, AMD slid in a new mobile chip using 3D V-Cache.\n\nAMD claims that its new Ryzen 9 9955HX3D \"Fire Range\" mobile CPU is \"the world's best gaming and content creation mobile processor,\" coming at you with 16 cores, a 5.4GHz boost frequency, 144MB cache (with the 3D stacked tech) and a 54W TDP.\n\nIt's joined by the Ryzen 9 9955HX and the Ryzen 9 9850HX, each lacking 3D V-Cache that makes them better suited for a focus on creativity. All three of these CPUs are expected to launch in the first half of 2025.\n\nAMD debuts new Zen 5 mobile CPUs at CES 2025\n\nA look at some specs from AMD's new Ryzen AI Max mobile CPUs. (Image credit: AMD)\n\nAMD's time at CES 2025 held a lot of new mobile chips, with the most powerful coming out of the Zen 5 era. While the Ryzen AI 9 300 mobile CPUs were announced in 2024 \u2014 I have an explanation below \u2014 AMD has bolstered the lineup with new Ryzen AI 7, Ryzen AI 5, and a \"Halo\" series known as AMD Ryzen AI Max.\n\nAMD made some bold claims about its new Ryzen AI 300 Max series, going so far as to say that the flagship Ryzen AI Max+ 395 CPU is faster than an RTX 4090 when it comes to some AI workloads. Whether it's true or not, AMD's redesigned memory interface that allows for up to 96GB of system RAM to be used on the integrated GPU (with 256GB/s bandwidth) is the main driver behind these claims.\n\nHere's a look at the lineup of AMD Ryzen AI Max mobile CPUs expected to launch in the first half of 2025.\n\nSeven new AMD Ryzen AI Max chips are expected to land in the first half of 2025. (Image credit: AMD)\n\nAMD did not stop there. Also coming to the Zen 5 party are new AMD Ryzen AI 7 and AI 5 mobile CPUs. These are intended for more affordable PCs, and the PRO variants will slot nicely into business laptops. Here's a look at the lineup.\n\nAMD expands its Ryzen AI 300 chips with four new options coming in the first half of 2025. (Image credit: AMD)\n\nThese new mobile Zen 5 CPUs are expected to arrive in laptops in the first half of 2025. The non-PRO models come first, with the business-minded chips arriving later.\n\nAMD reveals the Ryzen 7 9800X3D in October 2024\n\nMeet the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Processor - YouTube Watch On\n\nAMD confirmed that the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is its next flagship gaming CPU in a video posted on October 31, 2024. It has 8 cores, 16 threads, a 5.2GHz boost clock, and 104MB of total cache space. Its base frequency is 500MHz faster than the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, pushing it to 4.7GHz.\n\nAlso confirmed is the 9800X3D's ability to be overclocked. Ryzen 7000X3D could technically be overclocked with some extra legwork and tools, but the process should be much easier with the Zen 5 chip.\n\nAMD is promising an 8% average performance uplift (tested in more than 40 popular games) for the 9800X3D compared to the 7800X3D. AMD also took the fight to Intel's latest Core Ultra 9 285K desktop chip, claiming on average a 20% performance in the 40+ games tested. Intel focused a lot more on productivity with its latest chips, so this doesn't come as much of a surprise.\n\n\ud83d\udc40 Read our Intel Core Ultra 9 285K review\n\nFurthermore, some extra info about the second-gen 3D V-Cache has been revealed. As was rumored, AMD moved the L3 cache to be closer to the core complex die (CCD), allowing for enough of a cooling improvement to unlock for overclocking.\n\nWhat is AMD Zen 5?\n\nAMD's Ryzen AI 300 chips are from the Zen 5 lineup. (Image credit: AMD)\n\n\u201cZen 5\u201d represents AMD's next-generation desktop and mobile processors. It\u2019s the name of the architecture used for Ryzen 9000 and Ryzen AI 300 chips, bringing a number of improvements over last-gen \u201cZen 4\u201d hardware.\n\nAs was rumored in the lead-up to AMD\u2019s official announcement, Ryzen 9000 desktop CPUs offer up to 16% better instructions-per-clock (IPC) as well as more cache. They use the AM5 socket just the same as Zen 4 chips, and AMD says it plans on supporting the chipset \u201cthrough 2027 and beyond.\u201d That's good news for builders who hate upgrading every couple of years.\n\nNew X870E and X870 chipsets for AM5 motherboards were unveiled, sporting support for PCIe 5.0, DDR5 memory, USB4 connectivity, and Wi-Fi 7 wireless internet. They're now widely available, with more affordable B850 and B840 boards expected to launch in 2025.\n\nAMD Ryzen 9000 desktop CPUs\n\nAMD's Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X are the first two Zen 5 desktop PCs to launch. (Image credit: Future | Ben Wilson)\n\nAMD showed off four new Ryzen 9000 desktop CPUs at Computex 2024, including Ryzen 5, Ryzen 7, and Ryzen 9 options. The Ryzen 7 9700X, like its Zen 4 Ryzen 7 7700X predecessor, has eight cores and 16 threads. The Zen 5 chip has 40MB of cache (compared to 32MB), as well as a slightly higher 5.5GHz boost frequency. It runs at a 65W base TDP, which is impressive considering the Ryzen 7 7700X sits at a 105W default TDP.\n\nThe flagship Ryzen 9 9950X also brings a larger cache compared to its Zen 4 predecessor. However, it runs at a similar 170W TDP with a 5.7GHz boost clock compared to the Ryzen 9 7950X.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the specs that make up the chips.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Header Cell - Column 0 Cores/Threads Base/Boost Freq. Cache TDP AMD Ryzen 9 9950X 16 / 32 4.3GHz / 5.7GHz 80MB 170W AMD Ryzen 9 9900X 12 / 24 4.4GHz / 5.6GHz 76MB 120W AMD Ryzen 7 9700X 8 / 16 3.8GHz / 5.5GHz 40MB 65W AMD Ryzen 5 9600X 6 / 12 3.9GHz / 5.4GHz 38MB 65W\n\nAMD's Ryzen 9000 CPUs suffered a short delay due to a mislabeling issue, but it quickly fixed its mistakes and launched the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X on August 8, 2024 (about a week after the delayed original launch date). The Ryzen 9 9900X and Ryzen 9 9950X launched on August 15.\n\nJust three months later, AMD entered the market with its Ryzen 7 9800X3D gaming processor, which immediately sold out everywhere and continues to be hard to find at a reasonable price in January 2025. Revealed at CES 2025 were a couple of new Ryzen 9 X3D CPUs, which are expected to launch in Q1 2025.\n\nAMD Ryzen 9000 review highlights and benchmarks\n\nThe Ryzen 7 9700X is more power efficient and more powerful than its Ryzen 7000 predecessor. (Image credit: Ben Wilson | Windows Central)\n\nWindows Central Senior Editor Ben Wilson got his hands on the Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 chips to test and review, coming out with favorable results in both cases.\n\nIn his Ryzen 7 9700X review, in which he awarded it a Windows Central Best Award, Wilson remarked:\n\n\"AMD is delivering a multi-punch knockout with the Ryzen 7 9700X, as it drops the MSRP from its previous-generation 7700X and even returns to the 65W power draw of its 5700X. It comes with caveats, and the generational multi-core improvements are barely worth mentioning. However, its single-core performance is a thing to behold, ranking above most of Intel's comparable chips at 125W. Plus, it matches AMD's own gaming CPU champion, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, while remaining cheaper and more power efficient \u2014 it's the new mid-range champion.\"\n\nIt looks like AMD took a safe approach to its Zen 5 desktop CPUs, with a focus on lowering the power draw and keeping the chips within a reasonable price range. The performance isn't wildly different, but there's a ton of room for overclocking. With Intel's 13th and 14th Gen chips suffering from instability and degradation issues caused by elevated voltages, one can only hope that AMD's desktop CPUs remain stable.\n\nAMD's Ryzen 5 9600X should prove popular for anyone putting together a budget PC. (Image credit: Ben Wilson | Windows Central)\n\nWilson also reviewed the Ryzen 5 9600X; he wasn't as impressed with it as with the new Ryzen 7, but he handed it a Windows Central Recommended Award. Wilson said:\n\n\"In a masterclass of performance-per-watt efficiency, AMD offers incredible single-core performance scores that beat its intended 14600K rival and even challenge the 14700K. However, generational multi-core bumps are so minor that anyone running Ryzen 7000 chips or Intel 13th to 14th Gen won't see any real benefits. The 9600X is for entry-level builders starting with AM5, whether upgrading from much older platforms or starting from scratch; and even then, in-house competitors like the 7700X and 7800X3D will be more tempting to some crowds.\"\n\nHere's a look at performance comparisons between the new Ryzen 9000 chips and their primary competition that we've also tested.\n\nImage 1 of 7 AMD Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X CPU-Z results sorted by single-core (Image credit: Windows Central | CPU Monkey) AMD Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X Cinebench results sorted by single-core (Image credit: Windows Central | CPU Monkey) AMD Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X Geekbench results sorted by single-core (Image credit: Windows Central | CPU Monkey) AMD Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X 7-Zip results sorted by multi-core (Image credit: Windows Central | CPU Monkey) AMD Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X CPU-Z results sorted by multi-core (Image credit: Windows Central | CPU Monkey) AMD Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X Cinebench 2024 results sorted by multi-core (Image credit: Windows Central | CPU Monkey) AMD Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X Geekbench 6 results sorted by multi-core (Image credit: Windows Central | CPU Monkey)\n\nAMD's Ryzen 9 9900X and Ryzen 9 9950X CPUs launched on August 15, 2024, and Senior Editor Ben Wilson put them to the test in a joint Ryzen 9 9900X and 9950X review. Here's what he had to say:\n\n\"It's indisputable that the Ryzen 9 9950X is the world's most powerful consumer CPU, but it comes at a cost, both literally and through hardware requirements. You'll need a capable cooler to keep this 170W beast under control and performing its best, but it'll deliver the best metrics for creative apps. On the other hand, the 9900X stands up to Intel's 14th Gen Core i9-14900K at a lower cost, but both chips only make sense for those upgrading from much older hardware.\"\n\nFinally, Wilson reviewed the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, handing it a Windows Central Best Award and 4.5 (out of 5) stars. Its gaming performance proved unbested in Wilson's testing, and he came to this conclusion:\n\n\"Make no mistake: the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming CPU, politely dethroning its predecessor as the new king of the hill as a cache-heavy monster. However, it's not winning any awards for productivity. It isn't worth installing into a PC that spends most of its time crunching numbers in Microsoft Office and Teams since the 9900X and 9950X dominate that category, but it's a far better pick for gamers than anything from Intel's modern productivity-centric offerings.\"\n\nWith AMD's latest Ryzen 9 X3D chips expected in Q1 2025, any creators who need extra performance for gaming AND creative apps now have improved CPU options.\n\nAMD Ryzen 9000 pricing and availability\n\nAMD launched its Ryzen 9000 desktop CPUs with a certain MSRP in mind, and in October 2024 it cut the prices of the non-X3D models. Here's what you can expect to pay as we settle into 2025, with the original MSRP and new lower prices included.\n\nThe Ryzen 5 9600X has a $279 $250 MSRP that's $10 cheaper than its predecessor.

(Image credit: AMD)\n\nThe other side of AMD\u2019s Zen 5 Computex announcement involves new Ryzen AI 300 chips for laptops. This is the \u201cStrix Point\u201d lineup of processors, with Zen 5 CPU cores, RDNA 3.5 GPU Compute Units (CU), and XDNA 2 NPU.\n\nAMD lays claim to the \u201cworld\u2019s most powerful NPU\u201d with 50 TOPS of power for local AI acceleration, and that claim will stand for the foreseeable future. Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus chips hit 45 TOPS, while even Intel\u2019s next-gen \u201cLunar Lake\u201d chips are expected to have a 45 TOPS ceiling.\n\nThis is especially important for Copilot+ features in Windows 11, which require an NPU with at least 40 TOPS. Laptops with AMD\u2019s Ryzen AI 300 chips will eventually receive access to the advanced AI features just like our favorite Copilot+ PCs; until then, the major benefits of Ryzen AI 300 appear to be all-day battery life and strong performance.\n\nHere's a look at the two Ryzen AI 300 chips announced so far by AMD.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Header Cell - Column 0 Cores/Threads Base/Boost Freq. NPU TOPS TDP/cTDP Graphics AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 12 / 24 2.0GHz / 5.1GHz 50 28W / 15-54W AMD Radeon 890M AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 10 / 20 2.0GHz / 5.0GHz 50 28W / 15-54W AMD Radeon 880M\n\nThe two Ryzen AI 300 mobile chips feature the same NPU with 50 TOPS but otherwise different specs. The Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 is the flagship chip with 12 cores and 24 threads. AMD has split the cores between Zen 5 and Zen 5c, the latter being more efficient and slightly less powerful than the former. The Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 has a boost frequency up to 5.1GHz, a 28W TDP (configurable between 15W and 54W for manufacturers), and AMD Radeon 890M graphics.\n\nThe Ryzen AI 9 365 falls to 10 cores and 20 threads, with a 5.0GHz boost clock and the same TDP numbers. Its Radeon 880M GPU is slightly less powerful than the 890M due to it having four fewer CUs.\n\nThe ASUS Zenbook S 16 is the first laptop we tested with AMD's new chips\n\nThe ASUS Zenbook S 16 (UM5606) is equipped with AMD's Ryzen AI 300 chips. (Image credit: Ben Wilson | Windows Central)\n\nWhile ASUS is the first laptop manufacturer to get AMD's new Ryzen AI 300 chips into our hands, other big brands like Acer, HP, Lenovo, and MSI are also building AI PCs around the new CPUs.\n\nWindows Central's Ben Wilson reviewed the ASUS Zenbook S 16 (UM5606) favorably, handing it a Recommended Award. Here's what he had to say concerning performance:\n\n\"As expected, the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 sits comfortably between devices featuring Intel's Core Ultra 7 155H mobile processor in Geekbench 6, given that the Zenbook S 16 runs at the same 28W when its fan profile is set to 'Performance Mode' in the MyASUS companion app. It's exciting to see AMD pull ahead of Apple's M3 chip in a $1,999 14-inch MacBook Pro (16GB RAM) in multi-threaded performance, but single-core scores are still firmly in the macOS camp; not that many modern apps would utilize it.\"\n\nBattery life is also stellar; Wilson said:\n\n\"If ASUS is using AMD's new processors to expand its place in the AI PC category, it needs to keep up with the extraordinary battery life offered by competing devices, including its own ARM-based Vivobook S 15. Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chips boast a breakthrough in all-day battery life (and sometimes beyond) that eclipses more power-hungry x86-64 Ryzen chips. With that in mind, a 13-hour and 11-minute result from the 'Modern Office' battery drain benchmark in PC Mark 10 ranks among true \"all day\" devices, coming in only one hour behind the Vivbook S 15.\"\n\nComing at about $1,400 for a model with a Ryzen AI 9 365 CPU, 24GB of RAM, 1TB SSD, and 3K OLED touch display, ASUS is offering a lot of laptop at a competitive price.",

            "content": "When it comes to semiconductor stocks, it seems like all anyone can talk about is Nvidia. With the launch of the company's new Blackwell graphic processing unit (GPU) architecture underway, I'm not particularly surprised that Wall Street remains largely bullish on Nvidia.\n\nBut in the background, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.92%) is quietly gaining some ground on Nvidia in GPUs -- the high-powered chips used in many artificial intelligence (AI) applications -- despite the incumbent's dominating presence. Below, I'm going to analyze the full picture at AMD and make the case for why I think the stock is a better buy than Nvidia during the next 10 years.\n\nHere is what everyone is missing about AMD\n\nThe table below breaks down revenue and gross profit growth figures for both AMD and Nvidia during the third quarter.\n\nCompany Revenue Growth (% Year Over Year) Gross Profit Growth (% Year Over Year) AMD 18% 24% Nvidia 94% 95%\n\nNot only is Nvidia a much larger business than AMD, but its sales and profit margins are growing at a much faster pace. Although this may imply that AMD is far behind its rival, I see the growth figures above as a bit of an illusion.\n\nIf you look at the segmented results in the chart below, it becomes clear that AMD's data center business is thriving. Unfortunately, the company's gaming and embedded segments are declining across sales and gross profit -- thereby dragging down the company's overall results.\n\nWhat's even more encouraging is that AMD's data center revenue is now growing at nearly the same rate as Nvidia's. In other words, growth from Nvidia's data center GPU operation is decelerating at the same time AMD's is beginning to show signs of scaling.\n\nWhen in doubt, zoom out\n\nAccording to data compiled by Jon Peddie Research, Nvidia controls a staggering 90% of the AI GPU market. Coming in at a very distant second is AMD, which boasts an estimated 10% market share.\n\nSimilar to the growth figures I analyzed above, I see Nvidia's tight grip on the GPU market as somewhat misleading. For much of the past two years, Nvidia did not have any competition in the data center GPU sector. This first-mover advantage played a huge role in the company's ability to grab significant market share.\n\nHowever, in December 2023, AMD introduced its MI300 series of AI accelerators in an effort to start competing more directly with Nvidia's GPUs. In just one year, AMD has been able to scale its own data center GPU operation and acquire just enough incremental market share to make a dent in Nvidia's growth.\n\nConsidering AMD already has a line of successor GPU architectures scheduled to release between this year and 2026, I think the company is well on its way to becoming a challenger to Nvidia.\n\nAMD's valuation is too good to pass up\n\nTo me, an investment in AMD shouldn't revolve around whether you think the company will surpass Nvidia or become a larger player in the GPU realm. Rather, by taking a hard look at the trends explored throughout this article, I think there is a valid case to be made that AMD is in the early stages of exponential growth whereas Nvidia's trajectory during the next decade could slow.\n\nNevertheless, the market appears to be discounting this narrative entirely. As I write this, AMD is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 23 -- its lowest level in a year.\n\nIn my eyes, AMD's data center business will eventually reach a point at which its accelerating growth takes over and washes out any sluggish activity in other non-core segments such as gaming. At the same time, wider adoption of AMD's accelerators should help the company continue acquiring incremental market share in the GPU landscape.\n\nShould this play out, the narrative surrounding AMD could quickly change and the shares could begin to witness some revival as investors flock toward a new growth opportunity beyond Nvidia. I think now is a lucrative time to take advantage of the current price action and buy the dip in AMD stock.",

            "content": "For the first time in a while, I\u2019m considering buying one of the most exciting tech companies in the Nasdaq: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Based on my valuation model, the stock could deliver a 35% compound annual growth rate in price over the next three years. In addition, it appears to have a 35% margin of safety for investment at this time. As a semiconductor company well-positioned to capitalize on long-term AI demand, the stock has a strong operational context. Given these factors, I am bullish on AMD stock.\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving strong buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nAMD\u2019s Recent Downtrend Reveals an Attractive Entry Point\n\nIn the last six months, AMD stock is down by approximately -35% in price. This creates a potential buying opportunity when the company\u2019s medium-term growth prospects are placed alongside the new valuation that has emerged. To illustrate the value opportunity, consider that the stock had a GAAP price-to-earnings ratio of around 400 in March 2024, but it is now just over 100. Moreover, the company\u2019s price-to-sales ratio has dropped from 15 in March 2024 to just 7.8 today.\n\nWhile Nvidia (NVDA) has the most dominant moat in AI infrastructure provision with its world-class graphics processing units, AMD is shrewdly focusing its resources on capturing the AI inference market. This market requires different computational capabilities compared to the AI model training market, and is also expected to be more protracted, allowing for less cyclical dynamics in growth.\n\nAMD\u2019s Data Center segment\u2019s revenue grew by 122% year-over-year in Q3 2024, and the company expects similar growth to continue, supported by the release of new products like the MI350 series in late 2025. While the market was clearly disappointed by AMD\u2019s lowered guidance for Q4 2024 and Fiscal 2025, the market sell-off of AMD\u2019s stock that followed is seen as an opportunity for value investors.\n\nBased on my research and calibrated with the Wall Street consensus estimates, a compound annual growth rate of about 20% in AMD\u2019s revenues over the next three years is likely. In addition to this, the company\u2019s net margin is most certainly going to expand significantly over the next three years due to cyclical dynamics, where AMD is entering a profit harvesting phase after a heavy investment period where it positioned itself to capitalize on new compute demand.\n\nTo put this growth potential into perspective, AMD\u2019s financial projections highlight significant earnings power. At a net margin without non-recurring items of 35% in December 2027, this will lead to a net income without non-recurring items of $15.75 billion if it has total revenue of $44.5 billion. In addition, with a moderate increase in the company\u2019s outstanding shares over the next three years to about 1.9 billion (aligning with historical trends), the company will have an earnings per share without non-recurring items of $8.30. This outlook is a strong foundation to invest from.\n\nAMD Stock Could Be Worth $290 in Three Years\n\nI\u2019m bullish on AMD stock for the substantial 35% compound annual growth rate I could achieve over three years if the stock hits my price target of $290. The company\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio without non-recurring items is currently nearly 39. I consider this approximately fair, but I do think that a moderate contraction in this is likely by December 2030 due to saturation in the current AI-related upcycle.\n\nThe fair value is further elicited by a future three-year earnings per share without non-recurring items consensus estimate of 39.5% compared to 27.1% as an actual historical three-year annual average, and a price-to-sales ratio of 7.9 versus a 10-year median of 5.45.\n\nAt a price-to-earnings without non-recurring items ratio of 35 in December 2027, the company\u2019s stock price will be $290, given my estimate that it will have $8.30 in earnings per share at the time.\n\nAdditionally, AMD\u2019s weighted average cost of capital is 16.84%, with an equity weight of 98.61% and a debt weight of 1.39%, where equity costs 17.03% and debt costs 3.75% before tax. When discounting back my December 2027 price target of $290 to the present day using the company\u2019s weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate, the implied intrinsic stock value at the moment is $180.\n\nAs the current stock price is $115, the implied margin of safety for investment is 35%.\n\nWhat Is the Target Price of AMD?\n\nOn Wall Street, AMD has a consensus Moderate Buy rating based on 20 Buys, nine Holds, and one Sell. The average AMD price target indicates a 50% upside potential over the next year. Given this outlook, I feel even more confident in my independent analysis and three-year price target of $290.\n\nSee more AMD analyst ratings\n\nKey Takeaway: AMD Stock Is an Opportunity Worth Considering\n\nInvesting in the best companies in the world is not just about buying into a company\u2019s operational and financial strengths. In addition, valuation is perhaps the most important (and often overlooked) quality of an investment that capital allocators must focus on to achieve the greatest alpha possible. Six months ago, AMD\u2019s stock price was too expensive, but at this valuation, I think the medium-term returns have the potential to be exceptional.\n\nDisclosure",

I have taken apart at least two AMD Instinct MI300X / MI325X systems this week in Taipei, plus a few other fun servers. I finally asked a question that I felt ashamed to simply ask. What is this thing on these big GPU baseboards?\n\nThis is a Fun AMD Instinct MI325X 8-GPU Baseboard Feature\n\nAs a quick refresher, the AMD Instinct MI300X was the 192GB HBM3 memory GPU that comes in an OAM form factor. Eight of these come on a Universal Baseboard (UBB), and that assembly is roughly in line with a NVIDIA HGX 8 GPU platform, except NVIDIA has the NVLink Switch architecture on its HGX 8 GPU platforms.\n\nThe AMD Instinct MI325X is the HBM3e update with 256GB of HBM3e memory for higher capacitity and more memory bandwidth. It comes in a very similar platform. In the front of the platform\u2019s massive heatsink array there is a big black metal piece.\n\nHere is the other side where there is another one of these metal towers fitting around the PCIe retimer heatsink.\n\nWe had to swap an AMD Instinct MI325X 8-GPU baseboard today and these things are heavy. The shipping box with foam is around 39.5kg or 87lbs. Those black metal loops I was told are actually handles to simply help move the giant assembly.\n\nAfter being left in the dust by a gentleman who used these handles and replaced the entire UBB in under 90 seconds, I just had to double-check that I had seen these in systems before and never knew. Here is a fairly clear photo from the 2021 Inspur NF5488A5 8x NVIDIA A100 HGX Platform Review and we can see the metal handle here as well.\n\nThe funny part is that I have seen these handles for years and across many systems, and just never knew what they were.\n\nFinal Words\n\nModern 8-GPU assemblies from AMD and NVIDIA are heavy because they require a lot of metal in their heatsinks. Even the liquid cooled coldplate versions may look smaller, but the copper blocks are often heavy. Having these handles makes handling these expensive baseboards much easier.\n\nMaybe in the new year there is a key takeaway here: just ask a question even if it seems silly. The purpose of this post is that if I had the question, then there is a good chance someone else has a similar one.",

            "content": "When it comes to semiconductor stocks, odds are that companies such as Nvidia (NVDA -4.05%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.92%) are the first that come to mind. Both companies specialize in designing advanced chips called graphics processing units (GPUs), which are essential components for training generative AI models and machine learning.\n\nOver much of the last two years, Nvidia has emerged as the undisputed leader in the chip realm thanks to its long line of GPUs relative to what AMD has to offer. However, there is another part of Nvidia's computing and networking business that rarely gets spoken about -- and yet it's this very feature that has allowed Nvidia to remain in a market-leading position when it comes to data center GPUs.\n\nBelow, I'm going to explain what makes Nvidia such a force, and I'll detail AMD's latest move as it seeks to compete more closely with its rival, and how the chip king is responding.\n\nNvidia has a hidden gem in its business...\n\nGPUs in data centers are constantly running sophisticated computations around the clock. But how do these chipsets work, and what's actually powering them?\n\nFor Nvidia, the answer resides in its compute unified device architecture (CUDA), a software platform that layers on top of its GPUs. Although the company's chips can technically run on other platforms, developers are going to be limited in what they can accomplish. For this reason, using CUDA in conjunction with Nvidia GPUs is the optimal solution to take advantage of their large range of features.\n\nBuilding an end-to-end suite featuring tightly integrated hardware and software has helped Nvidia acquire a 90% share of the data center GPU market. Nevertheless, AMD appears to have a response up its sleeve, and it could just be the catalyst that leads to more accelerated growth for the Nvidia rival.\n\n...but AMD is raising the stakes\n\nWhile Nvidia undoubtedly has an enormous lead over AMD, there are some subtle signs that the company may be losing its grip on market dominance. As I explained in another article, sales of Nvidia's data center GPUs are showing some notable signs of deceleration. And at the same time, AMD's GPU business has scaled up considerably -- now growing at a rate similar to that of Nvidia's operation.\n\nOne reason for AMD's sudden surge is the overwhelming success of its MI300X accelerators, which have Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms as customers. Although each of these big tech companies is also a major Nvidia customer, it's notable that they are diversifying their GPU clusters and beginning to migrate toward lower-cost alternatives offered by AMD.\n\nIn addition to AMD's accelerators, the company also offers a software platform called ROCm. While CUDA has been more widely adopted than ROCm to date, I think the differing trends between the data center operations offered by Nvidia and AMD could signal that ROCm is poised for a breakout move as AMD seeks to acquire incremental market share in GPUs.\n\nNvidia's latest deal is a chess move for the ages\n\nI don't think I'm the only one who has noticed AMD's rapid growth in the data center GPU market over the last year. In late December, Nvidia closed a $700 million acquisition of a company called Run:ai, a start-up based in Israel that describes its specialty as \"efficient cluster resource utilization for AI workloads.\"\n\nI see the Run:ai acquisition as an incredibly savvy decision, as it underscores Nvidia's approach to remain a tightly integrated ecosystem for its customers on which AI workloads are trained. As a result, I think it's going to become even more challenging for customers to migrate away to alternatives such as AMD's ROCm.\n\nWhile I remain bullish on AMD and believe the company is making a lot of important strategic moves, I do not think ROCm is a checkmate move against Nvidia. For now, Nvidia remains safely on the throne as the king of the GPU realm.",

            "content": "AMD's delay in unveiling RDNA 4 GPUs was purely a tactical move, as Team Red was eager to witness what NVIDIA brought to the table with the RTX 50 series release.\n\nAMD's RDNA 4 GPU Series Might Potentially Overthrow Competition Through Impressive Price-to-Performance Figures\n\nWell, we were pretty surprised when Team Red didn't give RDNA 4 the event spotlight and instead released slides that mentioned subtle details about the SKUs, such as the Radeon RX 9070 XT and the RX 9070. Despite AMD claiming that they did this in order to give the RX 9070 series a standalone showcase, Chiphell's forum nApoleon claims that this move was a planned strategy, as the firm was waiting for what NVIDIA does with the RTX 50 \"Blackwell\" showcase, and come back with a stronger response.\n\nFor those unaware, the GPU markets have turned out quite differently this time, which might favor mainstream consumers instead of high-end GPU buyers. AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA are all focused on bringing a higher price-to-performance ratio with their budget-oriented offerings, which is why Team Green's RTX 5070 has seen a drop in MSRP when compared with the Ada Lovelace counterpart. Similarly, Intel's Arc Battlemage B580 also comes with impressive perf/$ figures, which has heated the mid-range segment massively.\n\nWith AMD, it is claimed that the RX 9070 series will \"change everything\" for the GPU markets, and early leaks have shown us impressive performance out of the RDNA 4 SKUs. AMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT managed to beat NVIDIA's RTX 4080 SUPER in initial testing. Considering that Team Red might release this particular SKU within the $500-$700 price range, it will ultimately become difficult for NVIDIA to pitch its GPUs to the mainstream markets, considering the value Team Red has brought onboard.\n\nIt is said that the RX 9070 series has already been shipped to retailers and is ready to be sold to consumers, but AMD's decision to delay the release has held them back for now. Whether this move turns out the right way for Team Red is something to consider later on, but by the looks, the RX 9070 series might become a compelling option, bringing massive on-launch demand. We might see the official showcase in the upcoming days, with preorders rumored to start by 23rd January.",

(NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nAs 2025 began, King Lip, chief strategist and partner at BakerAvenue Wealth Management expressed his bullish outlook for tech stocks in 2025 during a CNBC interview. He underscored a strong belief in the continued outperformance of tech stocks in 2025, driven by robust earnings growth and ongoing investments in AI infrastructure. Here\u2019s a short excerpt from our article on the 12 Best Technology Stocks to Invest In for the Long Term that covered this:\n\n\u201c\u2026Lip was against the prevailing sentiment among investors that big tech has peaked and that funds should rotate into smaller stocks or other themes. He argued that the recent weakness in the tech sector is largely due to technical rebalancing rather than a fundamental downturn. He emphasized that cash is likely to flow back into leading tech stocks, as they are projected to deliver the highest earnings growth in 2025, with an anticipated earnings increase of over 20%.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging the high valuations of many tech stocks, he argued that they remain within acceptable historical norms. On January 9, Mark Avallone, president at Potomac Wealth Advisors, joined \u2018The Exchange\u2019 on CNBC to discuss why technology is the best sector to invest in right now. He asserts that above-target inflation will prevent the Fed from implementing further easing measures, countering the notion that higher rates are detrimental. He noted that market rates have surged to all-time highs, with a significant increase of 1,800 points since October 2023. Avallone emphasizes that tech stocks, particularly cash-flowing mega-cap and large-cap companies, have shown resilience against rising rates, attributing this to improved operational efficiencies and ongoing technology spending even in a slowing economy.\n\nAvallone highlighted recent deal chatter in the tech sector, including Shutter Stock\u2019s potential acquisition in the uniform space, reflecting growing interest in technology-driven solutions. He is optimistic about the incoming administration\u2019s impact on economic efficiencies and stock performance, particularly for large-cap tech firms and mid-cap companies focused on innovation. He views Hilton favorably for its technological advancements in office management and cost efficiency. In the defense sector, he expressed confidence in Boeing\u2019s growth potential, emphasizing that significant cuts to defense spending are unlikely and that advancements in tech will enhance military capabilities.\n\nStory Continues",

The 7900 XT isn't quite as powerful as an RTX 4080 Super, but it has heaps of VRAM and is great for 1440p gaming. Throw in the Ryzen 9 CPU, 32 GB of fast DDR5 RAM, and 2 TB of storage, and you have a fantastic build here for less than $1,700.\n\nIf you're an AMD fan-person, this iBuyPower gaming PC might be right up your alley, however you feel about the imminent new generation of graphics cards. The iBuyPower Y40 has been a favorite of ours over the past few months, frequently offering up stellar prices for some serious gaming horsepower (a moment of silence for the $999 RTX 4070 build that popped up briefly in December before selling out). The latest Y40 discount to catch my eye, though, is this all-AMD one for just $1,649 at Walmart.\n\nWhy did it catch my eye? Well, apart from the fact that any build sporting an AMD GPU catches it, there's the fact that its so well-rounded in specs and that these components are packaged in a Y40 build that we rate quite highly.\n\nYou can check our Jacob Ridley's iBuyPower RDY Y40 Valorant VCTA R003 review to see the nitty gritty of the sort of system iBuyPower can build around the chassis, but essentially the Y40 is a very pleasantly crafted bit of kit. Decent cooling, good cable management, solid parts, a nice chassis, and all for a reasonable price. The version I'm highlighting here has different specs, of course, but the core build quality should remain.\n\nBut let's get down to brass tacks, and that's the specs themselves. At the centre of this build are the dual 7900 hand-cannons, the 12-core AMD Ryzen 9 7900X and 20 GB Radeon RX 7900 XT. (Yes, that's 20 GB on the GPU\u2014none of Nvidia's stinginess, here.)\n\nThis combo, despite the CPU being a little older and the GPU being just weeks away from being outshined by a whole new generation, is more than enough for basic productivity tasks, and of course gaming. And regarding the latter, the RX 7900 XT is ideal for high refresh rate 1440p gaming or 4K gaming in all but the most demanding titles. Sure, it's not quite at the level of the RX 7900 XTX or RTX 4080 Super, but you're not paying RTX 4080 Super prices, here.\n\nAnd for the price tag, you're also getting a pretty solid all-round system: 32 GB of DDR5 RAM\u2014fast DDR5 RAM, at that\u2014and 2 TB of storage. (Hopefully system builders are starting to get the message that game installs can be big, these days.)\n\nPlus, vertical GPU mounts just look lovely, don't they? If you're proud of your all-AMD build, why not show it off?\n\nThis build should serve as a good platform to upgrade from in future, too. 32 GB of fast DDR5 RAM and a Ryzen 9 7900X should get you by even through to the RTX 60-series generation of GPUs (and whatever AMD decides to call its post-9070 generation), so if you decide to upgrade your graphics card down the line, you should be in good stead. And if you wanted more on the CPU front, the AM5 socket will let you slap in a newer X3D chip, too.\n\nAll in all, this all-AMD build is a pretty good for this $250 saving, I'd say.",

            "content": "GPU Drivers Quality\n\nIn general, all drivers have bugs that are continuously discovered and (though not always) fixed by GPU manufacturers. It\u2019s important to note that NVIDIA places significant emphasis on driver optimization for applications used by creators. This focus is why NVIDIA has divided its drivers into two series: Studio Drivers (designed for creators) and Game Ready Drivers (optimized for gamers).\n\nRegarding rumors about AMD driver instability, it\u2019s worth mentioning that many people spreading these claims are unaware of tools like DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller), which allow users to cleanly install new drivers. Failing to remove remnants of previously installed drivers, such as outdated libraries or old settings, can cause severe issues independently of the drivers themselves. The quality of AMD drivers has improved significantly in recent years. For example, Adobe published a list of drivers with known issues affecting Substance 3D Painter/Designer products. The most recent AMD driver version on that list is 21.6.1, released on June 29, 2021. AMD has since released version 24.12.1 as well as a lot of in-between versions of the driver which performed better and better with each new version.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the same Adobe compatibility list includes older NVIDIA drivers with similar issues, which highlights that driver bugs are not exclusive to AMD.\n\nRegularly updating drivers is likely to resolve more issues than it creates. New driver versions typically include fixes for previously identified bugs, so checking for updates is always advisable. Many content creators on YouTube agree that AMD drivers, when installed correctly, do not cause significant issues in creative applications when using the AMD Radeon RX 7000 series. This is a notable improvement compared to the AMD Radeon RX 6000 series, which experienced challenges with older driver versions, as mentioned above.\n\nPrice Considerations\n\nIf budget is not a concern, purchasing the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 is the best possible option as of the date of this article. The likelihood of encountering issues related to bugs, performance, or insufficient memory is as low as it gets with this GPU. However, let\u2019s also consider other viable options at lower (or significantly lower) price points that are still optimal for a 3D Artist's PC.\n\nGraphics cards with AMD GPUs generally cost less than those with NVIDIA GPUs. So, when should you save money by choosing AMD, and when is it worth investing in NVIDIA? Here\u2019s my take:",

AMD aims to dominate the mid-range market with competitive pricing and performance, focusing on improved ray tracing and FSR 4 upscaling, while stepping back from high-end competition. AMD delayed the RDNA 4-powered Radeon RX 9000 series GPU unveiling at CES 2025 to strategically counter NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 50 series launch. AMD aims to dominate the mid-range market with competitive pricing and performance, focusing on improved ray tracing and FSR 4 upscaling, while stepping back from high-end competition.\n\nAMD was meant to unveil its new RDNA 4-powered Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs at CES 2025 last week, but delayed the unveiling... which is now being called a tactical move, to hurt NVIDIA's impending GeForce RTX 50 series GPU launch.\n\n3\n\nVIEW GALLERY - 3 IMAGES\n\nIn a new post on Chiphell, user \"nApolean\" said that this was a planned move by AMD, as they were waiting to see what NVIDIA was going to do with its GeForce RTX 50 series \"Blackwell\" unveil, and then come back with a bigger, and badder response.\n\nThe only option AMD has here is to absolutely nail the lower-end and mid-range markets with its new RDNA 4 GPU, where we could see the flagship Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics card somewhere in the $500 to $700 range. NVIDIA has a starting price of just $549 for its new GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card, which the company says has \"RTX 4090\" levels of performance (with DLSS, etc enabled).\n\nAMD's new RDNA 4-based Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics card saw performance that would best the RTX 4080 SUPER in early 3DMark testing, with a 330W TDP and 16GB of GDDR6 memory. The leaked ASUS Radeon RX 9070 XT had a base GPU clock of 2520MHz and a boost clock of 3060MHz, beating the RTX 4080 SUPER in TimeSpy Extreme tests.\n\nMaybe we'll see an insanely competitive -- like almost throw-away pricing -- on the Radeon RX 9070 XT with performance that sits at around the RTX 4080 SUPER, RTX 4080, RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5070 levels of performance.\n\n3\n\nCould AMD have planned the RDNA 4 announcement at CES 2025 because it has a trick up its sleeve? No. But, it could've been a bullet the company was meant to take -- bailing on the Radeon RX 9000 series GPU unveiling at CES 2025 -- to wait to see how competitive NVIDIA would be with its new GeForce RTX 50 series.\n\nKnowing, and already admitting it has bailed on the high-end GPU market... it didn't matter what AMD did, it wasn't going to beat the huge RTX 50 series announcement. RDNA 4's unveiling was pulled, but I don't think this was premeditated. I think AMD teased the RDNA 4 unveiling knowing it wasn't going to happen, gauging reaction of not just delaying the unveiling of RDNA 4, and to gauge the reaction of PC gamers and their thoughts on the RTX 50 series.\n\nAt this point, AMD would need to sell Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs at a loss -- take the hit, knowing Ryzen, EPYC, consoles, etc are making them money -- and nail the mid-range GPU market with better RDNA 4 offerings than last-gen Ada Lovelace GPUs. Improved ray tracing support, FSR 4 upscaling, improvements in multiple areas are coming with RDNA 4, and they'll offer better experiences than last-gen GPUs.\n\nAMD isn't going to the high-end, and won't come close to the RTX 5080... never settle? Now it's yeah, we'll settle (for the mid-range GPU market) with RDNA 4.",

            "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.92%) has been a significant player in the semiconductor space for years, designing chips for everything from PCs to data centers. While many other semiconductor stocks have received a nice bump in their share price thanks to artificial intelligence (AI), AMD has thus far been left behind. The company's share price is down almost 8% over the past three years, while rival Nvidia has skyrocketed by more than 414%, as of this writing.\n\nDoes AMD's decline, plus its growing position in the AI chip market, mean the stock is a buy right now? Let's take a closer look and see if the answer presents itself.\n\nMaking inroads toward AI, but not far enough\n\nBy some measures, AMD is doing well. The company's sales increased by 18% in the third quarter (ended Sept. 28), and diluted generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share spiked 161% to $0.47.\n\nAMD plays second fiddle to Nvidia's powerful GPUs, but its processors are still popular enough to generate significant sales. AMD's data center revenue rose 122% year over year to $3.5 billion in the most recent quarter, and management estimates that data center sales for the full year will exceed $5 billion.\n\nAMD's data center segment is growing fast as companies invest mounds of cash into building more advanced AI data centers. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang believes companies will spend $2 trillion over the next five years. While AMD is clearly benefiting from this AI trend, it's falling far short of Nvidia's position.\n\nNvidia holds an estimated 70% to 95% of the AI accelerator market, and AMD doesn't have much chance to chip away at that lead. Even with its impressive data center sales gains, AMD will be in Nvidia's rearview mirror for quite some time, making the case for buying its stock less compelling than owning Nvidia.\n\nSegment slowdowns at a premium price\n\nAMD has four business segments, two of which are growing (AI and processors for clients), and two that aren't (gaming and embedded processors). Gaming revenue fell 69% year over year in the third quarter to $462 million, and embedded sales retreated 25% to $927 million.\n\nWhile AI is clearly the major draw for many potential AMD investors, it's not great to see half of the company's revenue segments experiencing falling revenue.\n\nAnother strike against AMD is that its stock is expensive. It has a price-to-earnings ratio of 112, compared to 55 for Nvidia and about 30 for the S&P 500.\n\nThe artificial intelligence market is full of stocks that are expensive right now, mostly due to their recent rapid share-price gains. But AMD, unfortunately, hasn't participated in those gains. If you're going to pay a premium for a stock, it should have some significant technological advantages over its competition or a leading position in its respective market. AMD has neither.\n\nIt's best to sit this one out\n\nI understand why AMD would be on many tech investors' list of potential buys. It's clearly benefiting from a rush of AI infrastructure spending from some of its customers. But I don't think its stock is a good buy right now because AMD doesn't seem to have a chance of taking the lead in AI processing.\n\nThe company is trailing far behind Nvidia in AI processing market share and its stock is trading at a hefty premium. Therefore, it's probably best to put this stock on your watch list for now to see if its situation improves.",

            "content": "Well, it was indeed disappointing to see AMD not showcase specifics about its RDNA 4 offerings at the CES 2025 keynote, but the whole rumor buildup, followed by what some of Team Red's officials have said about the RX 9070 series shows that the upcoming SKUs will \"change everything\" for the mainstream markets.\n\nAMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT Will Disrupt The Mainstream GPU Segment, Courtesy Of Phenomenal Price-To-Performance Figures\n\nBefore we dive into what to expect with the Radeon RX 9070 XT, it is important to take a look at how AMD is approaching RDNA 4.\n\nA few months ago, Team Red announced that they would give up the pursuit of releasing the most powerful GPU in the market, and instead focus on the area of higher demand, which is unveiling a model that not only offers excellent performance, but dominating value. This is why we saw a radical change in AMD's RDNA 4 release schedule since the firm announced only two SKUs: the Radeon RX 9070 XT and the Radeon RX 9070.\n\nWhile it won't be wrong to say that AMD leaving the \"enthusiasts\" segment makes NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5090 the most powerful SKU out there, the main interest lies in the growing competition for the throne in the mainstream markets. Based on the rumors we have seen up until now, it is certainly safe to conclude that NVIDIA would face a lot more competition in pitching its 70-class and 80-class SKUs to consumers.\n\nAMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT Specifications - Core Focus Towards Providing The Best Perf/$ To Consumers\n\nNow that we have discussed AMD's RDNA 4 approach, let's look at Radeon RX 9070 XT specifications, including what has been official and the details yet to be disclosed. The GPU will be based on the higher-end Navi 48 die (4nm), coming in with 16 GB GDDR6 memory, which is a bit of a bummer considering that Team Green has switched to GDDR7, but that's something AMD has left for the future for now. Given that the RX 9070 XT is the top-end RDNA configuration, this marks a massive drop in VRAM from the previous-gen flagship, showing that AMD isn't focused on high-end markets for now.\n\nIn terms of other necessary specifications, we are looking at a 330W TBP for AMD's reference model, which is said to be bumped up from the initially planned 265W, likely to squeeze out more performance. The RX 9070 XT could feature a 3060 MHz boost, 2518 MHz base clocks, and 4096 Stream Processors (SPs). Interestingly, AMD won't include the 12V-2x6 power connector for the reference model, but AIB partners will have an option to feature the standard, given the respective power requirements.\n\nAMD Radeon RX 9000 GPU Lineup (Preliminary):\n\nGraphics Card GPU Cores Clock (Max) Memory TBP Radeon RX 9070 XTX? Navi 48 @ 4nm 4096 TBD 32 GB GDDR6 (256-bit) TBD Radeon RX 9070 XT Navi 48 @ 4nm 4096 2570 MHz? 16 GB GDDR6 (256-bit) 304W Radeon RX 9070 Navi 48 @ 4nm 3584 2210 MHz? 16 GB GDDR6 (256-bit) 220W Radeon RX 9060 XT Navi 44 @ 4nm TBD TBD 8 GB GDDR6 (128-bit?) TBD Radeon RX 9060 Navi 44 @ 4nm TBD TBD 8 GB GDDR6 (128-bit?) TBD\n\nAMD has managed to keep details under the wraps for its RDNA 4 SKUs, which is why we are currently unaware of the extensive specifications of the Radeon RX 9070 XT. However, most of the important details have surfaced. The next big question lies in the expected performance; fortunately, we have key benchmarks.\n\nAMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT - Expected Performance\n\nBefore we dive into this portion, it is important to note that the discussed benchmarks were not under ideal conditions since RDNA 4 drivers are currently in their beta stages, and many of these test benches may not have official drivers loaded up, so the final figures may vary.\n\nJust recently, the Radeon RX 9070 XT was tested at 3DMark, and due to ease in examining the performance, we have created dedicated charts, stacking up the numbers of other counterparts in the markets.\n\n3DMark Time Spy Extreme Graphics Score 0 4000 8000 12000 16000 20000 24000 0 4000 8000 12000 16000 20000 24000 RX 7900 XTX 15114 RX 9070 XT (Rumor) 14558 RTX 4080 14443 RX 7900 XT 12977 RTX 4070 Ti SUPER 11981 RTX 4070 Ti 11323 RTX 4070 SUPER 10255 RX 6950 XT 9357 RX 7800 XT 9251 RX 6900 XT 9220 RTX 3080 12 GB 9106 RTX 3080 10 GB 8972 RTX 4070 8862 RTX 3070 Ti 8583 RX 6800 XT 7307 RX 6800 7173 RTX 3070 6709 Arc A770 16 GB 6686 RTX 2080 Ti 6602 RTX 4060 Ti 6306 RX 6700 XT 5938 RTX 3060 Ti 5802 RTX 4060 5422 RX 6650 XT 4499 RTX 3060 4082\n\n3DMark Speed Way Graphics Score 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 RTX 4080 7331 RTX 4070 Ti SUPER 6402 RX 9070 XT (Rumor) 6345 RX 7900 XTX 6280 RTX 4070 Ti 5782 RTX 4070 SUPER 5413 RX 7900 XT 5299 RTX 3080 12 GB 4892 RTX 4070 4580 RTX 3080 10 GB 4522 RX 6950 XT 4021 RX 7800 XT 3802 RX 6900 XT 3726 RTX 3070 Ti 3725 RX 6800 XT 3612 RX 6800 3321 RTX 3070 3250 RTX 4060 Ti 3246 RTX 2080 Ti 3201 RTX 3060 Ti 2905 RTX 4060 2703 RTX 3060 2568 Arc A770 16 GB 2449 RX 6700 XT 2321 RX 6650 XT 1894\n\nBased on this alone, it's safe to say that the Radeon RX 9070 XT is the best option if you are looking at something between NVIDIA's 70-class and 80-class GPUs in terms of performance. Generationally, the GPU has managed to compete with the Radeon RX 7900 XTX impressively, and despite a lower VRAM count, the RDNA 4 counterpart manages to close down on the performance gap, showing the improvement AMD has brought in with the Navi 48 silicon.\n\nSadly, we don't have any gaming benchmarks for now, but based on what we have seen up until now, expect phenomenal performance out of the Radeon RX 9070 XT. It offers great value, and when you combine the power of technologies such as FSR 4, gaming with this particular GPU will be a delight. It is ample enough for 2K or even 4K gaming scenarios, but of course, this is assumed for now.\n\nAMD's Radeon RX 9070 AIB Models - Exclusive Hands-On Preview\n\nWell, fortunately, at our visit to CES 2025, we managed to take a look at some of the AIB models of the Radeon RX 9070 XT from partners such as XFX (White & Black variants), Sapphire (Pure White variant), ASUS (TUF Gaming), and PowerColor (Red Devil), and initial impression were undoubtedly great, hinting towards the massive interest AIB partners have on this particular GPU. While we won't go into individual models in depth (already done here), here are the respective images taken exclusively at the CES 2025 show floor.\n\n2 of 9\n\nAll models were in triple-fan configuration, with different color schemes and new GPU lineups, so it's safe to say that the Radeon RX 9070 XT will debut with a diversified range of AIB models, too, with varied performance.\n\nAMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT Expected Pricing - Will Team Red Nail This?\n\nTo make this release a success, AMD needs to come up with impressive pricing that competes with NVIDIA's 70-class and 80-class models.\n\nFor reference, the NVIDIA RTX 5070 and RTX 5080 are launched at $549 and $999, respectively, and judging by this, AMD needs to price the SKUs somewhere in between.\n\nIn an interview with AMD's Chief Architecture at Gaming Solutions Frank Azor, it was claimed that the SKU could launch at around $300-$1,000 price tag, and to shorten this up, we can assume that a $600-$800 range suits the SKU a lot better.\n\nHowever, this depends on how AMD decides to proceed with RDNA 4 in general or whether it wants to offer a more improved perf/$ with the XT or the non-XT model. But it's safe to say that AMD will do wonders once the RDNA 4 GPUs drop into markets. Speaking of release, the Radeon RX 9070 XT and Radeon RX 9070 preorders start on 23rd January, a few weeks from now.",

(NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other growth stocks.\n\nThe Future of Rate Cuts in 2025\n\nThe latest data from the job market in the United States came out on Friday and that has made the future of rate cuts even more uncertain. Lauren Sanfilippo, senior investment strategist at Bank of America, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss her market thesis and how the easing cycle is expected to play out in 2025.\n\nSanfilippo believes that the market has been basing its decisions on the easing cycle, but the job data, which has been particularly good, has allowed investors to pivot their investment approach away from rate cuts. She added that she is not looking at more rate cuts this year and is expecting a hike amid inflation concerns. She suggested that the market must not overreact to one piece of data and wait for more data to come out before any decisions are made.\n\nSpeaking of the commencement of the easing cycle, Sanfilippo believes the Fed was in the right to start the much-awaited easing cycle. However, she did share her concerns about the 100 basis point rate cut being executed over a very short time. She added that while the job market is in good shape and inflation is not that much of a problem yet, the stock market's performance may also be influenced because of yields and how stocks are \"thinking about yields.\" She also suggested that previously stocks have been very tolerant of higher yields, and is interested to see how it changes going forward.\n\nSanfilippo also shared her views on inflation and emphasized the importance of viewing the bigger picture more holistically. She added there is a much larger widening opportunity in the market but is waiting to see how the Q4 2024 earnings pan out.\n\nThe market may be uncertain, however, some stocks in the market have a promising outlook making them a solid buy. These stocks have been pouring into solid growth opportunities and are popular among analysts and investors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion and that gained more than 50% over the past 2 quarters. We then examined the analyst upside surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks with the highest upside as of January 10, 2025. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock.\n\nStory Continues",

Top investor, known by the pseudonym Nexus Research, believes this is wishful thinking.\n\n\u201cAMD stock is not worth buying given its lagging position in the AI race,\u201d asserts the investor who sits in the top 4% of TipRanks\u2019 stock pros.\n\nNexus Research argue that AMD\u2019s colossal gap with Nvidia is widening, especially when it comes to increasingly advanced operations. This growing disparity is particularly pronounced when it comes to the AI agents that larger tech companies are looking to adopt.\n\n\u201cAMD is yet to offer integrated hardware-software technology that is fit to run such complex workloads,\u201d Nexus opined, adding that Nvidia \u201ccontinues to widely outpace AMD in terms of offering industry-leading AI solutions.\u201d\n\nAccording to the investor, another major hurdle that AMD will be forced to reckon with is the \u201ccustom silicon\u201d wave that megascalers are moving towards. Instead of going with the ready-made solutions offered by Nvidia and AMD, tech leaders including Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are partnering with Broadcom or Marvell Technologies to build \u201cmore tailored, integrated technology infrastructure in their data centers.\u201d\n\nFinally, Nexus throws cold water on the idea that AMD\u2019s cheap valuation makes it a compelling buy. Though acknowledging that AMD has a cheaper Forward PEG than the other companies building the infrastructure of the AI revolution, the investor reminds readers that there are \u201cimportant reasons as to why the market is discounting its valuation to such a degree.\u201d\n\nTo this end, Nexus Research urges investors to \u201cface the reality\u201d about AMD\u2019s prospects and accordingly assigns a Hold (i.e., Neutral) rating to its shares. (To watch Nexus Research\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nMeanwhile, Wall Street analysts appear more optimistic. With 20 Buy recommendations, 9 Holds, and a lone Sell, AMD boasts a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Even more enticing, its 12-month average price target of $178.39 implies ~50% upside over the next year.

This Mini PC boasts an incredibly compact form factor and potentially offers some very interesting upgrades post-launch.\n\nOf course, there are limitations to this modular mini PC design. Like modular Framework laptops or Framework-based devices, Emdoor Clink-X xCraft will only come with custom motherboards with soldered OEM CPUs. But since the motherboard is so easily removable compared to the majority of mini PC designs, long-term support could still offset the downsides of this, particularly if truly meaningful modular attachments like an extended heatsink, discrete graphics, etc, actually come to fruition.\n\nImage 1 of 5 (Image credit: Emdoor) Emdoor Clink-X xCraft plate styles (Image credit: Emdoor) Emdoor Clink-X xCraft Build Step 1 (Image credit: Emdoor) Emdoor Clink-X xCraft Build Step 2 (Image credit: Emdoor) Emdoor Clink-X xCraft Build Step 3 (Image credit: Emdoor) Emdoor Clink-X xCraft Build Step 4\n\nAs far as the current fixed specifications go, the only two CPU options currently given with the motherboard are Ryzen \"Hawk Point\" CPUs, but specifically the Ryzen 7 250 and 260\u2014 which are just a rebadged Ryzen 7 8840U and Ryzen 7 8845HS, respectively. Those two CPUs are also rebadged Ryzen 7 7840U and Ryzen 7 7845HS, respectively, which makes the additional renaming cycle quite egregious. With either CPU, you'll be getting eight Zen 4 cores and AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics, with the differences boiling down to the CPU base clock.\n\nAMD's Ryzen 7 250 and its eight Zen 4 cores have a base clock of 3.3 GHz and boost up to 5.1 GHz, and are paired with 12 RDNA 3 iGPU Compute Units for graphical horsepower. The Ryzen 7 260 and its eight Zen 4 cores have a base clock of 3.8 GHz, boost up to 5.1 GHz, and also have 12 RDNA 3 CUs. These are still good specs since part of the reason 7840U and its ilk were so endlessly rebadgeable was because their iGPU performance took that long to be exceeded by the competition, but it's still worth noting.\n\nI/O is fixed regardless of your CPU and also replaces your PCIe expansion besides the dual NVMe slots. The fastest connectors are dual USB4 20 Gbps Type-C ports, with dual USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports (one Type-A, one Type-C) following directly behind. There is also a USB Type-C port specifically for power input, one HDM1 2.1 port, one DisplayPort 2.1 port, and a 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port.\n\nStorage and RAM support seem a little more interesting \u2014 with dual NVMe Gen4 slots (M.2-2280, up to 4TB) and support for up to 128GB of DDR5 RAM at 5600 MT/s, this mini PC definitely isn't slacking in those options. It's just a bit of a shame the CPU is soldered, but going unsoldered likely would have pushed them in the direction of AM4 or AM5 and presented a greater technical challenge for this form factor.\n\nAs-is, I think it looks decently promising, but the fastest expansion effectively being limited to dual USB4 20 Gbps does concern me, particularly at a $500 starting price point. OCuLink or even just a PCIe slot would be far preferable, particularly for whatever future discrete GPU attachments may be planned.",

They suggest Team Red's GPU might be set to rival the RTX 5070 Ti (in rasterization), and they also align with AMD's Frank Azor's claims that the capabilities of Navi 48 have been underestimated on the grapevine in the past.\n\nAMD's RDNA 4 graphics cards have been at the center of an avalanche of rumors since the RX 9070 models were revealed at CES 2025, and we've just had some fresh indications of performance.\n\n2\n\nThe hype is being stoked around AMD's RX 9070 graphics cards, that's for sure, ahead of a potential launch in a couple of weeks (Image Credit: AMD)\n\nVIEW GALLERY - 2 IMAGES\n\nPopular Popular Now: Skyblivion, the fan remake of Oblivion in Skyrim's engine, nears completion\n\nNaturally, take these with a whole lot of caution - for all we know they could be somehow wrong, or fabricated - but they come from Chiphell (again), as noticed by VideoCardz (via KimiGuoLM).\n\nIn fact, the Chiphell posts in question has been removed now, but not before VideoCardz took some screenshots and reported on all the relevant details.\n\nInterestingly, the purported benchmarks came from Cyberpunk 2077 and Black Myth: Wukong, both games which favor NVIDIA's GPUs rather than AMD's.\n\nWe're told the RX 9070 XT - note that in the Chiphell posts it's marked as the 'XXXX XT', but it's clear enough what that must be, at least assuming all this isn't made up - is competitive with the RTX 4070 Ti Super graphics card.\n\nIt pretty much equals that GPU in Cyberpunk 2077 (regarded as a showcase for NVIDIA cards) running ray tracing with no upscaling or frame generation. (VideoCardz claims it's ray tracing overdrive mode, but it seems that this isn't the case, judging from the frame rates at native 4K here - but the point is it's using ray tracing, presumably high levels).\n\nIn Black Myth: Wukong the 9070 XT is actually a bit faster than the RTX 4070 Ti Super, and the AMD next-gen GPU is shown to be pretty close to the RTX 4080 Super level (73 FPS plays 77 FPS at 1440p, and 30 FPS versus 33 FPS in 4K, not a difference you're going to notice).\n\nThat's impressive for rasterized performance, then, and in theory we could be looking at a more competitive card for overall frame rates than we thought with the RX 9070 XT (and the vanilla 9070 by extension).\n\nMore weight to Azor's assertions\n\nFunnily enough, this is exactly what AMD's Frank Azor (gaming marketing chief) has been saying very recently - that past estimations and rumors around Navi 48 performance have underestimated the capabilities of this chip.\n\nSo, while we still need to be very careful here, this latest piece of speculation is another suggestion that what Azor recently claimed is indeed the case.\n\nThat's an exciting prospect, and we could see an RX 9070 XT that's competitive with the RTX 5070 Ti (in rasterization), perhaps, and an RX 9070 that can stand against the RTX 5070 (and has more VRAM). If so, then everything depends on the pricing relative to NVIDIA's graphics cards, and also, to a lesser extent, how FSR 4 pans out against DLSS 4.\n\nPricing rumors have suggested the RX 9070 XT could debut at as low as $479, but if this latest performance hint is true, the GPU will likely pitch up at a higher level than that. We could get an official launch of these RDNA 4 graphics cards in a couple of weeks, too.",

Puget System has compiled the \"Hardware Trends of 2024\", giving a deep dive into how AMD's client and workstation market share has evolved in the past few quarters, and their findings indeed depict an interesting situation.\n\nStarting with the client CPU segment, the situation has favored Team Red tremendously, especially after Q4 2024. AMD saw a whopping 20% rise in market share in just the last year alone, with massive growth seen in Q2-Q4, mainly due to Intel's inability to capitalize on the market hype. With the release of AMD's \"Granite Ridge\" Ryzen 9000 series CPUs and the respective \"3D V-Cache\" models, the firm saw rapid consumer adoption, given that Team Red outperformed Intel in every aspect.\n\nNot just this, but with the persistent CPU instability issues with Intel's 14th Gen & 13th Gen CPUs, Team Blue had already started to lose its market share, moving into H2 2024. To top it all off, releasing the company's Arrow Lake-S desktop CPUs was disappointing. Intel failed to deliver on expectations, so AMD managed to be ahead of its competitor in next-gen CPU launch. AMD has claimed that Intel's Arrow Lake was a \"horrible\" product, and this sluggish performance has been reflected in the change in market dynamics.\n\nPuget Systems has also shared insights into the workstation CPU segment, showing AMD's dominance. AMD's Threadripper lineup accounts for a significant market share, with Intel's Xeon counterpart holding a mere 10% of the orders. Yet again, this shows how Intel has failed to sustain itself in the CPU business, and things aren't looking suitable for the company in the future, given how aggressive AMD has been with its products.",

Sometimes, these prices could be simple placeholders. It's also important to note that computer hardware is more expensive outside of the U.S. market, and Spain has a 21% standard VAT (value-added tax) rate so that the prices may be higher than usual. While we still don\u2019t have an official launch date for these AMD GPUs, B&H previously listed the RX 9070 series with preorders set for January 23.\n\nHowever, what caught our eye with Neo-Byte\u2019s listings are the GPUs\u2019 specifications. Since AMD skipped announcing the RDNA 4 GPUs during CES 2025, many of us are in the dark about the pricing and details of these new graphics cards.

However, Nvidia\u2019s launch of the RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti, which these GPUs are expected to compete against, are priced aggressively, undercutting the RX 9070 series by nearly $400. The RTX 5070 will retail for $549, so a more realistic price for the Radeon RX 9070 XT would be around $550 and $600 range, but we'll have to wait for AMD's official announcement to find out.\n\nNvidia claims that the RTX 5070 can deliver RTX 4090-like gaming performance. We doubt this claim regarding numbers, though, as Team Green likely uses technologies like DLSS to deliver higher FPS instead of creating a midrange GPU with the grunt of the previous-generation top-of-the-line card at nearly a quarter of the price.\n\nIt'll be exciting to see a fight between AMD\u2019s RX 9070 series and Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5070 to see who delivers more performance and better bang for the buck. Hopefully, Intel will release higher tiers of its Battlemage GPUs to turn the fight into a three-way battle royale in the mid-range desktop GPU space.",

The semiconductor company's share price was down 5.2% as of 11:15 a.m. ET. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index had fallen 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite index had declined 2.1%.\n\nAMD is falling today due to multiple bearish catalysts. In addition to the latest U.S. jobs report causing investors to become more risk averse, the chip specialist's stock is also falling in conjunction with negative analyst coverage.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nAMD stock falls on hotter-than-expected jobs report\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has published its latest jobs report, and the results are spurring a wave of selling across the stock market. The report shows that 256,000 jobs were added in December, coming in far ahead of the 155,000 job additions that had been forecast by economists.\n\nThe jobs data shows that U.S. economic activity is running hotter than expected and has raised concerns that inflationary pressures could tick up again. Following signs that inflation had been cooling, the Federal Reserve implemented three interest rate cuts last year. These rate reductions helped power bullish momentum for stocks, and investors have been hoping that the central banking authority will continue to serve up cuts this year. While the latest jobs data doesn't mean that the two rate cuts that were expected this year are now off the table, it does paint a significantly less favorable trading backdrop for AMD and other growth stocks.\n\nGoldman Sachs is no longer bullish on AMD stock\n\nIn a note published before the market opened today, Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating on AMD stock from buy to neutral. The investment firm also lowered its one-year price target on the stock from $175 per share to $129 per share. While the new price target still implies upside of roughly 6% from the stock's current pricing level, Goldman's lead analyst on the stock is concerned about AMD's competitive positioning.\n\nAnalyst Toshiya Hari thinks that AMD can still continue to win market share from Intel in the PC and server markets, but sees rising challenges from Arm. In order to deal with rising competition, Hari thinks AMD may need to spend more. In turn, this is likely to hurt margins and profitability. In addition to competition in the CPU space, other analysts have recently raised concerns about the company's ability to catch up to Nvidia when it comes to high-performance GPUs for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

            "content": "Last year, AMD introduced the Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU, which was specifically optimized for gaming by utilizing AMD\u2019s 2nd generation X3D technology to achieve exceptional gaming performance. Now, AMD has unveiled CES 2025 with their Ryzen 9000X3D CPUs, this time targeting both creators and gamers. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D have entered the scene!\n\nWith the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, AMD has incorporated its second-generation 3D V-Cache technology into one of the CPU\u2019s chiplets. This modification results in a total cache of 144MB, which is an increase of 64MB compared to a standard Ryzen 9 9950X.\n\nIn terms of gaming performance, AMD asserts an average boost of 8% across 40 games compared to their previous 7950X3D. However, it is important to highlight that many titles see improvements exceeding 20%. Clearly, some games take greater advantage of AMD\u2019s Zen 5 cores and Gen 2 3D V-Cache than others.\n\nWhen compared to Intel\u2019s Core Ultra 9 285K, AMD's new 9950X3D shows an average performance increase of 20%. This positions AMD\u2019s latest X3D processors as the clear choice for contemporary gaming tasks.\n\nFor content creators, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D yields more significant performance improvements than in gaming. AMD reports an average of 13% faster performance across 20 productivity and creation applications in comparison to the previous 7950X3D.\n\nRelative to Intel\u2019s 285K, AMD claims a 10% faster performance for creation tasks with their 9950X3D. This establishes AMD\u2019s CPU as superior in both gaming and productivity scenarios.\n\nIn addition to the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, AMD is also introducing the 9900X3D. Both processors are equipped with 3D V-Cache and AMD\u2019s Zen 5 CPU cores. The main distinctions between these two CPUs lie in their core counts and maximum CPU clock speeds. Below, you can find a comparison of both CPUs.\n\nBoth of these CPUs are set to be launched in March 2025. Until then, while waiting for more exciting news, remember to use our comparison tool to find the best deal for your next favorite game.",

            "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) was the big winner in the AI space during 2024 as it solidified its lead in GPUs, which led to a 185% stock rally. Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) lagged behind with a more limited AI presence that caused its stock to drop 11%. However, looking ahead to 2025, Nvidia is expected to see a moderate slowdown in growth, which could allow AMD to gain more ground over the next couple of years. While I\u2019m bullish on both companies for the long term, I believe AMD is better positioned for a bigger upside in 2025.\n\nStay Ahead of the Market:\n\nDiscover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll dive deeper into why I think the performance gap between Nvidia and AMD could look very different in 2025 compared to the past year.\n\nThe Case for NVIDIA in 2025\n\nAlthough I believe in the idea that \u201cthe trees cannot climb to the skies forever,\u201d I still think it\u2019s unlikely that Nvidia will experience a major decline in 2025. So, for now, I wouldn\u2019t suggest that bulls take their finger off the \u201cbuy\u201d button just yet.\n\nFirst off, Nvidia\u2019s guidance suggests that growth should remain strong for a while. Analysts expect Nvidia to grow its bottom line (earnings) by around 50% year-over-year and its top line (revenue) by 51% for the current fiscal year, which ends in January 2026. Keep in mind that these projections come after a truly massive 2025 Fiscal Year, where EPS is expected to soar by 128%, and revenues are set to jump by 113%.\n\nLooking ahead to 2026, we\u2019ll see a bit of a slowdown. Analysts expect Nvidia\u2019s EPS to grow by 26%, with revenues up by 21%. That said, these projections have already been revised upward by about 18% in the past few months as analysts have adjusted their forecasts to reflect Nvidia\u2019s ongoing success. A big part of this optimism comes from the continued progress in Nvidia\u2019s profitability, especially with the upcoming launch of its next-generation Blackwell technology.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Valuation Overview\n\nOne of the main reasons I\u2019m bullish on Nvidia is the safety we\u2019ve historically seen in investing in the company based on its solid fundamentals and projected earnings. There have been times when Nvidia might have seemed expensive based on trailing 12-month earnings, but I\u2019ve often found reassurance in the fact that the stock remained relatively cheap when looking at forward two-year guidance. This is largely due to the predictable demand for its products, which has kept its valuation multiples in the mid-20s.\n\nStory Continues",

AMD says the level of demand is partially down to Intel's launch of the rather underwhelming Arrow Lake.\n\nAs told to a writer at Tom's Hardware in a roundtable interview with AMD executives, AMD blames part of the severe demand for its current best chip on Intel launching a mediocre product in the hotly anticipated Arrow Lake. Okay, AMD put it a bit more harshly than that, saying \"We knew we built a great part. We didn't know the competitor had built a horrible one.\"\n\nOn this, we tested out both the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K and Intel Core Ultra 5 245K back in October and they are certainly underwhelming, though we wouldn't quite call them horrible.\n\nThe former CPU is great for productivity needs but beaten out in gaming by cheaper, older AMD CPUs. The latter is a strong budget choice for content creation, but the use-case is far more niche than one might expect from a competitive Intel CPU.\n\nHowever, a 'just okay' launch of a hotly anticipated set of CPUs, especially when you consider the CPU instabilities that still negatively impact the consumer view on Intel, these chips needed to be better to compete with AMD, which is currently performing really well.\n\nHistorically known for making the best CPUs in the world, Intel has had a bit of a fall from grace and the newest CPUs aren't helping it.\n\nAMD itself didn't have a flawless showing at CES. Early Radeon RX 9070 benchmarks are certainly positive but the cards themselves weren't given a release date, benchmark results, or even price point. We can say the fps in some games looks healthy but won't be able to say much more until we know what we're comparing it to in the market.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

I recently upgraded to the previous chip, the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D in my own personal rig and can happily state it still performs excellently.\n\nHopefully, Intel can start to claw its way out of the hole it has dug itself, even just so it's easier to get ahold of the best CPUs.",

Meanwhile, the sluggish gaming console market, which recorded just 2.4% growth in 2024, has turned out to be another headwind for the company. However, it wouldn't be surprising to see a turnaround in AMD's fortunes over the next three years. Let's see why that may be the case.\n\nThe PC market is expected to be in good health over the next three years\n\nThe PC market endured double-digit declines in 2022 and 2023. The good news for AMD is that the market stabilized in 2024, witnessing a 0.8% increase in shipments, per market research firm IDC. Even better, the PC market is expected to record 4.3% growth this year, driven mainly by a 5.1% improvement in sales of commercial PCs.\n\nFactors such as the end of support for Windows 10 in October this year, along with the growing adoption of AI-capable PCs, are going to drive the market's recovery. IDC forecasts that the PC market could clock an annual growth rate of 1.4% through 2028. Sales of AI PCs, however, are expected to grow at a much faster pace. Canalys expects that AI PCs will account for 60% of the overall PC market by 2027, compared to 19% last year.\n\nAMD is positioning itself to capitalize on this tremendous opportunity. The chipmaker recently revealed that PC giant Dell Technologies will use AMD's CPUs in its commercial offerings. Dell has been using AMD's processors for its consumer PCs, but this is the first time that it has announced using the chipmaker's CPUs in commercial PCs. AMD's AI-capable CPUs will also power over 100 commercial PC platforms in 2025.\n\nAll this should set the stage for more market share gains for AMD, which has been consistently eating into rival Intel's client CPU market share. More specifically, AMD controlled 23.9% of the client CPU market at the end of the third quarter of 2024, up from 19.4% in the year-ago period, per Mercury Research. This market share gain explains why AMD's revenue from the client CPU segment increased 29% year over year in Q3 2024 to $1.9 billion, growing at a faster pace than the overall PC market.\n\nAs the PC recovery gains momentum in 2025 and continues over the next three to four years, there's a solid chance that AMD could keep clocking healthy growth in this segment.\n\nData center and gaming are going to be additional catalysts for AMD\n\nAMD's data center business was another solid performer in Q3 2024. Revenue rose 122% year over year to $3.5 billion, thanks to the improving demand for its data center graphics cards and the company's improving share of the server CPU market. It won't be surprising to see the data center segment driving healthy growth for AMD over the next three years.\n\nThat's because the chipmaker is forecasting 60% annual growth in its total addressable market (TAM) for data center AI chips through 2028 to an annual revenue of $500 billion. AMD is a small player in this space right now, as it expects to generate more than $5 billion in revenue from sales of data center graphics cards in 2024. However, the company kept increasing its data center graphics cards revenue forecast throughout last year, beginning from an initial target of $2 billion.\n\nA combination of an improved supply chain and the stronger demand for AMD's data center graphics cards should ideally allow the company to sustain the solid momentum in this business and capture a bigger piece of the end-market opportunity on offer. Moreover, AMD is set to push the envelope in data center graphics cards by releasing a new chip every year, which could help the company claw some share from leader Nvidia.\n\nWhat's worth noting is that AMD doesn't need to take a lot of share away from Nvidia in the data center graphics card market. Even a 10% share by 2028 could send its data center GPU (graphics processing unit) revenue to $50 billion (based on the $500 billion TAM), which would be 10 times the revenue it's expecting to generate from this segment in 2024.\n\nFinally, Microsoft and Sony are expected to launch their next-generation gaming consoles in the next three years. AMD manufactures the semi-custom chips that power the gaming consoles from these two tech giants, and rumors suggest that the chipmaker is likely to remain the supplier for the next-gen consoles as well.\n\nIf that's indeed the case, AMD's gaming business could get a nice boost. The company pointed out that its gaming revenue was down 69% year over year in Q3 2024 to $462 million, owing to reduced demand for its semi-custom chips that are deployed in gaming consoles. So, investors can expect a potential turnaround in this segment in the next three years when the new console generation goes into production.\n\nThe above catalysts indicate why analysts are forecasting healthy growth in AMD's earnings in 2025 and 2026.\n\nConsensus estimates put AMD's expected 2024 earnings at $3.33 per share. The chart above tells us that its bottom line could increase at an annual rate of around 45% for the next couple of years. The growth drivers discussed above suggest that AMD could sustain a healthy rate of growth in 2027 as well.\n\nThere's a good chance that this semiconductor stock could regain its mojo and jump higher going forward.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Over 10 years we created a diverse pipeline to bring this vision closer to reality with seven named product candidates across three therapeutic areas utilizing three novel, clinically-validated vectors,\u201d said David Kirn, M.D., Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of 4DMT. \u201cWe have prioritized two product candidates with the strongest clinical proof of concept and high potential to impact the most patients to fulfil our mission. In addition, our ongoing regulatory interactions support an efficient path to Biologics License Applications (BLA) for 4D-150 in both wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME).\u201d\n\nStrategically Focused Pipeline\n\nCore Programs: Updates & Upcoming Milestones\n\nLarge Market Ophthalmology Focus\n\n4D-150 is a potential backbone therapy that is designed to provide multi-year sustained delivery of anti-VEGF (aflibercept and anti-VEGF-C) targeted to the retina with a single, well tolerated, intravitreal injection. 4D-150 is being developed for wet AMD and DME, each of which affects millions of patients globally, with the goal of preserving vision and relieving patients from burdensome repeated bolus injections, which can total up to 12 per year. 4DMT will focus the majority of its R&D resources and operations on global development and pre-commercial planning for 4D-150 in wet AMD.\n\n4D-150 for Wet AMD: Ongoing Phase 1/2 PRISM clinical trial currently in long-term follow-up: 52-week interim data from Phase 2b cohort of the PRISM clinical trial to be presented at Angiogenesis, Exudation, and Degeneration 2025 on Saturday, February 8, 2025 Corporate webcast to discuss data to be held on Monday, February 10, 2025 Phase 3 4FRONT program overview and updates: Trial designs and CMC plans aligned with U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) under RMAT designation and European Medicines Agency (EMA) under PRIME designation, based on multiple interactions through December 2024 4FRONT-1 and 4FRONT-2 are on target to initiate in Q1 and Q3 2025, respectively 4FRONT-1 and 4FRONT-2 clinical trial design: Primary endpoint: best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) noninferiority of 4D-150 3E10 vg/eye to aflibercept 2mg Q8W Enrichment criteria: Randomization requires on study demonstration of aflibercept responsiveness Supplemental aflibercept injection criteria for 4D-150 arm optimized to protect primary BCVA endpoint and to maximize reduction of supplemental treatment burden; criteria to be disclosed prior to trial initiation. No supplemental injections allowed in control arm Target enrollment of 400 patients per trial Designed with \u226590% power for primary endpoint of BCVA noninferiority of 4D-150 versus aflibercept 2mg Q8 weeks (margin of 4.5 letters) and supports required program safety database for BLA submission 4FRONT-1 to enroll treatment na\u00efve population and 4FRONT-2 to enroll both treatment na\u00efve and previously treated population, diagnosed within the last six months Primary endpoint 52-week topline data from both 4FRONT-1 and 4FRONT-2 expected in H2 2027\n\n4D-150 for DME: Ongoing SPECTRA Part 1 follow-up continues: Announced positive 32-week interim data today in separate press release Results and next steps to be presented in a corporate webcast on February 10, 2025 52-week interim data update expected at a scientific conference in mid-2025 Announced regulatory update, in separate press release issued today, summarizing written FDA feedback. Based on review of SPECTRA and PRISM data to date, combined with data from the two planned Phase 3 clinical trials in the 4FRONT wet AMD program, a single Phase 3 trial of 300-400 patients is acceptable for BLA submission and the Company may directly proceed into Phase 3 (SPECTRA Part 2 no longer needed)\n\n\n\n\n\nPulmonology Program\n\n4DMT\u2019s proprietary A101 vector is the first known AAV vector to demonstrate successful delivery and expression of the CFTR transgene in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) following aerosol delivery. Given A101-enabled product candidate 4D-710\u2019s proof of delivery, safety data and initial clinical activity signals, and ongoing support from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and collaboration with Therapeutics Development Network, the Company intends to complete Phase 1 enrollment in H1 2025, approach the FDA with a pivotal trial proposal mid-2025, and evaluate additional funding options to further advance 4D-710 into late-stage development.\n\n4D-710 for CF Lung Disease: Phase 1 AEROW enrollment completed in November 2024 (Cohorts 3 & 4 fully enrolled with n=3 each), follow-up ongoing; trial allows up to an additional 3 people with CF at these dose levels Interim data update expected to be presented in mid-2025 at a scientific conference, including available measurements of ppFEV 1 , CFQ-R-R (quality-of-life instrument), lung clearance index and serial airway biopsies and brushings collected at 4-8 weeks and beyond 12 months post-dosing\n\n\n\n\n\nPrograms with Reduced Capital Allocation\n\nWhile we believe the therapeutics below hold significant potential, at this time no further significant investment is expected on these programs, pending additional financing or partnerships.\n\n4D-175 for geographic atrophy (preclinical with open IND)\n\n4D-725 for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency lung disease (preclinical)\n\n4D-310 for Fabry disease cardiomyopathy (ongoing Phase 1)\n\n\n\nFollowing a comprehensive review of its portfolio, the Company has decided to terminate the development of the early-stage rare disease clinical programs evaluating 4D-110 for choroideremia and 4D-125 for X-linked retinitis pigmentosa.\n\nGiven the promising portfolio of product candidates and vectors owned and developed by 4DMT, 4DMT will not be investing additional capital into new preclinical product candidates at this time.\n\nUpdated Financial Guidance\n\nAs a result of its strategically focused pipeline, resource reallocation and discontinued future investment plans on non-core product candidates, the Company has extended its cash runway. Under the updated operating plan, based on unaudited cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $506M as of December 31, 2024, the Company now expects its current cash to fund operations into 2028. Cash runway includes full execution and topline 52-week data from 4FRONT-1 and 4FRONT-2 Phase 3 clinical trials in wet AMD, and ongoing early-stage development for DME and CF. Additionally, the Company will explore value-creating partnership opportunities and other strategic financing options.\n\nAbout 4DMT\n\n4DMT is a late-stage biotechnology company focused on unlocking the full potential of genetic medicines to treat large market diseases in ophthalmology and pulmonology. 4DMT\u2019s proprietary invention platform, Therapeutic Vector Evolution, combines the power of directed evolution with approximately one billion synthetic AAV capsid-derived sequences to invent customized and evolved vectors for use in our wholly owned and partnered product candidates.

            "content": "It\u2019s been a few months since the launch of Ryzen 7 9800X3D and the CPU is still difficult to find on store shelves, harder still at MSRP. It\u2019s no surprise that such a splendid chip is proving popular among consumers, gamers in particular, but questions have since arisen concerning the shortage of stock. According to a tongue-in-cheek comment from AMD, you can partly point the finger at Intel.\n\nDuring a roundtable interview with AMD at CES 2025, Tom\u2019s Hardware asked about the reason behind Ryzen 7 9800X3D stock shortages. In response, AMD Chief Architect of Gaming Solutions, Frank Azor said: \u201cWe knew we built a great part. We didn\u2019t know the competitor had built a horrible one, so the demand has been a little higher than we forecasted.\u201d To be completely clear, Azor is referring to Intel and its Core Ultra 200S Series.\n\nWhile Club386 doesn\u2019t share Azor\u2019s likely half-joking assessment of Core Ultra 9 285K, there\u2019s merit to demand for AMD\u2019s CPU vastly outweighing its competitor. Looking at Ryzen 7 9800X3D sales figures relative to Core Ultra 200S, the popularity of each isn\u2019t remotely close. To be fair to Intel, though, the X3D processor is also running rings around its Ryzen 9000 Series siblings.\n\nWith Core Ultra 200S performance fixes now readily available, it\u2019s possible that interest in the CPUs could improve and alleviate supply pressures for AMD. However, the jury\u2019s still out on how much said patches boost the competitiveness of chips like Core Ultra 9 285K relative to Ryzen 7 9800X3D. With CES 2025 winding down, this particular picture should become clear soon but I can\u2019t foresee this being an easy turnaround for Intel.\n\nComplicating matters further is the imminent arrival of Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D. AMD claims the former of the two processors easily matches or greatly exceeds the performance of Core Ultra 9 285K, in both applications and games. You and I should take these claims with a pinch of salt but it won\u2019t be too long before Club386 gets its hands on the 3D V-Cache flagship and puts them to the test.\n\nWhile we wait for the next batch of 3D V-Cache processors to make their splash on the CPU space, be sure to follow Club386 on Google News. In doing so, you\u2019ll know as soon as our reviews for each chip are available to read, alongside all the news and our thoughts on today\u2019s tech.",

While Nvidia spent most of its keynote talking about AI, AMD actually introduced a range of processors for client PCs, but this certainly does not mean that the company had nothing to show. In fact, it demonstrated its all-new Instinct MI325X.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nAMD's Instinct MI325X comes with the same dual-chiplet GPU that powers the Instinct MI300X and features 19,456 stream processors (304 compute units) clocked at up to 2.10 GHz. However, the new accelerator is equipped with 256 GB of HBM3E memory featuring 6 TB/s of bandwidth, as opposed to 192 GB of HBM3 memory with 5.3 TB/s of bandwidth.\n\nAs Nvidia's H200 comes with 'only' 141 GB of HBM3E memory with 4.8 TB/s of bandwidth, AMD's Instinct MI325X leads the industry in terms of HBM3E memory capacity onboard. Interestingly, AMD had previously announced that the MI325X would come with 288 GB of HBM3E, but then decided to reduce the usable capacity to 256 GB of memory for an unknown reason.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nHaving more onboard memory is crucial for AI accelerators, both for training and for inference, at least in theory.\n\nModern AI models usually have tens of billions of parameters and require tens of thousands of GPUs for training. Storing these parameters, along with intermediate data and gradients, requires a substantial amount of memory. Since no such model fits into a GPU's onboard memory, developers have to employ techniques like model parallelism or tensor slicing, which add computational and communication overhead. With more GPU memory, fewer GPUs are needed for training due to lower overheads.\n\nAdditionally, AI accelerators process data in batches. A larger onboard memory capacity allows for bigger batches, which can lead to higher throughput and faster, more efficient training and inference. Smaller memory forces the model to run with smaller batch sizes, reducing efficiency.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

A system with eight Nvidia H100 80 GB GPUs generates a comparable number of tokens per second to a machine with eight AMD Instinct MI300X 192 GB GPUs in the MLPerf 4.1 generative AI benchmark on the Llama 2 70B model, according to data submitted by AMD and Nvidia as of late August. By contrast, an 8-way server with H200 141 GB GPUs generates over 30% more tokens per second compared to an 8-way MI300X 192 GB machine.\n\nFor now, it seems that the Instinct MI300X was unable (at least as of August) to fully utilize its hardware capabilities, likely due to limitations in the software stack. It remains to be seen whether the Instinct MI325X will overcome the same software stack limitations and succeed in outperforming its rivals.",

(NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other technology stocks.\n\nOn January 1, King Lip, BakerAvenue Wealth Management's chief strategist and partner, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell' to discuss market outlooks as we enter 2025. His focus was on the impressive performance of tech stocks in 2024, with expectations for a second consecutive year of double-digit gains. Lip was against the prevailing sentiment among investors that big tech has peaked and that funds should rotate into smaller stocks or other themes. He argued that the recent weakness in the tech sector is largely due to technical rebalancing rather than a fundamental downturn. He emphasized that cash is likely to flow back into leading tech stocks, as they are projected to deliver the highest earnings growth in 2025, with an anticipated earnings increase of over 20%.\n\nDiscussing high valuations in the tech sector, particularly for large-cap stocks trading at forward earnings multiples between 32 and 35 times, Lip countered that many valuations remain within one standard deviation of their historical norms over the past decade. He pointed out that the MAG7 have consistently provided strong returns and are well-positioned for future growth. Lip identified Broadcom as a top stock, praising its management under Hock Tan and its unique role in the market as a provider of custom AI chips. He noted that the company operates at a lower earnings multiple while benefiting from substantial growth.\n\nLip also discussed Palantir, which has garnered attention for its profitability and positive cash flow since becoming profitable two years ago; despite its high valuation exceeding 50 times revenue, he believes it is well-positioned to benefit from government spending cuts and AI initiatives. While acknowledging concerns about insider selling and high valuations for the company, Lip remains optimistic about its future potential, suggesting it could be more appealing if it drops to the mid-$60 range.\n\nLip is bullish on tech stocks in 2025 that will be driven by strong earnings growth and ongoing investments in AI infrastructure. The NASDAQ 100 index has performed remarkably well, achieving a return of 27% in 2024 following a staggering 53.8% return in 2023. This reflects a broader trend where major tech companies have outperformed traditional indices significantly, and with that being acknowledged, we're here with a list of the 12 best technology stocks to invest in for the long term.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "At a small roundtable session with AMD executives at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, we asked the company for details about continuing shortages of its flagship gaming-optimized Ryzen 7 9800X3D \u2014 currently the uncontested best CPU for gaming \u2014 and when we can expect the supply to improve. AMD chalked it up to unprecedented demand and noted that Intel's \"horrible\" product, also known as Arrow Lake, has led to wildly increased demand that has pushed far beyond initial projections. In a separate roundtable, I also had the chance to ask Intel about its plans to fire back at AMD's dominating 3D V-Cache processors.\n\n\"We knew we built a great part. We didn't know the competitor [Intel] had built a horrible one,\" quipped AMD executive Frank Azor. \"So the demand has been a little higher than we forecasted.\"\n\nIt's no secret that Intel's Arrow Lake delivered underwhelming gaming performance at launch. Although the company has promised a 'fix' for the issue, we recently tested the full and complete patch on multiple systems. We found the patch does nothing to help (at least on two motherboards) and that the newer Windows revision required for the fix has benefited competing processors more, thus making Intel's Arrow Lake competitive positioning even worse than at launch. We'll publish that testing soon.\n\nAll of this means that Intel is far less competitive than AMD anticipated. That's exacerbated the longer-than-normal lead time for building an X3D processor. Due to the long lead times associated with building modern high-end processors, forecasting demand is key. Now that demand has far outstripped the original production targets, the company is cranking higher production into gear\u2014 but that takes time to filter down to the retail market.\n\n\"We have been ramping our manufacturing capacity, or the monthly, quarterly output of X3D parts, period, and that's 7000 [series] as well as 9000X3D,\" said AMD executive David McAfee. \"It's crazy how much we have increased over what we were planning. I would say the demand we've seen for the 9800X3D and the 7800X3D has been unprecedented. So the demand has been higher than ever.\"\n\n\"Building a traditional semiconductor, it's basically 12 to 13 weeks from when you start a wafer to when you get a product out the other end of the machine,\" McAfee explained. \"The [3D V-Cache] stacking process adds time to that, and so it's longer than a quarter horizon [three months] to really ramp output of those products. And so we're working very, very hard to catch up with demand. I think as we go through the first half of this year, you'll see us continue to increase the output of X3D. There's no secret, X3D has become a far more important part of our CPU portfolio than I think any of us would have predicted a year ago. And I think that trend will continue in the future, and we are ramping capacity to ensure we catch up with that demand for as long as customers want those X3D parts.\"\n\nMcAfee said there isn't any particular component or part of the production flow creating the bottleneck.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n\"It's the problem that you've got that lead time to build individually the CCD wafer, the cache wafer, and then the stacking process that follows that, which also adds a considerable amount of time. It's a non-trivial timeline when you're talking about building X3D products.\"\n\nMcAfee also said new 99x0X3D products won't help spread the demand, as customers choose the 8-core X3D parts 10-to-1 over the higher core count X3D models.\n\n\"If I look historically at our 7000X3D products, the 70800X3D was dramatically the highest volume part in that product stack. I think that for those 12- and 16-core parts, there are certain types of customers that buy those. But I think the reality is if you are truly a creator, you probably still buy the 9950X. The X3D doesn't add much at all for creator workloads. [...] It's like a percentage of incremental performance by having the X3D there.\" McAfee said.\n\n\"My belief is, in the 9000 series, those higher core count products, there'll be some demand there, but it'll still be 10-to-1, or more, on the eight-core X3D parts because they're just such a great gaming part for a pure gamer, there's nothing else like it,\" he finished.\n\nSo now it's a waiting game. AMD has ramped production, but it will take some time for the flood of shiny new 9800X3D chips to come to market. By the time more units arrive, we'll likely see the new 9950X3D and 9900X3D landing on shelves as well.\n\nAs for Intel, it has been entirely incapable of answering AMD's 3D V-Cache technology \u2014 and for an extended period of time. I spoke with Intel about its plans at a separate roundtable.\n\n\"AMD has been executing with its stacked 3D V-Cache X3D processors for three generations now. They're integrating it into more and more products, bringing it to mobile, etc., and we expect that trend to continue,\" I said. \"Intel has really not responded to that at all, at least in any way that we can see from the outside looking in. That's effectively ceding that high-margin, premium-tier gaming segment to AMD wherever they choose to deploy that technology. What are you considering as a response to this?\" I asked.\n\n\"Our goal is that leadership product in every segment, and I'm not going to talk about unannounced products,\" replied Intel's Jim Johnson, Corporate VP and GM of Client Engineering.\n\nWith no official word on faster tech from Intel and no indications through leaks or other industry chatter that Intel has a new competing tech in the works, AMD will certainly continue to dominate the global gaming CPU market in 2025. For now, it is AMD's gaming world, and Intel is just living in it.",

            "content": "Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) is experiencing a steady increase in the demand for its artificial intelligence chips and processors for high-performance computing. However, the semiconductor firm\u2019s performance in the stock market was not very impressive in 2024, mainly reflecting cautious outlook for the stock and weakness in non-core areas like the Gaming segment.\n\nAMD\u2019s stock has lost around 30% in the past six months, continuing the downtrend that began early last year. Market watchers are generally optimistic about the stock\u2019s prospects, forecasting a 50% growth this year. Considering the relatively low valuation, after experiencing high volatility in recent years, AMD looks like a good long-term investment.\n\nAI Push\n\nThe firm\u2019s primary strength is its ability to innovate. By ramping up its AI processor portfolio, AMD is striving to catch up with market leaders like Nvidia, which enjoys an upper hand in the GPU space. The company looks well-positioned to tap into new opportunities in artificial intelligence, amid heavy enterprise spending on AI infrastructure.\n\nIt is worth noting that the chipmaker has significantly expanded its footprint in data center, grabbing market share from Intel and ending the latter\u2019s prolonged dominance in the server chip market. Meanwhile, AMD is yet to meaningfully expand its market in other areas like gaming and CPU, where the company falls behind market leader Intel.\n\nGuidance\n\nThe tech firm\u2019s management targets a 20% growth in fourth-quarter revenue to approximately $7.5 billion \u2014 which is slightly below the market\u2019s estimates \u2014 and forecasts an adjusted gross margin of around 54%. The company has raised its full-year revenue guidance for Data Center GPU from $4.5 billion to $5 billion, based on the completion of certain customer milestones. Recently, AMD joined hands with Dell to launch PCs powered by its Ryzen AI PRO chips.\n\nAdjusted earnings rose to $0.92 per share in the third quarter of 2024 from $0.70 per share in the corresponding period in the prior year, matching analysts\u2019 estimates. On a reported basis, net income was $771 million or $0.47 per share in Q3, compared to $299 million or $0.18 per share in Q3 2023.\n\nStrong Revenues\n\nThe positive bottom-line performance reflected an 18% increase in revenues to $6.82 billion in the September quarter, vs. $5.8 billion in the prior year quarter, amid continued recovery in chip demand. The top line exceeded the market\u2019s projection. Data Center revenue, representing around half of the total, more than doubled. The Client business, the second largest segment, grew by 29% in Q3.\n\nCommenting on the Q3 results, AMD\u2019s CEO Lisa Su said, \u201cLooking ahead, we are very well positioned for continued growth in share gains based on the strength of our broad EPYC portfolio and the momentum we have built with cloud and enterprise customers. We also took a major step in the quarter to advance the x86 architecture, forming an ecosystem advisory group with Intel, several industry luminaries, and the largest cloud PC and enterprise leaders to accelerate innovation by driving consistency and compatibility across both the x86 instruction set and architectural interfaces \u2026\u201d\n\nAMD shares traded lower in the early hours of Thursday, extending the weakness seen in the previous sessions. Hovering slightly above $120, the stock\u2019s value is below its 52-week average.",

            "content": "AMD\u2019s world-beating 9800X3D chips destroyed the competition and promptly sold out. Why?\n\nDavid McAfee, AMD\u2019s corporate vice president and general manager of its Client Channel Business, and Frank Azor, the chief architect of gaming solutions and gaming marketing at AMD, sat down with reporters to give their answer: Intel\u2019s competing Arrow Lake chip simply stunk.\n\nIn PCWorld\u2019s review of the 9800X3D, we said that the chip obliterated Intel\u2019s best. At the same time, supplies of the part \u2014 a single chip, mind you \u2014 promptly sold out. And now AMD has added the 9950X3D, an even more powerful chip, to the lineup.\n\nFor more details, including why AMD\u2019s new GPUs weren\u2019t included in the company\u2019s CES 2025 keynote, the future of AI-rendered pixels, and how the new AMD AI Max chip shapes up to traditional gaming notebooks, see our Q&A with AMD\u2019s executives.\n\nPut simply, AMD simply didn\u2019t anticipate the disparity between its own product and Intel\u2019s. \u201cPut it this way,\u201d AMD\u2019s Azor said. \u201cWe knew we built a great part. We didn\u2019t know the competitor had built such a horrible one. So the demand has been a little bit higher than we had originally forecasted.\u201d\n\nMcAfee went even further: \u201cWhat I can say is that we have been ramping our manufacturing capacity \u2014 the monthly, quarterly output of X3D parts. That\u2019s 7000X3D as well as 9000X3D. It\u2019s crazy how much we have increased over what we were planning. I will say that the demand that we have seen from 9800X3D and 7800X3D has been unprecedented.\u201d\n\nChips take about twelve weeks to go from the start of the wafer manufacturing process to end product, he explained, so even increasing the number of wafers (and eventually chips) takes a long time.\n\n\u201cAnd so it\u2019s longer than a quarter to really ramp, you know, the output of those products, and so we\u2019re working very, very hard to catch up with demand,\u201d McAfee said. \u201cI think as we go through the first half of this year, you\u2019ll see us continue to increase output of X3D. You know there\u2019s no secret, X3D has become a far more important part of our CPU portfolio than I think we, any of us, would have predicted a year ago. And I think that trend will continue into the future, and we are ramping capacity to ensure we catch up with that demand as long as consumers want those X3D parts.\u201d Although the HX3D uses AMD\u2019s stacked cache, the cache isn\u2019t itself a gating factor, according to McAfee.\n\nMeanwhile, AMD launched its \u201cFire Range\u201d processors, which take the HX3D architecture and bring it to gaming notebooks. The Ryzen 9955HX3D has yet to ship, however. AMD also launched two new faster HX3D parts for the desktop.\n\nMcAfee said that the 7800X3D, the \u201caffordable\u201d option, was the one that consumers turned to \u2014 not the high-end, niche parts. \u201cIf I look historically at our 7000X3D products, the 7800X3D was dramatically the highest volume part in that product stack. I think that those 12- and 16-core parts, there are certain types of customers that buy those.\u201d\n\nHe also added, \u201cMy belief is, in the 9000 series, those higher core count products, there\u2019ll be some demand there, but it\u2019ll still be ten-to-one or more on the eight-core X3D parts because they\u2019re just such a great gaming part. For a pure gamer, there\u2019s nothing else like it.\u201d",

AMD's flagship GPUs, the AMD Radeon RX 70 series, start as low as $269.99, with the upper range peaking at $999.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia's existing GeForce 40 series starts at $399.99 with the GeForce RTX 4060 TI, while its most advanced unit, the GeForce RTX 4090, starts at $1,599. However, the 40 series is old news at CES 2025, as the Nvidia 50 series, coming Jan. 30 will range in price from $549 to $1,999.\n\nSo if you're shopping on price alone, AMD is going to be the most affordable option. However, it's important to note that AMD has reportedly stopped producing some of its Radeon RX series to make way for the RNDA 4 GPUs. Based on AMDs historical prices, we still expect the latest GPUs to fall below Nvidia's prices.\n\nAMD vs. Nvidia: Performance\n\nThe competition gets tougher when considering the performance of AMD and Nvidia GPUs. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is regarded as the best GPU on the market, beating out most of AMD's units. Not only is the 4090 exceptional for 4K gaming, it's the best option if you plan on creating games or working with AI. The 4090 is soon to be replaced by the 5090, which is built with and for AI, enhancing graphics for superior clarity and realistic dimensions.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

However, when you're not looking at the high-end GPUs from each brand, AMD can compete when you get into midrange and budget options. For example, the midrange AMD Radeon 7700 XT can easily compete with the Nvidia GeForce 4060.\n\nIt should be noted that our favorite gaming laptop, the Alienware m16, is loaded with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070. Plus, Alienware is doubling down on Nvidia's new 50 series, as its Area-51 line will come loaded with the new graphics cards.\n\nAMD vs. Nvidia: Beyond gaming\n\nMost of the time, we're discussing GPUs in terms of gaming and how the processors render games. However, GPUs are crucial outside of this realm. AMD keeps its priorities focused on gaming, updating its technology to compete in the growing market of 4K gaming. Its GPUs are generally more user-friendly, not requiring its own software to be exclusively used on the cards \u2014 you can even use AMD software on Nvidia graphic cards.\n\nHowever, if you're building a computer for more than just gaming, planning on doing some heavy-duty video editing, or working with AI, Nvidia is going to be the better choice as its GPUs are already incorporating AI into its devices. The Nvidia GeForce 50 series comes with the Nvidia Studio, a program to assist in video editing, 3D rendering, and graphic design, maximizing your graphics beyond just gaming.\n\nAMD vs. Nvidia: Which is better?\n\nThere really isn't a definitive answer on which GPU maker is superior. The answer is far more nuanced and depends on user needs \u2014 and budget.\n\nIf you're just getting started, playing around with building your first PC, AMD is the most accessible GPU. Budget-wise, it can't be beat, and its midrange options remain friendly on your wallet while managing to compete with Nvidia's performance. However, it should be noted that AMD GPUs seem to be taking a backseat with the brand. The Radeon series is currently out of stock, and we're waiting to hear more on the brand's new AMD line-up.\n\nBut for the more experienced users, investing in Nvidia's GPUs is a worthwhile endeavor. If you plan on working on massive tasks from video game creation to AI, the Nvidia graphics cards are built to handle these jobs, and while you're going to pay nearly $2,000 for a GPU, you are getting the best the market has to offer.\n\nFor the latest tech, Nvidia's GeForce 50 series is coming on Jan. 30, and while it's currently unavailable for preorder, you can shop the 40 series now.",

            "content": "CES AMD unleashed a flood of CPUs at the annual CES super-conference this week in Las Vegas \u2013 chips that span the gamut from high-end desktop processors to those aimed at gaming notebooks, handhelds and, yes, so-called AI PCs.\n\nWhile Qualcomm chases the lower-end of the AI PC market, AMD is targeting the upper-end with its newly unveiled Ryzen AI Max 300 series, code-named Strix Halo, alongside additional Ryzen AI 300 series parts.\n\nJust like the original batch of Strix Point Ryzen AI 300 chips launched last summer, AMD's Max chips feature the same 50 TOPS XDNA 2 NPU as before, as well as the usual Zen 5 CPU cores. However, that's not to say the latest chips don't offer anything more in the AI department.\n\nIn addition to the NPU, AMD's top-specced Strix Halo components feature up to 40 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores delivering a combined total of 126 TOPS. Much of that extra grunt presumably comes courtesy of the GPU. And while NPUs are closely associated with AI PCs, not all AI workloads are optimized to take advantage of them.\n\nWhile we're told it's possible to run LLMs on NPUs, the memory requirements associated with them means more often than not they end up running on the GPU.\n\nWith a 256-bit bus feeding the beefier GPU, the top-specced Strix Halo parts should deliver 256GB/s of bandwidth, which in theory should enable them to run large language models, such as Llama 3.2 3B locally at speeds of over 100 tokens per sec.\n\nBut while the new chips feature a more powerful GPU, they take a step back in memory capacity. Whereas Strix Point maxed out at 256GB of DDR5, Strix Halo only supports 128GB of LPDDR5x \u2014 no SODIMM support here \u2014 with 96GB directly accessible to the graphics pipeline.\n\nAMD will also offer its Strix Halo processors with so-called Pro features, such as fleet management, enterprise security, and cloud recovery services, when they hit the market later this quarter. Here's the line up:\n\nModel Cores / Threads Boost / Base Clock Total Cache GPU TDP NPU TOPS GPU Cores AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 16C/32T 5.1 / 3.0 GHz 80MB Radeon 8060S 45-120W 50 40 AMD Ryzen AI Max 390 12C/24T 5.0 / 3.2 GHz 76MB Radeon 8050S 45-120W 50 32 AMD Ryzen AI Max 385 8C/16T 5.0 / 3.6 GHz 40MB Radeon 8050S 45-120W 50 32 AMD Ryzen AI Max+ Pro 395 16C/32T 5.1 / 3.0 GHz 80MB Radeon 8060S 45-120W 50 40 AMD Ryzen AI Max Pro 390 12C/24T 5.0 / 3.2 GHz 76MB Radeon 8050S 45-120W 50 32 AMD Ryzen AI Max Pro 385 8C/16T 5.0 / 3.6 GHz 40MB Radeon 8050S 45-120W 50 32 AMD Ryzen AI Max 380 6C/12T 4.9 / 3.6 GHz 22MB Radeon 8040S 45-120W 50 16\n\nAlongside its Ryzen AI Max parts, AMD is also expanding its AI 300 family of products to include four lower-core count SKUs with and without AMD Pro features enabled:\n\nModel Cores / Threads Boost / Base Clock Total Cache GPU TDP NPU Tops AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 8C/16T 5.0 / 2.0 GHz 24MB Radeon 860M 15-54W 50 AMD Ryzen AI 5 340 6C/12T 4.8 / 2.0 GHz 22MB Radeon 840M 15-54W 50 AMD Ryzen AI 7 Pro 350 8C/16T 5.0 / 2.0 GHz 24MB Radeon 860M 15-54W 50 AMD Ryzen AI 5 Pro 340 6C/12T 4.8 / 2.0 GHz 22MB Radeon 840M 15-54W 50\n\nX3D returns to mobile\n\nAmong the more unusual SKUs announced at the annual consumer electronics showcase is the unassumingly named 9955HX3D, which sees the return of AMD's 3D V-cache packaging tech to the notebook arena.\n\nLooking at the spec sheet, the chip looks like just another Ryzen mobile processor, with 16 CPU cores, 32 hardware threads, and clock speeds that max out at 5.4 GHz. However, compared to the nearly identical 9955HX, the X3D version packs an additional 64MB of cache for a total of 144MB.\n\nIf you're not familiar with AMD's 3D V-cache tech, it was introduced with the Milan-X Eypcs and Ryzen 7 5800X3D in early 2022, and expands the processor's L3 cache using an auxiliary SRAM tile. For cache-sensitive applications, including gaming, this can have a big positive impact on performance. This isn't actually the first time that AMD has brought this tech to mobile either, having made its debut in notebooks with the launch of the 7945HX3D in mid 2023.\n\nIn the case of the 9955HX3D, the part uses 3D packaging to stack the SRAM tile underneath the compute tile. According to AMD this helps to mitigate performance, clock, and temperature penalties observed with its first-gen implementation, which placed the SRAM on top of the compute dies.\n\nHowever, this being a high-end mobile part, it doesn't get that hot with a configurable TDP \u2014 presumably this will be set by the notebook maker \u2014 of 55 to 75W.\n\nAMD's X3D mobile chip launches alongside two new non-X3D parts including the the 9955HX, which as we mentioned earlier is essentially the same chip just without the SRAM tile, as well as the Ryzen 9 9850HX which features 12 CPU cores and 24 threads clocking to 5.2 GHz.\n\nAll three come equipped with Radeon 610 graphics on board albeit with just two GPU cores; these chips are clearly aimed at machines with dedicated GPUs onboard.\n\nModel Cores / Threads Boost / Base Clock Total Cache GPU GPU cores TDP AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX3D 16C/32T 5.4 / 2.5 GHz 144MB Radeon 610M 2 55-75W AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX 16C/32T 5.4 / 2.5 GHz 80MB Radeon 610M 2 55-75W AMD Ryzen 9 9950HX 12C/24T 5.2/ 3.0 GHz 76MB Radeon 610M 2 55-75W\n\nThe parts are due to hit the market in the first half of 2025.\n\nAMD fills out its X3D desktop line up\n\nAlong with new X3D mobile chips, AMD also filled out its lineup of 3D V-cache-packed desktop processors with the 16-CPU-core 9950X3D and 12-CPU-core 9900X3D.\n\nMuch like the eight-core 9800X3D we put through its paces in November, AMD's latest chips cram 144MB of cache on the 9950X3D, and 140MB on the 9990X3D parts, up from 80MB and 76MB, respectively, on its non-X3D siblings.\n\nAnd just like 9850HX3D mobile part we discussed earlier, the 16-core desktop chip doesn't suffer any frequency penalties clocking to the same 5.7GHz boost and 4.3GHz boost as the bog-standard 9950X launched this summer.\n\nThe same can't be said of the lower spec Ryzen 9 part debuting this week. The 9900X3D tops out at 5.5GHz, a full 100MHz less than the regular old 9900X, though base clocks remain unchanged at 4.4GHz.\n\nDespite boasting double the L3 cache and nearly identical clock speeds, AMD's stated TDP remains unchanged at 170W and 120W for the 16-and 12-core parts respectively. Max operating temperatures, which have traditionally been lower on X3D parts are also unchanged at 95C.\n\nModel Cores / Threads Boost / Base Clock Total Cache PCIe TDP AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 16C/32T 5.7 / 4.3 GHz 144MB Gen 5 170W AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D 12C/24T 5.5 / 4.4 GHz 140MB Gen 5 120W\n\nThe latest crop of X3D desktop parts are due to arrive later this quarter.\n\nAMD hasn't given up on handheld gaming\n\nAMD has made a name for itself building custom SoCs for Microsoft XBox and Sony PlayStation lines, and most recently, Valve's Steam Deck. That last one has seen a wave of competitors arrive from the likes of Asus, MSI, and others, looking to get in on the handheld gaming market.\n\nFollowing the success of the SteamDeck, which features a custom Ryzen processor, AMD rolled out its Z-series of processors aimed at handheld gaming.\n\nThis week, AMD unveiled a trio of Z2 chips which feature four to eight of AMD's Zen 5 CPU cores, 10-24MB of cache, and 12-16 RDNA graphics cores onboard.\n\nModel Cores / Threads Boost / Base Clock Total Cache GPU Arch GPU Cores TDP AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme 8C/16T 5.0 / 2.0 GHz 24MB RDNA 3.5 16 15-35W AMD Ryzen Z2 4C/8T 5.1 / 3.3 GHz 24MB RNDA 3 12 15-30W AMD Ryzen Z2 Go 4C/8T 4.3 / 3.0 GHz 10MB RDNA 2 12 15-30W\n\nBut while all three chips slide into the 15-30W TDP range (up to 35W on the Extreme), the GPUs can vary wildly based on the SKU. The base model Z2 Go features 12 RDNA 2 graphics cores on board. As a refresher, RDNA 2 made its debut in 2020. The standard Z2 packs the same number of cores, but steps up to AMD's more modern RDNA 3 tech. However, if you want AMD's latest mobile GPU architecture, you'll have to opt for the Z2 Extreme which packs 16 RDNA 3.5 cores.\n\nHow big a difference this makes given the highly constrained power and thermals of a handheld device isn't clear, but it's still worth keeping in mind for those cross-shopping handheld consoles based on the chips when they arrive later this quarter.\n\nZen 4 lives on\n\nTrue to tradition, AMD's Zen 5 CPU cores may be the new hotness, but it hasn't given up on Zen 4 just yet.\n\nAt CES this week, AMD recycled its now two-year-old cores into 11 new Ryzen 200 and Ryzen Pro 200 processors. The parts include chips with four, six, or eight cores with boost clocks ranging from 4.7GHz to 5.1GHz at the high end, and support for AMD's older 16 TOPS XDNA NPUs on select SKUs.\n\nModel Cores / Threads Boost / Base Clock Total Cache GPU TDP NPU TOPS AMD Ryzen 9 270 8C/16T 5.2 / 4.0 GHz 24MB Radeon 780M 35-54W 16 AMD Ryzen 7 260 8C/16T 5.1 / 3.8 GHz 24MB Radeon 780M 35-54W 16 AMD Ryzen 7 250 8C/16T 5.1 / 3.3 GHz 24MB Radeon 780M 15-30W 16 AMD Ryzen 5 240 6C/12T 5.0 / 4.3 GHz 22MB Radeon 760M 35-54W 16 AMD Ryzen 5 230 6C/12T 4.9 / 3.5 GHz 22MB Radeon 760M 15-30W 16 AMD Ryzen 5 220 6C/12T 4.9 / 3.2 GHz 22MB Radeon 740M 15-30W NA AMD Ryzen 3 210 4C/8T 4.7 / 3.0 GHz 12MB Radeon 740M 15-30W NA AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 250 8C/16T 5.1 / 3.3 GHz 24MB Radeon 780M 15-30W 16 AMD Ryzen 5 Pro 230 6C/12T 4.9 / 3.5 GHz 22MB Radeon 760M 15-30W 16 AMD Ryzen 5 Pro 220 6C/12T 4.9 / 3.2 GHz 22MB Radeon 740M 15-30W NA AMD Ryzen 3 210 4C/8T 4.7 / 3.0 GHz 12MB Radeon 740M 15-30W NA\n\nNotebooks featuring AMD's Ryzen 200-series processors are slated to hit the market beginning in the second quarter. \u00ae\n\nAnd over in Nvidia world... Nvidia has squeezed a Grace-Blackwell Superchip into a $3K mini PC.\n\nIt also, as expected, announced its Blackwell-based $1,999 RTX 5090 and $999 RTX 5080 graphics cards, due out at the end of the month, plus a $749 RTX 5070 Ti and a $549 RTX 5070 for February.\n\nThe GPU giant openly released a collection of AI models called Cosmos, which can generate physics-aware videos of situations from written and visual prompts.\n\nSimilarly, it released its open Llama Nemotron language models and Cosmos Nemotron vision language models.\n\nAn Omniverse Blueprint dubbed Mega, for \"developing, testing and optimizing physical AI and robot fleets at scale,\" was shown off.",

Photo: Reuters\n\nAMD said its new Ryzen AI Max series of processors would deliver the highest level of performance available in premium thin and light notebooks.\n\nThe chips run AI workloads as much as 90 percent faster than their predecessors, it said.\n\nAMD is also bringing out new 9000 series desktop computer processors, which it said would extend the company\u2019s leadership in that area. The 9900X3D is a chip with 16 processor cores that can run as fast as 5.7 gigahertz, it said.\n\nAMD, Intel and would-be rival Qualcomm Inc are announcing new laptop and desktop parts at the show, arguing their respective technologies provide the best performance for AI workloads. The chipmakers, and computer manufacturers, believe the market for PCs would be revived by the capability of the machines to run more tasks with AI.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s new chips for AI PCs, the Snapdragon X Platform, cost as little as US$600 and consist of an 8-core Oryon central processor, a graphics component and dedicated AI chip. The new product would run Microsoft Corp\u2019s Copilot+ software, Qualcomm said on Monday.\n\nPC makers including Dell and Lenovo Group Ltd (\u806f\u60f3) are to offer laptops based on the new product in \u201cearly 2025,\u201d the chipmaker said.\n\nThe chips join a range of more powerful and pricey components offered by Qualcomm \u2014 the Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus. A key element of the company\u2019s pitch is the extended battery life offered by machines based on its chips.\n\nQualcomm said its chips have always been designed for small, battery-powered devices, making them more efficient than the scaled-down desktop parts offered by its more established rivals.\n\nIntel earlier on Monday announced new chips that it claims seize back battery life. Qualcomm disputes that, saying its chips are able to keep working at full power even when laptops are unplugged, while machines running rival processors have to be throttled back.",

I was previously the CTO of the Cisco UCS business and played an instrumental role in accelerating the growth of the Cisco UCS to a top data center compute platform. I have spent my entire career working on software and hardware ecosystems for data centers, both in research and business.\n\nI joined AMD in 2017 to help build a comprehensive software and hardware ecosystem for the AMD EPYC\u2122 processor family. By doing this, we can provide our customers with an easy out-of-the-box experience when they deploy their applications on AMD powered servers and cloud instances. I also have a CTO hat for Software and Solutions at AMD, making sure we are aligning our technology roadmap with end customer workloads.\n\nI have been in the industry for over two decades in various roles. One area that I wanted to mention are my leadership positions on industry standards committees for performance evaluation and leading academic conferences. I believe in open ecosystems and enabling fair competition. I thank my industry peers for electing me to chair the industry\u2019s first standards committee for benchmarking big data systems, and the industry\u2019s first standards committee for benchmarking the Internet of Things (IoT). I am the founding chair of TPC\u2019s International Conference Series\u2013 a leading forum on Performance Evaluation and Benchmarking.\n\nI have written more than 75 papers and book chapters, and in my book, Transforming Industry Through Data AnalyticsOpens a new window , I examined the role of analytics in enabling digital transformation, how the explosion in internet connections affects key industries, and how applied analytics will impact our future.\n\nLearn more: CFO as Visionary: Using Digital Analytics to Power Strategy\n\nIn AMD\u2019s vision for the future, high performance computing (HPC) takes the center seat. How does AMD plan to continue the required compute power growth, especially taking Moore\u2019s Law into consideration?\n\nWe play in every major computing segment \u2013 from consumers, to enterprises, to HPC, to gaming and the cloud. Today, the HPC industry is transforming rapidly and touches every aspect of our lives. Some of the world\u2019s most important and complex problems are being solved by HPC.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll see from AMD in the HPC industry is a continued effort for heterogeneous compute, which occurs when CPUs and accelerators work together to help increase the compute power and capacity of systems. Heterogeneous compute is one of the foundations of supporting the continued demand for more performance.\n\nA great example of heterogeneous compute is the Frontier supercomputer that will be installed at the Oak Ridge National Labs in 2021. Frontier is projected to have an estimated 1.5 exaflops of performance when it goes live, using both AMD EPYC CPUs and AMD Radeon Instinct\u2122 accelerators.\n\nBeyond heterogeneous compute, the other areas where AMD is looking for ways to increase compute power is efficiency within the entire system. Whether that is support for faster memory, better interconnects or faster peripheral support, these are all things that will help streamline the compute power, so customers can do more, with less.\n\nThis is how AMD is advancing compute when Moore\u2019s Law is slowing down. We are combining advancements in architecture, driving heterogeneous compute, looking at overall system efficiencies like right-sized core counts, large memory capacity, extreme memory bandwidth and massive I/O capabilities to enable exceptional HPC workload performance.\n\nLearn more: How Relevant Is Moore\u2019s Law and What Does It Means for the Tech Industry?\n\nHow will Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) impact traditional HPC capacities?\n\nThe world is undergoing unprecedented change driven by technology advances that are creating enormous amounts of data in the process. This data represents an opportunity for companies to improve their business, create new revenue streams, and even invent whole new models to solve some of the world\u2019s most challenging problems.\n\nAMD enables companies to tap into the massive amount of data with powerful and effective processing power with the AMD EPYC processor and Radeon Instinct accelerators. In fact, AMD is the only provider in the world of both high performance x86 CPU and GPU technologies, and there is a role for both in artificial intelligence and machine learning. AMD Radeon Instinct GPUs are well suited for the training function of a deep learning model, while AMD EPYC CPUs are a great fit for inference.\n\nSoftware is critical to both inference and training, as well as maximizing the efficiency of the processing between the CPU and GPU architectures. AMD is focused on large business opportunities where we can maximize the impact of both of our product families, in what we call \u201cA+A\u201d systems \u2013 AMD CPUs working with AMD GPUs. This allows us to apply our technical resources and software teams most effectively, giving our customers a unique value proposition for AI and ML workloads to use AMD supported capabilities like PCIe\u00ae 4.0.\n\nIn addition to hardware, AMD is committed to building an expansive software ecosystem with industry leaders. Enterprises of all sizes have realized the potential of Big Data Analytics (BDA) which is now commonly deployed on-premise, in the cloud, and in hybrid environments . We are focusing on technology partnerships, optimizations and easy-to-consume reference designs, both single-socket and dual-socket, that have our partners providing the flexibility, performance and scalability needed to help customers with their BDA.\n\nLearn more: 60% Of European Tech Enthusiasts Prefer AMD Processors: EHA Survey\n\nWhat are the key priorities for consumer computing leaders today, given the focus on enabling inference models across companies and industries?\n\nThe entire technology industry is transforming, and the consumer computing segment is no exception. To put it in perspective, the smart phones that we carry today are several million times faster than NASA\u2019s combined compute power that launched the first Apollo mission.\n\nMore and more things are getting connected, and in a data-driven economy speed is everything. AI and Big Data are now seemingly inseparable. The key priority for any computing leader today is identifying how to support inference in real-time at the data source or closer to it. This can be a consumer device or a specialized edge device.\n\nAt AMD, our mission is to provide the optimal compute technologies from edge all the way to the core while offering unique security features to help protect your private data.\n\nAI and ML security are big risk areas as CPU microarchitectures proliferate. What policies are needed to make CPU architecture safe for all stakeholders?\n\nSecurity is top of mind at AMD. A key focus of the 2nd Gen AMD EPYC Processors are the security features to help defend applications and data. Data centers around the globe are constantly adapting to more securely meet the current workload demands while planning for future workload needs. To help fortify these data centers, the 2nd Gen EPYC uses two security features, Secure Memory Encryption (SME) and Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). Additionally, the \u201cZen 2\u201d architecture of the 2nd Gen EPYC is \u201chardened at the core\u201d helping customers guard their most important assets, their data.\n\nWith SME and SEV, users can have greater confidence in the security capability surrounding their private data. The growing community of operating system vendors that support SEV includes Canonical, Fedora, Oracle, RedHat, and SUSE. VMware has also committed to support AMD security features in a future release of vSphere.\n\nLearn more: Big Tech Forms Open-Source Partnership to Encrypt Cloud Data from Server to Edge\n\nWhat personal strategies do you use to work closely with functional leaders in order to understand what the business needs are for CPU architecture? What is the difference in the way a CIO and a CTO would approach these new architectures?\n\nIn the digital world, often a company\u2019s differentiation is its ability to perform compute faster than its competition \u2013 this includes finance, retail, life sciences, oil and gas and many other industries.\n\nWe are a technology company, but our mission is to help solve problems efficiently and securely. Our value proposition is equally important to CIO and CTOs.\n\nCIOs are responsible for running the business, focusing on business process, infrastructure, security and overall efficiency. CTOs are often excited about the latest and greatest and what\u2019s coming up in the future. At AMD, we create products with both of their needs in mind.\n\nWith industry leading 7nm designs in CPUs and GPUs, we bring efficiency, high performance, density, and power efficiency to the data centers, helping lower the total cost of ownership (TCO) dramatically. The advanced security technologies we talked about earlier are designed to protect critical data about the business and their customers.\n\nWhile there\u2019s excitement about new technologies, we often see resistance due to uncertainties associated with new architectures and solutions. AMD provides close collaboration and joint engineering with our ecosystem partners to reduce the risks and give a seamless out-of-the-box experience when existing applications are migrated, and new applications are deployed.\n\nLearn more: How AI Has Transformed the Role of a Chief Data Officer: LinkedIn CDO\n\nWhich trends are you tracking in this space for 2020 and beyond?\n\nSoftware Defined Everything (SDx) \u2013 Virtualized environments are gaining more and more traction as users see the value and flexibility of intelligent software. We\u2019re going to see an explosion of SDx from compute, storage, network, and new consumption models over the coming years.\n\nMore migration to cloud \u2013 While many organizations still have on-premise needs for security and latency requirements, more and more data and apps continue to migrate to the cloud as providers offer specialized instances to meet unique workload demands.\n\n5G \u2013 5G will have a significant impact on economic growth. It will change the way we think about processing power at the edge. The increased data demands and coverage requirements for 5G nodes present exciting opportunities for both embedded processors and data center compute innovations.\n\nEdge computing \u2013 5G has supercharged the race to make gains in compute power at the edge. Likewise, lower latency requirements for AI applications such as image recognition and neural language processing are driving many companies to ramp up their edge offerings.\n\nAI \u2013 One of the most exciting things on the horizon is the work we\u2019re doing with the AMD powered Frontier supercomputer and the Center for Accelerated Application Readiness (CAAR) Opens a new window at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

            "content": "AMD is more than ready to launch its latest Ryzen AI Max, Ryzen 300, and 200 series chipsets that would place it in direct competition to defeat Intel and Qualcomm at CES 2025.\n\nThe chipmaker knows that the game is only getting harder each year\u2014and it hopes that its recent product is enough to prove that it won't go easy anytime.\n\nAMD Won't Hold Back in the Space of AI PCs\n\nAt CES 2025, AMD unveiled a series of high-end chips targeting the next big push in AI and gaming. The highlight of this launch, according to Yahoo, is the Ryzen AI Max series with processors designed to deliver the very best for performance laptops that would be perfect for gamers and content creators.\n\nThe Ryzen AI Max chips provide up to 128GB unified memory and deliver up to 50 TOPS (trillion operations per second) with its NPU, and AMD relies on TOPS as a primary benchmark for the performance of any AI. Others include Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm, as they all pursue the AI PC market.\n\nApart from the standard Ryzen AI Max, AMD also revealed the PRO series, which is going to support enhanced security features and enterprise management. This has been done as a strategy for targeting businesses with robust, reliable AI capabilities with safety for the sensitive data at hand.\n\nAI Mid-Tier Chips: The Ryzen 300 and Ryzen 200 Series\n\nHowever, not all consumers and enterprises will need such high power as Ryzen AI Max chips. So, AMD also launched the Ryzen AI 300 and Ryzen AI 200 series for those not needing the gigantic performance of the Ryzen Max chips - featuring the same 50 TOPs of AI performance as the Ryzen Max chips but in an affordable AI PC system.\n\nThe Ryzen AI 7 350 and Ryzen AI 5 340 are part of the AI 300 series, targeting users who demand solid AI performance in applications such as Microsoft's Copilot+ and Recall and Click to Do features.\n\nApps allow users to take snapshots of their activity pick up from where they were and take action based on what is on-screen text and images.\n\nThe Ryzen 200 series is built for more budget-friendly laptops and packs 16 TOPS of AI performance. Although these chips will not be able to handle the more demanding AI applications, they are still an excellent value for basic AI tasks.\n\nAMD's Gaming Chips for Desktop, Laptop, and Handheld Systems\n\nBeyond AI PC chips, AMD has made tremendous strides in the gaming world by unveiling several high-performance gaming CPUs. For desktop and laptop gamers, AMD introduced the Ryzen 9950X3D and Ryzen 9900X3D. These chips are built for extreme gaming performance and content creation, offering unmatched power for high-end systems.\n\nFor laptop gamers who need performance on the go, the new Ryzen 9000HX series promises better temperature control, which means that during intense gaming sessions, battery life will be improved.

            "content": "AMD just teased the Radeon RX 9070 yesterday at CES 2025 with very little in the way of specs or even a release date. However, because Team Red was demoing the Radeon RX 9070 at its booth with Call of Duty Black Ops 6 \u2013 which has a built-in Benchmark tool \u2013 I was able to get a quick peek how this next-gen GPU performs.\n\nAll told, at 4K Extreme settings without upscaling or frame generation, the Radeon RX 9070 was capable of an impressive 99fps average, even if it had the same visual bug as the Intel Arc B580 when I benchmarked it. Now, to be clear, this graphics card is running on very early alpha drivers, and that bug will more than likely be resolved by the time the card comes to market. But even on those early drivers, a solid 99fps is incredibly impressive.\n\nBecause I ran the benchmark without upscaling, rather than the vendor appropriate upscaling method that I use when I usually benchmark this game for graphics card reviews, I don't have a direct comparison I can make. However, even with DLSS on the 'Quality' setting, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super gets around 129fps on the same graphics preset at 4K. Given that DLSS adds about a 30% performance jump at the Quality setting, that may place the Radeon RX 9070 on equal footing with the 4080 Super \u2013 though I'd need to test the 4080 Super without DLSS to know for sure.\n\nSome of the amazing performance of this benchmark is likely due to the CPU as well \u2013 the rig was running on an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D, a high-end gaming CPU that was also announced yesterday. But if this is the level of performance we can expect when the Radeon RX 9070 launches later this year, it's going to be an awesome card for anyone looking for a mid-range solution.\n\nThe benchmark also gives a bit of insight to the specs of the graphics card, though it is limited. The Radeon RX 9070 has 16GB of VRAM, though we still don't know how many graphics cores or at what clock speed the card is running at.\n\nThis is just one test, though, and I won't have a clear picture of how this graphics card will perform across a variety of games until I get it in the lab to put it through the full testing suite. But the sneak peek is definitely exciting.\n\nJackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen. You can follow her @Jackiecobra",

All four models, on the other hand, have a commercial version that comes with AMD\u2019s Ryzen Pro management and security features.\n\nWith up to 16 Zen 5 cores, the Ryzen AI Max series increases the maximum core count by four while upping the number of XDNA 3.5 GPU cores by 16 to a maximum of 40 compute units compared to the flagship Ryzen AI 9 HX 375 that debuted last year.\n\nThe lowest-end chip in the Ryzen AI Max series comes with six cores, 12 threads, a maximum clock boost of 4.9GHz and 16 graphics cores.\n\nMeanwhile, the lineup\u2019s XDNA 2 NPU (neural processing unit) is capable of up to 50 trillion operations per second (TOPS) across all models. This is slightly under the 55 TOPS maximum that is possible with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 375.\n\nThe CPU, GPU and NPU are tied together with a new \u201cunified, coherent memory architecture\u201d that allows the PC to allocate up to 96GB of system memory for the GPU, according to Tikoo. This is boosted by a memory bandwidth of 256 GB/s, which the AMD executive called \u201cunprecedented in any x86 mobile device.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt bridges the gap between awesome performance and efficient portability in a whole new way for Windows laptops,\u201d Tikoo said.\n\nHow Ryzen AI Max Compares To Intel, Apple And Nvidia Chips\n\nIn handpicked comparisons to chips from Intel, Apple and Nvidia, the flagship Ryzen AI Max+ 395 was shown by AMD to perform better by varying degrees across benchmarks for 3-D rendering, graphics and running inference for large language models.\n\nCompared to Intel\u2019s recently launched eight-core Core Ultra 9 288V, the 16-core Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is, on average, 2.6 times faster across six 3-D rendering benchmarks, which included Cinebench 2024 nT, Corona and Blender Classroom, according to AMD.\n\nAs for graphics benchmarks such as Night Raid, Time Spy and Fire Strike, the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is 40 percent faster on average, AMD claimed.\n\nThe chip designer also showed that the Ryzen chip is faster than Apple\u2019s 12-core M4 Pro chip\u2014which is available in new MacBook Pros and Mac minis\u2014by 12 percent in Cinebench 2024 nT, 25 percent in Blender Classroom, 39 percent in Corona and 86 percent in Vray.\n\nCompared to Apple\u2019s 14-core M4 Pro, the Ryzen chip is faster by 10 percent in Blender Classroom, 24 percent in Corona and 59 percent in Vray, according to AMD. However, the company conceded that the Ryzen AI Max+ 350 is 3 percent slower than the 14-core M4 Pro in the Cinebench 2024 nT benchmark.\n\nAMD also said the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 could outshine Nvidia\u2019s 24-GB GeForce RTX 4090 desktop graphics card when it comes to AI workloads. When running a 70-billion-parameter Llama 3.1 large language model in LM Studio, the Ryzen chip was 2.2 times faster when measuring tokens per second, according to the chip designer.\n\nThe company noted that the Ryzen system used 128GB of system RAM while the GeForce system had 32 GB of RAM and 24 GB of GPU memory for this comparison.\n\nAMD pointed out that the Ryzen system used significantly less energy than the GeForce system in the test, with the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 platform using 55 watts for its thermal design power, 87 percent less than the RTX 4090\u2019s 450 watts.\n\n\u201cThe Ryzen AI Max processor is really a game changer for creators, artists and developers,\u201d said Tikoo.",

            "content": "New single-chip processor features significantly enhanced GPU to take on Intel / Nvidia in graphics intensive workflows for workstations\n\nAMD has unveiled its highly anticipated \u2018Strix Halo\u2019 AMD Ryzen AI Max PRO, a single-chip processor that looks set to deliver a significant leap forward for APUs (Accelerated Processing Units)\u2014 CPUs with integrated GPUs.\n\nThe new processor, which is designed for mobile workstations and micro desktop workstations, features up to 16 \u2018Zen 5\u2019 CPU cores, a powerful \u2018RDNA 3.5\u2019 integrated GPU, and an integrated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for AI rated at 50 TOPS. Despite the computational potential, the power demands of the new chip are relatively low, featuring a configurable Thermal Design Power (cTDP) of 45W \u2013 120W.\n\nThis article is part of AEC Magazine\u2019s 2025 Workstation Special report\n\nAt launch, the new processor will be available exclusively from HP in the HP ZBook Ultra G1 A mobile workstation and HP Z2 Mini G1 A desktop workstation (read this article).\n\nThe Ryzen AI Max PRO pushes the message that users no longer need to rely on a separate CPU and GPU, providing a compelling alternative to the dominant combination of Intel (CPU) and Nvidia (GPU). Read what AEC Magazine thinks\n\nOn paper, the AMD Ryzen AI Max PRO represents a major advancement across multiple fronts, particularly in graphics, where performance is reported to rival that of discrete GPUs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompared to the AMD Ryzen AI PRO 300 Series laptop APU, which launched last year, the AMD Ryzen AI Max PRO features significantly more RDNA 3.5 graphics compute units (40 vs 16), which should make it applicable to a much wider range of GPU-intensive workflows, such as real-time visualisation and rendering.\n\nMoreover, with a unified memory architecture, up to 96 GB of the platform\u2019s maximum 128 GB of 8000MT/s LPDDR5X memory can be allocated exclusively to the GPU. Typically, such vast quantities of GPU memory are only available in extremely powerful and expensive cloud-based GPUs.\n\nAccording to AMD, giving the GPU access to this much memory allows the AMD Ryzen AI Max PRO to handle \u2018incredibly large, high-precision AI workloads\u2019. The company states the chip can run a 70-billion parameter large language model (LLM) 2.2 times faster than a 24 GB Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU.\n\nMeanwhile, the NPU is designed to handle lighter AI tasks, such as those offered by Windows Copilot+ and video conferencing features like AutoFrame, background blur, and noise suppression.\n\nAMD is launching four AMD Ryzen AI Max PRO models, including the top-end AMD Ryzen AI Max+ PRO 395 with 16 \u2018Zen 5\u2019 cores, 32 threads, up to 5.1 GHz max boost, 80 MB of Cache, 50 peak TOPS and 40 Graphics cores. The full line up can be seen below.\n\nNon \u2018PRO\u2019 versions of the chip are also available for consumers. They feature the same silicon but lack certain security and manageability features, as well as Radeon Pro graphics drivers, which are Independent Software Vendor (ISV)-certified for CAD, BIM, and other professional applications.\n\nWhat AEC Magazine thinks\n\nThe AMD Ryzen AI Max PRO processor is poised to make a significant impact in the workstation sector. On the desktop, AMD has already disrupted the high-end workstation space with its Threadripper Pro processors, severely impacting sales of Intel Xeon workstations. Now, the company aims to bring this success to mobile and micro desktop workstations, with the promise of significantly improved graphics and power efficiency.\n\nThe Ryzen AI Max PRO pushes the message that users no longer need to rely on a separate CPU and GPU, providing a compelling alternative to the dominant combination of Intel (CPU) and Nvidia (GPU).\n\nHowever, AMD faces challenges, particularly in the realm of professional graphics. While the Ryzen AI Max PRO\u2019s RDNA 3.5 GPU should perform well in CAD and core workflows in viz software like Twinmotion and Lumion, it lags behind Nvidia in ray tracing performance. Furthermore, some AEC-focused ISVs rely on Nvidia GPUs to accelerate certain features, and AMD\u2019s graphics drivers could certainly benefit from more optimisation in some professional 3D applications.\n\nIn the AI space, although the GPU\u2019s large memory capacity shows great promise, software compatibility will be a key factor in determining the success of the chip, as Nvidia currently holds a commanding lead in AI workloads.\n\nUltimately, while the AMD Ryzen AI Max PRO shows impressive potential and positions AMD as a strong contender in both mobile and micro desktop workstations, its success will hinge on gaining support from other major workstation OEMs and overcoming challenges related to graphics and software. To truly compete with Intel / Nvidia, AMD will need to match the maturity and ecosystem support that Nvidia currently offers.",

            "content": "Where Intel's new CPU designs are a little too split between optimizing for AI and optimizing for everything else, the chips AMD debuted at CES 2025 show more consistency: If they have a Neural Processing Unit, it's the current generation rather than a mix. So if it's got \"AI\" in the name, that means it has the 50 trillion operations per second (max) architecture, so that's one less tradeoff to worry about when buying a laptop. And AMD's CES looks more interesting, with new designs like the Ryzen AI Max and Max Plus chips, the mobile launch of its gaming-optimized X3D stacked-memory architecture in the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D, and an expansion to its desktop X3D line with the Ryzen 9 9950X3D that has a technology twist intended to make it as good for creating as it is for gaming.\n\nThe company also delivered more information about its new RDNA 4-generation of graphics architecture, which underpins the new Radeon RX 9000 series desktop GPUs, starting with the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT (shipping soon). AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution 4, the new version of its upscaling and optimization software, builds on the capabilities of RDNA 4.\n\nThere's also a profusion of the usual expansions of CPU lines. In this case they go to lower-end parts of the Ryzen AI chips launched this summer, the new generation of Ryzen 9 HX-series performance-focused CPUs, a minor refresh of its Z series (with the Ryzen Z2, Z2 Extreme and a new lower-end Z2 Go) and more.\n\nRadeon RX 9070, 9070XT, 9060\n\nWe don't have real specs yet for these new desktop graphics cards. We just know they'll be shipping this quarter from AMD's usual partners, such as Acer, Asus, Sapphire, XFX, ASRock, Gigabyte, PowerColor and more.\n\nWe do know AMD has reworked its branding to match Nvidia's. Notice the -70 and -60 in the names? That's intended to indicate which GeForce RTX card they compete with... at least for the RTX 4000 cards. What happens if, say, a new RTX -60 performs like the 4070? The company has also skipped an RX 8000 series and gone straight to RX 9000, because its current desktop chips are there. RX 8000 will live on in laptops, as a way to indicate that the GPU is of the RDNA 3.5 generation. Which brings us to to 9000 series architecture...\n\nRDNA 4. This generation incorporates XDNA 2, the same AI architecture as the current CPUs. It also updates the ray tracing (third gen) -- I really hope it's gotten faster -- and an updated Radiance Display Engine (second gen), which controls color bit depth, HDR and connections. The compute units are supposedly more efficient and AMD says the media encoding is better. Like everyone, AMD's Adrenalin application offers some look-what-AI-can-do apps, including image generation, a chatbot to answer questions about AMD's products and more.\n\nThe Ryzen 9 9000HX series die. AMD/CNET\n\nThe other \"4\" belongs to FidelityFX Super Resolution, which adds ML-powered upscaling -- that's what Nvidia DLSS has been doing for a few years -- specifically for RDNA 4 GPUs. It's targeting 4K high quality or high performance performance gameplay, and includes all the features currently FFXSR 3.1.\n\nWatch this: Everything Announced by AMD at CES 2025 in 7 Minutes 07:07\n\nRyzen AI Max and Max Plus\n\nThe Max series are steroidal expansions to the line, flagship APUs for larger laptops that don't include a discrete GPU -- primarily for working with larger AI models and some gaming. They've got a new memory interface that increases memory bandwidth and a ton more graphics compute units, needed by the larger AI models and heavy graphics and video work. In fact, AMD says it's faster than Apple's 14-core version of the M4 Pro.\n\nAMD has renamed the higher-power integrated GPU, designating it the 8060S; it's fundamentally different than the M series GPUs because of its unified memory architecture (which, like Apple's chips, lets all the processing units share the total system memory).\n\nRyzen AI 300 series specs\n\nCores (Zen 5/5c) Max boost (GHz) Total threads XDNA 2 NPU performance (up to) Power class (base/boost) GPU GPU cores (RDNA 3.5) Expected availabilty Ryzen AI 7 350 8 (4/4) 5 16 50 TOPS 15W-54W 860M 8 Q2 2025 Ryzen AI 5 340 6 (3/3) 4.8 16 50 TOPS 15W-54W 840M 4 Q2 2025 Ryzen AI Max 385 8 (8/0) 5 16 50 TOPS 45W-120W 8060S 32 H1 2025 Ryzen AI Max 390 12 (12/0) 5 24 50 TOPS 45W-120W 8060S 32 H1 2025 Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 16 (16/0) 5.1 32 50 TOPS 45W-120W 8060S 40 H1 2025\n\nRyzen 9 9000HX series\n\nThe X3D versions of AMD's CPUs have a large memory cache underneath the processor (3D V-cache), which is closer than usual. This minimizes the frequent trips between the cores and the cache -- frequent trips that generate heat. It helps keep the processor cores cool, which in turn allows it to run faster.\n\nIntroducing a mobile version of that architecture in the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D will make it AMDs fastest mobile chip. Because it's expected to rely on a discrete GPU for its graphics processing, the integrated GPU on the HX series is typically low power, something it unfortunately shares with Intel's HX series. But with the discrete GPU and the relatively powerful NPU, laptops with it should be fast for almost any work or gaming.\n\nRyzen 9 9000HX series specs\n\nZen 5 Cores/Max boost (GHz) Total threads NPU performance (up to) Power class (base/boost) Expected availabilty Ryzen 9 9955HX3D 16/5.4 32 50 TOPS 55W-75W H1 2025 Ryzen 9 9955HX 16/5.4 32 50 TOPS 55W-75W H1 2025 Ryzen 9 9850HX 13/5.2 24 50 TOPS 45W-75W H1 2025\n\nThe desktop flagship that mirrors this is the Ryzen 9 9950X3D. Because the stacked cache design can result in a small drop in clock frequency on nongaming tasks, AMD tweaked the new CPU by adding a second die, which can run at the maximum frequency, essentially unstacking the 3D V-cache. Thus, AMD proclaims this chip not just the best for gaming, but for content creation as well.\n\nRyzen 9 X3D specs\n\nZen 5 Cores Total threads Base/Max boost (GHz) TDP Expected availabilty Ryzen 9 9950X3D 16 32 4.8/5.7 170W H1 2025 Ryzen 9 9900X3D 12 24 4.4/5.5 120W H1 2025\n\nRyzen Z2 series\n\nThese are seemingly minor upgrades, but this processor line is popular for handheld gaming consoles, and there's a new lower-end Z2 Go which hints at perhaps a lower-priced class of these devices, which tend to be pricey (the relatively inexpensive Nintendo Switch uses an Nvidia Tegra processor).\n\nRyzen Z2 series specs\n\nZen/Zen c cores Total threads Max boost (GHz) Power class (base/boost, watts) GPU cores (RDNA 3.5) Expected availabilty Ryzen Z2 8/0 16 5.1 15W-35W 12 Q1 2025 Ryzen Z2 Go 4/0 8 4.3 15W-35W 12 Q1 2025 Ryzen Z2 Extreme 3/5 16 5 15W-35W 16 Q1 2025\n\nFor more coverage of CES 2025, check out some of the new CES products that you can actually buy right now, or scroll through the most ridiculous and bizarre CES products of this century.",

            "content": "At CES 2025 in Las Vegas, AMD unveiled a slew of new chips destined for devices ranging from desktops to gaming handhelds.\n\nAMD is riding high coming into this year\u2019s CES. The company commanded a 28.7% share of the desktop CPU segment in Q3 2024, up 9.6 percentage points compared to the same quarter the year prior. In mobile, AMD held 22.3% of the chip market as of last Q3, a 2.8-percentage-point uptick from the previous fiscal period.\n\nThe company isn\u2019t resting on its laurels, though. AMD\u2019s 2025 strategy is aggressive and multipronged \u2014 and it begins with the Ryzen 9 9950X3D.\n\nAimed at \u201cgamers and creators,\u201d the 9950X3D has 16 cores based on AMD\u2019s Zen 5 architecture clocked up to 5.7GHz. According to the company\u2019s benchmarks, the 9950X3D is 8% faster on average in popular games like Hogwarts Legacy and Starfield versus AMD\u2019s 7950X3D.\n\nImage Credits:AMD\n\nThe 9950X3D, along with the Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a lower-tier processor with 12 cores clocked up to 5.5GHz, will ship sometime in Q1 2025, AMD said.\n\nTo complement the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D, AMD also announced a new \u201cFire Range\u201d lineup of chips targeting midrange laptops and ultraportables. Set to launch in the first half of 2025, the series \u2014 which includes the Ryzen 9 9850HX, 9955HX, and 9955HX3D \u2014 offers 12 to 16 cores clocked at between 5.2GHz and 5.4GHz at the maximum.\n\nNotably, the Fire Range chips draw around ~54 W of power \u2014 less than half the wattage requirement of the 9950X3D (170 W).\n\nAI PC chips\n\nTo power the next generation of Copilot+ PCs \u2014 laptops and compact desktops with AI-accelerated Windows 11 features \u2014 AMD is launching new and refreshed processor series: the Ryzen AI 300 series and Ryzen AI Max series.\n\nAll chips in the series have a dedicated neural processing unit (NPU) to accelerate certain AI workloads, like running a text-summarizing language model or Windows 11\u2019s AI-powered image editor.\n\nRyzen 300 series chips, which will come to market in Q1/Q2 2025, pack between 6 and 8 cores clocked at up to 5GHz, and deliver \u201c24-plus-hour\u201d battery life in the best-case scenario (e.g., light work only). There\u2019s four SKUs: Ryzen AI 7 350, Ryzen AI 5 340, Ryzen AI 7 Pro 350, and Ryzen AI 5 Pro 340.\n\nImage Credits:AMD\n\nAs for the Ryzen AI Max, this is AMD\u2019s flagship offering for Copilot+ PCs, with between 6 and 16 cores clocked at up to 5.1GHz, paired with built-in graphics and a new memory interface. AMD\u2019s claiming that Ryzen AI Max chips can achieve leading 3D rendering and AI application performance.\n\nSKUs in the series \u2014 which include the Ryzen AI Max+ 395, Ryzen AI Max+ Pro 395, Ryzen AI Max 390, Ryzen AI Max Pro 390, Ryzen AI Max 385, Ryzen AI Max Pro 385, and Ryzen AI Max Pro 380 \u2014 are set to launch beginning Q1/Q2.\n\nTargeting more budget-friendly, \u201cmainstream\u201d devices, AMD also debuted the new Ryzen 200 series of chips. The processors \u2014 most of which sport NPUs \u2014 have between 6 and 8 cores clocked up to 5.2GHz, and are scheduled to launch in Q2 2025.\n\nHandheld processors\n\nHandheld PCs like Valve\u2019s Steam Deck continue to be a major growth area for AMD. To that end, the chipmaker announced new processors in its Ryzen Z2 series, which is meant for lightweight and gaming-focused form factors.\n\nThere\u2019s the Ryzen Z2 Go, which has four cores clocked up to 4.3GHz and 12 graphics cores, and the Ryzen Z2 Extreme, which has eight cores clocked up to 5Ghz and 16 graphics cores. They join the eight-core Ryzen Z2, whose cores top out at 5.1GHz and which packs 12 graphics cores.\n\nAll three Ryzen Z2 SKUs will be available Q1 2025.\n\nGraphics cards\n\nLastly, AMD revealed its next set of discrete, desktop-bound GPUs: the Radeon RX 9070 XT and Radeon RX 9070. They\u2019re based on the company\u2019s RDNA 4 architecture, a 4nm architecture that the company says features improved ray tracing performance, better media-encoding quality, and improved AI acceleration.\n\nThe RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 cards will be available from manufacturers, including Acer, Asus, Gigabyte, and XFX, in Q1 2025.\n\nImage Credits:AMD\n\nAMD highlighted its FidelityFX Super Resolution 4.0 upscaling technology, which it says was developed for RDNA 4 hardware. Super Resolution 4.0 leverages AI algorithms to upscale game content to up to 4K resolution with minimal latency, AMD says.\n\nIn a related development, AMD Adrenalin, AMD\u2019s software that lets users manage and tune their AMD hardware, including Radeon graphics cards, has new AI features. Adrenalin can now generate images using a built-in image-generation model, leverage a local language model to summarize files like PDFs, and answer AMD-related questions via an AI-powered chatbot interface.",

The company on Monday announced its new Ryzen AI Max, additional Ryzen AI 300, and Ryzen AI 200 central processing units (CPUs) for AI PCs, as well as high-powered chips for gaming desktops and laptops and handheld gaming systems.\n\nThe chips set up AMD to further compete with rivals Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM) in the still nascent AI PC space and Intel on the desktop and mobile gaming fronts, two important markets for the semiconductor firm.\n\nThe Ryzen AI Max chips are designed for high-powered laptops targeting gamers and content creators. The company says they\u2019ll feature up to 128GB of unified memory and a neural processing unit capable of up to 50 TOPS (trillions of operations per second).\n\nTOPS are a general means of measuring a chip\u2019s AI performance. AMD, Intel, Nvidia (NVDA), and Qualcomm are each pushing TOPS as the specification consumers should pay attention to when it comes to picking out AI PCs.\n\nAMD says the Ryzen AI Max will also come in a PRO series that will feature AMD PRO capabilities including improved security and enterprise management functionality.\n\nIn addition to the AI Max, AMD also showed off its latest AI 300 and AI 300 Pro Series chips, including the Ryzen AI 7 350 and Ryzen AI 5 340. AMD says the chips are designed to run AI PCs for consumers and enterprise customers that don\u2019t necessarily need the high-flying power of its AI Max processors.\n\nLike AMD\u2019s Max chips, however, the AI 300 and AI 300 Pros offer 50 TOPS of AI performance, meaning they can run things like Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Copilot+ PC apps, including its Recall and Click to Do options, which allow you to take snapshots of your activity, quickly pick up where you left off, and take dynamic actions related to on-screen text and images.\n\nAMD also debuted its Ryzen 200 and Ryzen 200 PRO Series chips for affordable consumer and enterprise laptops. Unlike the Ryzen AI Max and Ryzen AI 300 processors, however, the Ryzen 200 only offers 16 TOPS, which means they may not be able to run more advanced AI applications.\n\nThe Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

For hardcore PC gamers and content creators, there\u2019s the Ryzen 9950X3D and Ryzen 9900X3D. Gamers looking for high-performance laptops get the new Ryzen 9000HX Series chips, which AMD says offer better temperature control, which can save on battery life.\n\nFinally, the company revealed its Ryzen Z2 Series gaming chips for handheld gaming systems. Handheld PC systems are generally similar in size to Nintendo\u2019s popular Switch console but run Windows or Linux-based operating systems and can play PC games.\n\nStory Continues",

This is the Compal SG720-2A, an AMD EPYC and AMD Instinct MI325X AI server we saw on the show floor.\n\nCompal SG720-2A AMD EPYC and AMD Instinct MI325X AI Server\n\nHere is the quick spec sheet, which includes SSD storage, and many expansion slots. The prominent feature is that this AMD EPYC 9005 Turin system supports up to 500W TDP CPUs.\n\nThe front of this server is a fan aficionado\u2019s dream. The top portion is three rows of fans, followed by the U.2 drive bays, and then more fans.\n\nHere is what the other side of the fan wall looks like.\n\nThe bottom section has the U.2 drive bays, but then a neat feature. This is actually a front I/O server with the management port and front KVM hookups. On either side, we have OCP NIC 3.0 slots.\n\nTurning to the rear of the server, we have a big GPU tray on top. Usually top-tier designs have GPUs on top since that minimizes the PCIe trace lengths. Likewise, a tray design is important to ensure that systems are easy to service while in racks.\n\nOn the bottom rear, we have six power supply slots which is a 5+1 design. The PCIe slots are also on serviceable trays.\n\nAs an AMD Instinct MI325X (and MI300X) server, this offers something different than the NVIDIA HGX platforms. AMD\u2019s platform does not have the NVLink switch architecture, and instead uses the OCP UBB.\n\nStill, the two CPU and eight GPU option might be attractive to many users.\n\nFinal Words\n\nWe are going to hear plenty around NVIDIA servers since we are in the middle of doing in-depth reviews of three NVIDIA HGX H200 platforms. We wanted to at least take a moment to show the AMD competition given that.",

This might seem surprising, given that the semi giant is often seen as a potential challenger to Nvidia in the AI chip segment.\n\nDon't Miss Our New Year's Offers:\n\nDiscover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks\n\nMake smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter\n\nHowever, the market appears to have adopted a skeptical stance regarding its ability to make significant inroads. To wit, while AI-focused stocks have been all the rage, AMD shares have shed 10% over the past 12 months.\n\nHowever, Northland\u2019s Gus Richard, an analyst ranked in the top 2% of Wall Street stock experts, thinks investors are presented with a great opportunity here, with the 5-star analyst viewing AMD as one of his \u201cTop Picks for CY25.\u201d\n\nRichard backs his optimism with several compelling arguments: \u201cWe expect AMD to continue to gain share in AI GPUs, server CPUs, and PC clients as headwinds from the embedded and gaming segments abate. AMD is winning share in AI based on its roadmap and TCO. AMD has better products for server and client CPUs. The PC refresh cycle will likely be much stronger than currently expected. We think there is significantly more upside to CY25 than risks.\u201d\n\nRichard is calling for AI revenue of $9.5 billion in CY25, up from $5.2 billion, with the first half of 2025 showing a 7% increase compared to 2H24. As AMD will ramp its MI325X in 1H25, Richard thinks that is a conservative estimate, with the analyst believing it is \u201ccompetitive with NVDA\u2019s H200.\u201d\n\nHowever, the main issue remains the software. Here, Richard thinks there\u2019s an ongoing debate about how long CUDA provides Nvidia with a competitive edge. Nvidia\u2019s \u201clead is significant\u201d due to its extensive software ecosystem, large market share, and early development in GPU computing. Meanwhile, AMD\u2019s open-source ROCm platform is improving but still behind. CUDA\u2019s flexibility allows code to run on both AI server clusters and graphics cards, enabling developers to work across multiple environments (such as on laptops). AMD\u2019s server microarchitecture, CDNA, is separate from its graphics GPU design, limiting developers\u2019 options. However, Richard notes that AMD\u2019s MI300X is widely available in the cloud. While Nvidia dominates in AI training, AMD\u2019s MI300X is competitive in inference, matching Nvidia\u2019s H100 in recent benchmarks.\n\nElsewhere, Richard anticipates AMD will keep eating away at Intel\u2019s share in PC clients. As Microsoft ends support for Windows 10, which currently runs on about 1.2 billion systems, Richard expects \u201cstrong PC demand in 2025.\u201d While overall PC inventory is slightly high, AMD\u2019s inventory \u201cis in good shape.\u201d Richard thinks client revenue in 2025 will reach $7.9 billion, amounting to a 15% year-over-year increase. However, if the replacement cycle goes ahead as expected and AMD maintains its market share, Richard believes client revenue could be $1-2 billion higher than that estimate.\n\nAll told, Richard rates AMD shares an Outperform (i.e., Buy), along with a $175 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of ~40% from current levels. (To watch Richard\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nIn general, the rest of the Street has an optimistic view of AMD. The stock\u2019s Strong Buy status comes from the 24 Buys and 8 Holds issued over the past three months. Adding to the good news, the upside potential lands at 47% based on the $184.37 average price target.

            "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has captured significant attention in the investment world, especially after Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest purchased 82,456 shares on December 31. This acquisition, valued at approximately $10.32 million, is based on AMD\u2019s January 3 closing price of $125.37 per share. This move by Ark Invest underscores the confidence some investors still have in AMD, despite the mixed signals from its recent financial performances.\n\nIn October 2024, AMD reported third-quarter earnings that met analysts\u2019 expectations, driven by an 18% revenue increase to $6.82 billion, exceeding the forecasted $6.71 billion. However, the optimism was tempered when the company\u2019s fourth-quarter guidance fell short of Wall Street\u2019s hopes, projecting sales of $7.5 billion, just shy of the $7.54 billion analysts had anticipated. This discrepancy raised concerns about AMD\u2019s ability to capitalize on the burgeoning AI market, where it has been playing catch-up to Nvidia (NVDA), the current leader in AI GPU technology.\n\nThe narrative around AMD continues to be heavily influenced by its ventures into artificial intelligence (AI). Despite the excitement, AMD\u2019s market share in AI remains considerably smaller than Nvidia\u2019s, which has carved out a dominant position in the AI GPU sector. This gap highlights the challenges AMD faces in not only scaling its production but also in innovating to meet the specific demands of AI applications where performance per watt and efficiency are critical.\n\nCEO Lisa Su has acknowledged the supply constraints, noting that chip supplies would be tight in 2025. During Q3\u2019s earnings call, she highlighted that the demand for AI chips from major tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) is surging at a pace far exceeding the supply from AMD and its larger rival, Nvidia. This imbalance is creating significant strain on production capabilities. This is partly due to supply constraints at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), the world\u2019s largest contract chip manufacturer. This admission points to broader industry issues where demand for high-performance chips outstrips supply, particularly in tech sectors driven by AI, gaming, and data centers. Su\u2019s comments during the earnings call reflect a strategic optimism, however, with plans for significant growth and an emphasis on enhancing supply chain capabilities to address these shortages.\n\nInvestors and analysts are thus watching closely how AMD will navigate these challenges. The company\u2019s ability to ramp up production, innovate, and capture more of the AI market will be crucial. While Ark Invest\u2019s recent investment shows faith in AMD\u2019s potential, the broader market seems cautious, awaiting clearer signs of AMD\u2019s trajectory in AI and beyond. The balance between supply constraints and market demand, along with AMD\u2019s strategic initiatives, will likely shape its stock performance \u2014 which has fallen 26.64% over the last three months and around 10% over the past year \u2014 as well as influence investor sentiment in the year ahead.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

The board will feature 4x DIMMs, 2x PCI-E x16 slots, 1x PCI-E x1 slot, at least 3x M.2 connectors, 4x SATA ports, and built-in WiFi 7. It will feature Thunderbolt 4 ports on the I/O as well, as seen on the box. The motherboard has 2x 8-pin EPS connectors above the DIMM slots, which we saw previously as well, and there is an additional 8-pin PCI-E connector at the bottom, which will provide up to 150W of power to the GPU alongside 75W from the PCI-E x16 slot.\n\nThe next three are all AM5 motherboards. The first one is the MSI PRO B850-P WiFi, featuring a black PCB with white/silverish heatsinks. The board features 4x PCI-E x16 slots, which is rare on budget motherboards these days, and also has that 8-pin connector at the bottom. There are 3x m.2 slots and 4x SATA ports for storage drives.\n\nThe third one is the MSI B840 Gaming Plus WiFi, offering a unique appearance with white heatsinks and grey-blue accents. There are even more PCI-E x16 slots on this one than you will see on the PRO B850-P WiFi. A whopping 5x PCI-E x16 slots are available on this board, which is too many, but apparently, you won't be able to fully populate all of them at the same time due to PCI-E lane limitations. It misses the bottom 8-pin PCI-E connector and appears to be an entry-level board.\n\nThe last one is the MSI PRO B840-P WiFi, which also gets 5x PCI-E x16 slots, 4x DIMMs, 2x M.2 connectors, 4x SATA ports, and some basic connectivity. All of these are expected to be unveiled at CES, where their detailed specs, features, pricing, and availability will be disclosed.",

The 32GB of RAM is pre-installed but it can be upgraded to 96GB of RAM, while the 2TB of SSD storage can be expanded up to an 8TB SSD (there are dual M.2 SSD slots inside).\n\nThe Hawk Point APU comes with the Radeon 780M integrated GPU which is good for mainstream games, but it's not as good as the new Strix Point APU that features an RDNA 3.5-based iGPU. However, that's where the OCulink port comes into play as it can provide GMKtec K11 Mini-PC owners to plug in an external graphics card, amplifying gaming performance.\n\nGMKtec says that they have 70W of cooling power for the K11 Mini-PC which seems fine, with the Mini-PC joined by dual USB4.0 ports, dual 2.5GbE ethernet port, HDMI 2.1 + DisplayPort 2.1, dual USB 2.0 ports, and a 3.5mm audio jack. There's also Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 for wireless connectivity.\n\n3\n\nAs for pricing, the Hawk Point APU-powered Mini-PC is pretty expensive considering it starts at $479.99 in barebones form, moving to $649 for 32TB + 2TB, while first-time buyers can get a (whopping) $10 discount by giving GMKtec their e-mail address.",

            "content": "Wall Street left AMD in the dust in 2024, but that could soon change in a big way.\n\nThe stock market can sometimes feel like a popularity contest. Investors have flocked to Nvidia because it's the dominant supplier of the data center chips powering artificial intelligence (AI) models. On the other hand, Wall Street has seemingly left Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.92%) in the dust. While Nvidia has soared an impressive 170% over the past 12 months, AMD has declined nearly 20%.\n\nIt's clear that AMD isn't the AI company Nvidia is. Its $3.5 billion in data center revenue in Q3 was a fraction of Nvidia's $30.8 billion. However, investing isn't always about following the herd. Often, the underdog can win big, too. Is AMD poised to perform better in 2025? Keep reading to discover if the stock is a buy right now.\n\nAMD is finding AI success on a smaller scale\n\nAMD offers its Instinct line of accelerator chips, which are purpose-built for artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia is currently the market leader in AI chips, but the big technology companies that buy these chips for their data centers don't want to depend on one supplier for such a critical need. Therefore, companies like Microsoft and Meta Platforms work with other chips, including AMD's Instinct line.\n\nAs mentioned, AMD's data center revenue in Q3 was about 10% of Nvidia's. That's not bad when you're in such a vast market. Research from S&S Insider estimates that the AI chip market will grow from $61.4 billion in 2023 to $632 billion by 2032. AMD CEO Lisa Su has estimated it will reach $500 billion by 2028, a similar trajectory.\n\nNvidia's total revenue over the past four quarters was $113 billion, which shows just how much room there still is for growth in AI chips. AMD doesn't need to lead -- it can compete and still do very well for investors.\n\nAI's impact on AMD should be more pronounced in 2025\n\nNow, let's discuss why Nvidia's stock has performed so well, why AMD's hasn't, and why that could change. Each stock's performance over the past year makes sense when you look at the numbers. You can see below that Nvidia has grown revenue much more quickly than AMD. Given Nvidia's superior growth, it's not a shock that it enjoys a far higher price-to-sales ratio (P/S) than AMD. That said, AMD could soon join the party.\n\nData center sales (where AI chips go) make up almost all of Nvidia's revenue, so AI-driven growth carries the whole business. However, AMD is more diversified than Nvidia, as data center revenue represents barely half of total Q3 sales.\n\nInvestors may not realize that AMD, despite its inferior market position, is seeing plenty of success. The company's data center segment grew 122% year over year in Q3, faster than Nvidia's 112%.\n\nIf this continues, AMD's total revenue growth will accelerate as AI becomes a more significant part of the business. As you can see above, this has happened over the past few quarters.\n\nAMD could be a coiled spring ready to unleash returns\n\nThings seem poised to pick up speed in 2025. Analysts estimate AMD's revenue will finish 2024 at $25.66 billion and increase to $32.56 billion in 2025. If accurate, that would represent nearly 27% growth. Ironically, AMD stock trades at a P/S ratio of 8.1 today, a far lower valuation than in early 2024, when growth was nowhere close to 27%.\n\nIt's also roughly just a quarter of Nvidia's valuation. I'm not arguing that AMD deserves a valuation as high as Nvidia's, but AMD has plenty of room for that valuation to expand. When you add things up, it starts getting interesting.\n\nAMD's valuation could remain stagnant, and growing 27% would still produce a stellar one-year return. Factor in a higher valuation, and AMD could have a stretch similar to what Nvidia investors have enjoyed over the past few years. That handily makes the stock a buy today.",

            "content": "AMD is rumored to be working on a successor to its Dragon Range (Ryzen 7045HX) processor lineup, codenamed Fire Range. Wu Haijun, chairman of Hasee, a Chinese PC manufacturer, has reportedly confirmed that these upcoming CPUs will be branded per AMD's old naming scheme and further asserted the development of an X3D variant on mobile, namely the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D (via Golden Pig Upgrade Pack). In addition, the discussion also touched on Intel's Arrow Lake-HX processors, but the sentiment was not strictly positive.\n\nAMD and Intel offer select processors employing desktop-grade silicon branded with the HX suffix at the high end. With Ryzen 7000, AMD introduced the Dragon Range series, featuring upwards of two CCDs and one IOD, distinct from other mobile counterparts, which are monolithic. These processors are designated for workstations or desktop replacements but suffer from poor battery life due to the multi-chiplet design. Likewise, Intel's HX-series processors are no different, with the latest iteration, Core Ultra 200HX or Arrow Lake HX, expected to debut at CES.\n\nAt a recent pre-launch product briefing, Wu Haijun, president and founder of Hasee Computer Company, shared essential details about AMD and Intel's forthcoming HX processors. Reportedly, AMD is porting its X3D or 3D V-Cache technology to mobile with Fire Range X3D.\n\nHowever, Wu Haijun named the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D, an upcoming mobile CPU from AMD, after the Ryzen 9 7945HX3D. He didn't confirm whether Hasee products would feature this processor on their laptops. Interestingly, while AMD's Zen 5 mobile CPUs have adopted the new Ryzen AI 300 branding, the firm is reviving its old naming scheme for Fire Range.\n\nOn the other hand, Arrow Lake-HX was also a part of the discussion at the meeting. Per the report, Intel's 255HX and 275HX, alleged to be 20 and 24 core offerings, respectively, are not that impressive in performance. The exact definition of the word \"performance\" in this context is unclear, however, it is a known fact that Arrow Lake does not deliver many improvements; if any, over Raptor Lake when we consider raw performance.\n\nEfficiency, on the contrary, is another topic. Arrow Lake-HX should theoretically outperform Raptor Lake-HX if both chips operate within a strict 45W power limit. Still, we'll leave Intel to fill out the extra details at its CES keynote.",

A benchmark of an engineering sample was recently spotted running on an upcoming high-end 2-in-1 notebook from Asus.\n\nUsers are also eagerly awaiting the launch of AMD's Fire Range, the company's most powerful Zen 5 laptop processors. A recent Geekbench AI test suggests they will debut in Asus' 2025 ROG Strix G-series laptops.\n\nIn the desktop sector, AMD is also set to unveil new Ryzen 9000 X3D CPUs this month. TechSpot recently named last year's 9800X3D the best gaming CPU, and it has outpaced all of its non-X3D counterparts in sales at Mindfactory.\n\nThe new ECS Krackan Point laptop will be accompanied by a new Snapdragon X Plus notebook, a mini PC, and new Intel motherboards.",

            "content": "Chipmakers are gaining a lot of attention amid the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) wave. While Nvidia (NVDA) quickly captured the robust demand for advanced chips required in building AI models, other semiconductor companies are either gradually catching up or are comparatively lagging in innovation. Moreover, chipmakers are looking to capture demand in other attractive end markets like automotive. Bearing that in mind, we used TipRanks\u2019 Stock Comparison Tool to place Intel (INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) against each other to pick the chip stock with the highest upside potential, according to analysts.\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving strong buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nIntel shares plunged by more than 60% in 2024, marking the worst year for the company since it went public in 1971. The decline reflects investors\u2019 concerns over the lack of innovation, product delays, strategic missteps, and failed turnaround efforts under the leadership of Pat Gelsinger, who resigned in December 2024.\n\nMoreover, investors are disappointed that Intel has not been able to capitalize on the generative AI boom, unlike players like Nvidia. The company is trying to restore investor confidence by reducing costs, streamlining operations, strengthening its manufacturing and foundry capabilities, and enhancing its product offerings. However, the stock market seems to be skeptical due to Intel\u2019s poor track record when it comes to execution.\n\nIs Intel a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nLast Month, Citi analyst Christopher Danely reiterated a Hold rating on Intel stock with a price target of $22. The analyst is sidelined on the stock due to several factors, including worries related to the company\u2019s strategic direction and leadership, especially the ongoing search for a new CEO.\n\nDanely is also concerned about the company\u2019s foundry business and thinks that exiting this segment could improve Intel\u2019s financial performance and boost its stock\u2019s value.\n\nWall Street has a Hold consensus rating on TipRanks, backed by 21 Holds, five Sells, and one Buy recommendation. The average INTC stock price target of $24.53 implies 19.3% upside potential.\n\nSee more INTC analyst ratings\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices shares have declined 7.4% over the past year. The company has not been able to capture the opportunities in the AI chips market to the extent that rival Nvidia has done. Further, challenges in the company\u2019s gaming and embedded segments have been weighing on its overall performance.\n\nNevertheless, AMD remains confident about robust growth in the AI space in the times ahead. While the Q4 guidance lagged expectations, the company raised the estimate for the full-year sales from its AI-accelerators to more than $5 billion from $4.5 billion. Following a 122% rise in data center revenue in Q3, CEO Lisa Su said the company still sees a lot of demand from cloud providers and other companies to build AI infrastructure.\n\nIs AMD Stock a Buy or Sell?\n\nNorthland analyst Gus Richard reiterated a Buy rating on AMD stock and a price target of $175. The analyst said that AMD is one of the Top Picks of his firm for 2025. Richard expects AMD to continue to gain share in AI GPUs, server CPUs, and the PC market as pressures in the embedded and gaming segments fade. Notably, Richard expects the PC refresh cycle to be much stronger than expected. Richard sees more upside in 2025 than risks.\n\nOverall, AMD scores a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 23 Buys and eight Hold recommendations. The average AMD stock price target of $184.52 implies 47.2% upside potential.\n\nSee more AMD analyst ratings\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nQualcomm shares have advanced by about 15% over the past year. The company is a key chip supplier to smartphone makers. However, there are concerns about the impact on Qualcomm from the loss of business from Apple (AAPL) when the contract to supply modem chips for smartphones ends in 2026.\n\nNonetheless, Qualcomm is trying to bolster its business by diversifying into attractive areas like AI, IoT (Internet of Things), and automotive. The company is gaining traction in these key growth areas, with the automotive business delivering a 68% year-over-year revenue growth to $899 million in Q4 FY24.\n\nAnother favorable aspect is Qualcomm\u2019s recent win against Arm Holdings (ARM). The jury ruled that Qualcomm did not breach its licensing agreement with Arm following the acquisition of startup Nuvia in 2021. The ruling addressed some concerns about the company\u2019s expansion into the laptop market.\n\nIs Qualcomm a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nFollowing the favorable ruling in the Arm Holdings case, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh reiterated a Hold rating on Qualcomm stock with a price target of $150. Despite this favorable news, Vinh remains sidelined on QCOM stock due to macro challenges and company-specific risks like the possibility of displacement of QCOM modems with Apple\u2019s own internal modems and in-house \u201csilicon verticalization\u201d by mobile OEM (original equipment manufacturers) customers, implying that there is a threat that OEM clients could develop their own chips in the years ahead.\n\nVinh also noted intense rivalry in the mobile chipset market and maturing smartphone market growth.\n\nWith 11 Buys, 10 Holds, and one Sell recommendation, Qualcomm earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $199.88, the average QCOM stock price target implies 26.6% upside potential.\n\nSee more QCOM analyst ratings\n\nConclusion\n\nWall Street is optimistic on AMD and Qualcomm but sidelined on Intel due to the ongoing pressures. Currently, they see more upside potential in AMD stock than the other two chip stocks. Several analysts see the pullback in AMD stock as an opportunity to build a position and gain from the semiconductor giant\u2019s growth potential in areas like AI.\n\nDisclosure",

            "content": "AMD is pushing to corner more of the data center server market, with an eye on enterprises\n\nIt's pitching upgrades as a boon for efficiency and a way to make the most of pricey software licenses\n\nBut its focus on efficiency has the potential to push prospective customers into the arms of cloud providers, which offer cheap ARM-based silicon\n\nGPUs have been getting all the love lately \u2013 so much so that Dell\u2019Oro Group noted in December that hyperscale cloud companies were on track to deploy 5 million accelerators in their data centers in 2024. If you ask AMD though, there\u2019s something to be said for CPU upgrades as well.\n\nWe\u2019ve noted before that updated servers have the potential to save power in an energy-constrained data center environment. But Madhu Rangarajan, AMD\u2019s CVP for Epyc Products, pointed out that more modern chips can also help enterprises make the most of their software licenses as well.\n\nWait, what? That was our reaction, too. But here\u2019s how it works.\n\nSay you have 100 users and they have their jobs queued up on an old CPU. If you have a set number of licenses, it will take a certain amount of time for that CPU to get through all those jobs. But with a more modern chip doing the work faster, you can either serve those same 100 users twice as fast or serve double the number of users in the same amount of time with the same number of licenses.\n\nBasically, \u201cfewer or the same number of licenses go a much longer way,\u201d Rangarajan explained.\n\nAnd in a world that has largely moved from perpetual licenses to subscriptions, saving on licensing costs is a big deal.\n\nServer market smackdown\n\nOf course, AMD has a horse in this race. The company has long been chipping away at Intel\u2019s market share and Rangarajan outright stated that AMD\u2019s goal is to \u201cbe the CPU leader in the market.\u201d As of Q3 2024, Mercury Research data (as reported by PCWorld) indicated AMD held 33.9% market share for server revenue.\n\nRangarajan said AMD has already locked down some major clients like Meta and What\u2019sApp. Now, it\u2019s about scaling out to enterprises large and small \u2013 including the \u201clong tail\u201d of those with just 50-100 servers. \u201cWe want to get a lot more enterprises running on AMD,\u201d Rangarajan said.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch to AMD\u2019s big push around efficiency.\n\nAs AvidThink\u2019s Roy Chua explained, \u201cIf you push too hard on the efficiency argument, it could flip them from x86 architecture to an ARM architecture.\u201d The former is used by Intel and AMD, while the latter is used by cloud hyperscalers like AWS and others like Apple, which makes its own silicon.\n\nRelated AMD says creaky old servers are a big problem for AI\n\n\u201cEfficiency is a good argument against Intel\u201d for on-premises workloads that can\u2019t easily be moved to the cloud, Chua said. But for those that can, as well as for new developments, ARM-based silicon will likely end up being the most cost effective.\n\n(For what it\u2019s worth, during AWS Re:Invent last month, CEO Matt Garman said the company\u2019s Graviton processor is used by almost every customer and is still \u201cgrowing like crazy.\u201d Today, he said, \u201cthere\u2019s as much Graviton running in the AWS fleet as there was all compute in 2019.\u201d)\n\nChua acknowledged that switching workloads from x86-based chips to ARM-based ones takes work \u2013 mostly in the form of recompiling code. But he noted that process has gotten easier in recent years and is relatively easy for standardized business software.\n\nAnd if Apple was able to move a massive consumer ecosystem from x86 to ARM, then enterprises \u2013 which are playing in a much smaller ecosystem \u2013 can do the same.\n\nMeanwhile, in on-premises server land, Jack Gold said AMD faces a few other hurdles besides making the efficiency argument. For one thing, he noted that while both Intel and AMD use x86 architecture for their server chips, \u201cthey\u2019re not 100% compatible\u201d thanks to the incorporation of proprietary software. So, that alone \u2013 the possibility that a transition could spark issues \u2013 could be cause for hesitation.\n\nThere\u2019s one other differentiator that\u2019s a factor in the equation: customer service. Those eyeing a switch may question how well they\u2019ll be supported by AMD compared to Intel, which is a much larger company, Gold said.\n\nThe takeaway? AMD isn\u2019t wrong that efficiency is important, but there\u2019s plenty more to look at beyond just power and licensing costs. And some of those factors could work in Intel and cloud providers\u2019 favor.",

We are talking about the Zen 5-based Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU, which succeeds the Ryzen 7 7800X3D based on Zen 4. Since its launch, the processor has seen heavy demand despite a whopping $479 price tag. Even at that price, the processors seem to do extremely well in most retail stores worldwide.\n\nWhile we don't have the exact global sales figures for the 9800X3D, the numbers in Germany for one of the biggest retail stores are now out. Mindfactory shows that the Ryzen 7 9800X3D has now sold about 8650 units from this single retailer, which means the total sales of the processor are significantly higher when combining fixtures from all the offline and online German retailers.\n\nImage Source: Mindfactory\n\nTo understand how impressive this is, you can compare it against other CPUs like the Zen 5-based non-X3D Ryzen 9000 processors. A quick search reveals that the total sales of all the Ryzen 9000 CPUs combined couldn't reach the total sales figures of the 9800X3D. The AMD Ryzen 9700X came second with 2560 units, followed by the AMD Ryzen 5 9600X with 920 units, and then the Ryzen 9 9900X, and Ryzen 9 9950X with 820 and 790 units respectively.\n\nThe total combined sales of these processors came to about 5090 units, which is still short of 3560 units to become equal to the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. Surprisingly, the Ryzen 9000 non-X3D processors were launched a few months before the 9800X3D, which made the 9800X3D sales number even more terrific. While a bit early to say, it does have the potential to compete with the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, which sold about 78,450 units from Mindfactory alone.\n\nImage Source: Newegg\n\nThe Ryzen 7800X3D is going to turn two in April and has enjoyed popularity for quite a while now. AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D stands among the top 5 best-selling CPUs in most retail stores worldwide, including giants like Amazon and Newegg. On Amazon, AMD sold about 5000 units of 9800X3D on 24th December (just a single day). Even though it was occasional, it still stood in the top 5 best-selling CPUs on that day.\n\nDue to its high popularity, the CPU sometimes goes out of stock and retails for a higher price than MSRP. Meanwhile, the Ryzen 9000 processors can now be found for lower than their launch price but aren't as popular as the X3D counterpart.\n\nAMD is going to reveal more Ryzen 9000X3D chips at CES, namely the Ryzen 9 9900X3D and Ryzen 9 9950X3D. At the same time, it will release more hardware like RDNA 4 GPUs and budget 800-series chipset motherboards.\n\nNews Source: Mindfactory",

            "content": "CES doesn\u2019t just introduce the world to a new generation of consumer electronics, but new PC hardware as well. CES 2025 should be the opportunity for both Intel and AMD to launch new mobile processors for 2025 laptops, with possibly Qualcomm discussing new PC CPUs, too.\n\nIntel is a virtual lock to launch its Core H- and -HX series of Arrow Lake mobile processors for gaming laptops at January\u2019s CES show in Las Vegas, both from its own statements and LG\u2019s announcement of its new \u201cArrow Lake\u201d laptops.\n\nThe momentum has clearly swung to AMD, however, which has announced a launch date of January 6, 2025 for new PC and graphics products. Here, we\u2019re expecting AMD to announce both new desktop processors \u2014 including new iterations of its fantastic Ryzen 9000X3D gaming processors \u2014 but also \u201cStrix Halo\u201d chips with ultra-powerful integrated graphics aimed at the mobile gaming market. Could we even see additional CPUs for handhelds, too? It\u2019s likely.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s crystal ball is a bit murkier, but remember: Qualcomm has already announced its next-generation Oryon CPU cores for smartphones. Eventually, we expect them to debut inside of a PC processor, too.\n\nFurther reading: The next generation of PC graphics will kick off at CES 2025\n\nIntel\u2019s mobile Arrow Lake debuts\n\nAnyone who\u2019s followed the laptop market knows that Intel still commands a decided advantage over AMD in terms of the number of devices available, especially in gaming. This isn\u2019t likely to change within 2025. In fact, you can make the argument that Intel\u2019s decision to prioritize low power over high performance with its Arrow Lake desktop processors \u2014 which contributed to a steep drop in Intel desktop market share in 2024 \u2014 might be viewed more favorably in notebooks which can benefit from longer battery life. That argument makes more sense backing up a Core H-series part, which isn\u2019t as desperate for performance as a Core HX chip is.\n\nIntel\n\nRegardless, leaks have already suggested that these new Core Ultra (Arrow Lake) mobile chips will feature five new models, from the Core Ultra 5 225H on up to the Core Ultra 9 285H, with a total of 6 P-cores, 8 E-cores, and a pair of the new Low Power Efficiency cores, with no hyperthreading. The same leaker suggests that Intel\u2019s Core HX series could lead with a 24-core 285X flagship (8 P-cores, 16 E-cores, with no dedicated low-power efficiency cores) on down to the 235HX. It\u2019s also suggested that these new HX chips will use older Xe GPUs for integrated graphics, in part because they\u2019re traditionally paired with discrete GPUs.\n\nMoore\u2019s Law is Dead, which has an iffy reputation among leakers, has suggested (via Notebookcheck.net) that Arrow Lake will be 14 percent faster than the 13th-gen Raptor Lake architecture using the Cinebench benchmark, but with power consumption that is surprisingly about the same.\n\nLast year saw Intel\u2019s Core HX go up against the Core Ultra as a two-pronged approach to productivity and gaming performance. Expect Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake to do the same in 20525. Mark Hachman / IDG\n\nWhat does seem to be the case, however, is that Intel\u2019s Lunar Lake chips won\u2019t be going away. So 2025\u2019s notebook lineup will likely include productivity laptops that run on Intel\u2019s Lunar Lake, with the Arrow Lake architecture taking over on the gaming and performance front. Unfortunately, they\u2019ll all be using similar Core Ultra branding, so you\u2019ll need to pay attention.\n\nAMD\u2019s cavalcade of CPUs\n\nAs someone who touches more notebooks than desktops, AMD\u2019s Strix Halo definitely interests me. Whether intentionally or not, AMD has made an effort to keep up with its competition in the low-power notebook space, but still finds itself atop the heap in terms of performance. And there\u2019s definitely something to be said for that, as a number of customers simply prefer buying the fastest processor available for gaming and otherwise.\n\nOfficially, AMD\u2019s Strix Point should be named the Ryzen AI Max, complementing the low-power Ryzen AI 300 family with a Ryzen AI Max 395+ processor. A leaker (Golden Pig Upgrade Pack \u2014 where do these leakers come up with these names?) suggests via Tom\u2019s Hardware that we could see AMD announce three processors: the 16-core Ryzen AI Max+ 395, the 12-core Ryzen AI Max 390, and the 8-core Ryzen AI Max 385. Strix Halo is said to include a pair of Zen 5 CCDs with a LPDDR5X memory interface, too.\n\nIt\u2019s tie for AMD\u2019s Strix Point to give way to Strix Halo. MSI\n\nThe question, as Tom\u2019s suggests, will be whether AMD attaches a large GPU \u2014 the AI Max+ 395 is said to have an RDNA 3.5-based GPU with 2560 stream processors, which would massively outperform an ordinary Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 or \u201cStrix Point\u201d processor. The question is whether PC makers will also attach a discrete GPU, or simply let the APU\u2019s graphics horsepower carry the load. But that may come at a cost, with power climbing to 120W to 130W all by itself.\n\nThe limited launch of the single AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D also points to more to come on the desktop front. The 9800X3D chip obliterated the competition \u2014 but it was a single chip! That\u2019s led to suggestions that AMD has a 12-core Ryzen 9 9900X3D and a 16-core Ryzen 9 9950X3D chip waiting to be announced by AMD at CES, as a loose-lipped Asus executive indicated. If nothing else, that should help alleviate AMD\u2019s supply crunch, which has squeezed supplies of the chip since launch.\n\nCPUs are typically considered part of one of two categories: desktop, and mobile. But the mobile definition has expanded to include both laptops as well as handheld gaming PCs. In the latter category, as in consoles, AMD has dominated. But Intel is expected to make a push into the category with Lunar Lake at CES. AMD, meanwhile, is expected to respond with the Ryzen Z2, the sequel to the Ryzen Z1 and Z1 Extreme chip for handheld PCs.\n\nHandheld PCs are the nw battleground for mobile CPUs. PCWelt/Asus/Amazon\n\nAMD\u2019s Z1 and Z1 Extreme, launched in 2023, are based on the Zen 4 architecture; the Z1 included six primary cores and 12 threads, with 4 RDNA 3 graphics units. The Extreme variant increased the number of cores from six to eight, but tripled the RDNA 3 units to a total of twelve.\n\nDetails on the upcoming chips are a little skimpy, but we could see the Z2 Extreme, the \u201cvanilla\u201d Z2, and the Z2G or Z2 Go. The Extreme is said to boast eight CPU cores (3 Zen 5, 5 Zen5c) with 12 CUs based on the Strix Point and RDNA 3.5 GPU architecture. The \u201cvanilla\u201d Z2 could also use eight cores and 12 CUs, based on AMD\u2019s Hawk Point graphics, while the \u201cG\u201d variant could be built around the older Ryzen 6000 and an RDNA 2 GPU. Again, while the features are all speculation and rumor, it does seem likely that AMD has something up its sleeve for the handheld PC market at CES.\n\nCould we see more AM4 and AM5 boards and chipsets announced at CES? That\u2019s possible, too. Either way, AMD should have a lot to talk about in just a few days.\n\nA Qualcomm conundrum\n\nWhile both AMD and Qualcomm will host press events on Jan. 6, Qualcomm has its fingers in enough pies to avoid needing to make a PC announcement at CES. Instead, I\u2019m expecting to hear more information (and spin) about Arm\u2019s litigation against Qualcomm, which was largely settled over the holidays in favor of Qualcomm. I interpreted that to mean that little has changed, and that Qualcomm can continue to sell Snapdragon processors without issue. But I\u2019d expect a formal clarification on that from Qualcomm chief executive Cristiano Amon from a CES podium.\n\nQualcomm spent the fall showing off its Snapdragon 8 Elite platform, but for smartphones. Anyron Copeman / Foundry\n\nIn October, Qualcomm launched an updated, second-generation Oryon CPU core as part of its Snapdragon 8 Elite platform for handheld PCs. Snapdragon 8 Elite reportedly consumes 44 percent less power while offering 45 percent more multi-core performance versus the previous Snapdragon 8 core, Qualcomm says. Eventually, I\u2019d expect, it will be the foundation for the next Snapdragon X Elite platform.\n\nI don\u2019t think this happens at CES 2025, however. It\u2019s more likely this takes place at Computex this summer, when Qualcomm has typically launched processors for new computing platforms. In the meantime, Qualcomm has done an admirable job working with developers and solving compatibility problems with the Windows on Arm platform, and this type of announcement seems likely for CES. We could also see a wave of new laptops powered by Qualcomm\u2019s more affordable Snapdragon X Plus chips, which were announced earlier this fall.\n\nNevertheless, this looks to be the busiest CES in some time, especially because Nvidia and AMD are expected to launch new GPUs, too. The PCWorld team is headed to Las Vegas this weekend to cover all the news as it happens. The holidays are over; the chip wars are heating up once again.

            "content": "Thanks to Taiwanese manufacturer PowerColor, we now have our first glimpse at what the next-gen AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT might look like. These teased images of the future flagship card from AMD come just days before we expect to hear an official announcement from the chip maker at the CES 2025 trade show, with this particularly fiendish card expected to join PowerColor\u2019s red-themed Red Devil GPU series.\n\nThis new flagship RDNA 4 graphics card from AMD will be its best attempt to break through the dominance that Nvidia has held over the GPU market since producing the best graphics cards of recent years. There\u2019s potential to be excited, too, with recent rumors suggesting that it might offer ray tracing performance that matches the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080, despite speculation earlier this year that AMD was abandoning high-end Radeon GPUs completely.\n\nThe possible first glimpse at the RX 9070 XT came via a post on X (formerly Twitter) by PowerColor. In a cryptic post, the GPU maker shared a tease of its new graphics card with a look at the GPU\u2019s backplate design. According to a report by wcctech.com, their analysis suggests that this particular backplate doesn\u2019t match up to existing RX 7900 GPUs and is instead from an unreleased card.\n\nThe first image doesn\u2019t give too much away, but it does show what looks to be a metal backplate with PowerColor\u2019s Red Devil logo prominently displayed. Another X post, however, showed off a much clearer look at the new card, with three fans and a prominent red LED-lit, crystal-like structure on the end of the card.\n\nWhile there\u2019s admittedly nothing specific linking these images to the RX 9070 XT in PowerColor\u2019s posts, another X user suggested in response to this image that the \u201c9000 series [is] looking good\u201d and, in response, PowerColor teasingly replied \u201c9000 series eh?\u201d with an emoji.\n\nAs for when this card might become available, RX 9000 launch speculation from earlier this week suggests the timescale for these flagship GPUs hitting shop shelves will be around February. This will only be for the flagship AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT, though, with lower range cards arriving in March, according to leaked information.\n\nWhat we do know is that PowerColor\u2019s Red Devil branding has, so far, been used for mildly overclocked versions of AMD GPUs, but there will likely be no information about specs until AMD announces the GPU itself.\n\nOne way or another, AMD is expected to launch this new card next week at the CES 2025 trade show, which is when we\u2019ll get our first official look at the GPU itself. In the meantime, check out our AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT guide for all the recent rumors and leaks about this new flagship GPU so far.",

            "content": "It's time to round up the best CPUs on the market. After countless CPU reviews, benchmarks, retests, and revisits, we've put it all together into a single article to make your CPU shopping as straightforward as possible.\n\nWhether you're upgrading your PC or building a new one, choosing the right processor can be overwhelming, given the sheer number of options available. In this guide, we've done the heavy lifting for you by narrowing down the choices to the best options across five key categories that we believe effectively cover the market from top to bottom. Admittedly, there is no 5800X3D or 5700X3D pick here, which might draw some criticism upfront.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning, there are a lot of CPUs currently on sale, but you can ignore the vast majority of them as they simply don't make sense for one reason or another, or the use case is just too niche. For example, we're often asked if it's worth getting one of AMD's APU's, such as the Ryzen 7 8700G or 8600G, but for desktop users, especially those planning on using a discrete GPU, they don't make sense mostly because the CPU portion is so weak.\n\nFrom budget-friendly processors to core-heavy monsters, we'll help you find the ideal CPU for your specific needs, whether it's productivity, gaming, or both. Let's dive in.\n\nBest CPU, Entry-Level Platform Upgrade\n\nIntel Core i5-12400F In numbers $111 on Amazon Price: User Reviews: 9.4 Starting with the most affordable option, our recommendation for the best value entry-level CPU depends on whether you're upgrading your CPU, motherboard, and possibly memory, or building an entirely new PC. These scenarios have different budget considerations. If you're upgrading your platform, the most cost-effective option right now is the Intel Core i5-12400F. This is the CPU we recommend for those looking to spend as little as possible, which also means pairing it with DDR4 memory. In the past, we recommended the Core i3-12100F, which is currently priced at just $75. However, this quad-core model is starting to struggle in newer games. As a result, we advise spending a bit more on the 6-core 12400F, which can now be found for $110. The 12400F has been one of Intel's most popular processors in recent years because it is both highly affordable and sufficiently powerful. The main drawback is that you're investing in a dead platform with LGA1700, so it only makes sense if you stick with cheaper DDR4 memory. In total, you can get the 12400F, a DDR4 LGA1700 motherboard, and a 32GB kit of DDR4-3600 memory for around $250 \u2013 a hard-to-beat value. The only real alternative here is AMD's AM4 platform, which is arguably one of the best PC platforms ever created. However, the Ryzen 5 5600, which also costs $110, is slower than the Core i5, making the 12400F our clear recommendation. It's also important to note that there's no point in spending additional money on either Intel's LGA1700 or AMD's AM4 platforms, as they are effectively end-of-life. If your budget allows, you should focus on a current platform instead. Speaking of which, let's explore that next. Back to top \u25b5\n\nBest CPU for a New Gaming PC\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 7600 In numbers $184 on Amazon Price: User Reviews: 9.6 For those with a tighter budget who are building an entry-level PC they hope to keep for many years, we recommend spending a little extra on the CPU, motherboard, and memory by choosing the Ryzen 5 7600. The Ryzen 5 7600 is a significantly faster CPU than the Core i5-12400F, even though both are 6-core processors. In gaming performance, the 7600 is nearly 20% faster, and that advantage grows to almost 30% if the Core i5 is paired with DDR4 memory instead of high-speed DDR5. Of course, the Ryzen 5 processor costs more \u2013 about 80% more if you compare just the CPU prices, and 60% more when factoring in motherboard and memory costs. However, when building an entire budget PC, the total cost difference shrinks. A complete Core i5 system might cost around $730, while the Ryzen 5 system could come in at $890. This means the Ryzen 5 costs roughly 20% more, and in the worst-case scenario, it offers the same cost per frame while delivering far better overall performance with the AMD platform. Additionally, the Ryzen 5 7600 offers a platform that will age better, thanks in part to the increased bandwidth provided by DDR5 memory. This platform is almost certain to offer a solid upgrade path in the future. While DDR5 memory can also be paired with the Core i5-12400F, doing so undermines the value of that CPU, making it a less financially viable option. For those building a new PC or upgrading to a more modern platform, we recommend the Ryzen 5 7600 or its Chinese counterpart, the 7500F, available on AliExpress. If you are shopping on AliExpress, keep in mind that not only are Ryzen CPUs often cheaper, but the Core i5-12400F is currently available for as little as $80. Back to top \u25b5\n\nBest Value Mid-Range CPU\n\nBest Gaming CPU\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D In numbers $547 on Amazon Price: User Reviews: 9.4 There's no room for debate here: the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is hands down the best gaming CPU money can buy right now. The only issue with this CPU is its availability. At $480, it's not ridiculously expensive considering it's the very best, but demand from gamers is extremely high. As a result, weeks after its release and it remains incredibly difficult to find. The next best thing is the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, but that too is mostly out of stock and not worth paying a premium for. The best course of action is to be patient and wait for the 9800X3D to become more readily available. This reflects the current state of the PC hardware market: most products you don't want to buy because they're underwhelming, and the few great ones are nearly impossible to get. Perhaps the industry should focus on making fewer disappointing products \u2013 but surely it's not that simple. Anyway, the 9800X3D is incredibly popular because it is undeniably the best of the best, and gamers naturally gravitate toward the top-performing hardware. That said, while the 9800X3D is excellent, not everyone needs it. For many gamers, the Ryzen 7 7700 will perform just as well and offer significantly better value. This is primarily because, in most cases, gaming performance is limited by the GPU rather than the CPU. With a modern and powerful processor like the Ryzen 7 7700, your frame rate will almost always be constrained by the GPU long before the CPU becomes a bottleneck. Of course, there are exceptions \u2013 competitive shooters, strategy games, city builders, and turn-based games can sometimes be more CPU-intensive. However, for the vast majority of gamers, the GPU will remain the limiting factor. Keep this in mind when deciding whether the 9800X3D is truly necessary for your setup.

According to the press release, the processor in this laptop called the ECS UP42KP, will feature eight Zen 5(c) CPU cores, RDNA 3.5 integrated graphics, and an NPU that delivers more than 40 TOPS of performance. The Krackan Point chips are AMD\u2019s budget alternatives to the Strix Point processors it launched in mid-2024, and we expect laptops with these CPUs to start at $799 and have Copilot+ branding.\n\nECS said the UP42KP will have features including a TDP range of 15 to 45 watts, support for DDR5-5600 RAM, Wi-Fi 6, and USB 4.0. It will also have an IR camera compatible with Windows Hello, a privacy shutter, a backlit keyboard, and HDMI 2.1. All this is packed in a sleek metal chassis that\u2019s just 16.9mm thick and has a 14-inch Full HD screen.\n\nUnfortunately, ECS hasn\u2019t released pricing for this new laptop model, especially since it\u2019s primarily an OEM instead of a laptop retailer. That means we will probably see the ECS UP42KP on store shelves under a different brand name. Furthermore, the brands that eventually carry the UP42KP in their lineup could tweak the specifications to change its features and pricing. Nevertheless, since ECS is targeting this model for the mainstream mid-range market, we expect it to be priced somewhere between $700 and $1,000.\n\nECS is releasing Snapdragon X-powered laptops, too\n\nIn addition to the AMD Krackan-powered UP42KP, ECS will launch the UP42PW and UP52PW, a 14-inch and 15.3-inch laptop with a Snapdragon X Plus processor. Although the company didn\u2019t mention which model these laptops featured, ECS said they could hit a maximum turbo frequency of 3.4 GHz. That means they\u2019re likely powered by the base Snapdragon X Plus X1P-41-100, which has a 3.2 GHz Oryon 8-core CPU that can reach a maximum single-core boost of up to 3.4 GHz.\n\nThese laptops will have an NPU that could hit 45 TOPS, high-speed LPDDR5 memory, and enough battery life to last up to 12 hours. ECS also says these devices will have USB 4.0 and support Microsoft\u2019s Copilot+ PC functionality. Again, the company did not release pricing as they will likely be sold under different brands. Nevertheless, these could be part of the more affordable Snapdragon X PCs that the Qualcomm CEO said will come out in early 2025.",

ECS' new UP42KP and UP52PW laptops that it'll be showing at ECS.\n\nCES is next week and you can bet that there will be a bevy of beautiful hardware announcements, including many luxurious laptops sporting the latest processor designs. Apparently, Taiwanese ODM Elitegroup (better known to the DIY crowd as \"ECS\") couldn't wait though, and showed its hand early. In the company's communications were a trio of laptops, but the interesting part is that one of them is apparently based on an as-yet unreleased AMD processor.Kraken Point, or \"Krackan\" as ECS writes it, is the SoC underpinning the ECS UP42KP, a 14-inch thin & light laptop design that seems to share its chassis with the UP42PW. That laptop is powered by eight-core Snapdragon X Plus SoCs, and that allows us to make certain assumptions about Kraken Point.Only, we don't really have to because ECS lays out many of the specifications for the new chips right in its press release. According to ECS, \"Krackan\" is a \"cutting-edge\" AMD platform that supports up to eight Zen 5 CPU cores, RDNA 3.5 integrated graphics , and a powerful NPU with up to 40 TOPS of AI compute\u2014rather similar to the NPUs in Snapdragon X Elite, Intel's Lunar Lake, and AMD's own Strix Point.Of course, the reason the NPUs are so similar is because of Microsoft's requirements to refer to a machine as \"Copilot+\". We know a bit more about Kraken Point from leaks, though; assuming they're accurate, the RDNA 3.5 GPU has four WGPs, making it approximately the same width as the GPU in the Steam Deck (albeit considerably faster thanks to architectural advancements.)One key detail of ECS' press release that conflicts with previous information is that the company describes the CPU configuration of \"Krackan\" as \"8 Zen 5(c) CPU cores\". It's not completely clear if the company is claiming that the chips have eight Zen 5c compact cores, or if the parenthetical \"(c)\" is meant to indicate that some of the cores are the dense configuration.Earlier rumors described Kraken Point as a processor with a hybrid configuration consisting of four standard Zen 5 cores alongside four Zen5c cores. That would make it rather like a smaller version of the larger, twelve-core Strix Point chips launched last year that comprise the Ryzen AI 300 family. If it does indeed use eight Zen 5c cores instead, it might be quite a compact and power-sipping processor altogether.",

This condition gradually impairs vision, making objects appear distorted or unclear. Up to 30 percent of individuals with dry AMD may develop its more severe form, wet AMD, within 10 years. Despite its widespread impact, treatment options for dry AMD have been limited to two FDA-approved injectable drugs. While moderately effective, these injections carry risks, including potential complications from the procedure, and can be burdensome for patients.\n\nA research team, headed by Dr Moon-Hyeong Seo from the Natural Product Drug Development Center at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), has developed a therapeutic agent for dry AMD. This innovative treatment, designed to be administered as eye drops, directly tackles the challenges associated with injection-based therapies, including patient discomfort, potential medical complications, and difficulties with long-term adherence.\n\nDr Seo\u2019s team has focused on the inflammatory signalling pathway of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), critical in the pathogenesis of AMD. By constructing an extensive library of over 190,000 peptide drug candidates with structures similar to natural TLR signalling proteins, they utilised advanced screening technology to identify peptides capable of inhibiting harmful protein interactions.\n\nThe efficacy of these peptides was validated in animal models, where mice with induced dry AMD received the peptide-based eye drops. Treated mice demonstrated retinal cell protection and reduced retinal degeneration, with results comparable to healthy control groups. This marks a significant milestone, indicating that non-invasive eye drops can offer comparable benefits to existing injectable therapies for dry AMD.\n\nThe introduction of this novel eye drop formulation brings numerous advantages. It enhances patient convenience by eliminating the need for repetitive invasive procedures and reducing associated risks. The non-invasive nature of the treatment also lowers costs, making it a more accessible and safer alternative for AMD patients. \u201cWe plan to pursue collaborative research with domestic and international pharmaceutical companies to advance global clinical trials for this innovative dry AMD therapeutic,\u201d explained Dr Seo.\n\nKIST, founded in 1966, continues to spearhead cutting-edge research addressing national and global challenges. This breakthrough has been supported by the Ministry of Science and ICT through KIST\u2019s major project initiatives and the Excellent Young Researcher Program.\n\nThis study was published in Advanced Science.",

            "content": "It\u2019s no secret that Ryzen 7 9800X3D has proven a critical and sales darling for AMD, with the processor still proving difficult to find at MSRP due to demand. This is in stark contrast to other chips in the company\u2019s Ryzen 9000 Series, both in terms of reception and revenue. While the state of affairs are plain to see on the surface, diving into one retailer\u2019s figures shows just how massive the gap is between the Zen 5 X3D CPU and its standard siblings.\n\nGerman retailer Mindfactory publicly displays approximate sales figures for all the products it offers, and is now finally sharing the number of Ryzen 7 9800X3D processors it\u2019s shifted since launch. It claims to have sold over 8,650 of the chips, not only making it the best-selling current-generation AMD CPU but placing it well ahead of all other Ryzen 9000 models combined.\n\nCPU Units sold Relative sales performance Ryzen 7 9800X3D 8,650+ 100.00% Ryzen 7 9700X 2,530+ 29.24% Ryzen 5 9600X 900+ 10.40% Ryzen 9 9900X 810+ 9.37% Ryzen 9 9950X 780+ 9.01%\n\nNone of the other Zen 5 processors even come close to matching Ryzen 7 9800X3D, with all but Ryzen 7 9700X falling short of four-figure sales. However, the latter\u2019s reported units sold of 2,530~ is still well short by a factor of 3.4x relative to the former. While I don\u2019t expect Ryzen 9 9000X3D models to trump Ryzen 9 9900X and 9950X to the same extent, I\u2019ve little doubt that they\u2019ll fare better.\n\nTurning attentions to the Ryzen 7000 Series, there\u2019s still a ways to go before the current 3D V-Cache champion catches up to its predecessor. At the time of writing, Ryzen 7 7800X3D has sold a whopping 78,420 units since June 2023. With time, Ryzen 7 9800X3D should be able to close the gap if not exceed its forebear.\n\nAt the very least, both Ryzen 7 9800X3D and other Ryzen 9000 processors are selling markedly better than Core Ultra 200 Series. Intel\u2019s flagship Core Ultra 9 285K boasts just 70~ units sold, with Core Ultra 7 265K leading the charge with a slightly better turnout of 100~ sales.\n\nExcellent as Ryzen 7 9800X3D is on its own terms, it\u2019s clear that it partly owes its success to the slate of middling processor releases on top of the fervent hunger from gamers eager to push frame rates ever-higher through 3D V-Cache. I\u2019ve little doubt it\u2019ll remain the darling choice for many for the foreseeable future, particularly given the rumoured extended wait time for Zen 6 successors.\n\nAll the same, I\u2019m excited to see what AMD has its up its sleeves at CES 2025 on the Ryzen and Radeon fronts come January 6, 7PM (GMT).

            "content": "The share price of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) \u2014 commonly referred to as AMD \u2014 has declined 11% over the past year. This is clearly disappointing for investors who were looking to cash in on the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. It\u2019s also a stark contrast to fellow chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), which has seen a 180% rise in its share price over the last 12 months. However, I believe the current dip may represent an opportunity for investors as AMD\u2019s price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio drops below one and the company\u2019s impressive transition continues. In this article, I\u2019ll explain why I\u2019m bullish on AMD stock.\n\nDon't Miss Our New Year's Offers:\n\nDiscover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks\n\nMake smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter\n\nAMD\u2019s Turnaround\n\nThe main reason I\u2019m bullish on AMD is the company\u2019s impressive transformation and trajectory. In 2015, the company was struggling with $4 billion in revenue and a $500 million operating loss. Fast forward to today, and AMD\u2019s data center revenue for just one quarter has reached $3.5 billion, with consolidated net income of $771 million.\n\nUnder CEO Lisa Su, the company has excelled through a combination of strategic innovation, management excellence, and partnerships with industry giants such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (META).\n\nIn recent years, the prevailing narrative has positioned AMD as something of a loser as Nvidia dominates the AI and data center markets. However, its financial performance, growth forecast, and technological advancements have positioned the company as an exciting investment prospect. And with AI and data center markets expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 29% through 2030, AMD\u2019s focus on these segments positions it as a serious competitor to Nvidia, not a loser.\n\nAMD\u2019s Bright Future\n\nLet\u2019s next take a closer look at AMD\u2019s recent performance and its positioning within the AI landscape. In the last quarter, AMD\u2019s data center segment surged, with year-over-year growth of 122% and quarter-over-quarter growth of 25%. This impressive feat more than compensated for declines in other segment areas.\n\nAMD\u2019s market share in the AI accelerator market, while still modest, is estimated to be between 5% and 7% as of 2024. While this highlights Nvidia\u2019s dominance in the sector, it also represents a significant opportunity for growth, with analysts projecting that if AMD can increase its market share to 10% by the end of 2026, it could generate an additional $5 billion in sales. Beyond AI, AMD is steadily gaining ground in other markets. Its market share in the server CPU segment has climbed to 24.2%, a testament to its ability to compete with Intel (INTC) in a market once considered impenetrable.\n\nThis bullish outlook is supported by AMD\u2019s technological developments and partnerships. The Ryzen AI PRO processors and data center CPUs and GPUs are tailored to meet the growing demands of AI and cloud workloads. The company is also a key supplier for AI applications like ChatGPT, further underscoring its credibility in the field. Moreover, while Nvidia\u2019s margins remain the envy of the sector \u2014 with 75% gross margins \u2014 AMD\u2019s gross margin rose 300 basis points in the last quarter to 54%. The current guidance suggests that this will be maintained going forward.\n\nCompelling Valuation\n\nAnother reason for my bullishness on AMD stock is the valuation. AMD\u2019s valuation is particularly attractive when considering its growth-adjusted metrics, particularly the PEG ratio. The company\u2019s forward PEG ratio of 0.87 is significantly lower than the sector median of 1.82, indicating that AMD\u2019s stock is undervalued relative to its expected earnings growth. This PEG figure represents a 52.1% discount compared to the sector, suggesting strong growth potential at a reasonable price.\n\nMoreover, analysts project AMD\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio will decrease significantly in the coming years, from 36.3 times in 2024 to 13.3 times in 2027, reinforcing current growth expectations. This declining P/E trend, combined with the company\u2019s low PEG ratio, presents a compelling valuation case for long-term investors.\n\nIs AMD Stock a Buy?\n\nOn TipRanks, AMD has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 23 Buys, eight Holds, and zero Sell recommendations assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average AMD stock price target is $184.52, implying 52.4% upside potential.\n\nRead more analyst ratings of AMD stock\n\nConclusion\n\nI\u2019m bullish on AMD stock because of the company\u2019s growth forecast and earnings outlook. AMD\u2019s attractive valuation metrics, particularly its low PEG ratio and declining forward P/E, suggest the stock may be undervalued relative to its growth prospects. With a strong analyst consensus and substantial upside potential, AMD presents a compelling investment opportunity in the evolving microchip sector.\n\nThis bullishness is driven by the company\u2019s impressive growth and transformation under Lisa Su\u2019s leadership, rising from financial struggles to become a major player in the data center and AI markets. With the data center and AI markets expected to grow at breakneck speed, AMD\u2019s market position appears shrewd despite Nvidia\u2019s current dominance.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

This configuration is a solid third behind 32GB and 16GB RAM systems, both of which saw declines.\n\nAnother remarkable trend in the new December data deluge was a significant jump in Windows 11 adoption, almost wholly at the expense of Windows 10. Graphics card VRAM trends were also interesting, with a notable migration away from 6GB GPUs.\n\nImage 1 of 4 (Image credit: Valve / Steam) (Image credit: Valve / Steam) (Image credit: Valve / Steam) (Image credit: Valve / Steam)\n\nAMD CPU gains\n\nAMD is finally gaining momentum, winning Steam gamers' hearts and minds in this latest survey. After steady but small gains since the middle of 2024, December saw a chunky 4.96% increase in AMD CPU user share.\n\nWe've seen signs of this movement in retail charts and the buzz for AMD's latest Zen 5 processors, especially those with 3D V-Cache. The CPUs are also backed by a good selection of AM5 motherboards, widely expected to enjoy enviable longevity.\n\nSo, perhaps it isn't surprising to see AMD gain nearly 5%, but the Intel/AMD ratio is still so strong in the former's favor at 63.43/38.73. The figure is likely skewed by Intel's strength in pre-built and laptop systems.\n\nPC RAM \u2013 64GB in strong gains\n\nThe PC system RAM chart shows that 64GB configurations were up 0.59% last month. This is the biggest gain in the RAM table, meaning that 3.94% of Steam gamers\u2014or those surveyed\u2014now use 64 GB RAM systems.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, 32GB RAM systems were down, but only by 0.09%, to 32.08%. The most popular RAM quota, 16GB, was equipped by 45.07% of users, down 0.86% from last month.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

With a massive 6.16% uplift in December, Windows 11 jumped above the halfway mark to grab 54.96% of Steam users. Meanwhile, Windows 10 dropped 5.07% to 42.39% of Steam gamers.\n\nSomehow, Windows 7 users are still charting despite Steam support for this aged OS dropping in January last year. However, the number almost halved, with Windows 7 users now at 0.15\u2014down 0.13%.\n\nVRAM \u2013 users migrate from 6GB GPUs\n\nLastly, 70% of Steam gamers still use a GPU with 8GB or less VRAM. Though the biggest gainer in December was 16GB GPUs, up 0.88%, and the most significant drop was seen with 6GB GPUs, down 2.42%, more than two-thirds of people are edging into VRAM poverty as far as modern AAA gaming is concerned.\n\nThere's been an upswell in voices complaining about mid-range GPUs packing 8GB of VRAM. Intel decided that 8GB wasn't enough, even with its first Battlemage graphics card with 12GB VRAM at a $250 MSRP. Nevertheless, enthusiasts are worried AMD and Nvidia won't raise the VRAM stakes for their most popular 060 cards in 2025.",

The only problem is how erratic these deals have become because as soon as you get around to whipping your smartphone, grabbing your tablet, or powering on your computer, the deal expires, which is why it is imperative that you do not waste a moment on becoming the proud owner of one of these processors.\n\nIdeally, it makes sense to get the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, but there are times when we have seen this component available for $459 on Amazon. In short, we will recommend customers who want to save a few bucks to a hold of the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, since the additional savings will allow you to invest in other components, such as a motherboard, or graphics card. We will also reiterate to refresh the listing pages so you get updated on the latest prices.\n\nWe have noticed that some readers have become livid over the sudden change in the figure, leaving them to conclude that this was nothing more than a scam to bait unsuspecting buyers. Fortunately, it is anything but that, as we keep a close watch on these parts, but since there is limited quantity to go around, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D and Ryzen 7 9800X3D immediately go out of stock.

AMD plans to focus on the mainstream, where it can gain mass consumer share easier and thus incentivize developers to optimize for its GPUs. While AMD has done remarkably well with its gaming CPUs , its GPUs still fall behind NVIDIA's offerings.The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 should be a powerhouse GPU, with 32GB of VRAM and significant performance. This holds true for not only gaming, but 3D content, productivity, and machine learning. NVIDIA is also likely to furnish it with the latest in AI technology, such as neural rendering and more refined DLSS. Ray tracing performance is also likely to increase, with improved RT cores for its GeForce RTX 50 Series products.Ray and path tracing are an area where NVIDIA has been ahead of AMD, with performance a notch above its competitor. This is especially important for AMD, which also has a strong foothold in the console market where such technology is increasing in popularity. Sony's PlayStation 5 Pro, for example, uses AMD hardware and touts ray tracing as one of its perks. The AMD RX Radeon 9070 XT will likely be the one AMD leads with first, and we hope it can achieve a good price-to-performance for gamers.With CES 2025 rapidly approaching, we will soon know the release dates and full specifications of the next generation of GPUs, and if they match the latest rumor of a February-March release for AMD . If NVIDIA makes it to market sooner than AMD may not matter in the long run, especially if the first-released NVIDIA GPUs cater to the higher-end market first.",

            "content": "AMD could be set to make available its mid-range AMD RX 9000 graphics cards as early as March, according to a new rumor. Historically, gaming GPU manufacturers have tended to launch flagship high-end cards for each new generation first, before launching new mid-range cards several months later, so this quick turnaround from AMD would make for a change from the norm.\n\nPart of the reason for this could be that AMD has long been expected not to compete with Nvidia at the high-end of the market, with the RX 9070 XT expected to be the company\u2019s flagship next-gen card with specs fast enough to only compete with the RTX 5070 rather than the RTX 5090. That means AMD will be highly reliant on grabbing as much of the mid-range GPU market as possible, so the sooner it can launch its more affordable cards, the higher its chances of enticing buyers.\n\nThe new rumor comes from Chinese site boardchannel.cn \u2013 via videocardz.com \u2013 with forum user Expert No.1 posting about the upcoming launch. Initially they talk about the release of RX 9070 models, suggesting AMD-branded boards will arrive as soon as January but that add-in board (AIB) partner cards might not ship until February. However, they then go on to say that \u201cOther models are estimated to be launched in March, that is, mainstream models will be released before March.\u201d\n\nThe apparent confirmation of some availability of RX 9070 XT models in January is good to see, and ensures AMD should have some products available to compete with the RTX 5070 launch that\u2019s also expected to see products available in January. However, its the rapid arrival of mid-range cards that\u2019s particularly notable.\n\nThe overall AMD RX 9000 launch is expected to consist of graphics cards made up from two main gaming GPUs, the AMD Navi 44 and AMD Navi 48. The latter is believed to power the RX 9070 series while cut-down versions of that GPU could arrive as RX 5060 cards. Meanwhile, the Navi 44 is a smaller overall GPU design that is believed to be set to power even lower-end, sub-$300 cards such as a possible RX 5050.\n\nIf these cards do arrive quickly, we could suddenly find the graphics card market having completely flipped on its head. After years of surprisingly uncompetitively-priced and poor-performing low to mid-range GPUs, we could be set to have some very capable cards for reasonable prices. We\u2019ve already seen Intel shake things up with its Intel B580, with that card proving to provide solid performance for well under $300, and we fully expect AMD and Nvidia not to let Intel have it easy.\n\nWe should find out more about AMD and Nvidia\u2019s next-gen gaming GPU plans next week, with both companies expected to be officially unveiling their new card ranges at the CES 2025 trade show in Las Vegas, from which we\u2019ll be reporting, with new posts arriving in our CES news hub.\n\nWhile we wait for those official unveilings, you can read more about what we\u2019ve learned so far about the upcoming launches by checking out our guides to Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5090, RTX 5080, and RTX 5070 along with AMD\u2019s RX 9070 XT. The information in those guides and in this article is still based on rumors and leaks but the picture is getting ever clearer as we get closer to those official launches.",

AMD Zen 5 on Linux easily dominated the list of most popular articles for the year along with ZLUDA and several of the Intel Arrow Lake and Granite Rapids articles plus the Framework 16 laptop.It was an interesting year and when looking at the list of 20 most popular reviews for 2024, a number of AMD Zen 5 reviews topped the list for the Ryzen 9000 series, Ryzen AI 300 series, and also the EPYC 9005 \"Turin\" server processors. Plus various Windows vs. Linux comparisons, benchmarks against the Apple M4, and other interesting benchmarking battles. AMD Zen 5 has been performing great and of mighty interest to Linux readers.\n\nBefore getting to that top 20 list for 2024, as a friendly reminder, please make it a New Year resolution to disable ad-block for this site if you currently engage any ad blocking when browsing this site. Operations for web publishers remain difficult given the sad state of the industry overall and many organizations just advertising on the likes of YouTube and Facebook.

The tooling has improved such as with HIPIFY to help in auto-generating but it isn't any simple, instant, and guaranteed solution -- especially if striving for optimal performance. Over the past two years AMD has quietly been funding an effort though to bring binary compatibility so that many NVIDIA CUDA applications could run atop the AMD ROCm stack at the library level -- a drop-in replacement without the need to adapt source code. In practice for many real-world workloads, it's a solution for end-users to run CUDA-enabled software without any developer intervention. Here is more information on this \"skunkworks\" project that is now available as open-source along with some of my own testing and performance benchmarks of this CUDA implementation built for Radeon GPUs.Last Wednesday was the review embargo for the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X Zen 5 desktop processors that proved to be very exciting for Linux workloads from developers to creators to AVX-512 embracing AI and HPC workloads. Today the review embargo lifts on the Ryzen 9 9900X and Ryzen 9 9950X and as expected given the prior 6-core/8-core tests: these new chips are wild! The Ryzen 9 9900X and Ryzen 9 9950X are fabulous processors for those engaging in heavy real-world Linux workloads with excellent performance uplift and stunning power efficiency.This could quite well be my simplest review in the past twenty years of Phoronix. The AMD Ryzen 9000 series starting with the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X launching tomorrow are some truly great desktop processors. The generational uplift is very compelling, even in single-threaded Linux workloads shooting ahead of Intel's 14th Gen Core competition, across nearly 400 benchmarks these new Zen 5 desktop CPUs impress, and these new Zen 5 desktop processors are priced competitively. I was already loving the Ryzen 7000 series performance on Linux with its AVX-512 implementation and performing so well across hundreds of different Linux workloads but now with the AMD Ryzen 9000 series, AMD is hitting it out of the ball park. That paired with the issues Intel is currently experiencing for the Intel Core 13th/14th Gen CPUs and the ~400 benchmark results makes this a home run for AMD on the desktop side with only some minor Linux caveats.After reviewing the Ryzen 7 8700G and the Ryzen 5 8600G as these new Zen 4 processors with RDNA3 integrated graphics, the latest AMD 8000G series CPU in the Linux benchmarking lab at Phoronix is the Ryzen 5 8500G. The Ryzen 5 8500G is a 6-core / 12-thread processor with RDNA3 graphics that retails for just $179 USD. Here's a look at how it's performing against other AMD and Intel processors on Ubuntu Linux. The Ryzen 5 8500G ends up being decent on the GPU side but making me genuinely excited is the Zen 4C prospects in the low-power space for AI workloads at the edge, low power servers, and other different deployments for great low-power performance. Under load this AVX-512 wielding budget desktop processor was typically pulling 50 Watts or less!With all of my AMD Ryzen 9900X and 9950X Linux benchmarking and Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X reviews as well, many have wondered if AMD Zen 5 is just really great on Linux, if Windows 11 is in particularly poor shape for these new AMD Ryzen 9000 series processors, if it's just the different/diverse benchmarks being run, or simply why are these new desktop CPUs running so well on Linux but less so with Windows?Earlier this month Intel announced the Core Ultra 200S \"Arrow Lake\" processors and today they go on sale. In turn, the review embargo also lifts for these new desktop processors. Up first today on Phoronix is the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K Linux performance review for this flagship 24-core desktop processor.The review embargo has now expired on the Framework Laptop 16, the latest innovative and upgradeable laptop from this company that has made quite a name for itself with modular and user-upgradeable laptop designs for both AMD and Intel. The new Framework Laptop 16 offers even more customizability around the keyboard/touchpad and other options including over using a Radeon RX 7700S graphics module and more. Besides the immense customizability options and upgrades available with the Framework Laptop 16, the new model employs the AMD Ryzen 7040HS processor for even greater performance over the AMD Ryzen 7040U found with the latest Framework 13 model.Last month Intel introduced their Xeon 6 \"Granite Rapids\" processors with up to 128 P cores, MRDIMM support, and other improvements as a big step-up in performance and power efficiency for their server processors. The Xeon 6900P series showed they could tango with the AMD EPYC 9004 Genoa/Bergamo processors in a number of areas, but Genoa has been around since November 2022... With today's AMD 5th Gen EPYC \"Turin\" launch, Zen 5 is coming to servers and delivers stunning performance and power efficiency. The new top-end AMD EPYC Turin processor performance can obliterate the competition in most workloads and delivers a great generational leap in performance and power efficiency. Here are our first 5th Gen AMD EPYC Turin benchmarks in looking at the EPYC 9575F, EPYC 9755, and EPYC 9965 processors across many workloads and testing in both single and dual socket configurations.As part of my ongoing AMD Ryzen 9 9950X Linux testing, last week I provided a look at the AVX-512 benefits to Zen 5 and also the Windows vs. Linux performance for the Ryzen 9 9950X. For sharing today is a look at multiple Linux distributions up and running on the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X (Zen 5) desktop. Among the distributions in the mix are Intel's Clear Linux distribution that is optimally tuned for maximum x86_64 Linux performance and once again even on AMD hardware shows the significant benefits to a well-tuned Linux software stack.Apple last week released their latest iMac, Mac Mini, and MacBook Pro products powered by their fourth-generation M-series Apple Silicon. The new Mac Mini in particular is interesting for under $600 starting out with the all re-designed Mac Mini with 10-core M4 and now the base model having 16GB of memory. It will take some time before there is any reasonable Linux support on the M4 hardware with Asahi Linux, but for those curious about how the M4 Mac Mini with macOS compares to AMD Ryzen and Intel Core CPUs under Linux, here are some preliminary benchmarks.With the AMD Zen 5 generation, the timing is interesting where it's not the desktop processors launching first but happens to be in the form of AMD Ryzen AI 300 series laptops. With the last minute delay of the Ryzen 900 series by 1~2 weeks, the embargo lift for the Ryzen AI 300 series is timed for this Sunday morning where I can now present the first AMD Zen 5 Linux benchmark results. And with being the first Zen 5 chip in my lab, I have been pushing it hard... Here is an extensive look at the ASUS Zenbook S 16 I received with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 current flagship SoC compared to a variety of other AMD and Intel laptop models. The focus was on both the raw performance and the package performance-per-Watt for the overall power efficiency of this Zen 5 SoC. And with it being the first Zen 5 hardware in the lab, I didn't limit the selection to just conventional laptop workloads but also explored the performance characteristics for various other workloads of interest to diverse Linux users and for an idea of the HX 370 potential or similar Zen 5 chips appearing in thin client / edge / IoT type devices. This initial taste of AMD Zen 5 has me extremely excited about the performance potential of the upcoming Ryzen 9000 series and EPYC Turin processors.After last week looking at how FreeBSD 14.1 has improved performance over FreeBSD 14.0, here is an expanded cross-OS comparison now looking at how the new FreeBSD 14.1 stable release compares to the recently released NetBSD 10.0, the current DragonFlyBSD 6.4 release, and then CentOS Stream 9 and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS for some Linux comparison data points.Today the review embargo lifts on the new AMD Ryzen 7 8700G and Ryzen 5 8600G desktop APUs. Announced back during CES, the Ryzen 8000G series pairs Zen 4 CPU cores with RDNA3 graphics and now also boasting Ryzen AI support too. Today's launch article is focusing on the AMD Ryzen 7 8700G Linux performance.Ahead of tomorrow's availability of the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor as the first Zen 5 CPU released with 3D V-Cache, today the review embargo lifts. Here is a look at how this 8-core / 16-thread Zen 5 CPU with 64MB of 3D V-Cache is performing under Ubuntu Linux compared to a variety of other Intel Core and AMD Ryzen desktop processors.With the Framework 16 laptop one of the performance pieces I've been meaning to carry out has been seeing out Linux performs against Microsoft Windows 11 for this AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS powered modular/upgradeable laptop. Recently getting around to it in my benchmarking queue, I also compared the performance of Ubuntu 23.10 to the near final Ubuntu 24.04 LTS on this laptop up against a fully-updated Microsoft Windows 11 installation.Here's a fresh look at the AMD Radeon versus NVIDIA GeForce Linux graphics/gaming performance across a variety of workloads as well as our first look at the GeForce RTX 4070 series and RTX 4080 SUPER performance. With recently receiving the rest of the GeForce RTX 40 series line-up currently released, we're now able to share a comprehensive look at how the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series versus AMD Radeon RX 7000 series performance is under Linux.A number of Phoronix readers have been requesting a fresh re-test of the experimental Bcachefs file-system against other Linux file-systems on the newest kernel code. Your wish has been granted today with a fresh round of benchmarking across Bcachefs, Btrfs, EXT4, F2FS, and XFS using the Linux 6.11-rc2 kernel. This round of testing was carried out on the newly-released Solidigm D7-PS1010 PCIe 5.0 NVMe SSDs that offer very speedy performance for modern Linux desktops and servers.With the Intel Xeon 6900P \"Granite Rapids\" launch today the review embargo has now expired. I began with my Intel Granite Rapids Linux benchmarking a few days ago and have initial benchmarks to share for the flagship Xeon 6980P processors paired with MRDIMM 8800MT/s memory. This is just the beginning of a lot of Granite Rapids benchmarks to come on Phoronix. Compared to the existing AMD EPYC competition and prior generation Intel Xeon processors, the Xeon 6900P series performance surpassed my expectations and has debuted as an incredibly strong performer. In some areas of HPC and other workloads, Intel is able to regain leadership performance with Granite Rapids paired with MRDIMMs. In AI workloads where the software is optimized for AMX, the new Xeon 6900P CPUs can showcase staggering leads.Over the past several years we have seen AMD Ryzen processors being used for low-cost servers, budget web hosting platforms, game servers, and more. Since the Ryzen 5000 series we have seen the likes of ASRock Rack and Supermicro putting out interesting budget-friendly Ryzen servers and that has ramped up even more with AMD Ryzen 7000 series server performance being stellar thanks to AVX-512 and other improvements making it more practical for such workloads. AMD has now solidified its positioning for entry-level servers with the introduction of the EPYC 4004 series processors. The EPYC 4004 series is derived from the Ryzen 7000 series offerings to facilitate cost conscious server options and putting the Intel Xeon E-2400 series in the crosshairs. In this review is a look at the EPYC 4004 series along with benchmarks of nearly the entire EPYC 4004 product stack compared to Intel's current top-end Xeon E-2400 series processor, the Intel Xeon E-2488 Raptor Lake.Earlier this week I posted a 35-way Linux graphics card comparison featuring the new NVIDIA RTX 40 SUPER graphics cards and other recent AMD and NVIDIA hardware I had available while using the latest Linux drivers. Intel Arc Graphics desktop graphics cards weren't part of that comparison for simply running out of time prior to the RTX 4080 SUPER embargo lift to facilitate that re-testing. But for those interested, here is a fresh look at the Intel Arc Graphics A580 / A750 / A770 Linux performance against those NVIDIA GeForce and AMD Radeon graphics cards on Ubuntu Linux.",

            "content": "The past year has been a solid one for semiconductor companies, as evident from the 21% gains clocked by the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index during this period. But not all semiconductor stocks have benefited from the broader market's rally.\n\nFor instance, while shares of Broadcom (AVGO -3.56%) have jumped an impressive 115% in the past year, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.92%) stock has headed in the opposite direction and lost 14% of its value. Both companies play a key role in the semiconductor market as they design chips that are used in personal computers (PCs), smartphones, gaming consoles, and data centers.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the prospects of both of these semiconductor stocks and determine which is the better buy following their contrasting performances in the past year.\n\nThe case for AMD\n\nWhile 2024 was a bad year for AMD, the company could witness a nice turnaround in 2025 thanks to the sunny prospects of the PC and data center markets. A closer look at AMD's third-quarter 2024 results (released in October 2024) tells us that a turnaround is already in progress.\n\nThe chipmaker's quarterly revenue increased 18% year over year to $6.8 billion, along with a 31% spike in its earnings per share to $0.92 per share. AMD is forecasting a year-over-year increase of 22% in its revenue for the fourth quarter to $7.5 billion. Analysts are projecting the company's earnings to increase by 41% to $1.09 per share.\n\nThe forecast for 2025 is rosier. AMD's bottom line is projected to jump by 54% in the new year to $5.13 per share on the back of a 27% spike in its revenue to $32.5 billion. It is easy to see why analysts are expecting AMD to step on the gas in 2025. The company's data center business gained momentum throughout 2024 as AMD was able to attract more customers for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used in servers for artificial intelligence (AI) model training and inference.\n\nAMD was originally expecting to sell $2 billion worth of data center GPUs in 2024, but it has increased that forecast to more than $5 billion. The company could witness further growth in this segment in 2025 thanks to an improved supply chain, which should allow AMD to fulfill more demand for its AI GPUs. Meanwhile, CEO Lisa Su points out that PC OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) are set to triple the number of products powered by AI-capable Ryzen PC processors in 2025.\n\nAs a result, it won't be surprising to see AMD gaining a greater share of the client CPU market. Mercury Research reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market increased by 4.6 percentage points year over year in the third quarter of 2024 to 23.9%. AMD's solid positioning in AI PCs should allow it to grab a bigger chunk of this space in 2025, which should be good enough to help the company maintain its outstanding growth in this segment.\n\nIn all, there are a lot of positives for AMD in the new year, which could help this chip stock come out of the rut that it's in. AMD carries a median 12-month price target of $183 based on 55 analysts covering it, which points toward 46% upside from current levels.\n\nThe case for Broadcom\n\nBroadcom is already a bigger player in the AI chip market than AMD. It generated $12.2 billion in revenue last fiscal year from sales of its custom AI processors and networking chips, which was a massive jump of 220% from the preceding year. More importantly, AI has set the stage for terrific long-term growth at Broadcom since the company sees its addressable market in this space increasing to a range of $60 billion to $90 billion by fiscal 2027.\n\nBroadcom is in a robust position to make the most of this lucrative growth opportunity as it controls 55% to 60% of the custom processor market. Assuming Broadcom manages to hold on to a 60% share of this market after three years and the size of the custom processor market increases to $75 billion (based on the midpoint of its guidance range), its AI revenue could jump to $45 billion after three years.\n\nThat would be a big jump of almost four times over the revenue that the company generated from this segment in fiscal 2024. The impressive performance of Broadcom's AI-specific semiconductor business has been solid enough to help the company offset the weakness that it is facing in the non-AI semiconductor business.\n\nMore specifically, Broadcom's non-AI semiconductor revenue fell 23% year over year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 to $4.5 billion. That was in sharp contrast to the 150% year-over-year increase in AI semiconductor revenue to $3.7 billion. The good part is that Broadcom's non-AI semiconductor business has hit a bottom already and the company is expecting a recovery in this segment going forward.\n\nAs such, it is not surprising to see that Broadcom's growth in fiscal 2025 is expected to be stronger than last year. The company finished fiscal 2024 with organic revenue growth of 9%. Its top line came in at $51.6 billion for the quarter. As the following chart tells us, Broadcom is expected to step on the gas in fiscal 2025, followed by healthy growth over the next couple of years as well.\n\nSo, Broadcom is likely to remain a top semiconductor stock going forward thanks to its sunny prospects in AI and a potential recovery in other markets. But is it worth buying this chipmaker over AMD following the outstanding gains that it has delivered in the past year?\n\nThe verdict\n\nWe have seen that both AMD and Broadcom are likely to deliver robust growth in 2025 and beyond, suggesting that both semiconductor stocks may be worth buying right now. However, Broadcom is trading at a richer valuation than AMD following its impressive surge in the past year. This is evident in the chart below.\n\nBroadcom's sales and earnings multiples are well above AMD's. Of course, Broadcom's dominant position in the custom AI processor market explains why it deserves that rich valuation. However, AMD is expected to deliver faster growth in the new year. That's why investors looking for a growth stock that's trading at an attractive valuation are likely to prefer buying AMD over Broadcom as the former could come out of its slump and soar higher in 2025.",

You can also see how all of these processors stack up in our CPU benchmarks hierarchy, and for detailed help on picking the best processor, you can check out our 2024 CPU Buying Guide. And if you're on the fence about which CPU maker to go with, our AMD vs. Intel article dives deep into the topic and comes up with a winner.\n\nAMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D is now the fastest gaming chip on the planet, and it isn't even close \u2014 the fastest AMD CPU for gaming is a whopping 35% faster in 1080p gaming than Intel's competing flagship Core Ultra 9 285K, and 30% faster than Intel's previous-gen flagship, the Core i9-14900K. This chip has been hard to find, but it's definitely worth continuing to look for.\n\nThe 9800X3D is on the pricey side with a $480 MSRP, and its limited availability often finds it selling for far higher pricing, but this chip delivers the pinnacle of gaming performance. AMD's previous-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D is still a great buy for gaming, and we expect to see good sales on it now that it is officially a last-gen product, but it does lag the 9800X3D by 15% in gaming. However, AMD has also improved the 9800X3D's performance in applications, giving it another advantage over the prior-gen model. The X3D chips do come with trade-offs in application performance, so do your research before you buy, but it delivers the best gaming performance overall, and we don't expect a faster chip for gaming for several months. If you need more threaded heft, look to the X3D Ryzen 7 and 9 versions listed below.\n\nAMD's standard Ryzen 9000 models made a somewhat underwhelming debut due to lackluster gen-on-gen gaming performance improvements, but recent firmware and operating system tweaks that improved performance, not to mention some price cuts, have made them far more competitive. As such, we've added the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X to our list for their strong level of gaming performance at their price points.\n\nHere's the shortlist of our buying recommendations \u2014 use the 'More' links to jump to a more detailed description of each processor and its alternatives:\n\nBest CPU for Gaming in 2025 at a glance (more info below):\n\nIf you need more heft in heavy workloads, AMD's $489 16-core 32-thread Ryzen 9 7950X3D brings 3D V-Cache-powered gaming performance to a workstation-class processor for the highest-end systems. AMD's 12-core 24-thread $327 Ryzen 7 7900X3D represents the next step down the ladder, but it also delivers on the gaming front. However, we expect AMD to launch 9000 series versions of these chips next year.\n\nThe list below is for the best CPUs for gaming, while our list of best CPUs for workstations is for those who frequently tackle high-end content creation or professional work, while the best budget CPUs can help you find a cheap chip.

It easily beats Intel's more expensive competitors, not to mention AMD's own lineup. At $480, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is both the fastest gaming CPU on the market and a solid value in the high-performance category.\n\nThis chip really has no peer in the market \u2014 the Ryzen 7 9800X3D delivers outstanding gaming performance, beating Intel's fastest gaming chip, the $440 Core i9-14900K, by 30% in our test suite. The 9800X3D is also almost unbelievably 35% faster than the current-gen Intel flagship, the $629 Core Ultra 9 285K. The stock Ryzen 7 9800X3D's 1% low frame rates (a good smoothness indicator) also deliver an exceptionally smooth gaming experience, benefiting gamers even in GPU-limited scenarios.\n\nThe Ryzen 7 9800X3D has eight cores and 16 threads that operate at a 4.7 GHz base and 5.2 GHz boost clock rate. The chip employs AMD's 3D V-Cache tech with a new spin, which places a 3D-stacked SRAM chiplet underneath the die to deliver an incredible 96MB of L3 cache to great effect. AMD moved the L3 cache chiplet from the top to the bottom of the compute die this generation to improve performance in productivity applications, and the end result is a comparatively low-power chip that delivers incredible gaming performance and comparable productivity performance to other eight-core models on the market.\n\n\n\nYou have to be aware of the tradeoffs with this highly specialized chip \u2014 our gaming benchmarks show that the 3D V-Cache doesn't boost performance in all games, though we found that it impacted nearly every title we tested.\n\n\n\nThe previous-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D is another alternative, but it uses the aging AM4 platform with less advanced interfaces, like PCIe 4.0 and DDR4 memory. Meanwhile, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D snaps into AM5 motherboards that support the latest connectivity tech, like DDR5 and PCIe 5.0. AMD now allows using the auto-overclocking Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) and Curve Optimizer with the 7800X3D but still doesn\u2019t allow direct frequency overclocking.\n\n\n\nThe Ryzen 7 9800X3D has much lower power consumption than the Intel competition, making it a far cooler processor that won't require as expensive accommodations, like a beefy cooler, motherboard, and power supply. That means the 9800X3D delivers top-notch gaming performance and a cooler, quieter, and less expensive system than you'll get with an Ultra 9 or Core i9.\n\nRead: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Review\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9700X Overall Best CPU for Gaming \u2014 First Alternate Pick Our expert review: Specifications Architecture: Zen 5 Socket: AM5 Cores/Threads: 8 / 16 Base Frequency: 3.8 GHz Top Boost Frequency: 5.5 GHz TDP: 65W Today's Best Deals View at Newegg View at Amazon View at Best Buy Reasons to buy + Solid gaming performance for the price points + Decent pricing + Low power consumption, excellent efficiency + Easy to cool + Class-leading single-threaded performance + Native AVX-512 support Reasons to avoid - No bundled cooler - Trails competitors in heavily-threaded productivity work\n\nThe $318 Ryzen 7 9700X had a rough initial product launch, but AMD's targeted firmware and operating system improvements have changed the picture tremendously, allowing the chip to place much higher on our CPU benchmark hierarchy (head there for the most up-to-date gaming benchmarks). Combined with its $40 lower-than-launch pricing, the Ryzen 7 9700X is a strong contender, tying Intel's Core i9-14900K in gaming and beating the Core i7-14700K, as well. That's not to mention that it beats Intel's entire lineup of new Core Ultra processors as well. Now, all of those processors offer faster performance in heavily-threaded productivity applications than the 9700X, but when it comes to just a pure gaming experience, the 9700X either ties or beats all competitors.\n\nThe Ryzen 7 9700X has eight Zen 5 cores with 16 threads that operate at a 3.8 GHz base and 5.5 GHz boost clock. The chip has a 65W TDP, though AMD retroactively added a 105W TDP option you can select in the BIOS that helps boost performance in productivity applications. With either setting, the 9700X has comparatively tame power consumption, so it is an easy chip to cool. You'll have to buy your own cooler for the processor, though.\n\nThe Ryzen 7 9700X drops into socket AM5 motherboards, and B-series motherboards make the most sense for this class of chip. AMD's partners have plenty of 600-series 'B' motherboards on the market that will make a good pairing with this chip. However, the much-anticipated B850 and B840 motherboards will not arrive until early next year.\n\nRead: Ryzen 5 9700X Review\n\n(Image credit: Newegg)\n\nIntel Core i7-14700K Overall Best CPU for Gaming \u2014 Second Alternate Pick Our expert review: Average Amazon review: \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 Specifications Architecture: Raptor Lake Refresh Socket: LGA 1700 Cores/Threads: 20 (8P+12E) / 28 Base Frequency: 3.4 GHz Top Boost Frequency: 5.6 GHz Processor Base Power: 125W Today's Best Deals View at Amazon View at Newegg View at Best Buy Reasons to buy + Price + Four more e-cores for productivity work + Largely matches 14900K gaming performance + Single- and Multi-threaded performance + PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 memory + Overclockable Reasons to avoid - No bundled cooler - Draws more power than Ryzen\n\nIntel boosted the Core i7-14700K's core count by adding four more e-cores and tweaked the boost clock rate, but left its recommended pricing the same as the prior-gen model. At $339, the 14700K delivers essentially the same gaming performance as Intel's own flagship $435 Core i9-14900K \u2014 but for significantly less. You can also discard the integrated graphics engine and get the otherwise identical Core i7-14700KF for $327.\n\n\n\nAs always, if you aren't after top performance in heavy productivity tasks, the Core i7 model takes the shine off the Core i9. The Core i7-14700K is a great high-performance gaming chip at its price point, offering 97% of the flagship Core i9-14900K's performance for $90 less. Better yet, you can overclock the chip and get basically identical performance to the stock Core i9-14900K.\n\n\n\nOur benchmarks show the Core i7-14700K is a much better all-rounder than Ryzen if you're looking for performance in productivity work. The Core i7-14700K has eight P-cores (high-performance) and 12 E-cores (efficiency), for a total of 28 threads. The P-cores run at a 3.4 / 5.6 GHz base/boost, while the E-cores weigh in at 2.5 / 4.3 GHz. In addition, the execution engine is fed by 33MB of L3 cache and 28MB of L2.\n\n\n\nThe 14700K also supports leading-edge connectivity with support DDR4-3200 or up to DDR5-5600 memory, along with 16 lanes of PCIe 5.0 and an additional four lanes of PCIe 4.0 from the chip for M.2 SSDs. The 14700K has a 125W PBP (base) and 253W MTP (peak) power rating.\n\n\n\nYou'll need to buy a capable cooler for the chip, and you'll also need a new 700-series or previous-gen 600-series motherboard. You can find a wide selection of high-end motherboards that support DDR5 memory, and although you'll only find lower-end and mid-range DDR4 motherboards, there's still plenty of selection available. Gamers will enjoy the lower price option of selecting DDR4, but it does come with 5 to 8% lower performance in gaming. You can upgrade to the slightly more expensive DDR5 if you need access to more memory throughput.\n\nRead: Core i7-14700K Review\n\nMid-Range Best CPU for Gaming - $200 to $300\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\n2.

You can also sacrifice the integrated graphics engine \u2014 you won't need it if you have a discrete GPU \u2014 and go with the $200 Core i5-14600KF and get the same level of performance. Intel has since released the newer $320 Core Ultra 5 245K, but it offers virtually the same performance in gaming as the Core i5-14600K, but for $85 more. That leaves the Core i5-14600K as the better option in this price range for now.\n\nThe Core i5-14600K comes with six threaded P-cores that operate at 3.5 / 5.3 GHz and four E-cores that run at 2.6 / 4.0 GHz, for a total of 20 threads. That's paired with 20MB of L3 and 24MB of L2 cache.\n\nThe chip supports 16 lanes of the leading-edge PCIe 5.0 interface and an additional four PCIe 4.0 lanes for a speedy M.2 SSD port, and it also supports either DDR4 or DDR5 memory. Some gamers will enjoy the lower price and comparable performance of DDR4, but you can step up to the slightly more expensive DDR5 if you need access to more memory throughput.\n\nThe 14600K comes with a maximum power rating of 181W. The power consumption threshold allows the chip to work well with a wide variety of standard air and water coolers, but you'll need to ensure your model supports the LGA 1700 socket.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of which, you'll also need a 700 or 600-series motherboard for the processor (with 600-series, make sure the BIOS supports the chip). You can find a wide selection of high-end models that support DDR5 memory, and although you'll find fewer lower-end and mid-range DDR4 motherboards, there's still plenty of selection available.\n\nRead: Core i5-14600K Review\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D Mid-Range Best CPU for Gaming - Alternate Pick Our expert review: Specifications Architecture: Zen 3 Socket: AM4 Cores/Threads: 8/16 Base Frequency: 3.0GHz Top Boost Frequency: 4.1GHz TDP: 105W Today's Best Deals View at Walmart View at Amazon View at Newegg Reasons to buy + Leading gaming performance at its price point + Great pricing + Low power consumption, excellent efficiency + Support for AM4 upgrades Reasons to avoid - Lower performance in productivity applications - No bundled cooler - No direct multiplier-based overclocking\n\nThe $229 Ryzen 5 5700X3D offers the fastest possible gaming performance in the ~$200 price range, bar none, but it does come with some performance tradeoffs in productivity applications.\n\nThe Ryzen 7 5800X3D is the king of the gaming hill for the Ryzen 5000 series, but the 5700X3D has the same number of cores for 35% less cash while delivering 91% of the gaming performance of its more expensive counterpart. That's a win for value gamers and brings AMD's vaunted game-boosting 3D V-Cache tech to a new lower price point.\n\nThe Ryzen 7 5700X3D is basically a down-clocked Ryzen 7 5800X3D, losing 400 MHz off its base and boost frequencies. All other details remain unchanged, including the voluminous 96MB of game-boosting L3 cache.\n\nThe Ryzen 7 5700X3D drops into existing socket AM4 motherboards dating back to the 300-series, which debuted in 2017. Thus, it makes a great high-performance drop-in upgrade for Ryzen owners on the AM4 platform.\n\n\n\nYou have to be aware of the tradeoffs with this highly specialized chip. Our gaming benchmarks show that the 3D V-Cache doesn't boost performance in all games, though we found that it impacted nearly every title we tested. The Ryzen 7 5700X3D is optimized specifically for gaming but isn't as fast as similarly priced chips in productivity applications. Also, the Ryzen 7 5700X3D doesn't support the latest leading-edge connectivity options, like DDR5 and PCIe 5.0.\n\nIf you're willing to accept lower performance in productivity applications and do your homework to ensure the Ryzen 7 5700X3D accelerates the types of games you play frequently, it's hard to go wrong\u2014especially for upgraders with AMD AM4 systems.\n\nRead: Ryzen 7 5700X3D Review\n\nHighest Performance Best CPU for Gaming - $400+\n\n(Image credit: AMD, Shutterstock)\n\n3. AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D Highest Performance Best CPU for Gaming Our expert review: Average Amazon review: \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 Specifications Architecture: Zen 4 Socket: AM5 Cores/Threads: 16/32 Base Frequency: 4.2 GHz Top Boost Frequency: 5.7 GHz TDP: 120W Today's Best Deals View at Amazon View at Newegg Reasons to buy + Leading gaming performance + Modern platform + More overclocking support + Low power consumption, excellent efficiency + Passable single- and multi-threaded performance Reasons to avoid - Steep pricing - No support for DDR4 memory - Reduced performance in some productivity apps\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen 9 7950X3D is geared specifically for gamers looking to blast through CPU-limited games while still having the threaded heft of 16 cores that can handle the heaviest of productivity workloads. The new chip comes packing sixteen Zen 4 cores and the company\u2019s second-gen 3D V-Cache tech that unlocks 128MB of L3 cache, a combo that delivers the fastest gaming performance available from a flagship chip. In our tests, the 7950X3D beats Intel\u2019s fastest chip, the $629 6.2 GHz Core i9-14900KS, by 10% on average and up to 40%+ in some games.\n\nThe 7950X3D uses AMD\u2019s cutting-edge 3D chip-stacking technology, 3D V-Cache, to enable an incredible 128MB L3 cache. Like AMD\u2019s inaugural X3D chip, the Zen 3 Ryzen 7 5800X3D, the extra L3 cache comes courtesy of a 3D-stacked SRAM chiplet fused atop the processor with hybrid bonding, which accelerates gaming to new heights in many titles. AMD also has a new thread-targeting technique designed to help apply the gains more evenly across various games.\n\nHowever, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D does lag its direct competition in some productivity apps due to the tradeoffs associated with the 3D chip-stacking tech, and it doesn't accelerate all games equally. As such, you'll need to study the pros and cons of the chip before pulling the trigger. However, one thing is certain \u2014 it's the fastest flagship gaming chip on the planet. The Ryzen 9 7950X3D offers all the amenities we would expect from a modern processor, including support for DDR5, PCIe 5.0, and the latest USB connectivity standards. For the first time, AMD has also added integrated graphics for a basic display out, which is a plus if you need to troubleshoot.\n\nAMD's new Ryzen 7000 series chips require a bulky cooler, so plan for a 240mm or 280mm or better AIO for the best performance. You'll also need a new AM5 motherboard, as the latest Zen processors are not backward compatible, and DDR5 memory is the only option. If you're looking to build the absolutely fastest gaming system, regardless of cost, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D is undoubtedly the fastest gaming chip currently available.\n\nRead: AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D Review\n\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\nIntel Core i9-14900K Highest Performance Best CPU for Gaming - Alternate Pick Our expert review: Average Amazon review: \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 Specifications Architecture: Raptor Lake Refresh Socket: LGA 1700 Cores/Threads: 16 (8P+16E) / 32 Base Frequency: 3.2 Top Boost Frequency: 6.0 Processor Base Power: 125W Today's Best Deals View at Amazon View at Best Buy View at Newegg Reasons to buy + Solid gaming performance + Competitive pricing + Incredible overclocking headroom + DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 + Single- and Multi-threaded performance + Reasons to avoid - No bundled cooler - Needs a powerful cooler for the best performance - Power consumption\n\nThe prior-gen $438 Core i9-14900K is now selling for all-time low pricing, primarily because the newer $629 Core Ultra 9 285K has arrived to take its place. However, the Core Ultra 9 285K is actually slower than the 14900K in gaming, so it isn't a suitable replacement \u2014 at least not yet, but Intel is issuing patches in early December 2024 that will improve the 285K's gaming performance. Naturally, we won't know if those patches will change the balance of power until they arrive, so the 14900K is the better chip for now.\n\nYou should be aware that the much more economically-priced $339 14700K (listed above) is only 2% slower than the 14900K in gaming but costs roughly $100 less. The Ryzen 7 9700X, also listed above, is also less expensive and effectively ties the 14900K in gaming.\n\nHowever, there are Intel fans willing to pay extra for the absolute most gaming performance they can get from an Intel platform. Also, the 14900K does offer more multi-threaded horsepower than the 14700K and 9700X, which could be useful if you game, stream, and record simultaneously or do other heavy multi-tasking while gaming. Just make sure that your use case justifies the extra cost.\n\nThe 14900K sports leading-edge connectivity, supporting DDR4-3200 or up to DDR5-5600 memory, along with 16 lanes of PCIe 5.0 and an additional four lanes of PCIe 4.0 from the chip for M.2 SSDs.\n\nThe chip comes with eight P-cores that support hyper-threading and 16 single-threaded E-cores for a total of 32 threads. The P-cores have a 3.2 GHz base, and peak frequencies reach an amazing 6.0 GHz with Turbo Boost Max 3.0 (this feature is only active on P-cores). Meanwhile, the E-cores have a 2.4 GHz base and stretch up to 4.4 GHz via the standard Turbo Boost 2.0 algorithms. The chip also has 36MB of L3 cache and 32MB of L2.\n\n\n\nThis 14900K has a 125W PBP (base) and 253W MTP (peak) power rating, but we recorded considerably lower power consumption than its prior-gen counterpart. You'll need to buy a capable cooler for the chip, and you'll also need either a new 700-series or a previous-gen 600-series motherboard. You can find a wide selection of high-end motherboards that support DDR5 memory, and although you'll only find lower-end and mid-range DDR4 motherboards, there's still plenty of selection available.\n\nThe lower price of DDR4 might entice some gamers, but you'll lose anywhere from 5 to 8% of gaming performance with higher-end Intel chips. You can step up to the slightly more expensive DDR5 if you need access to more memory throughput and, thus, every bit of performance possible.\n\nRead: Intel Core i9-14900K Review\n\nBest Budget CPU Pick - $100 to $150\n\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\n4. Intel Core i5-12400F Budget Best CPU for Gaming Our expert review: Specifications Architecture: Alder Lake Socket: LGA 1700 Cores/Threads: 6 (6P + 0E) / 12 Base Frequency: 2.5 Top Boost Frequency: 4.4 TDP: 65W / 117W Today's Best Deals View at Amazon Check Walmart Reasons to buy + Strong gaming performance + Support for DDR4 + Support for PCIe 5.0 + Single-threaded performance + Sufficient bundled cooler Reasons to avoid - No integrated graphics - No CPU core overclocking - Limited memory overclocking\n\nAt $110, the graphics-less Core i5-12400F is an exceptional value, and you can step up to the $130 Core i5-12400 if you need integrated graphics. This chip is slightly faster than the alternate in this class, the Ryzen 5 5600 listed below, in both gaming and productivity work. The 12400F's connectivity features and more modern platform are the big selling point, though. If you're looking for support for more modern interfaces, like PCIe 5.0, DDR5 and DDR4, this chip makes even more sense -- AMD's Ryzen 5 5600 only supports DDR4 and PCIe 4.0.\n\nThe Core i5-12400F comes with six P-cores and 12 threads, but it lacks e-cores. In contrast, its predecessor and our top pick above, the 13400F, comes with four e-cores to add more performance in threaded workloads. The 12400F has a 2.5 GHz base clock and boosts up to 4.4 GHz. The chip also comes with 18 MB of L3 cache and has a 65W PBP (base) and 117W MTP (peak) power rating.\n\nThe Core i5-12400F drops into the cheap and plentiful Socket 1700 ecosystem, so 600- and 700-series boards are fine. Naturally, a B-series model will be the best logical pairing for this class of chip. These come in either DDR4 or DDR5 flavors, so be sure to match your motherboard to the type of RAM you choose to use.\n\nThe Core i5-12400F also comes with a competent bundled cooler, but we always recommend stepping up to a more capable third-party model, some of which can be found as for as low as $20 if you're particularly price sensitive. All in all, the Core i5-12400F at this price point is a solid chip for a budget system.\n\nRead More: Intel Core i5-12400F Review\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 5600 Budget Best CPU for Gaming - Alternative Our expert review: Specifications Architecture: Zen 3 Socket: AM4 Cores/Threads: 6 / 12 Base Frequency: 3.7GHz Top Boost Frequency: 4.6GHz TDP: 65W Today's Best Deals View at Newegg View at Amazon View at Walmart Reasons to buy + Competent gaming and application performance + Solid upgrade path for Ryzen 1000 owners + Bundled CPU Cooler + Overclockable + Broad support with 300-series motherboards Reasons to avoid - Value prop is poor vs Intel chips - No integrated GPU - 5500 only supports PCIe 3.0\n\nThe $107 AMD Ryzen 5 5600 delivers a solid blend of performance in both gaming and productivity applications, bringing a new level of value to the Zen 3 lineup. If you're fine sticking with a previous-gen AM4 motherboard, the Ryzen 5 5600 makes a great budget build. The primary trade-off for the AM4 platform is that you're limited to DDR4, and you don't have access to PCIe 5.0, but this isn't a problem for most users at this price point. However, the Core i5-12400F is a better deal if you're looking for DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 support.\n\nThe Ryzen 5 5600 also makes an absolutely unbeatable budget chip if you're updating a first-gen Ryzen system. The 5600 unseats the Ryzen 5 5600X, a long-time favorite. The 5600X is only a mostly imperceptible ~1% faster in gaming and multi-threaded PC work than the non-X model, but provides a 4% advantage in single-threaded work.\n\n\n\nYou can find the six-core 12-thread Ryzen 5 5600 at $107, a deep discount brought on by competitive pressure from Intel. In fact, our testing shows that the Ryzen 5 5600 generally matches the gaming performance of its more expensive sibling, the ~$175 Ryzen 7 5800X. That makes the 5600 an incredibly well-rounded chip that can handle gaming well, from competitive-class performance with high refresh rate monitors to multi-tasking gaming workloads like streaming, while also serving up more than enough performance for day-to-day productivity apps. As with all AMD CPUs for gaming, you can fully overclock the CPU.\n\n\n\nThe Ryzen 5 5600 has a 3.7 GHz base and 4.6 GHz boost clock. The chip also has a 65W TDP rating, so it runs cool and quiet. Existing AMD owners with a 500-series motherboard will be happy, as the 5600X drops right into existing 500-, 400-, and 300-series motherboards. If you need a new motherboard to support the chip, AMD's AM4 motherboards are plentiful and relatively affordable, with the B-series lineup offering the best overall value for this class of chip.\n\nRead: AMD Ryzen 5 5600 Review\n\nEntry-Level Best CPU for Gaming - For gaming on integrated GPUs\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\n5.

In contrast, the $170 Ryzen 5 8600G delivers 90% of the 8700G's performance but for ~$110 less, making it a solid alternative for gaming systems that don't use a discrete GPU.\n\nNaturally, you'll have to accept lower fidelity settings and be realistic about which titles can play at 1080p resolution. Still, AMD's Hyper-RX suite of features, which includes in-driver Radeon Super Resolution upscaling tech, frame generation with AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF), Anti-Lag+, and Radeon Boost, helps boost performance at a slight cost to image quality. This new feature set, a first for AMD's iGPUs, is a boon for budget gamers.\n\nThe Ryzen 5 8600G has six Zen 4 CPU cores and the RDNA 3 GPU engine with eight CUs. The Ryzen 5 8600G drops into the AM5 platform, with value-focused B650 and A620 motherboards being the obvious best combination. These systems offer a new level of connectivity for AMD's APU processors, which were previously on the aging AM4 platform but require DDR5 memory. That adds some cost, so do a value analysis before selecting this processor. If you're looking for the lowest entry price possible with an APU, the Ryzen 5 5600G listed below slots in as the value alternative.\n\nThe Ryzen 7 8600Gs only supports 16 usable lanes of PCIe 4.0 connectivity, while other processors on the AM5 platform support PCIe 5.0. However, we don't feel this will impact this class of system.\n\nMore: AMD Ryzen 7 8700G and Ryzen 5 8600G Review\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 5600G Entry-Level Best CPU for Gaming \u2014 Alternative Our expert review: Average Amazon review: \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 Specifications Architecture: Zen 3 Socket: AM4 Cores/Threads: 6/12 Base Frequency: 3.9GHz Top Boost Frequency: 4.4GHz TDP: 65W Today's Best Deals View at Walmart View at Newegg View at Amazon Reasons to buy + Stellar price-to-performance ratio + Faster Zen 3 CPU cores + Passable 1080p, solid 720p + Excellent power consumption and efficiency + Great overclocking headroom + Bundled cooler + Compatible with some AM4 motherboards Reasons to avoid - PCIe 3.0 connectivity\n\nThe Ryzen 5 5600G steps into the arena as the value champ for APUs, which are chips with strong enough integrated graphics that they don't require a discrete GPU for light gaming\u2014just be sure you're willing to accept lowered quality settings.\n\n\n\nAt $120, the Ryzen 5 5600G gives you 96% of the gaming performance on integrated graphics than its more expensive sibling, the $160 Ryzen 7 5700G, but for 25% less cash. Our testing shows that its level of performance makes it the best value APU on the market. As long as you're willing to sacrifice fidelity and resolution and keep your expectations in check, the Ryzen 5 5600G's Vega graphics have surprisingly good performance in gaming.\n\nThe 5600G's Vega graphics served up comparatively great 1280x720 gaming across numerous titles in our tests, but options become more restricted at 1080p. Of course, you can get away with 1080p gaming, but you'll need to severely limit the fidelity settings with most titles.\n\n\n\nWith eight cores and 16 threads that operate at a 3.9 GHz base and boost up to 4.4 GHz, the Ryzen 5 5600G also offers solid performance for its price point in standard desktop PC applications. The chip also comes with a bundled Wraith Stealth cooler, sweetening the value prop, and drops into existing 500-series and some 400-series motherboards, though support on the latter will vary by vendor.\n\n\n\nIf your budget is tight and you're looking to build a system for modest gaming, you should check out our Best Cheap CPU feature. Some of those chips can deliver passable gaming performance without a graphics card, and their prices start at just $55 (\u00a340).\n\nRead: AMD Ryzen 5 5600G Review",

Roughly inline with what we have been seeing for Linux right at around the 2% threshold. With the just-published December survey numbers, there is a 0.29% increase to 2.29%! A very healthy 0.29% bump month-over-month and larger than we are used to seeing for the monthly Linux increases... There is some differences with 2.03% seemingly revised down to 2.00% after the fact or how the +0.29% now means 2.29%, but in any case it's showing a healthy Linux increase for December.\n\nThe Windows percent pulled back by 0.51% to 96.1% while Apple macOS also gained 0.22% going up to a 1.61% marketshare. Some of these numbers may be attributed again to a shift in Steam China usage... The December numbers show Simplified Chinese language use dropping by 3.53% while English usage going up by 9.46%. There are also other language increases but nothing specified for where the other ~6% English increase is coming from with Simplified Chinese at just a 3.53% decrease.\n\nWhen looking at the Linux numbers, SteamOS Holo accounts for around 36% of all Linux gamers... SteamOS Holo being the operating system of the Steam Deck and beginning to appear on other devices as well. SteamOS / Steam Deck continues to be the primary growth driver for gaming on Linux.\n\nDriven in large part by the Steam Deck relying on a custom AMD SoC/APU and AMD being popular with Linux gamers/enthusiasts for their open-source driver support, AMD CPU use on Linux commands a 73.6% marketshare. But here's another strange but as the Steam Survey results show Intel CPU marketshare for Linux gamers at 29.6%... So combined 103.2%, which would indicate something isn't quite right with these results. With Steam OS on Windows, AMD has a 38% CPU marketshare to Intel at 63%.So there are a few oddities with the December 2024 survey results on the Steam Survey with some numbers not adding up quite right, but in any event they seem to be pointing to a higher marketshare for Linux gaming in closing out the year and the continued popularity of SteamOS / Steam Deck with the AMD numbers.

            "content": "AMD is preparing to launch its new generation of RDNA4 graphics cards. It is likely that detailed announcements will be made during the conference to be held by the Reds during CES 2025. AMD could surprise us, and not necessarily where we expect them to. Against all expectations, the brand does not seem to have decided to bury the good old 6/8-pin PCIe connector, unlike its rival Nvidia.\n\nAMD & Intel: the choice of reason for RDNA4 and Battlemage\u2026\n\nWith this choice, AMD would be positioning itself in the same way as Intel with its Battlemage GPUs: in continuity for users and at odds with Nvidia\u2019s choices. Some will see it as a sign of caution, others as a nod to the trend towards more powerful connectors such as 12VHPWR or 12V-2\u00d76. Whatever the case, according to the latest information available, RDNA4 will retain the famous PCIe connector that has dominated graphics cards for years.\n\nWhy keep a 6/8-pin connector when others are opting for more compact and potentially more powerful solutions? The answer is not officially given by AMD, but we can put forward a few hypotheses. Firstly, the 6/8-pin PCIe connector has a proven track record of reliability, whereas its potential replacement made headlines in 2024. We know its limits, we know how to handle it, and its integration is perfectly mastered by power supply manufacturers. This is also the assurance of not adding extra costs on components that don\u2019t bring any real gains. But the explanation may also lie in the positioning that AMD wants to adopt with its new RDNA4 GPUs. AMD, like Intel, can simply argue that, from a purely technical point of view, a 6/8 pin connector is sufficient to power their future graphics cards. If the GPUs do not exceed a certain TDP, there is no need to multiply the number of exotic connectors. Rumours point to a more controlled power/energy efficiency positioning, suggesting that the Radeon RX 9000 series, and in particular the potential RX 9070 XT, would not need to consume as much power as the competition\u2019s top-of-the-range GPUs.\n\nOnly time will tell whether this choice is sustainable. As graphics cards become more powerful, the question of power supply will become more pressing. Nor is there any guarantee that, for the sake of standardisation, AMD\u2019s partners will not switch to 12VHPWR or 12V-2\u00d76 connectors when their custom references get released, like Asrock\u2019s RX 7900 XTX WorkStation (WS) that was equipped with a 12VHPWR.",

            "content": "By Sam Naffziger, SVP, AMD Corporate Fellow, and Product Technology Architect\n\nOver the last two years, generative AI (GenAI) has become a major focus, with billions of people and organizations using artificial intelligence (AI) tools daily. As adoption accelerates and new applications emerge, new data centers are coming online to support this transformational technology \u2014 but energy is a critical limiting factor.\n\nIn these early stages of the AI transformation, demand for compute will continue to be nearly insatiable. And in the data center, every watt of energy consumed by a chip has an impact on its energy needs, total cost of ownership, carbon emissions and, most importantly, its compute capacity. To continue driving advances in AI and broaden access, the industry must deliver higher performance and more energy efficient processors.\n\nDriving energy efficiency through the 30\u00d725 goal\n\nIn 2021, we announced our 30\u00d725 goal, a vision to deliver a 30x energy efficiency improvement for AMD EPYC CPUs and AMD Instinct accelerators powering AI and high performance computing (HPC) by 2025 from a 2020 baseline. We have made steady progress against our goal by finetuning every layer from silicon to software.\n\nThrough a combination of architectural advances and software optimizations, we have achieved a ~28.3x energy efficiency improvement in 2024 using AMD Instinct MI300X accelerators paired with AMD EPYC 9575F host CPUs, compared to the 2020 goal baseline.\n\nEnergy efficient design starts at the architecture level\n\nAMD takes a holistic approach to energy efficient design, balancing advancements across the many complex architectural levers that make up chip design, incorporating tight integration of compute and memory with chiplet architectures, advanced packaging, software partitions, and new interconnects. One of our primary goals across all of our products is to extract as much performance as possible while balancing energy use.\n\nAMD Instinct MI300X accelerators pack an unprecedented 153 billion transistors and leverage advanced 3.5D CoWoS packaging to minimize communication energy and data movement overhead. With eight 5nm compute die layered on top of four 6nm IO die, all tightly connected to industry-leading 192GB of high-bandwidth memory (HBM3) capacity running at 5.2 terabytes per second, these accelerators can ingest and process massive amounts of data at an incredible pace.\n\nMicrosoft and Meta are taking advantage of these capabilities, leveraging MI300X accelerators to power key services including all live traffic on Meta\u2019s Llama 405B models.\n\nMemory capacity and bandwidth play a crucial role in AI performance and efficiency, and we are committed to delivering industry-leading memory with every generation of AMD Instinct accelerators. Increasing the memory on chips, improving the locality of memory access via software partitions, and optimizing how data is processed by enabling high bandwidth between chiplets can lower interconnect energy and total communication energy consumption, reducing the overall energy demand of a system. These effects multiply across clusters and data centers.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just accelerators that impact AI performance and energy efficiency. Pairing them with the right CPU host is critical to keeping accelerators fed with data for demanding AI workloads. AMD EPYC 9575F CPUs are tailor-made for GPU-powered AI solutions, with our testing showing up to 8% faster processing than a competitive CPU thanks to higher boost clock frequency.\n\nContinuous improvement with software optimizations\n\nThe AMD ROCm open software stack is also delivering major leaps in AI performance, allowing us to continue driving performance and energy efficiency optimizations for our accelerators well after they\u2019ve shipped to customers.\n\nSince we launched the AMD Instinct MI300X accelerators, we have doubled inferencing and training performance across a wide range of the most popular AI models through ROCm enhancements. We are continuously finetuning, and our engagement in the open ecosystem with partners like PyTorch and Hugging Face means that developers have access to daily updates of the latest ROCm libraries to help ensure their applications are always as optimized as possible.\n\nWith ROCm, we have also expanded support of lower abstraction AI-specific math formats including FP8, enabling greater power efficiency for AI inference and training. Leveraging lower precision math formats can alleviate memory bottlenecks and reduce latency associated with higher precision formats, allowing for larger models to be handled within the same hardware constraints, and enabling more efficient training and inference processes. Our latest ROCm 6.3 release continues to extend performance, efficiency and scalability.\n\nWhere do we go from here?\n\nOur high-performance AMD EPYC CPUs and AMD Instinct accelerators are powering AI at scale, uncovering incredible insights through the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers, and enabling data centers to do more in a smaller footprint. We are not taking our foot off the gas \u2014 we are continuing to push the boundaries of performance and energy efficiency for AI and high-performance computing through holistic chip design. What\u2019s more, our open software approach enables us to harness collective innovation across the open ecosystem to drive performance and efficiency enhancements on a consistent and frequent cadence.\n\nWith our thoughtful approach to hardware and software co-design, we are confident in our roadmap to exceed the 30\u00d725 goal and excited about the possibilities ahead, where we see a path to massive energy efficiency improvements within the next couple of years.\n\nAs AI continues to proliferate and demand for compute accelerates, energy efficiency becomes increasingly important beyond the silicon, as we broaden our focus to address energy consumption at the system, rack, and cluster levels. We look forward to sharing more about our progress and what\u2019s after 30\u00d725 when we wrap up the goal next year.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nRelated Stories",

It\u2019s your CPU that sets up the frames for your GPU to render in games, making it the foundation of your gaming PC hardware. This is particularly true in the current climate, where there is a substantial difference in the gaming performance of some of the latest CPUs.\n\nThe two main players are AMD and Intel, and there are now substantial differences between the two companies\u2019 CPUs when it comes to gaming. On one level, you\u2019re now spoiled for choice when picking the perfect processor for your gaming PC, but you want to make sure you get this choice absolutely right, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here to make your search easier.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the current gaming champ in our own benchmarks, with its predecessor, the 7800X3D a close second. However, the Intel Core i9 14900K still offers solid gaming performance, while also being much faster at other non-gaming tasks, such as video encoding and rendering, making it a better all-rounder. You\u2019ll need to make sure you flash the BIOS on your motherboard to the latest version for this CPU, though, to make sure it has the latest Intel CPU fix, and you\u2019ll also need to make sure you have a strong CPU cooler and power supply.\n\nWe currently don\u2019t recommend the latest Intel Arrow Lake chips for gaming, however. As we found in our Core Ultra 7 265K review, while these CPUs are great for heavily multi-threaded work, such as 3D rendering, and they\u2019re very power-efficient, they\u2019re substantially slower than AMD\u2019s latest chips, and Intel\u2019s last-gen options, when it comes to gaming.\n\nWe suggest going for a CPU with at least six cores for gaming, and in most cases more than eight cores is overkill. Hexacore chips are now the standard among gamers, and a growing number of AAA PC games expect as much. There are great current generation options that fit this bill, such as the AMD Ryzen 5 7600X, but if you\u2019re on a tight budget, even a cheap CPU such as the Intel Core i5 12400F will do the job fine for a basic gaming PC.\n\nWhy you can trust our advice \u2714 At PCGamesN, our experts spend hours testing hardware and reviewing games and VPNs. We share honest, unbiased opinions to help you buy the best.

This eight-core CPU isn\u2019t cheap, but it takes the winning formula of its predecessor, the 7800X3D, and runs with it. The 9800X3D is quite simply the fastest gaming CPU we\u2019ve ever tested, and it absolutely obliterates the current Arrow Lake competition from Intel. This CPU tops our frame rate charts in Cyberpunk 2077 and Far Cry 6, and it\u2019s also much quicker than its predecessor in application software. The secret to this CPU\u2019s success is its use of 2nd-gen AMD 3D V-cache, a large 64MB slice of silicon that sits under the CPU cores, rather than on top of them, as it did in the 7800X3D. This cache massively improves gaming performance, and the fact that it\u2019s underneath the CPU cores means your CPU cooler now directly cools those cores, rather than cooling the cache first. This not only means cooler operating temperatures than the 7800X3D, but it\u2019s also enabled AMD to up the clock speeds, with a top boost clock of 5.2GHz. Add in AMD\u2019s latest Zen 5 architecture and you have a formidable gaming CPU, as well as a chip that can handle multi-threaded software without breaking a sweat. It doesn\u2019t have loads of CPU cores, but it has enough for most people\u2019s needs, and it\u2019s a fantastic chip for gaming.

This perky processor punches well above its weight, usually costing around $399, and it competes with more expensive flagship options. The 96MB of L3 cache inside the 7800X3D does wonders to boost the floor and ceiling of frame rates, ensuring that you\u2019re getting all the pixel-pushing juice out of your graphics card. Its effects are most keenly felt at resolutions like 1080p, making it an ideal choice for competitive gamers. It will concede ground where clock speeds are king, but these instances are few and far between in our experience. Plus, the AM5 motherboard you pick up to seat the 7800X3D will serve you well for a drop-in upgrade, futureproofing your build.

The price is amazing for the gaming performance on offer. Unlike newer budget CPUs, such as the Core i3 13100, the Core i5 12400F has six P-Cores under its heat spreader, rather than just four, giving it plenty of raw horsepower in games. Don\u2019t be fooled by the \u201812\u2019 in this CPU\u2019s model number either \u2013 the Alder Lake architecture used by this chip is very similar to the Raptor Lake architecture used in Intel\u2019s latest 14th gen CPUs, and we\u2019ve found it more than capable when it comes to gaming. Unlike AMD\u2019s AM5 CPUs, you can run the Core i5 12400F with your old DDR4 memory if you have some in an existing system, and it will happily run an old motherboard with a B660 chipset. With its TDP of just 65W, this CPU also doesn\u2019t need a massive AIO cooler to keep it in check \u2013 a decent air cooler will do the job fine. There are a few catches. One is that this \u2018F\u2019 model has no integrated GPU, but that\u2019s not an issue if you buy a separate graphics card for gaming. It also doesn\u2019t have any of Intel\u2019s E-Cores, which provide a boost in multi-threaded work, but these are largely irrelevant when it comes to performance in most games. The peak clock speed of just 4.4GHz could also be higher, and this isn\u2019t a K-series CPU either, so you can\u2019t officially overclock it with the multiplier but you can\u2019t have everything at this price. This is the best option if you want a decent gaming CPU for the cheapest price possible.

It features six of Intel\u2019s latest Raptor Lake P-Cores and a 4.6GHz boost clock, making it a capable processor for gaming, but it also has an added bonus over the 12400F. Unlike its predecessor, the 13400F also has four of Intel\u2019s low-power E-Cores under its heat spreader, giving you a total of ten cores, which gives it a boost in multi-threaded software. It\u2019s an ideal choice for anyone who does more than just game with their system but doesn\u2019t have a huge amount of money to spend. Like the 12400F, this chip doesn\u2019t have a K in its model name, which means it can\u2019t officially be overclocked by changing the multiplier, and the F means it doesn\u2019t have an integrated GPU either. However, the latter enables you to save some money if you\u2019re buying a dedicated graphics card anyway. You won\u2019t need an enormously powerful AIO cooler to keep this CPU in check either, and if you buy the retail version you\u2019ll even get an adequate Intel stock air cooler included in the box.

This makes it a prime candidate for just about any build you could think of, regardless of size or power. Despite sitting at the lower end of the Ryzen 7000 series stack, the 7600X handily outperforms previous generation flagships when it comes to gaming. Better still, you\u2019re not missing out on many frames at all by opting for it versus its more expensive siblings. It\u2019s worth bearing in mind, however, that you\u2019ll want to pair the 7600X with suitably strong cooling as it doesn\u2019t come with a stock cooler. Don\u2019t forget that you\u2019ll need a new motherboard too, as well as some sticks of DDR5 RAM.

With six Zen 4 cores and a Radeon 760M integrated GPU, it\u2019s a perky performer as a processor and stand-in graphics card. The 8600G shines brightest in less demanding games, but it\u2019s still capable of playing the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 at 30fps if you\u2019re comfortable with playing at 1080p using low settings. It\u2019s compatible with FidelityFX Super Resolution too, which can help boost frame rates further through upscaling and frame generation. You\u2019ll need to pair the 8600G with DDR5 RAM clocked at 6,000MHz or above to get the most performance out of its integrated graphics. While this does add to the total cost of putting together a system, you can use the same RAM if you upgrade your CPU in the future. If you plan to pair the 8600G with a dedicated graphics card, it only supports a limited number of PCIe 4.0 lanes. This is less of a problem with current generation pixel pushers (Radeon RX 7000 and GeForce RTX 40 series), but it will limit the bandwidth of future graphics cards that use the PCIe 5.0 interface.

Featuring 16 cores and 24 threads, the chip is more than capable of handling real-time 120fps encoding using the \u2018x264 Slower\u2019 preset. This is especially useful if you have a Radeon graphics card but it can act as a great replacement for \u2018NVENC\u2019 on GeForce GPUs, should the need arise. The chip can keep up with top-tier pixel pushers too, maintaining solid maximum, average, and minimum frames per second. It\u2019s plenty useful for exporting and editing VODs too, boasting fast export times and rendering capabilities in Adobe suite applications such as Premiere Pro and After Effects.

It packs the usual makeup of 24 cores and 32 threads that have defined every Core i9 for the past three generations. The only other LGA 1700 processor capable of competing is the Core i9 13900KS, but the 14900K is essentially identical to the more expensive CPU. The Core i9 14900K is best suited for systems that serve both as a gaming rig and workstation, as its strengths are best realized in multi-core workloads. Just make sure you have a capable power supply and cooler to hand, as it\u2019ll guzzle electricity like nobody\u2019s business. There is a word of warning with this CPU, though, which is that there have been problems with voltage fluctuations, causing crashes in games, and even permanently damaged CPUs. If you want to run this CPU, make sure you flash the BIOS in your motherboard so it has the latest microcode first.

In this chip lies the very best that Zen 4 has to offer, with the flagship hiding some surprising tricks up its sleeve. While this chip doesn\u2019t boast a higher core or thread count compared to previous generation offerings, they are clocked much higher. This not only translates into higher frames per second but also greatly improves performance in just about every application that can make use of multiple CPU cores. Its greatest trick, however, is its \u2018Eco Mode\u2019, which can force the processor to draw a maximum of 65W. Even with such low power consumption, it can still trade blows with top-tier processors. Naturally, you\u2019ll get the most out of the chip while running at its standard 170W TDP, but it makes the prospect of a small form factor build featuring the 7950X more possibility than a dream. Read our AMD Ryzen 9 7950X review.\n\nHow to choose a CPU for gaming\n\nOnce you\u2019ve figured out your budget, choosing the right CPU for your system comes down to what you plan to use it for. If you want to play games at the highest frame rates possible in first-person shooters, then AMD\u2019s latest X3D chips are ideal. They have a massive stack of cache that sits above (or below, in the 9800X3D) the CPU cores, reducing the need for your CPU to get data from your system RAM, and our benchmarks show this has a big impact on gaming performance.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford an X3D CPU, or you\u2019re looking more for an all-rounder than a pure gaming CPU, then the next big metric to look at is the clock speed. Don\u2019t get fooled into thinking you need 16 or 24 cores for gaming \u2013 eight is more than enough, and six is fine, but the faster the clock speed, the faster your CPU will set up frames for your graphics card.\n\nIntel\u2019s 12th-gen to 14th-gen Core i5 CPUs are all fine for gaming, and models with faster clock speeds will be quicker in games. Meanwhile, AMD\u2019s Ryzen 5 7000-series chips are all solid in games, as are the company\u2019s Ryzen 5000-series X3D chips, which you can use to upgrade an old Socket AM4 AMD machine if you don\u2019t want to buy a whole new PC.\n\nIf you really want to save some money, then it\u2019s also worth considering an AMD APU, which not only has a CPU inside it, but also a basic-level Raden GPU, meaning you don\u2019t need to buy a separate graphics card. These chips, such as the Ryzen 5 8600G, can cope with basic gaming at 1080p with low settings, but they\u2019re not as quick as AMD\u2019s full-fat CPUs if you do upgrade to a full graphics card at a later date.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow we test the best gaming CPUs\n\nThere are a lot of gaming CPUs on the market, and it can be hard to know which processors are genuinely worth your money. To help you decide which CPU is right for your system and budget, we evaluate each chip\u2019s gaming capabilities using a solid base spec for our test rig.\n\nThis comprises an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition graphics card, a Corsair H100x Elite 240mm AIO cooler, a Corsair RM1000x PSU, 32GB of G.Skill TridentZ 5 Neo RGB 6,000MHz, CL28 RAM, and a 2TB WD Black SN850X SSD. We also test with the very latest version of Windows,\n\nWhen we test gaming CPUs, our benchmarks include our usual suite of PC games, including Cyberpunk 2077, Far Cry 6, F1 24, and Total War: Warhammer 3. We also test application performance using Handbrake for video encoding, and Cinebench R24 to assess rendering performance. In addition, we observe what temperatures the processor hits under load, and note how long it can maintain its advertised boost clock speeds.\n\nCan I upgrade my CPU?\n\nTo upgrade the CPU in your gaming PC, you\u2019ll need to physically swap it out for one of the more powerful processors in this list. It\u2019s more straightforward than you\u2019d think, provided you have a compatible chip, an adequate cooling solution, and the right tools.\n\nCheck that a new CPU is compatible with your motherboard before upgrading. Intel\u2019s compatibility tool lets you look up any Intel processor and view all compatible motherboards, while AMD\u2019s search tool does a similar thing.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, our seven-step CPU upgrade guide has plenty of advice on installing a new processor.\n\nWhen to upgrade a gaming CPU\n\nThere isn\u2019t a set amount of time that a CPU will last you, but there are several ways to determine the best time to replace your CPU. Either you\u2019ll find that your current system has slowed and is no longer meeting your needs, you have a fast processing speed and want to keep it that way, or you want to futureproof yourself with the latest processor.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure whether the CPU is the weak link in your gaming machine, there are tools to help you figure it out. CapFrameX and Rivatuner Statistics Server can display CPU and GPU loads when you boot a game with it running in the background. If your GPU hovers around 90-100%, upgrading to the best graphics card you can will be better than a CPU upgrade.\n\nWhat should CPU usage be when gaming?\n\nIn a balanced system (i.e. a PC with a CPU and GPU of a similar caliber, think RX 7700 XT and Ryzen 5 7600 or RTX 4090 and Core i9 14900K) your CPU usage will largely depend on the types of games you\u2019re playing.\n\nCertain genres, such as RTS games, will lean more heavily on the CPU as more computational performance is required to manage things like artificial intelligence. That said, more often than not, your GPU usage will be at 100% long before your processor is but higher frame rates (120+) will put more strain on it.",

            "content": "AMD has a whole lot of goodies in store for us next year. Its new hardware launches expected in 2025 include RDNA 4 graphics cards, more Ryzen 9000 processors \u2013 including new 3D V-Cache offerings \u2013 and a deluge of APUs that could seriously pep up thin-and-light gaming laptops and PC gaming handhelds in a big way.\n\nThere\u2019s some exciting stuff on the boil, and the best bit is a lot of this hardware is rumored to be shown off by AMD right at the start of the coming year, at CES 2025.\n\nNext-gen RDNA 4 GPUs\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\nProbably the most anticipated launch from AMD next year \u2013 certainly for PC gamers who can\u2019t stomach the prices of best graphics cards \u2013 is new RDNA 4 desktop GPUs.\n\nAs has been long-rumored, the RDNA 4 series from AMD is expected to top out at the mid-range. Team Red won\u2019t be challenging Nvidia at the higher end of the market, by all accounts.\n\nThe most recent speculation (at the time of writing) has theorized that AMD will launch an RX 9070 XT and vanilla 9070, which, if it happens, looks to be an odd kind of one-upmanship game with Nvidia (as in RX 9070 > RTX 5070 at the mid-range). Previously, the rumor mill believed the RX 8800 XT would be the next-gen flagship, and that could still happen, but we're in strictly wait-and-see territory here.\n\nIf the rumors are on the money, the top-end RDNA 4 (Navi 48) graphics card, whatever it's called, could equal Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4080 GPU for non-ray tracing performance, and the RTX 4080 Super when it comes to ray tracing \u2013 an exciting prospect. Yes, the theory is that AMD has taken some big strides forward with ray tracing performance in particular.\n\nWe should see these RX 9070 models (or indeed 8800 XT and sibling) revealed at CES 2025 if the buzz on the grapevine is right, with the GPUs going on sale in Q1. Of course, there\u2019ll likely be more RDNA 4 products in the pipeline later in the year, too.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nIf the initial release is indeed the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070, we\u2019d expect to see an RX 9060 variant(s) later in 2025, and maybe a true budget GPU too \u2013 an RX 9050 perhaps? We can but hope, as AMD\u2019s RX 6600 is a stalwart of a cheap GPU for a budget PC build, but it\u2019s looking distinctly tired now (especially after the successful launch of the Intel Arc B580).\n\nFSR 4 finally adopts AI\n\n(Image credit: Activision)\n\nOn the software front, AMD has told us that it\u2019s bringing AI into its FSR frame rate boosting tech (finally).\n\nFSR 4 will undoubtedly arrive at some point in 2025 packing AI, and AMD said it will usher in the \u201cnext generation of ML-based [machine learning, or AI] FSR\u201d for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 to begin with (and other PC games will doubtless follow). A recent rumor suggested FSR 4 could be aired as soon as CES 2025.\n\nWe don\u2019t know much about how the implementation of AI will work yet, but it should improve FSR\u2019s frame generation, and also upscaling image quality.\n\nSeveral hints have been dropped that FSR 4 will help handhelds to achieve better battery life, which is a key aspect for portable gaming devices. If it is shown off at CES, expect to get just a teaser and some initial nuggets of info.\n\nA good deal more Ryzen 9000 CPUs\n\n(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)\n\nAnother surefire bet for 2025 is the launch of more Ryzen 9000 processors, as there are only five models out there so far.\n\nThe latest arrival is the 3D V-Cache gaming champ, the Ryzen 9800X3D, and that\u2019s expected to be joined by higher-end Zen 5 X3D CPUs at CES 2025. Those should be the Ryzen 9950X3D and 9900X3D which will likely go on sale shortly after their unveiling.\n\nFurther into 2025, at some point, we\u2019d bank on seeing a more wallet-friendly 3D V-Cache chip, such as a Ryzen 9600X3D perhaps (and if this happens, it\u2019ll be interesting to see if it\u2019s a Micro Center exclusive in the US, once again).\n\nAMD will surely flesh out the range of vanilla Ryzen 9000 processors too, and will likely add plain (slightly more affordable) non-X variants of Zen 5 CPUs, as it did with Ryzen 7000 \u2013 so we\u2019ll get the Ryzen 9600 (running alongside the 9600X) and so on. In fact, that Ryzen 9600 might turn up in January 2025, based on recent speculation.\n\nAlso expect some more affordable AM5 motherboards to pitch up early in 2025, with B850 and B840 models seeing a release early in the year to go alongside more premium X870 offerings.\n\nA veritable feast of new APUs\n\nAMD has made a name for itself with powerful APUs in recent times, all-in-one chips that pack not just a CPU, but integrated GPU and NPU \u2013 and we\u2019ll get some new big hitters in terms of laptop APUs in 2025.\n\nThe most excitement has been generated around Ryzen AI Max 300 (known as Strix Halo) mobile chips.\n\nThe Strix Halo flagship is rumored to be an absolute beast of an APU with 16 cores (Zen 5) and RDNA 3.5 (refreshed RDNA 3) integrated graphics with 40 CUs \u2013 theoretically providing a similar level of performance to the RTX 4070 laptop GPU.\n\nThis is incredible for an integrated GPU, frankly, if it pans out, which could mean that this is a highlight of the year, again with an expected CES 2025 reveal (and launch later down the line).\n\nThe catch with Ryzen AI Max 300 is that the top-end APUs may be destined for workstations rather than gaming laptops, and the latter may only get the middle-of-the-pack Strix Halo silicon. That said, even if this does happen, those could still be impressively powerful chips.\n\nRumor has it that workstations with Ryzen AI Max 300 could arrive in Q1 2025, and thin-and-light gaming laptops might debut in that quarter too, though the majority of the latter could follow in Q2.\n\nAMD is also rumored to be launching Kraken Point APUs, which will follow current Hawk Point chips, sitting beneath Strix Halo \u2013 built on Zen 5 and RDNA 3.5 \u2013 but still categorized as a premium offering.\n\nAlong with that, we have Fire Range, AMD\u2019s take on Ryzen 9000 desktop as a laptop APU, following in the footsteps of Dragon Range. Crucially, these will include X3D models, and all of these APUs are expected to be unveiled at CES 2025.\n\nFresh APUs to supercharge handhelds\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nThat won\u2019t be it for new APUs in 2025, as we\u2019re also expecting the sequel to AMD\u2019s chips designed for handhelds.\n\nThe Ryzen Z2 and Z2 Extreme are the next-gen offerings that we anticipate will again be shown off at CES 2025, if the rumor mill is right.\n\nWord is that the Ryzen Z2 Extreme could sport 8 Zen 5 CPU cores plus RDNA 3.5 graphics with 16 CUs, which would make it a peppy upgrade on its Z1 predecessor.\n\nNotably, the Z2 might mean better efficiency, and therefore battery life, for handhelds, which is another key aspect in the portable gaming arena \u2013 longevity gains that could be amplified with FSR 4, as we already touched on.\n\nConcluding thoughts\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock / JHVEPhoto)\n\nWe\u2019re most looking forward to those RDNA 4 graphics cards, with the rumors around the RX 9070 XT making the board sound like it could become the mid-range champ of desktop GPUs \u2013 if AMD pins the right price tag on the product.\n\nSeeing an RX 9060 model debut early next year would be great for those searching for a more affordable GPU, too.\n\nThe other major highlights for us are those Strix Halo APUs, which have sounded immense since the very first leak about the chips, and also those Ryzen Z2 processors for handhelds that could help seriously improve both performance and battery life for these portable devices. Whichever way you dice it, there\u2019s a lot to look forward to from AMD in 2025.",

(NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nA December 30 report by CNBC discussed the rapid adoption of generative AI by businesses, its potential to significantly impact global GDP, and the varying perspectives of leaders on its future. As per the report, generative AI has evolved from a novelty to a key tool for businesses, with nearly two-thirds of organizations using it for tasks like customer service automation and data analysis. While its growth could potentially boost global GDP by $7 trillion in the next decade, opinions among business leaders vary. Jamie Dimon and Bill Gates view AI as transformative, comparing it to past technological breakthroughs.\n\nHowever, Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella caution that further advancements will be slower, requiring deep innovation. Meanwhile, concerns about AI's ethical risks, highlighted by Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, suggest the technology could have unintended consequences, despite its growing importance in industries like defense.\n\nREAD ALSO: 9 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors' Radar and 10 AI News Investors Shouldn't Miss.\n\nOpen-Source AI from China Takes on Major U.S. Models with Fractional Costs\n\nCNBC\u2019s TechCheck anchor, Deirdre Bosa reported on December 30 that DeepSeek, an open-source AI model developed by a Chinese research lab, has emerged as a serious competitor to leading models like GPT-4 and LLaMA 3.1. Despite using lower-cost H800 chips, which are less powerful versions of the H100, DeepSeek outperformed these models in key benchmarks and was built for just $5.5 million, a fraction of the cost of other frontier models that require hundreds of millions or even billions to develop.\n\nThis signals a shift toward more commoditized AI models, where progress relies less on building new infrastructure and more on optimizing existing models. The development raises concerns for investors in major U.S. tech companies, as it challenges the long-standing dominance of firms like OpenAI. Additionally, the success of DeepSeek highlights the potential advantage of open-source models, suggesting that nations like China, without access to the latest chips or massive investments, could still compete effectively in the AI race, Bosa mentioned. The implications of this development, particularly for the U.S.-led AI dominance and global geopolitical dynamics are expected to unfold further in 2025.\n\nStory Continues",

Not wanting to waste any time, it appears the company plans to launch Radeon RX 9070 XT shortly after its press conference. There\u2019s also further news concerning its power cables and consumption which should please anyone with older PSUs.\n\nAccording to Benchlife, both Radeon RX 9070 XT and Radeon RX 9070 will hit store shelves at the end of January 2025, falling short of providing an exact date but highlighting it\u2019ll be before Chinese New Year (January 29, 2025). Should this and prior rumours hold true, the Navi 48 Radeon 9000 (formerly 8000) graphics cards will scrap with almost every member of Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 50 Series. Hopefully Navi 44 will quickly follow to aid Team Red\u2019s chances, but there\u2019s no sign just yet.\n\nThe outlet also claims that Radeon RX 9070 XT\u2019s TBP (Total Board Power) will exceed 300W. Such power consumption would put it in the company of Radeon RX 7900 XT which has a 315W TBP. Relative to its potential competition, however, it\u2019d sip more watts from the wall than GeForce RTX 5070 Ti with its 300W TDP.\n\nThis lowly TBP doesn\u2019t even come close to saturating the 600W a 12V-2\u00d76 power connector can deliver. With this in mind, it should come as no surprise that AMD isn\u2019t mandating its usage on Radeon RX 9070 XT, allowing board partners to continue using tried-and-tested PCIe eight-pins. This doesn\u2019t mean models featuring the newer header won\u2019t appear, but I would expect them to be the exception rather than the rule.\n\nIt\u2019s still difficult to gauge the potential success of Radeon RX 9070 XT, particularly given a lack of pricing and performance estimates. That said, its alleged 16GB VRAM buffer does give me hope. If AMD can craft a graphics card similar in value to Radeon RX 7800 XT or Radeon RX 7900 GRE, then I\u2019d wager it\u2019s on to a midrange winner. Both the aforementioned pixel pushers were great offerings but faced an uphill battle thanks to their relatively late arrival to market, so I\u2019m glad we won\u2019t see that problem repeat here.\n\nWe\u2019ll learn more about Radeon RX 9070 XT and Radeon RX 9070 at CES 2025, come January 6 at 7PM (GMT). Club386 will be in Las Vegas for the show, so stay tuned for any and all announcements.

At times, Intel stumbled through 2024 like someone coming home from the pub on Christmas Eve. But AMD was steady, reliable, and mostly dependable.\n\nSee if you agree with us as we walk through the best and worst of AMD\u2019s 2024, as we\u2019ve done (or will do) for Microsoft, Google, and Intel. Will AMD be able to keep up the pace in 2025?\n\nAMD Ryzen 8000: FAIL\n\nCalling this family a failure may seem a hit harsh, but it\u2019s true that this was one of the few missteps by AMD all year. The Ryzen 8000 family fell a bit short on a few fronts: First, it was entirely made up of APUs, with no cheaper options without integrated graphics. For desktop gamers who favor graphics cards, that\u2019s just wasted silicon. Second, while the chips offered AI capabilities, they fell short of Copilot+ PC status \u2014 and again, gamers have always been a bit suspicious of AI. The Ryzen 8000 also began shipping a few months after its announcement.\n\nAMD\n\nAt the time, Intel\u2019s 14th-gen Core chips were delivering impressive performance with less care paid to battery life. And since the Ryzen 8000 was announced at the same time as the Ryzen 5000 series, it felt like people just stopped talking about the Zen 4-based 8000 and wondered when the Zen 5-based 9000 series would appear.\n\nAMD Ryzen 5700X3D: WIN\n\nIt\u2019s probably fair to say that the Ryzen 8000 was overshadowed by the 5700X3D, too, which was announced alongside it.\n\nOne of AMD\u2019s most attractive characteristics is the longevity of its platforms, and the Ryzen 8000 was designed around the AM5 socket. The Ryzen 5700X3D had two things going for it: First, it was yet another processor on the venerable AM4 socket, allowing customers to extend their PCs a bit longer; and second, by then the X3D\u2019s monstrous cache had become a fan favorite. While I don\u2019t have any numbers on how the 5700X3D sold, my guess is that it was a more appealing part than the Ryzen 8000 APUs.\n\nIt has to be noted, though, that the 5700X3D was a Zen 3 part, with slower clock speeds that pushed down productivity performance. For gamers, though, the Ryzen 5700X3D was just what they asked for.\n\nAMD\u2019s mainstream GPU strategy: WIN\n\nAMD\u2019s GPU business in 2024 and 2025 will be guided by this storyline: Nvidia has won the high-end GPU market, and everyone else is chasing the scraps. That\u2019s not totally true, but close enough! AMD\u2019s senior vice president Jack Huynh revealed AMD\u2019s new direction in September, explaining that he\u2019d rather chase 80 percent of the lower-cost, mainstream market than the top 20 percent, or the premium offerings.\n\nThiago Trevisan / IDG\n\nSince we don\u2019t know what AMD has up its sleeve for 2025, we can\u2019t be sure if AMD will hold to this price/performance strategy or not. Keep in mind, though, that AMD has found a comfortable little niche, with minority positions in CPUs and GPUs, but also enterprise CPUs, graphics, and AI. The profit margins that AMD has for products in the latter three categories help offset the challenges of competing in the PC space.\n\nAMD\u2019s GPU pricing strategy: WIN\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been easy, though, and February\u2019s launch of the rival Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 for $169 was evidence of that. Nvidia is expected to launch consumer versions of its \u201cBlackwell\u201d architecture (the GeForce 5000 family) in 2025, most likely at CES with eye-popping specs and prices. But there\u2019s a risk that it could just drop an update to an older architecture to essentially torpedo AMD\u2019s ambitions.\n\nAMD (and its customers) have been willing to adjust pricing, however, to their credit. AMD\u2019s partner, Sapphire, dropped the price of the Radeon 7900XT card by $200 in February, probably to compete with new \u201cSuper\u201d versions of Nvidia\u2019s cards.\n\nRadeon Link, RIP: FAIL\n\nIn January, AMD ended support for the Radeon Link mobile app, which allowed gamers to stream games from PCs with Radeon graphics cards to phones and tablets running with Android or iOS.\n\namd\n\nAMD\u2019s right in that there are numerous other ways to stream games, including Microsoft\u2019s own Xbox application, as well as portable PCs. Still, its a shame to take a tried-and-true solution and just ditch it wholesale.\n\nAMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3.1: WIN\n\nWhile AMD\u2019s partners should be applauded for making pricing adjustments, there\u2019s a bit of subtext to all of this, too: The hardware doesn\u2019t always determine how a game will play. We\u2019ve known for some time that driver improvements will push frames higher, but so too will some of the most revolutionary technologies in the past few years: graphics upscaling and frame generation. In March, AMD debuted AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3.1 (FSR 3.1), an improved version of its FidelityFX 3.0 technology.\n\nAMD\n\nFSR 3.1 decouples upscaling from frame generation, an interesting tweak. FSR can boost frame rates by up to three times in games like Ghost of Tsushima: Director\u2019s Cut. That\u2019s substantial. But AMD also promised FSR would be coming to 40 games when FSR 3.1 was announced in March. It\u2019s now December, and AMD lists 36 (between FSR2 and FSR3) on its games page.\n\nAMD Fluid Motion Frames 2.0: WIN\n\nWhile FSR began as an upscaling technology, AMD\u2019s Fluid Motion Frames was always a way to smooth frame rates by interjecting new (some call these \u201cfake\u201d frames) in between the frames the game asks for. While this technically boosts frame rates, its goal is to actually provide smoother gameplay. AMD began 2024 by basically making FMF 1.0 available to all DirectX games; in October, AMD debuted FMF 2.0 as well.\n\nThe problem within frame generation is that those extra frames introduce latency, another thing that gamers tend to avoid. FMF 2.0 is specifically designed to reduce latency by using AI (of course). Fortunately, it\u2019s applicable to both AMD\u2019s integrated graphics as well as RX 6000- and RX 7000-series GPUs.\n\nAMD\u2019s handheld dominance: WIN\n\nI don\u2019t own a handheld gaming PC, and my wife would probably start screaming at me if I brought it up, using words like \u201cmortgage\u201d and \u201cvacation money\u201d and \u201cthe price of eggs.\u201d Anyway, if you are in the market for a handheld PC, it\u2019s a virtual lock that an AMD processor is inside.\n\nPCWelt/Asus/Amazon\n\n2024 may have been an off year for consoles \u2014 which use AMD chips, too, by the way. But the resurgence of portable PCs has meant renewed interest in AMD\u2019s Z-series processors: The Z1 and the Z1 Extreme. (The Z2 may debut at CES.) Basically, it\u2019s news any time a handheld doesn\u2019t use an AMD chip inside.\n\nMicrosoft passes over AMD for Surface: FAIL\n\nThis year, 2024, was the year of the Copilot+ PC and especially Windows on Arm. AMD has always struggled somewhat to attract customers in the mobile space, and this year numerous PC makers signed up to manufacture at least one PC designed around Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite platform.\n\nIn 2019, AMD cracked Microsoft\u2019s Surface Laptop 3 with a custom-designed Ryzen processor, and Microsoft and AMD maintained a fairly steady relationship. But in 2024 Surface sold out wholesale to the Snapdragon, and AMD was left out in the cold. If Qualcomm can keep up its combination of long battery life and decent computing performance, AMD could be pushed aside.\n\nbinary comment Matthew Smith / IDG\n\nAMD\u2019s Copilot+ PC conundrum: WTF\n\nIn March, Microsoft introduced the concept of a Copilot+ PC, complete with an AI-powered CPU to drive Microsoft\u2019s collection of AI apps. Microsoft launched Copilot+ PCs with Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X platform, but promised that a Windows update would bless PCs running on AMD\u2019s Ryzen AI 300 processor and Intel\u2019s Lunar Lake with Copilot+ capabilities, too. But that\u2026didn\u2019t happen. Instead, Microsoft delayed the controversial Recall feature, letting those with Snapdragon-powered PCs test out generative AI features instead.\n\nAlongside Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung, Microsoft is also offering AI laptops with Arm processors. The new Surface devices cost between 1,200 and 2,500 dollars. Foundry\n\nAs for the others? In December, Microsoft pushed the Windows update that allows the AMD and Intel Copilot+ PCs to test out Recall \u2014 and that\u2019s all. If you want to keep the AI hype train going, this is not how you do it, Microsoft. Unfortunately, it\u2019s AMD (and Intel) who were burned.\n\nAMD Ryzen AI 300: WIN\n\nHonestly, the current crop of laptop processors \u2014 Snapdragon X Elite, Intel\u2019s Lunar Lake, and AMD\u2019s Ryzen AI 300 \u2014 may be both the best and most competitive mobile processor generation in history. They\u2019re all excellent in their own way. With over 50 TOPS plus a Radeon 3.5 GPU, the Ryzen AI 300 looks great on paper, and tested at the top of the heap in terms of performance as well. It\u2019s why I argued that AMD should acknowledge the low-power efforts of its competition, but strive for performance instead.\n\nAMD\u2019s new Ryzen AI 300 SoC AMD\n\nThe next test will be in gaming: AMD\u2019s \u201cStrix Halo\u201d versus the Intel Core HX processor. Expect to see a showdown in mobile gaming at CES this January\u2026with possibly an Nvidia \u201cBlackwell\u201d mobile GPU alongside them.\n\nAMD\u2019s market share gains: WIN\n\nAll these wins had to pay off, right? Yep. AMD now seems to consistently record quarter after quarter of strong revenues and profits. AMD\u2019s market share also soared, especially in desktop. There, AMD recorded growth of 10 percentage points in its desktop market share alone.\n\nRyzen 9000: WTF\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen 8000 APUs may have met with a mixed reception, but the launch of the Ryzen 9000 desktop processors at Computex in June was very well-received\u2026even after a bump or two. A promised 40 percent improvement over Intel\u2019s 14th-gen Cores! AMD even confirmed that the AM5 socket (the foundation for the Ryzen 9000) would be supported until 2027, and ditched AI and integrated GPUs on its four new parts. Things were looking great!\n\nWillis Lai / Foundry\n\nBut then it got a little weird. After discovering a \u201cquality issue,\u201d AMD delayed the Ryzen 9000 launch until August. But then AMD cut the Ryzen 9000 prices, lower than its predecessor! But then the actual Ryzen 9000 review was disappointing\u2026but for a reason! But after installing Windows 11\u2019s 2024 Update\u2026performance soared again! And then there was another update, this time to the firmware, that pumped 105W through the chips for even higher performance.\n\nYeah, this probably concluded in \u201cWIN\u201d territory, but after a rocky ride through \u201cWTF land.\u201d\n\nRyzen 9000X3D: WIN\n\nWe conclude with what should be the biggest victory of AMD\u2019s 2024: The Ryzen 9000X3D gaming behemoth. If this chip was AMD\u2019s final exam of 2024, the company showed that it understood the assignment: low power and kick-ass gaming performance. It won our award for the best desktop CPU of 2024, and for good reason: Not only did it obliterate Intel\u2019s best in both games and content creation, it did so while consuming less power, too. What can\u2019t AMD\u2019s V-Cache do?\n\nAMD\n\nIf there was any downside, it\u2019s that the 9800X3D promptly sold out. But just wait, AMD says more are coming.\n\nAnd with that, we conclude one of AMD\u2019s best years ever. Happy holidays to you and yours, and be sure to join us in January for CES, and the next chapter of AMD\u2019s story!",

Of course, the power balance among the best processors shifts, and there\u2019s a seemingly endless number of comparisons to start making between each lineup. This year, however, AMD and Intel barely moved the needle.\n\nThat\u2019s the despite the fact that both companies debuted entirely new architectures, both of which promised to radically change how our PCs work and perform. Those promises just fell flat, particularly at release. We still saw standout releases like the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, but even with so much hardware flying around, there\u2019s been little reason to go out and buy it.\n\nHere\u2019s how we got here.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nAMD played with its food\n\nAMD started the CPU battle this year with its Ryzen 9000 CPUs. The setup was simple. AMD planned to leverage its entirely new Zen 5 architecture to build a world-class desktop and mobile lineup. Instead of staggering its releases, as it has done in the past, AMD kept the desktop and mobile launches close together, flooding the market with Zen 5 options over the course of just a few weeks.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!\n\nThe company described Zen 5 as a \u201cnew foundation\u201d for Ryzen moving forward. It talked about big efficiency improvements with chips like the Ryzen 9 9950X and world-class gaming performance with the eight-core Ryzen 7 9700X. That\u2019s not to mention new architectural features like a 512-bit data path for AVX-512 instructions, which is a big boost to AI workloads and other tasks like PS3 emulation.\n\nBut then the CPUs showed up. AMD provided good gen-on-gen improvements in productivity apps, but it was largely still competitive with Intel\u2019s 14th-gen offerings. The flagship Ryzen 9 9950X, performant as it was, couldn\u2019t manage to beat the Core i9-14900K across apps. It took AMD two years to release a new flagship, and the result was a rather familiar CPU with performance that, in most apps, was just middling.\n\nPC gamers really got the short end of the stick, though. In the vast majority of games, the new crop of Ryzen 9000 CPUs performed identically to their less expensive Ryzen 7000 counterparts. Worse, the last-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D still topped benchmarks, giving PC gamers little reason to invest in AMD\u2019s \u201cnew foundation.\u201d It\u2019s little surprise that AMD\u2019s Zen 5 CPUs saw very little interest from buyers when they released.\n\nAMD eventually revisited the performance on Ryzen 9000 CPUs, offering up to a 17% boost in performance through various updates. The company addressed latency issues on the 12-core and 16-core models, and it introduced a higher-power mode for the six-core and eight-core models. Combined with some key Windows updates, AMD\u2019s Ryzen 9000 lineup ended up in a much better spot.\n\nBut the damage had already been done. Even with better performance, AMD\u2019s Ryzen 9000 lineup just didn\u2019t deliver the performance boost AMD had promised, particularly in games. They became an even more tough sell with chips like the Ryzen 7 7800X3D floating around, which offers performance that\u2019s hard for AMD itself to contend with.\n\nIntel\u2019s struggles never let up\n\nAMD struck first this year, but Intel fell into very similar trappings to Team Red. For Intel, it focused on a radically new architecture for its Lunar Lake laptop CPUs. That new architecture made a lot of strides in laptops, particularly in machines like the Asus Zenbook S 14. But Intel decided to take its architecture focused on efficiency and battery life and apply it to high-performance desktop CPUs with its 15th-gen Arrow Lake offerings.\n\nThat was a mistake, which becomes abundantly clear if you read my Core Ultra 5 245K review. With this architecture, Intel decided to push its efficient (E) cores to the forefront of performance, and reserve its performance (P) cores for workloads that could use an extra boost. This design is very similar to Qualcomm\u2019s approach to chip design, and it does wonders for battery life in laptops.\n\nIt just kind of stinks for high-performance desktops.\n\nWith a desktop, you don\u2019t have to worry about battery life. And more importantly, there\u2019s far less concern for thermals, with flagship CPUs often getting the liquid-cooling treatment for maximum performance. Intel\u2019s highly efficient mobile architecture fell flat on its face in desktops. In the best situations, Arrow Lake CPUs offered middling performance gains. And in the worst situations, they were flat-out worse than older, less expensive options.\n\nThe flagship Core Ultra 9 285K wasn\u2019t a complete disaster, but it definitely wasn\u2019t a strong release. Intel could rarely match the Ryzen 9 9950X from AMD, which as I covered in the last section, was a disappointing CPU in its own right. Gaming was much worse, though. Not only did Intel not provide a significant improvement in gaming performance; in most games, Intel\u2019s 13th-gen and 14th-gen offerings were straight-up faster.\n\nJust like AMD, Intel has put out some updates that supposedly improve performance for Arrow Lake processors. I haven\u2019t tested those updates yet, but similar to the situation AMD found itself in with Zen 5, it\u2019s hard to crawl back from a devastating launch.\n\nTo add fuel to the fire, Intel faced massive instability issues on 14th-gen and 13th-gen CPUs throughout the year, which could completely brick hardware if unaddressed. A complete lack of communication during the months-long problem only led to more speculation on the issues, and certainly didn\u2019t inspire confidence for an entirely new generation of underperforming Intel chips.\n\nA new perspective\n\nThere are a lot of parallels between AMD and Intel this year, but the most important is this: AMD and Intel designed their new architectures for laptops. That\u2019s speculation on my part, but it\u2019s really hard to imagine these architectures were angled toward desktops with their middling performance. And it\u2019s even more difficult to imagine when you consider how impressive Lunar Lake and Zen 5 are in laptops.\n\nConcurrent to the new ranges from AMD and Intel, Microsoft and Qualcomm launched the Copilot+ initiative \u2014 a range of laptops focused on AI features, all-day battery life, and performance that could dethrone the MacBook Pro. AMD and Intel, whose chips had been the driving force behind the loud fan noise, poor battery life, and high heat that Windows laptops came to be known for, needed an answer to new efficient chips like the Snapdragon X Elite.\n\nIntel and AMD don\u2019t just spin up new architectures out of the blue. It\u2019s a years-long process, but clearly the companies knew a major shift in Windows laptops was coming. And Zen 5 and Lunar Lake seem specifically designed to take advantage of that shift.\n\nBy doubling-down on architectures for desktop and mobile, the consequences of focus show up pretty clearly here. There isn\u2019t a massive boost on desktop, and sometimes no boost at all. If you were waiting for an upgrade, Zen 5 and Arrow Lake only served to showcase that last-gen options were the best bet for PC gamers.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that your CPU isn\u2019t the main component driving gaming performance. Your GPU is. However, we still see a steady uplift in gaming performance generation over generation, and that uplift was completely absent this generation. Here\u2019s to hoping the next generation doesn\u2019t continue that trend.",

This is the GZ302EA model that comes with an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 CPU, which is one of the fastest in the lineup apart from the Ryzen AI Max+ Pro 395.\n\nThe APU boasts 16-cores and 32 threads and the Radeon 8060S integrated graphics based on the RDNA 3.5 architecture. More on that later. The processor scored 2928 points in single and 19484 points in multicore tests and, while the scores are decent, it should be noted that the frequency it was operating at was around 3.0 GHz at base while the boost clock was reported at 5.1 GHz.\n\nImage Source: Geekbench 6\n\nThe AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 \"Strix Halo\" APU can attain up to 5.1 GHz as per the previous leaks in Geekbench. Meanwhile, the Pro version can boost noticeably higher than the non-pro edition. Now, if we compare the latest scores to the previous ones, we find that the single-core performance is slightly higher but the multi-core score is slightly lower as well.

While Strix Point's flagship APU Ryzen AI 9 HX 370/375 can feature only up to 12 cores and 24 threads, the flagship Strix Halo chips can feature up to 16 cores and 32 threads.\n\nHowever, the integrated graphics is perhaps one of the biggest upgrades, which now brings 40 Compute Units compared to just 12 on the Strix Point chips. The Radeon 8060S is therefore expected to deliver superior gaming performance to the Radeon 880M and 890M and should compete with the RX 7600 or similar discrete GPUs.\n\nWith such a powerful CPU-iGPU combination, the Strix Halo eliminates the need for discrete GPUs in budget gaming laptops and can offer significantly faster compute performance in CPU-oriented tasks as well. We did see some synthetic benchmarks of the Radeon 8060S, but none of the gaming benchmarks have surfaced online yet. We wait for its launch eagerly, which is supposedly CES 2025, when AMD will reveal more products.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 9 Semiconductor Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other semiconductor stocks that Jim Cramer has boldly predicted.\n\nAs 2024 comes to a close, the semiconductor industry has seen its fair share of fireworks. While firms like Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI GPU stock are the ones that have caught investor attention, not all chip stocks have performed well. Just like the economy, where firms exposed to AI-driven data center spending have performed well, semiconductor stocks that are geared towards AI have also seen their fortunes soar while others haven\u2019t been so lucky.\n\nAs an example, consider the stock price performance of two of the most well-known semiconductor stocks in the world. The first ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks while the second ranks 12th. The first stock is the GPU stock we mentioned above while the second is the world\u2019s largest integrated chip manufacturer. An integrated chip manufacturer, for those out of the loop, is a firm capable of designing and manufacturing its chips. Looking at their share price performance, the first stock has gained 184% year-to-date while the second is down by 57.5% over the same time period.\n\nSo why does their performance lie on the opposite ends of the spectrum? Well, the first company has sustained investor optimism because its products are market leaders in terms of computing AI workloads. Even so, while the shares are up by 184%, they had already gained 173% by mid-October. Since then, the stock has added just 4% as Wall Street is in wait-and-watch mode regarding the demand for AI services among businesses and users and the GPU supply chain of the company.\n\nHowever, while the GPU maker hasn\u2019t impressed in terms of returns in the final quarter, the integrated chip manufacturer has stunned with its fall from grace. From the start of the year to July-end, its shares had lost 36%. While that was bad on its own, the firm\u2019s second-quarter earnings report led to nothing but a bloodbath. It caused a whopping 34.6% share price drop over the next couple of days. So what happened? Well, starting from the financial figures, its Q2 earnings per share of two cents fell way short of consensus analyst estimates of $10 cents. The revenue wasn\u2019t great either, as while the firm earned $12.83 in the second quarter, analysts had expected it to bring in $12.94 billion.\n\nBut an earnings and revenue miss rarely wipes a third of a stock\u2019s value. Along with the dismal financial results, the firm also revealed that not only would it cut 15% of its workforce, but it would also stop paying a dividend in Q4. Naturally, investors weren\u2019t impressed and they weren\u2019t optimistic about the firm\u2019s future trajectory either. Since the earnings, the stock is up by 2.5% though as its CEO\u2019s sudden exit and whispers of a divestiture of the costly chip manufacturing business to ease costs seemed to have piqued investor attention.\n\nThe start of December has also seen another interesting, albeit long-term, development for the semiconductor industry. The semiconductors, or chips, that currently power our computers and phones rely on classical computing which uses bits for computing. Quantum computing, on the other hand, expands the processing power significantly over classical computing by relying on qubits instead. In December, Google revealed its Willow quantum computing chip which it claims is capable of processing a problem that would take a classical supercomputer 10 septillion years in less than five minutes. More importantly, Google claimed to have manufactured the chip itself \u2013 a development that broadens the number of companies capable of manufacturing advanced processors.\n\nThe announcement injected fresh life into quantum computing stocks which have gained as much as 281% since Willow was revealed. This is despite the fact that no semiconductor foundry is capable of manufacturing quantum computing chips at scale. And why would they? After all, the use cases for quantum computers are limited as well, as opposed to the billions of chips used in personal computing applications.\n\nFor his part, Cramer isn\u2019t a fan of quantum computing either. Commenting on the negative share price movements following the Federal Reserve\u2019s well-televised conference earlier this month, he likened the sentiment in quantum computing to a hype bubble. The market won\u2019t recover quickly according to Cramer as \u201crampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing\u201d pushed stocks higher than their fundamentals would justify. Further commenting on the industry, he stated:\n\n\u201cHow are these companies going to, how is D-Wave Quantum by the way, how is that going to quantum? When we don\u2019t even know what quantum is? It\u2019s a nonfungible token, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bold predictions about semiconductor stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out semiconductor stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 107\n\nDate of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 8-21-24\n\nPerformance Since Then: -20.64%\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor designer that designs and sells CPUs, GPUs, custom chips, and other products. It enjoys a unique position in the market courtesy of being able to compete with Intel in the CPU market and NVIDIA in the GPU market. As a result, any firm-specific weakness from either means that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) can eke out market share for itself. Its shares haven\u2019t done well in the fourth quarter primarily due to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\u2019s inability to wrest market share away from NVIDIA and analyst concerns of a slower PC market in 2025. The stock fell by 10.6% in October after the firm\u2019s Q4 guidance of $7 billion missed analyst forecasts of $7.54 billion. Here\u2019s what Cramer said in August:\n\n\u201cI think you can buy more. AMD has been on a steady upward trend this week, and Lisa Su made a great acquisition. Her products, especially for accelerated computing, are terrific. Yes, for AI and generative AI, they are outstanding. Buy more AMD, just as we\u2019ve been doing for the club. \u201cListen, guys, it\u2019s driving me crazy\u2014not everything you hear is consequential. There\u2019s a lot of noise; there are a lot of data points that don\u2019t mean anything. Sometimes, companies just have their consumers\u2019 backs, and that\u2019s where the business goes. The economy is fine, and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\n\nOverall, AMD ranks 4th on our list of semiconductor stocks that Jim Cramer has boldly predicted. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Graphic processing units (GPUs) serve as a key component in the foundation of the world's artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure build-out. Training AI models and running AI inference demands high-speed processing power, and it creates computational workloads that can best be handled using parallel processing. That positions GPUs -- originally developed to speed up the rendering of video game graphics -- as some of the best hardware options for providing the right type of processing power.\n\nTwo companies dominate the GPU market. Nvidia (NVDA -4.05%) is by far the leader in the space. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.92%), meanwhile, is trying to take Nvidia on and gain a meaningful share of the data center market. In 2024, Nvidia's stock has been the clear winner, trading up by about 175% as of this writing. AMD stock, meanwhile, is down by about 15% on the year.\n\nBut which stock is likely to perform better in 2025?\n\nThe GPU market keeps growing\n\nThe outlook for the GPU market continues to look strong. Most large hyperscalers (companies that operate mega-sized data centers) have already indicated that they plan to increase their AI-related capital expenditures in 2025. Demand for cloud computing is soaring due to AI, and all the major cloud computing companies are working to expand their infrastructure to meet that demand.\n\nMeanwhile, GPU clusters are growing larger and larger as big tech companies and well-funded start-ups such as OpenAI and Elon Musk-owned xAI race to develop more sophisticated AI models.\n\nIt is expected that Meta Platforms will use 160,000 GPUs to train its upcoming Llama 4 model -- 10 times as many as it used for Llama 3. The case is similar with xAi's Grok 3 model, which is expected to require 100,000, up from 20,000 used to train Grok 2. Meanwhile, there is talk of companies deploying clusters with as many as 1 million GPUs in the near future.\n\nNvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of these companies' insatiable demand for GPUs, and its revenue has far outpaced AMD's. A big reason for this is that Nvidia long ago developed its free (but proprietary) CUDA software platform, which allows developers to program the GPUs they buy for tasks other than graphics rendering. As such, CUDA became the software platform on which many developers learned to program GPUs, creating a wide moat for the company. In the years since, Nvidia has added developer tools and AI-specific microlibraries through CUDA X, extending its software lead.\n\nToday, AMD has its own GPU software platform, and it makes GPUs that are just as powerful as Nvidia's, if not more so -- at least, on paper. However, testing by independent research and analysis company SemiAnalysis has concluded that AMD's software is holding back the performance of its GPUs. In its report, it called AMD's out-of-the-box experience \"unusable,\" and said that it needed \"multiple teams of AMD engineers\" to help it fix software bugs. In the end, the paper specs for AMD's latest GPU did not match its real-world performance. By contrast, SemiAnalysis described the out-of-the-box performance of Nvidia's H100 and H200 GPUs as \"amazing.\"\n\nThis helps explain why Nvidia generated data center revenue of $30.8 billion last quarter compared to only $3.5 billion for AMD. Notably, though, both showed similar rates of data center revenue growth: Nvidia's rose by 112% and AMD's rose by 122%. Of course, Nvidia was doubling its revenue from a much larger base, which makes its performance all the more impressive.\n\nOne area in which AMD has been able to carve out a niche for itself is AI inference. SemiAnalysis noted that AMD's customers tend to deploy its GPUs in inference, which presents narrow, well-defined use cases. As such, one way AMD could start to gain market share in the coming years is if more of the GPU market shifts from training to inference. AMD's GPUs are cheaper than Nvidia's, so such a shift could potentially benefit it.\n\nValuation and verdict\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, AMD is a modestly cheaper stock, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24 compared to nearly 31 for Nvidia. However, Nvidia has been growing its total revenue more rapidly (94% vs. 18% last quarter) as at AMD, GPUs are just one piece of a larger hardware portfolio.\n\nAt this point, I think AI training will remain important over the next several years as companies continue to try to develop more advanced AI models. As such, I much prefer Nvidia's stock as a holding from here and think investors could still profitably add it to their portfolios in 2025.",

            "content": "Lenovo's Yoga 7 14AHP9 laptop, complete with an AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS APU, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD, is currently on sale for $300 off or $599.99 at Best Buy. This is its lowest-ever price point, but it has been on sale at this price several times in the past year.\n\nThe price point alone is probably compelling for fans of Lenovo's convertible Yoga form factor, which allows the device to be used as a touchscreen tablet, standard laptop, or even a self-standing tablet/screen for pure viewing purposes. However, the Ryzen 7 8840HS is no slouch of an APU, and it can prove to be a competent entry-level gaming performer if you're willing to make the right compromises around its hardware.\n\nLenovo Yoga 7 14AHP9: was $899.99, now $599.99 at Best Buy Lenovo Yoga 7 14AHP9 is a 14-inch, AMD-powered Lenovo Yoga 7 laptop with 16GB of soldered LPDDR5X-6400 RAM and a 1 TB NVMe Gen 4 SSD. The device has Wi-Fi 6E 2x2 AX, Bluetooth 5.3 support, a 1080p webcam, and a fingerprint reader. \"Yoga\" and other convertible laptops are almost always bought for form factor.\n\nThe specific model of the Lenovo Yoga 7 14AHP9 on sale is mostly a maxed-out configuration. The 16GB of DDR5-6400 RAM, 1TB NVMe Gen 4 drive, and a Ryzen 7 8840HS APU with integrated Radeon 780M iGPU all point toward the top end of available configs. Unfortunately, this on-sale model does not have a 500-nit OLED\u2014 instead, this discounted model is shipping with a 400-nit IPS panel. This should still look reasonably good, but existing reviews indicate that the OLED model does at least look considerably better. However, that one is more expensive and (at the time of writing) much more complicated to find actual listings for.\n\nIn any case, the overall computing experience on offer here should be pretty good. The Lenovo Yoga convertible form factor is well-proven at this point and truly ideal for those who want to maximize the portability of their laptop. The Ryzen 7 8840HS has eight Zen 4 CPU cores and 16 threads, running at a maximum boost clock of 5.1 GHz. Add the powerful Radeon 780M iGPU (also featured in last-gen top-end gaming handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally Z1 Extreme edition), and you have a workhorse with more than enough power for most productivity applications.\n\nIf you plan to game on this device, I recommend using resolution scaling or FSR whenever available while playing modern 3D games. The iGPU is more targeted at 720p/800p native rendering than this laptop's full 1920x1200 resolution. Intelligent resolution scaling and reduced graphical settings should also make this a perfectly adequate gaming laptop, so long as you prioritize playability over pretty graphics.",

The one we are talking about is the Navi 48, which powers the upcoming Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT GPUs. Unlike the Navi 44, it will bring hardware encoders, making them ideal for streamers and content creators.\n\nHXL (@9550pro) spotted AMD's RDNA 4 GPUs' added AV1 encoding support on GitHub under GPUOpen Libraries and SDKs. Here, the \"AV1 B-Frame\" support refers to a feature in the AV1 video codec that enhances video compression and quality. With the AV1 codex, the RDNA 4 GPUs, i.e., the Navi 48, can achieve better compression efficiency than H.264 and HEVC, which is important and the standard for modern GPUs.\n\nImage Credits: Github\n\nUnfortunately, this support is supposedly absent on the Navi 44, a budget RDNA 4 die that will power lower-end RX 9000 GPUs. The Navi 44 misses the hardware encoders completely, which makes them unsuitable for content creation and streamers. This is similar to what AMD did with its budget RDNA 2 GPUs, such as the RX 6500 XT and RX 6400. However, the Navi 44 is supposedly powering GPUs that are rumored to cost up to $349. So, removing the hardware encoders doesn't look too consumer-friendly.\n\nNonetheless, we are waiting for the official unveiling, which should happen in around a week. With that, we will also see AMD's top offerings in the RX 9000 lineup, the RX 9070 GPUs. The Radeon RX 9070 XT is supposedly as powerful as the upper-mid-range or high-end NVIDIA RTX 40 series cards like RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4080. Apart from bringing strong gaming performance, the full support for hardware encoding will enable it to increase productivity in various apps where the encoders are needed.\n\nApart from the RX 9000, AMD will also launch FSR 4 and Ryzen 9 9000X3D chips, such as Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, at the same event.",

            "content": "We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other AI stocks Jim Cramer talked about.\n\nAs trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ\u2019s top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market\u2019s 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow\u2019s performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned.\n\nHowever, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street\u2019s AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms\u2019 varying exposures to artificial intelligence.\n\nYet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer\u2019s shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed\u2019s announcement.\n\nCramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed\u2019s announcement. Talking on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed\u2019s decision, the host shared that \u201crampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing\u201d was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. \u201cHow is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don\u2019t even know what quantum is?\u201d wondered Cramer. \u201cIt\u2019s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?\u201d he added.\n\nAs AI continues to shape the winners and losers in the stock market, Cramer also shared tips for trading in 2025 in a recent Mad Money episode. He believes that one key fact that everyone needs to keep in mind when trading is to not get disillusioned by strong gains. According to Cramer, while bulls and bears both \u201cmake money\u201d on the stock market, it\u2019s the pigs that \u201cget slaughtered.\u201d He elaborated further and shared that in his experience he\u2019s \u201cseen moments where stocks went up and up and up so much that people were intoxicated with their gains.\u201d Yet, it\u2019s \u201cprecisely at that point of intoxication that you need to remind yourself that you don\u2019t want to act like a pig,\u201d believes the television show host.\n\nCramer\u2019s second tip for successful investing is to have the fortitude to hold stocks even when the market is tough. He believes that not only is holding through the thick and thin \u2018the hardest part of investing,\u201d but adds that \u201ctaking short-term pains so you can have long-term gains\u201d lies at the heart of the market\u2019s performance \u201cfor a century.\u201d\n\nFinally, one key factor that several people ignore while trading stocks is to hunt for the right entry price. Cramer cautions against buying in bulk. \u201cDo not, under any circumstances, buy your whole position at once,\u201d he stresses and adds that \u201cyou should never sell all at once,\u201d either. Instead, Cramer recommends staging \u201cyour buys, work your orders, try to get the best price over time.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 107\n\nDate of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 08-12-24\n\nPerformance Since Then: -8.43%\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is the only company in the world with a sizable presence in the x86 CPU and GPU markets. In both of these markets, the firm is the second biggest player. Its presence in the CPU industry has helped Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) eke out market share following chip giant Intel\u2019s historic struggles with manufacturing the latest chips. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\u2019s acquisitions over the past couple of years have provided it with a footing in tertiary industries such as FPGAs and AI products. While its AI accelerators are also somewhat popular, sentiment has soured in the year\u2019s second half. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\u2019s shares are down by 9.6% year-to-date; but, Cramer was optimistic in August:\n\n\u201cAMD isn\u2019t nipping at their heels. AMD is dominating. It\u2019s actually taking gobs of market share, and galy 3 is not a factor when it comes to Nvidia\u2019s high-end chips.\u201d\n\nOverall AMD ranks 8th on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Thankfully, it seems that the midrange maverick will have memory aplenty to tackle the demands of today\u2019s games.\n\nRadeon RX 9070 XT will feature 16GB of VRAM according to leaker momomo_us, citing several unannounced Asus models of the graphics card. For now, it seems as though the manufacturer only plans to launch TUF Gaming and Prime versions of the AMD pixel pusher, but ROG variants could show face closer to launch.\n\nTangentially, momomo_us also confirms that GeForce RTX 5080 will arrive with 16GB of VRAM too. The leaker curiously cites a potentially new family of products from Asus dubbed \u2018ROG Astral\u2019. Listings featuring this branding also briefly appeared on the store El Changarro, before the retailer promptly erased any mention of it.\n\nA 16GB buffer puts Radeon RX 9070 XT alongside Radeon RX 7800 XT and the now-discontinued Radeon 7900 GRE in this respect. However, there\u2019s no confirmation as to what standard of video memory the next-gen Navi 44 GPU will have at its disposal, nor what its total bandwidth will be. Nvidia seems all but certain to use GDDR7 on its upcoming GeForce RTX 50 Series but AMD could opt for slower GDDR6 stock in a bid to cut costs.\n\nShould this be the case, I hope AMD has the sense to equip its less-powerful Navi 44 GPU with at least 12GB of memory. Anything less would risk less-than-flattering comparisons to Intel\u2019s Arc B580 and put in the already mired company of the 8GB GeForce RTX 5060.\n\nVRAM capacity has its part to play in manifesting Radeon RX 9070 XT performance but the grunt of its GPU will ultimately determine its value, alongside price. We should learn more about each category come CES 2025, where I expect AMD will formally unveil the graphics card alongside Ryzen 9 9000X3D CPUs.\n\nClub386 will be in Las Vegas for the show, so stay tuned for any and all announcements.

The latest leaks suggest that the wait may be over soon, with both companies tipped to release their respective budget-focused 800-series boards by mid-January.\n\nAccording to a tipster on Chinese forum Board Channels, Intel and AMD will reveal their mid-range and entry-level 800-series motherboards at CES 2025. The official announcements from both companies are expected on January 7, but Intel will reportedly allow customers to pre-order the boards on January 6. The actual launch is slated to happen the following week.\n\nIntel's B860 and H810 motherboards are rumored to go on sale January 13, while AMD's B850 and B840 boards will hit store shelves on January 15. The report adds that motherboard manufacturers like Asus, MSI, and Gigabyte have already prepared multiple new models to enable people to upgrade to the latest platforms without burning a hole in their pockets.\n\nIt is worth noting that AMD already offers multiple affordable AM5 motherboards featuring the X670 and B650 chipsets. All of them support the latest technologies, including DDR5 memory and PCIe Gen5 interface. Intel, on the other hand, does not have any budget LGA 1851 boards on the market, so the upcoming products will be a welcome addition to its portfolio.\n\nLess affordable...

According to a recent leak, the RDNA 4 desktop lineup will include the RX 9070, 9060, 9050, and 9040, alongside the flagship 9070 XT, while the laptop range will feature the 9070M XT, 9070M, and 9070S.

The leaks suggest that the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 will have a Total Board Power (TBP) of around 260W for reference designs, with custom models potentially reaching up to 330W.\n\nThe report also claims that AMD will not be mandating using the new 12VHPWR (12V-2\u00d76) power connector for its RX 9000 series. This differs from Nvidia's approach with its RTX 40 series (and probably the RTX 50 series, too), which adopted the 12VHPWR connector and continues to do so, even after the melting connector issues that plagued the RTX 4090's launch. Instead of the 12VHPWR connector, Benchlife suggests that the Radeon RX 9070 XT might feature three 8-pin power connectors as most RX 7900 series cards do.\n\nHowever, this doesn't necessarily mean we won't see any RX 9000 series cards with the new connector. For example, ASRock demonstrated that it's possible to implement it on AMD's GPUs by launching some RX 7000 series cards with the 12VHPWR connector.\n\nAMD is expected to announce the new GPUs at CES 2025 and launch them in late January.
