            "content": "Scientists at deCODE genetics, a subsidiary of Amgen, reveal today in Nature Genetics associations between rare loss-of-function variants in two genes and bipolar disorder.\n\nREYKJAVIK, Iceland, March 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Bipolar disorder is characterized by extreme mood swings, bouts of mania or hypomania, and episodes of depression. It is a highly heritable and serious condition, that when untreated comes with a high suicide rate. While there are several mood-stabilizing drugs available to treat the disorder, pharmaceutical treatment of bipolar disorder can have difficult side-effects and better treatments are urgently needed.\n\nRare loss-of-function variants in HECTD2 and AKAP11 confer risk of bipolar disorder Kari Stefansson CEO of decode genetics with Thorgeir Thorgeirsson and Vinicius Tragante, authors on the paper.\n\nSignificant progress has occurred over the last 15 years through genome-wide association studies leading to the identification of hundreds of biomarkers, i.e. DNA sequence variants, associated with the risk of psychiatric disease, including bipolar disorder. These biomarkers represent common variations each carrying a small risk, but in confluence, they are beginning to account for a considerable part of the variance in psychiatric traits and disorders. Variants predicted to cause loss of function of genes tend to be rare but hold great promise for informing on the underlying biology.\n\nTo harness the information contained in rare loss-of-function (LOF) variants, the scientists performed a variant burden analysis for bipolar disorder using gene-based aggregation of LOF variants in whole genome sequencing data from Iceland and the UK Biobank and using data from the Bipolar Exomes study (BipEx, www.bipex.broadinstitute.org/results) for replication and further meta-analysis efforts. The study revealed the association of LOF variants in two genes (HECTD2 and AKAP11) with bipolar disorder. Both associations with bipolar disorder are novel, but AKAP11 has previously been associated with psychosis and schizophrenia.\n\nAKAP11 encodes an anchoring protein, that regulatory subunits of protein kinase A (PKA) bind to, leading to confinement of PKA to specific cellular locations. HECTD2 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, that adds multiple ubiquitin groups to proteins, thereby labeling them for destruction by the proteasome. The products of both AKAP11 and HECTD2 interact with GSK3\u03b2, a protein inhibited by lithium, the most effective mood stabilizer available to treat bipolar disorder. These findings point to the dysfunction of specific cellular pathways in bipolar disorder and cast the gene products of AKAP11 and HECTD2 along with GSK3\u03b2 as promising targets in the search for new treatments for bipolar disorder.\n\nBased in Reykjavik, Iceland, deCODE genetics is a global leader in analyzing and understanding the human genome. Using its unique expertise and population resources, deCODE has discovered genetic risk factors for dozens of common diseases. The purpose of understanding the genetics of disease is to use that information to create new means of diagnosing, treating and preventing disease. deCODE genetics is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amgen.\n\nVideo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2648654/deCODE_genetics_1.mp4\n\nPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2648485/deCODE_genetics_2.jpg\n\nLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1535464/5231224/deCODE_genetics_Amgen_Logo.jpg",

            "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) has changed a lot in recent years. In 2020, Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell International replaced ExxonMobil, Pfizer, and RTX, respectively, and in February 2024, Amazon replaced Walgreens Boots Alliance. Last November, Nvidia booted out Intel, and Sherwin-Williams replaced chemical company Dow.\n\nAdding many tech-focused companies has shifted the balance of the Dow toward growth and away from value and income. Many growth stocks are selling off this year, and investors may be wondering if it was a good idea to revamp the Dow.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nAfter all, the Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) is in a correction -- which is a drawdown of at least 10% from a recent high. Tech-focused Dow stocks -- like Nvidia, Amazon, and Salesforce -- have been selling off, too.\n\nRead on to learn why changes to the Dow help the index better represent the U.S. stock market. I'll also discuss how to view the Dow, compared to the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and Nasdaq.\n\nThe Dow's major makeover\n\nAdding tech-focused companies has altered the composition of the Dow. But so has the outperformance of the financial sector.\n\nThe Dow is a price-weighted index -- meaning that stock prices, rather than market caps, impact the weightings. The stock prices of many financial stocks have gone up as the financial sector was one of the top-performing areas in 2024. But none of these companies have issued stock splits in recent years, giving financials a higher weighting the Dow.\n\nAt over $560 a share, Goldman Sachs is currently the highest-weighted Dow component. Visa is the seventh-highest weighted, American Express is 15th, Travelers Companies is 12th, and JPMorgan Chase is 14th. Combined, these five financial companies make up 23.9% of the index, which is higher than the combined weighting of Microsoft, Salesforce, International Business Machines, Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, and Cisco Systems, which make up 22.2%.\n\nAmazon and Nvidia underwent stock splits before being added to the index. Although Nvidia and Amazon are two of the most valuable companies in the world, they both hold below-average weightings in the Dow.\n\nStill, there's no denying that the Dow is more growth-focused than in years past. The strong performance of financial stocks has stretched their valuations, so the Dow isn't as value-focused, either.\n\nThe Dow's growth focus could make it more volatile\n\nDuring a growth-fueled stock market sell-off, investors would typically expect the Dow to hold up a lot better than the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite. This is because during market sell-offs, investors are more likely to scrutinize valuations and pay less for potential earnings growth, especially if an economic downturn may delay that growth.\n\nFor example, in 2020, the Dow fell less than 10%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite had far worse sell-offs, as you can see below.\n\nHowever, so far this year, the Dow is down, even though sectors typically associated with the Dow (like healthcare, financials, consumer staples, and industrials) are all up in 2025.\n\nThe Dow and the broader economy\n\nWhen scanning the stock market, it's easy to get bogged down by sector labels or classifying a stock as growth, income, or value. The same can happen with indexes. In the past, the Nasdaq was typically seen as the tech-focused growth index, the S&P 500 was the balanced index representing large-cap companies across all sectors, and the Dow was all about value and income.\n\nThat mentality made more sense when the largest U.S.-based companies by market cap were names like General Electric and ExxonMobil. But today, 9 out of the 10 largest U.S.-based companies by market cap are tech-focused. The only one that isn't is Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nTechnology has become a bigger part of the U.S. economy, so it makes sense that the S&P 500 and Dow are becoming more tech-focused. Apple is arguably a modern-day consumer staple company since smartphones are integral to everyday life. Similarly, advertisers are spending more and more on Alphabet's Google search and YouTube or Meta Platforms' Facebook and Instagram, which have taken market share from more traditional outlets.\n\nIn many ways, changes to the Dow merely reflect how the economy is evolving. Nvidia is worth nearly 30 times more than Intel, which is why it's a better fit to represent the semiconductor industry. Amazon represents e-commerce in a way that a brick-and-mortar retailer could not.\n\nIn sum, it's a good idea to continue modernizing the Dow. However, investors need to be aware of index changes so they don't assume the Dow is immune from a growth-stock-led sell-off in the broader market.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "We recently published a list of 13 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) stands against other best healthcare dividend stocks to invest in.\n\nThe US healthcare sector has been at the forefront since the emergence of COVID-19 in 2020, leading to a significant transformation in the industry. The rise of telehealth, virtual consultations, and technological advancements has reshaped the way healthcare services are delivered.\n\nOver the past two decades, the healthcare sector has expanded considerably in relation to the broader economy, as reflected in its growing share of gross domestic product (GDP). According to a report by CNBC, in 2003, healthcare spending made up 15.7% of US GDP, increasing by approximately 1.7 percentage points over the next decade to reach 17.4% in 2013. Today, it is estimated at around 18.4% of GDP, and projections from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services suggest it could rise to 20% by 2030. This steady increase is driven by several factors, including rising demand for healthcare services, advancements in medical technology, and escalating costs. The aging population, particularly as baby boomers retire, has significantly increased the need for medical care, while longer life expectancies have resulted in prolonged healthcare utilization. In addition, the prevalence of chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity has contributed to rising costs. The latest breakthroughs in diagnostics, treatments, and pharmaceuticals\u2014though beneficial\u2014often come with higher expenses, further fueling the sector\u2019s expansion.\n\nThe healthcare industry\u2019s share of the overall economy has expanded, with healthcare companies experiencing faster revenue growth than the broader market in the past five years. During this period, healthcare sector revenues have increased by nearly 61%, compared to just over 38% growth for the broader market as a whole, as reported by CNBC. However, despite this strong revenue performance, the healthcare sector has lagged behind the broader market index, which has been driven by the rapid expansion of the technology sector.\n\nThe healthcare sector faced a turbulent year in 2024. During the first half, investors gravitated toward industries such as technology and communication services, particularly those linked to the growing influence of AI, leaving healthcare stocks trailing behind. However, as the market rally broadened in the second half of the year, healthcare stocks saw some recovery, though certain segments continued to struggle with lingering supply-and-demand imbalances from the pandemic. Beyond these challenges, fundamental issues and policy uncertainties created additional obstacles for parts of the sector. While some regulatory pressures may ease with the incoming administration, others\u2014such as drug pricing concerns\u2014are expected to remain a persistent issue.\n\nOn a positive note, innovation remained robust throughout the year. Biotech companies delivered a series of encouraging clinical updates while growing enthusiasm for new treatments targeting obesity and diabetes contributed to an increase in pharmaceutical firms\u2019 market valuations. A Fidelity report suggested that the healthcare sector is well-positioned for growth in 2025. The industry benefits from strengthening business fundamentals, such as rising cash flows, and encompasses a diverse range of segments that offer a blend of defensive stability and growth potential, making it appealing across different market conditions.\n\nThe healthcare sector is also attracting attention due to its rising dividend payouts. In the third quarter of 2024, total dividends distributed by the global healthcare industry reached $25.7 billion, up from $18.7 billion in Q3 2018, reflecting steady growth in shareholder returns, according to a report by Janus Henderson. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the healthcare sector.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q4 2024 and picked healthcare dividend companies. From that list, we chose healthcare stocks with a strong track record of paying dividends to shareholders, which makes them resilient in the current environment. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the hedge fund investors owning stakes in them, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 72\n\nAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is an American multinational biopharmaceutical company, headquartered in California. The company\u2019s portfolio includes notable treatments such as Tezspire, designed for asthma, and Tepezza, a medication for thyroid eye disease (TED). Tezspire is still undergoing multiple clinical trials, with the potential for expanded indications. Meanwhile, Tepezza remains the only FDA-approved treatment for TED in the US, and Amgen has been working to introduce it in additional markets.\n\nThese two drugs represent just a portion of Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)\u2019s extensive lineup of approved therapies, which positions the company for continued revenue and earnings growth in the coming years. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported $9.1 billion in revenue, marking an 11% increase from the prior year period and surpassing analysts\u2019 expectations by $216.5 million. Product sales also climbed 11%, primarily driven by a 14% increase in volume. Excluding contributions from the Horizon Therapeutics acquisition, sales grew by 10%, with volume expanding by 15%.\n\nAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is also popular among investors because of its strong dividend policy. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $2.38 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.03%, as of March 20. It maintained a steady cash position in the latest quarter. The company generated $4.4 billion in free cash flow, a significant increase from $300 million in the same period the previous year.

In addition, Amgen distributed $1.2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends during the quarter. AMGN is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has raised its payouts for 13 consecutive years.\n\nOverall, AMGN ranks 13th on our list of best healthcare dividend stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of AMGN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than AMGN but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Big Pharma is staring down the barrel of blockbuster patent expirations over the next few years. Merck\u2019s Keytruda, for example, is far and away the best-selling drug on the planet at the moment, clocking in at nearly $30 billion in worldwide sales in 2024 , but will go off patent in 2028, and the industry is now racing to develop biosimilars to get a piece of the enormous PD-1 market share.\n\nLike many companies facing substantial loss of revenue due to loss of exclusivity, Merck is doing what it can to protect Keytruda. The pharma company has filed at least 129 patents since Keytruda\u2019s initial approval in 2014, most of which cover new indications and formulations for the drug, rather than the drug itself. This so-called patent thicket could theoretically push its protection into 2036. The company\u2019s patent dance has prompted investigation from the office of U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., to investigate what she called Merck\u2019s \u201cmonopoly power.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Novo Nordisk is taking a similar tack, building out a complex web of nearly two dozen patents for its blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic, which came in second on last year\u2019s list of top-selling drugs with nearly $17 billion in sales. Novo has a little more breathing room before Ozempic, also marketed as Wegovy for weight loss, faces generic competition. While the first round of core patents are set to expire in 2026, a secondary group will give Novo exclusivity until 2033.\n\nBut if history is any guide, losing exclusivity is not always the death knell of a drug\u2019s profitability. Here, BioSpace explores the sales trajectories of recent blockbuster drugs, before and after they lost their patent, to search out a pattern in the post-exclusivity drug world.\n\nGSK\u2019s Advair\n\nIndication: COPD and asthma\n\nCOPD and asthma Peak Sales: $7.9 billion in 2013\n\n$7.9 billion in 2013 Year of Patent Expiry: 2010\n\nA new generation of asthma and COPD treatment arrived in the 1990s and 2000s, with Boehringer Ingelheim and AstraZeneca scooping up billions of dollars in sales with their inhalers. But GSK\u2019s multi-blockbuster treatment Advair beat them all when it hit the market in 2000, becoming the best-selling asthma drug on the market at its peak.\n\nThe drug lost its patent in 2010 but kept selling steadily for years afterward, hitting peak sales of about \u00a35.27 billion ($7.9 billion) in 2013. GSK\u2019s secret sauce was the specialized Diskus device for administering the drug that had its own separate patent kept generics out until 2019 . Generic drugmakers had to find their own device to match with the medicine, which proved difficult for several years. Because of that, \u201cit\u2019s not going to be a classic generic collapse,\u201d analyst Paul Diggle predicted to Reuters in 2010, but rather a \u201cfairly slow collapsing pack of cards.\u201d The data show exactly that.\n\nAbbVie\u2019s Humira\n\nIndication: Rheumatoid arthritis, psioriasis, ulcerative colitis, other immune-related diseases\n\nRheumatoid arthritis, psioriasis, ulcerative colitis, other immune-related diseases Peak Sales: $21.2 billion in 2022\n\n$21.2 billion in 2022 Year of Patent Expiry: 2022\n\nBefore the earth-shaking numbers that Keytruda put up, AbbVie\u2019s arthritis drug Humira was the reigning champ. After gaining approval in 2008, AbbVie racked up indications in immunology and ran up to peak sales of more than $21 billion in 2022.\n\nThe drug\u2019s original patent was set to expire in 2016, but AbbVie for years fought off biosimilars through a blizzard of patents\u2014totaling more than 250 for a variety of indications beyond its original intended use in arthritis. That extended the drug\u2019s runway to 2022, when it finally lost exclusivity in the U.S. That extra time gave AbbVie the opportunity to set up two successor drugs: Skyrizi, which AbbVie bought from Boeringer Ingelheim in 2016 for $595 million, and Rinvoq, which AbbVie developed in-house.\n\nTogether, Skyrizi and Rinvoq have almost made up for Humira\u2019s dive off the patent cliff, totaling about $19 billion in sales in 2024. AbbVie expects Skyrizi and Rinvoq to hit a combined $27 billion in sales by 2027.\n\nAmgen\u2019s Neulasta\n\nIndication: Immune stimulation in chemotherapy patients\n\nImmune stimulation in chemotherapy patients Peak Sales: $5.8 billion in 2013\n\n$5.8 billion in 2013 Year of Patent Expiry: 2015\n\nAmgen\u2019s blockbuster drug Neulasta\u2014used to stimulate neutrophil growth primarily in patients undergoing chemotherapy\u2014was an annual top 10 best-selling drug for most of its exclusivity period and perennially one of Amgen\u2019s top sellers, going neck-and-neck with Amgen\u2019s arthritis treatment Enbrel.\n\nAmgen didn\u2019t use any special legal maneuvers to prolong the drug\u2019s life after the patent dropped in 2015 (aside from suing potential competitor Coherus, accusing it of poaching Amgen employees to learn about Neulasta). Amgen got lucky that companies jostling to produce their copycats struggled to gain FDA approval. Mylan finally got a biosimilar across the line in 2018, taking a bite out of Amgen\u2019s sales. Sandoz followed in 2019, pushing sales down further.\n\nPfizer\u2019s Lipitor\n\nIndication: High cholesterol\n\nHigh cholesterol Peak Sales: $12.9 billion in 2006\n\n$12.9 billion in 2006 Year of Patent Expiry: 2011\n\nLipitor had an outsized impact on the cardiology space. Its class of drugs\u2014statins \u2014were prescribed to more than 800 million people in 2019, with Lipitor and its generics accounting for nearly 300 million of those. After losing its patent back in 2011, Lipitor fell off a nearly picture-perfect patent cliff when generics immediately cut Pfizer\u2019s sales of the drug by two-thirds in a single year.\n\nPfizer spun off Lipitor and another legacy drug, Viagra, into a separate company, Viatris, in 2020, which has reported steady total sales of the drug of around $400 million per year for the last few years. Pfizer began selling its own Lipitor generic starting in 2011 in partnership with Watson Pharmaceuticals.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s Remicade\n\nIndication: Crohn\u2019s disease, rheumatoid arthritis\n\nCrohn\u2019s disease, rheumatoid arthritis Peak Sales: $6.9 billion in 2016\n\n$6.9 billion in 2016 Year of Patent Expiry: 2016\n\nThe TNFa-blocking antibody Remicade was a blockbuster year after year for J&J\u2019s pharmaceuticals unit Janssen. It\u2019s one of the top five best selling drugs of all time, and the rheumatoid arthritis treatment hit its peak sales in 2016, going head-to-head with Humira in the space.\n\nJ&J spent practically the entire lifetime of the drug fighting tooth and nail to maintain patent exclusivity and protect its margins. In 2018, two lawyers from Brinks Gilson & Lione wrote in the National Law Review that J&J had tried and failed to \u201crewrite history\u201d with the games it played regarding Remicade\u2019s patent.",

            "content": "Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories RDY and partner, Alvotech ALVO, announced the FDA\u2019s acceptance of a regulatory filing, seeking the approval of AVT03, a proposed biosimilar of Amgen\u2019s AMGN Prolia (denosumab) and Xgeva (denosumab), for review.\n\nThe biologic license application (BLA) was submitted under the 351(k) pathway, which is the FDA\u2019s biosimilar application process. AVT03 is a human monoclonal antibody developed by Alvotech.\n\nAmgen's Prolia treats osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fractures, especially when other treatments are ineffective. AMGN\u2019s Xgeva helps prevent fractures, spinal cord compression and the need for bone-related surgery or radiation in patients with multiple myeloma or bone metastases from solid tumors.\n\nBoth drugs play a crucial role in Amgen\u2019s revenue stream. In 2024, Prolia generated $2.89 billion in sales, reflecting an 8% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, Xgeva brought in $1.51 billion, marking 5% growth compared with 2023.\n\nYear to date, Dr. Reddy\u2019s shares have lost 15.5% compared with the industry\u2019s 16.4% decline.\n\nSubject to approval, RDY/ALVO\u2019s AVT03 could significantly enhance patient access to affordable treatment options for osteoporosis and other bone-related conditions. AVT03\u2019s approval would align with broader efforts to expand the availability of high-quality biologic medicines. Given the high cost of branded drugs, a biosimilar alternative could provide substantial financial relief to patients and healthcare systems.\n\nAdditionally, with osteoporosis affecting millions across the United States, the introduction of AVT03 could improve treatment accessibility for a large patient population in need of effective bone health therapies.\n\nRDY\u2019s Ongoing Partnership With Alvotech for AVT03\n\nDr. Reddy\u2019s and Alvotech signed a license and supply agreement for AVT03 in 2024, outlining their respective roles in bringing the biosimilar to market. Per the agreement, Alvotech is responsible for the development and manufacturing of AVT03, while Dr. Reddy\u2019s is tasked with its registration and commercialization in key markets, including the United States.\n\nYear to date, Alvotech shares have lost 14.3% against the industry\u2019s 7.4% growth.\n\nContingent upon the FDA\u2019s approval, AVT03 is expected to be available in two formulations, a single-dose prefilled syringe containing 60 mg in a 1 mL solution and a single-dose vial with 120 mg/1.7 mL (70 mg/mL) solution. RDY and ALVO have clarified that AVT03 is an investigational product that has not been approved by any regulatory authority. Its biosimilarity has also not been established or claimed.\n\nRDY & ALVO\u2019s Zacks Rank and Stock to Consider\n\nDr. Reddy\u2019s and Alvotech carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each at present.\n\nA better-ranked stock from the sector is Gilead Sciences GILD, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIn the past 30 days, Gilead Sciences\u2019 earnings estimate for 2025 has improved from $7.80 to $7.87 per share.

            "content": "The Fed has lowered the funds rate by one full point since September. The present market pricing indicates that there will only be one or two additional declines in 2025, according to CNBC. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members voted to lower the central bank\u2019s benchmark borrowing rate to the 4.25%\u20134.5% target range, according to a January 8 CNBC report. But they also trimmed their projections for anticipated rate cuts in 2025, assuming quarter-point increases, from four to two.\n\nLikewise, Goldman Sachs clarified biotech as a frequently disregarded area of the investment world. John Flood, Head of Americas Equities Sales Trading at Goldman, wrote in a letter to clients that biotech equities offered an unnoticed opportunity for investors hoping to profit from the Fed\u2019s recent rate decreases. Because biotech equities are sensitive to interest rate changes and frequently depend on anticipated future revenues, they are particularly impacted. The cost of capital has a significant effect on these equities as well. These equities have substantial upside potential and, should clinical studies be successful, offer an \u201coption-like structure,\u201d even though they are now quite unprofitable. Because of this, they are particularly sensitive to shifts in interest rates.\n\nNonetheless, there have been effects on businesses that specifically support the pharmaceutical sector, including contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), research and development tools providers, and contract research organizations (CROs). Similar patterns have been noted for businesses that produce production tools for the biotech and pharmaceutical sectors. Although there have been ups and downs in these sectors over the last two years, the patterns are now beginning to stabilize. According to Hueffer, there is a lot of potential in the sector right now.\n\nAlthough biotech stocks had a \u201cchallenging\u201d year in 2024, JPMorgan believes that some of the industry\u2019s companies could see significant growth in the months to come. Senior partner and principal of investments at Novo Holdings, Johan Hueffer, spoke on CNBC on November 28 about his macro outlook for life sciences investments. He claimed that in the past few years, biotechs have had trouble raising funding. Over the past quarter or two, though, that tendency has begun to improve.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Biotech Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) stands against other best biotech stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFlood\u2019s report also emphasized how the biotech sector has recently demonstrated better fundamentals, which have been ascribed to superior clinical outcomes and a more favorable regulatory environment. Goldman\u2019s data shows that hedge funds continue to underinvest in biotechnology despite these tailwinds. Over the previous year, the industry\u2019s hedge fund\u2019s long/short positioning placed it in the 13th percentile. In addition, for the previous five years, it was in the fourth percentile.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our methodology, we selected biotech stocks from the Insider Monkey billionaire database, as of Q4 2024, focusing on those with the highest number of billionaire holdings. We then ranked these stocks based on the number of billionaire investors. In cases where multiple stocks had the same number of billionaire holders, we used the dollar value of billionaire holdings as a tiebreaker, placing stocks with lower dollar values first in ascending order.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Amgen Inc. (AMGN) a Best Biotech Stock According to Billionaires?\n\nA pharmacist filling a prescription for a complex drug developed by the company.\n\nAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)\n\nNumber of Billionaires: 14\n\nDollar Value of Billionaire Holdings: $1,412,039,283\n\nAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets human therapeutics. It provides patients with complicated tumors with innovative treatments, particularly in regions where there are a lot of unmet needs. The corporation had 14 medications at the end of fiscal Q4 2024, each of which had an annualization of over $1 billion. Over the course of the decade, a number of them are anticipated to be important growth drivers for the business.\n\nAdditionally, Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) has a robust rare illness portfolio that is anticipated to grow in 2025 with the possible international regulatory approval of TEPEZZA, the first and only FDA-approved medication for the treatment of Thyroid Eye disease (TED). As one of the best biotech stocks in the industry, it is anticipated that the company\u2019s rare disease business will continue to grow as additional indications for UPLIZNA, which treats neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), are introduced.\n\nEVENITY, which targets osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, and Repatha, which addresses heart disease and cholesterol, are two medications that consistently provide the company with robust growth. The product Repatha has grown to be worth billions of dollars. Its rise is being further fueled by heart disease, the world\u2019s leading cause of mortality. With the anticipated five-year payoff from its October 2023 acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, analysts are optimistic about the stock.\n\nPGIM Jennison Health Sciences Fund stated the following regarding Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a large-cap global biotech company with a diverse portfolio of marketed and pipeline products. Amgen\u2019s discovery pipeline has led the company to broaden its focus from oncology, immunology, and renal disease to include musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and neurologic conditions. In addition, Amgen has turned its expertise in antibody manufacturing into a leading position in the development of biosimilars of competitor drugs. Most recently, Amgen shares advanced in 2Q following its announcement that its novel injectable GLP-1 agonist / GIPR antagonist, MariTide, for obesity, showed promising interim Phase 2 data and has shown enough promise to warrant advancement into pivotal trials as soon as late 2024. While Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk will remain the market leaders in the diabetes/obesity space, we think there is room for Amgen to carve out a meaningful share of the market with its antibody-peptide conjugate approach that could enable monthly or better dosing for MariTide.\u201d\n\nOverall, AMGN ranks 5th among the 15 best biotech stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of AMGN, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMGN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure.

            "content": "A U.S. federal appeals court on Friday handed Regeneron another legal loss in its patent fight against Amgen over the latter\u2019s biosimilar to Regeneron\u2019s blockbuster eye injection Eylea.\n\nThe ruling, though expected, could still be a \u201cheadwind that could be difficult to overcome\u201d for Regeneron, BMO Capital Markets analysts wrote to investors on Friday afternoon. \u201cThis decision adds incremental risk to the Eylea story,\u201d which is already running into other difficulties.\n\nRegeneron sued in January 2024 , claiming that by developing and marketing its VEGF blocker Pavblu, Amgen was violating more than 30 Eylea patents. Regeneron at the time asked the court to permanently block Amgen from commercializing \u201cany current or future versions of a product that infringes, or the use or manufacturing of which infringes\u201d the Eylea patents in the suit.\n\nA West Virginia court in September 2024 ruled against Regeneron, though the order was issued and remains under seal .\n\nWriting for the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Judge Alan David Lourie affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling, noting that Regeneron had failed to sufficiently make its case that Pavblu\u2019s specific formulation clearly violates Eylea\u2019s patents.\n\n\u201cThere is at least a substantial question of noninfringement,\u201d Lourie wrote of Amgen\u2019s Pavblu, noting a distinct difference in its formulation to Eylea. \u201cRegeneron has therefore not established a likelihood of success on the merits of its infringement allegations.\u201d\n\nAs noted by BMO, it has not been smooth sailing of late for Eylea.\n\nAs per Regeneron\u2019s full-year business report last month, for instance, sales of the therapy dipped 11% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, capping off a year of disappointing sales and mounting competition from other biosimilars . Hoping to shore up revenues for the franchise, Regeneron is developing a high-dose formulation of Eylea, though its rollout has been rough. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the high-dose injection made $305 million, missing the analyst expectation of $336 million.\n\nStill, BMO appears to be optimistic about Regeneron overall, pointing to its \u201ccatalyst-filled 2025.\u201d Foremost of these is the launch of its prefilled syringes for high-dose Eylea by midyear. Additionally, the BMO analysts pointed to readouts for the biologic itepekimab in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and for the LAG-3 therapy fianlimab in non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma.",

            "content": "Amgen (AMGN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this world's largest biotech drugmaker have returned +7.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -7.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, which Amgen falls in, has gained 1.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAmgen is expected to post earnings of $4.18 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.63 points to a change of +4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.34 indicates a change of +3.4% from what Amgen is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amgen.",

Among these patients 72.3% of those receiving Uplizna had at least a three point improvement in the MG-ADL score, compared to 45.2% in placebo.\n\nUp to 100,000 people in the US are affected by myasthenia gravis, with gMG accounting for approximately 85% of all cases. The disease impairs neuromuscular communication and can cause muscle weakness, trouble breathing, difficulty swallowing and impaired speech and vision.\n\nUplizna is a humanised monoclonal antibody that works by reducing the number of B cells, which are central to the pathogenesis of gMG. The drug already holds approvals to treat certain adults with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, a rare autoimmune disease that attacks the optic nerve, spinal cord, brain and brainstem, and is under priority review in the US for immunoglobulin G4-related disease.\n\nRegulatory filing activities for Uplizna in gMG are underway, with submissions expected to be complete in the first half of 2025, according to Amgen.\n\nJay Bradner, executive vice president of research and development at Amgen, said: \u201cThe 52-week MINT trial results highlight the potential for a new standard of care in gMG, offering durable symptom relief with a simplified treatment regimen.\n\n\u201cThese findings reinforce Uplizna\u2019s ability to provide sustained symptom relief with just two doses per year \u2013 an important advancement for patients living with gMG\u2026\u201d",

            "content": "Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger has maintained their neutral stance on AMGN stock, giving a Hold rating on March 10.\n\nDavid Risinger has given his Hold rating due to a combination of factors related to Amgen\u2019s recent trial results and market position. The company has been conducting multiple Phase 3 trials in its ROCKET program for atopic dermatitis, with mixed results. The ROCKET-HORIZON trial showed underwhelming efficacy compared to placebo, while the ROCKET-IGNITE trial demonstrated more promising results with a significant improvement in patient outcomes at the same dosage level.\n\nDespite the positive data from the ROCKET-IGNITE trial, there are concerns about the variability in trial results and the competitive landscape, as other treatments like Dupixent have shown comparable efficacy. Additionally, safety concerns such as pyrexia and chills, although primarily occurring after the first dose, may impact the drug\u2019s overall appeal. Given these factors, Risinger maintains a cautious outlook, resulting in a Hold rating for Amgen\u2019s stock.\n\nIn another report released on March 10, Morgan Stanley also maintained a Hold rating on the stock with a $328.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

Despite drug development advances in the past decade, patient survey data suggest that moderate-to-severe Psoriasis Vulgaris is being undertreated.\n\nFor further information on the market impact by therapies, download the Psoriasis Vulgaris sample @ Psoriasis Vulgaris Therapeutic Scenario\n\nPsoriasis Vulgaris Overview\n\nPsoriasis vulgaris, or plaque psoriasis, is a chronic autoimmune skin disorder characterized by red, scaly, and inflamed plaques that commonly appear on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. It occurs when the immune system mistakenly triggers rapid skin cell turnover, causing an excessive buildup of skin cells.\n\nThe exact cause remains unknown, but genetics, immune dysfunction, and environmental factors play key roles. Psoriasis vulgaris Triggers include stress, infections, medications (e.g., beta-blockers, NSAIDs), smoking, alcohol, and cold weather.\n\nCommon Psoriasis vulgaris symptoms include itching, burning, and skin cracking, which can significantly impact quality of life. Some patients also develop psoriatic arthritis, causing joint pain and stiffness.\n\nPsoriasis vulgaris Treatment options range from topical therapies (steroids, vitamin D analogs), phototherapy, systemic medications (methotrexate, cyclosporine), and biologic drugs targeting inflammatory pathways like TNF-\u03b1, IL-17, and IL-23 inhibitors.\n\nWhile no cure exists, lifestyle modifications, such as moisturizing, stress management, and avoiding triggers, help manage symptoms. Early diagnosis and personalized treatment are crucial for minimizing flares and improving skin health.\n\nFor severe cases, biologics have revolutionized treatment, offering long-term control and better patient outcomes. Regular follow-ups with dermatologists and rheumatologists ensure effective disease management.\n\nPsoriasis Vulgaris Epidemiology Segmentation\n\nAs per the assessment of DelveInsight, Psoriasis is the most common inflammatory disease in the United States, affecting as many as 8 million Americans and this number is expected to increase during the study period.\n\nAs per DelveInsight's estimates, the total diagnosed prevalent cases of Psoriasis Vulgaris in the US are estimated to be more than 6 million in 2021, the highest among the 7MM and are predicted to increase during the study period (2019-2032).\n\nIt is observed that about 80-90% of people living with psoriasis experience Psoriasis Vulgaris and approximately 20% of people suffering from Psoriasis have moderate-to-severe Psoriasis Vulgaris.\n\nThe Psoriasis Vulgaris Market report offers epidemiological analysis for the study period 2019-2032 in the 7MM segmented into\n\nTotal Prevalent Cases of Psoriasis Vulgaris\n\nGender-specific Prevalent Cases of Psoriasis Vulgaris\n\nAge-specific Cases of Psoriasis Vulgaris\n\nSeverity-specific Prevalence of Psoriasis Vulgaris\n\nKeen to learn how Psoriasis Vulgaris Epidemiological Trends are going to appear in 2032 for the 7 MM, Download @ Psoriasis Vulgaris Prevalence\n\nPsoriasis Vulgaris Market Outlook\n\nAlthough Psoriasis Vulgaris cannot be permanently cured, therapeutic interventions for localized Psoriasis Vulgaris should begin with patient education and the use of topical corticosteroids with or without coal tar or calcipotriene. Thereafter, anthralin or tazarotene, alone or in combination with steroids, can be used following first-line treatment failure or subsequent loss of response to first-line therapy. Alternatively, if control is difficult to achieve or disease is widespread, phototherapy, with and without drugs such as psoralen or retinoids, may be required.\n\nThere are many FDA-approved Psoriasis Vulgaris treatment therapies available in the market. Some of these include Skyrizi produced by AbbVie which was approved by the FDA in April 2019 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Ilumya is manufactured by Sun Pharma (also known by its generic name tildrakizumab-asmn), it was FDA approved in March 2018 for moderate-to-severe Psoriasis Vulgaris treatment in adults. Then, Johnson & Johnson's Psoriasis Vulgaris treatment drug namely Tremfya (also known by its generic name guselkumab) was FDA approved in July 2017. Other FDA-approved and currently marketed Psoriasis Vulgaris treatment drugs include Cimzia by UCB, Inc., Taltz (ixekizumab) by Eli Lilly and Company, and Cosentyx (secukinumab) by Novartis Pharmaceuticals, and Otezla (apremilast) from Amgen.\n\nThe dynamics of the Psoriasis Vulgaris market are anticipated to change in the coming years owing to the improvement in the research and development activities for efficient treatment options to be available in the market. It includes several Psoriasis Vulgaris pipeline therapies such as DMB-3115, Deucravacitinib, BAT2306, and others under investigation by key Psoriasis Vulgaris market players such as Meiji Seika Pharma, Dermavant Sciences, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Bio-Thera Solutions, Amgen, Arcutis Biotherapeutics, UCB Pharma, and many others.\n\nDiscover more about therapy set to grab substantial Psoriasis Vulgaris market share @ Psoriasis Vulgaris Treatment Market\n\nPsoriasis Vulgaris Market Dynamics\n\nDelveInsight's analysts estimate that the Psoriasis Vulgaris market is poised to show significant growth in the coming years, mainly attributed to increasing cases, recent drug approvals, and the anticipated launch of novel therapies during the forecast period.\n\nPsoriasis Vulgaris Market Driver\n\nAlthough topical agents help in providing symptomatic relief, they neither mitigate disease progression nor cure the disease.

            "content": "Amgen\u2019s Blincyto (ingredient: blinatumomab) has significantly expanded its role in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with approval for use as consolidation therapy.\n\nConsolidation therapy eliminates leukemia cells after induction therapy for remission.\n\nThis marks a shift in the treatment paradigm, potentially reducing the need for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in certain patients.\n\nOn Feb. 14, Korea\u2019s Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) approved Blincyto as a consolidation therapy for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) precursor B-cell ALL. The expansion builds upon its previous approvals for relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL in 2015 and minimal residual disease (MRD)-positive B-cell precursor ALL in 2020.\n\nThe new approval allows adult and pediatric Ph- precursor B-cell ALL patients to receive up to four cycles of Blincyto consolidation therapy. This represents a significant advancement, as previously, consolidation therapy options were limited to chemotherapy and HSCT.\n\nAmgen held a press conference on Wednesday on the expanded indication of Blincyto for consolidation therapy in precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and highlighted its future role.\n\nTraditionally, ALL treatment consists of three phases -- induction therapy to achieve remission, consolidation therapy to eliminate residual leukemia cells, and maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. For many ALL patients, HSCT has been a critical component of consolidation therapy. However, HSCT is associated with severe complications, including graft-versus-host disease, and is not a viable option for all patients due to donor availability or pre-existing conditions.\n\nProfessor Yoon Jae-ho at Seoul St. Mary\u2019s Hospital explains the significance of Blincyto\u2019s expansion in treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia at Josun Palace Seoul on Wednesday. (Credit: Amgen Korea)\n\n\u201cUntil now, first-line treatment for precursor B-cell ALL relied primarily on chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation,\u201d Professor Yoon Jae-ho of the Department of Hematology at Seoul St. Mary\u2019s Hospital said. \u201cThe approval of Blincyto provides a new treatment option that reduces relapse risk and improves survival.\u201d\n\nBlincyto\u2019s approval was based on strong clinical evidence, including results from the E1910 trial.\n\nThis study examined MRD-negative adult precursor B-cell ALL patients receiving either Blincyto plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone as consolidation therapy. Among 112 patients treated with Blincyto and chemotherapy, the three-year overall survival (OS) rate was 85 percent, compared to 68 percent in the chemotherapy-only group. Additionally, the three-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rate was 80 percent in the Blincyto group versus 64 percent in the chemotherapy-only group.\n\n\u201cThese findings suggest that Blincyto not only improves survival outcomes but could also reduce the reliance on HSCT in some patients,\u201d Yoon emphasized.\n\nDuring the conference, a pediatric oncologist also expressed an optimistic view about Blincyto\u2019s role in childhood ALL.\n\nProfessor Kim Hye-ry of the Department of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology at Asan Medical Center speaks at the conference. (Credit: Amgen Korea)\n\nProfessor Kim Hye-ry of the Department of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology at Asan Medical Center highlighted findings from the AALL1731 study, which involved 1,140 pediatric precursor B-cell ALL patients with standard or high relapse risk.\n\nThe study found that the three-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 96 percent in the Blincyto-chemotherapy group, significantly higher than the 87.9 percent observed in the chemotherapy-only group.\n\n\u201cFor over two decades, pediatric ALL treatment has relied solely on chemotherapy. The introduction of Blincyto as a consolidation therapy offers a new approach that brings children closer to a cure,\u201d Kim said.\n\nAdditionally, the AALL1331 trial showed that among pediatric ALL patients aged 1\u201330, those receiving Blincyto had a four-year DFS rate of 61.2 percent compared to 49.5 percent in the chemotherapy group. Though statistical significance was not reached, the trend suggests meaningful clinical benefits.\n\n\u201cPediatric patients generally tolerate treatment well and have higher remission rates than adults,\u201d Kim said. \u201cBlincyto has demonstrated its ability to increase survival rates and improve transplant eligibility by helping more patients achieve complete remission.\u201d\n\nKim further emphasized the need for reimbursement for Blincyto in pediatric ALL cases, referencing the AALL1731 study as a basis for this request.\n\n\u201cBoth international and Korean medical societies apply the same treatment protocols for all pediatric ALL patients,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is crucial that reimbursement policies reflect this and allow for rapid access to Blincyto for both MRD-positive and MRD-negative patients upon diagnosis.\u201d",

            "content": "Why Multiple Myeloma Awareness Matters\n\nImagine feeling exhausted for months, your bones aching, infections coming one after another\u2014only to be told you have an incurable blood cancer. That\u2019s the reality for thousands diagnosed each year with multiple myeloma, a complex and often relentless disease affecting plasma cells, a type of white blood cell found in the bone marrow. Despite advancements in treatment, multiple myeloma remains challenging to manage, as many patients experience disease relapse or develop resistance to therapy.1,2 Even more troubling, racial and socioeconomic disparities mean that some communities face additional barriers to diagnosis and treatment.\n\nThis Myeloma Action Month, we\u2019re spotlighting the progress made\u2014and the work still to be done. We spoke with Joseph Mikhael, MD, MEd, FRCPC, FACP, FASCO, Chief Medical Officer of the International Myeloma Foundation (IMF) to gather his insights on treatment advances, access to equitable care and how individuals can make a difference in the myeloma community. Let\u2019s see what he had to say:\n\nUnderstanding Multiple Myeloma\n\nCan you explain what multiple myeloma is?\n\nIn simplest terms, multiple myeloma is a blood cancer that affects a person\u2019s plasma cells, a type of white blood cell. Plasma cells produce antibodies (immunoglobulins) to fight off infections. When plasma cells become malignant\u2014meaning they become cancerous and start growing uncontrollably, they can become myeloma cells.\n\nMultiple myeloma can affect so many parts of a person\u2019s body, and patients with myeloma are at higher risk of infections\u2014partly because they have a reduced number of normal plasma cells to make good antibodies, but also because the other immune cells produced in the marrow, like white blood cells, may be crowded out by the myeloma cells.\n\nSo, for a multiple myeloma patient, we are concerned with how the disease affects their bones, their kidneys, their blood and their immune system.\n\nAddressing Disparities in Myeloma Care\n\nWhat are some of the most significant disparities in accessing equitable care?\n\nIn the U.S., African Americans are about 14% of the country's population, but they constitute about 20% of all myeloma patients. This is because individuals of African descent have twice the risk of developing myeloma. Furthermore, real-world survival in Black African American and Latino American patients is significantly shorter than in White patients. There are many drivers of that disparity, including the social determinants of health, the healthcare system, delayed diagnosis and reduced access to therapies.\n\nThe diagnosis of myeloma in most patients is delayed due to its vague symptom onset, but it is even longer in African American and Latino American patients. Some of this may be due to access to primary care and confounding conditions like diabetes. Advancements in myeloma therapies over the last several years have expanded treatment options, yet access to these key treatments remains disparate.\n\nHow is the IMF\u2019s M-Power program tackling these challenges?\n\nThe IMF\u2019s M-Power\u00ae Initiative brings education and advocacy directly to underserved communities.\n\nM-Power hosts in-person workshops that educate participants about myeloma and empower them with knowledge. The workshops are conducted in optimal locations to reach the Black and African American community, including at churches and community centers.\n\nThe M-Power Initiative also continues to partner with W. Montague Cobb/NMA Health Institute\u2019s Cobb Scholar Program. Together, we have developed a mentoring program for underrepresented medical school students. Selected students, many from Historically Black Colleges or Universities (HBCUs), are paired with myeloma experts dedicated to health equity and they collaborate on projects related to health disparities in myeloma.\n\nAs we look forward, M-Power will widen its scope to Hispanic/Latin Americans in the U.S. and focus on the three facets - community engagement, primary care education and myeloma care enhancement.\n\nA Rapidly Evolving Treatment Landscape\n\nHow has the multiple myeloma treatment landscape evolved over the years?\n\nMultiple myeloma treatment has evolved rapidly in recent years, bringing new hope to patients and their families. From more powerful frontline therapies to cutting-edge relapse treatments and innovative disease monitoring, these breakthroughs are reshaping the treatment landscape.\n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients now have access to advanced combinations that achieve high response rates, leading to deeper and more sustained remissions. Patients experiencing relapse currently have access to standard of care triplet therapies that are widely available. Additionally, cutting-edge immune-based therapies, including cell therapies and bispecific antibodies, are being introduced earlier in treatment, potentially transforming disease management.\n\nWith more effective frontline treatments, earlier use of advanced relapse therapies, and smarter disease monitoring, myeloma care is improving at an unprecedented pace. These innovations not only provide the potential to extend survival but also the potential to enhance quality of life\u2014offering patients more time and hope than ever before.\n\nPowering Research & Innovation\n\nHow does the IMF contribute to advancing research and new treatment options?\n\nThe IMF is home to the International Myeloma Working group (IMWG)\u2014a network of over 350 experts who convene and facilitate collaboration and research across the globe.\n\nIn addition, the IMF drives progress in multiple myeloma research (found on myeloma.org) and treatment by funding groundbreaking studies through our Black Swan Research Initiative\u00ae (BSRI), leveraging advanced data analytics and developing innovative patient support tools. Through BSRI projects, the IMF advances research that leads to more personalized and effective treatment options.\n\nBy prioritizing real-world evidence and collaborating with organizations such as ZS Associates, LatentView Analytics and Amazon Web Services, the IMF helps accelerate clinical breakthroughs that directly benefit patients.\n\nThrough commitment to research, technology and patient advocacy, the IMF continues to drive transformative change in multiple myeloma care.\n\nWhat role do partnerships play in advancing myeloma care?\n\nPartnerships with the scientific and biopharma communities allow the IMF to continue its vital research initiatives, educational resources, support services and advocacy efforts for the myeloma community worldwide. Their partnerships provide critical seed funding to accelerate the path to potentially finding a cure. This funding can expedite the discovery of innovative treatments and expand IMF programming to support those affected by this incurable disease.\n\nSupporting Patients & Caregivers\n\nHow does the IMF support patients, caregivers and HCPs throughout the myeloma journey?\n\nThe IMF\u2019s robust website (myeloma.org) is the resource that aggregates the organization\u2019s many services in the areas of research, education, support and advocacy.\n\nBeyond digital tools, the IMF brings people together through in-person and virtual events. From one-hour webinars to our Patient & Family Seminar program, we connect patients and caregivers with the multiple myeloma community. We also offer local and virtual support groups, ensuring no one has to face myeloma alone.\n\nFor those who prefer printed materials, the IMF provides hundreds of free publications, available globally in 21 languages and can be easily accessed as downloadable PDFs or order by mail.\n\nWhat advice do you have for patients with a new diagnosis or relapse of MM?\n\nFor patients who may feel overwhelmed, we want to remind them that they are not alone - we are here to help support them every step of the way.\n\nWe encourage patients to explore the IMF website (myeloma.org) and find resources tailored to their needs. They may prefer:\n\nEducational materials to read that their own pace.\n\nSpeaking to an IMF coordinator through IMF InfoLine at:\n\n800-452-2873 (U.S./Canada)\n\n\n\n1-818-487-7455 (Worldwide)\n\n\n\nEmail: infoline@myeloma.org\n\nJoining a local or virtual support group to connect with others, when ready.\n\nNo matter what the patient\u2019s decisions are, the greatest reminder here is that living with a disease is a marathon, not a sprint. Don\u2019t isolate and try to take things one step at a time. Avoid overloading yourself with information - every patient\u2019s experience of the disease will be different along their treatment journey. The IMF is here to help guide you with trusted resources and supportive community.\n\nWhat are some key resources the IMF provides for education, treatment, navigation and emotional support?\n\nThe IMF offers a variety of resources to support patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals, including:\n\nA comprehensive website with educational materials and tools.\n\nOver 100 free publications covering multiple myeloma topics.\n\nVirtual and in-person events to connect patients with the community.\n\nSupport groups for patients and caregivers.\n\nFor a full list of available resources, visit myeloma.org.\n\nTaking Actions: How You Can Help This Myeloma Action Month\n\nHow can individuals and organizations support the IMF and help amplify awareness?\n\nThis year we\u2019re celebrating progress, resilience and hope through the #MyelomaMilestone campaign, which focuses on empowering individuals to share their personal milestones in the fight against multiple myeloma. Whether it\u2019s a significant treatment breakthrough, overcoming a tough challenge, seeing your grandchildren graduate, traveling to a long-awaited destination, learning a new skill, or simply enjoying a precious moment with loved ones\u2014every milestone, big or small, is worth celebrating.\n\nHere are a few ways to get involved:\n\nVisit myelomaactionmonth.org to learn more\n\nShare social graphics from our social media toolkit (located under \u201ctake action\u201d drop down menu)\n\n\n\nDownload the Patient Action Letter and mail it to a health care professional who may not know about MM symptoms (located under \u201ctake action\u201d drop down menu)\n\nShare personal myeloma milestones\n\nContinue advocating for the MM community year-round by signing up for communications by visiting myeloma.org\n\nStart a peer-to-peer fundraiser to raise funds for a specific IMF program\u2014it can be as easy as hosting a bake sale or luncheon, or as elaborate as a golf tournament or a run/walk\n\nFor fundraising details, contact Kimberly Francis at kfrancis@myeloma.org.\n\nEvery action, big or small, raises awareness and advances myeloma care.\n\nReferences",

            "content": "Within dividend investing, companies with a consistent track record of dividend growth tend to attract greater investor interest. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices highlighted that firms with ample cash reserves are better positioned to sustain and expand their operations while continuing to pay stable or increasing dividends. To assess the sustainability of dividends, companies must evaluate whether their payouts are supported by cash generated from operating activities and the availability of free cash flow. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures\u2014such as spending on property, plants, and equipment (PP&E)\u2014from cash flow generated through operations. Excess cash can be allocated toward dividends, debt reduction, share buybacks, or business expansion.\n\nThe significance of dividend stocks is well established, with extensive research examining their long-term performance. A study by Robert Arnott found that over a period of more than 200 years, ending in 2002, the US stock market delivered an average annualized total return of 7.9%, with dividend reinvestment accounting for 5% of that growth. Beyond enhancing overall returns, dividends also provide a buffer during market downturns. Various studies have shown that companies paying dividends tend to experience lower downside risk and recover losses more quickly, ultimately leading to higher risk-adjusted returns over extended investment periods.\n\nThe Dobermans of the Dow strategy serves as an alternative to the well-known Dogs of the Dow approach, offering a more selective screening process. While the Dogs of the Dow ranks stocks solely based on dividend yield, the Dobermans method prioritizes high-quality companies trading at attractive valuations. The selection process involves two key steps: first, the 30 stocks in the Dow are ranked by Return on Equity (ROE), with the top 20 retained. Then, these 20 companies are further ranked by Free Cash Flow Yield, narrowing the selection to the final ten stocks, which form the Dobermans portfolio. Historically, a hypothetical portfolio following this approach and rebalanced annually has delivered superior performance compared to the Dow, the broader market, and the Dogs of the Dow strategy, according to a report by Forbes. The report further mentioned that since 2000, this methodology has generated a cumulative return of 810%, more than doubling the long-term performance of these benchmarks.\n\nWe recently published a list of Dobermans of the Dow: 10 Stocks to Consider . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) stands against other Dobermans of the Dow to buy.\n\nStory Continues\n\nA positive or growing free cash flow often signals stable or increasing profitability. Since strong free cash flow may indicate a healthy balance sheet, S&P Dow Jones conducted an analysis to determine whether free cash flow yield\u2014measured as annual free cash flow per share divided by stock price\u2014provides valuable insights into investment returns. The underlying investment thesis suggested that all else being equal, companies with a higher free cash flow yield are preferable, as they generate greater free cash income for each dollar invested.\n\nAn analysis of the broader market universe, divided into quintiles based on free cash flow yield, revealed that the top-quintile stocks delivered an annualized return of 15.7% between December 1990 and June 2017. This performance exceeded the returns of all other quintiles and outpaced the broader market by an average of 3.6%. While the bottom two quintiles also achieved respectable returns of 11.0% and 8.6% annually, respectively, both underperformed relative to the overall equity market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we filtered the Dow stocks by Return on Equity, narrowing the list to the top 20. These are then ranked by Free Cash Flow Yield, with the top 10 earning the title \u201cDobermans of the Dow.\u201d The stocks are ranked according to their free cash flow yield. In cases where multiple stocks had the same free cash flow yield, the number of hedge fund investors was used as a deciding factor. Data on hedge funds was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database, which tracks over 1,000 hedge funds as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAmgen Inc. (AMGN): Among Dobermans of the Dow to Buy\n\nA pharmacist filling a prescription for a complex drug developed by the company.\n\nAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)\n\nFree Cash Flow Yield: 0.06\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 72\n\nAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a California-based multinational biopharmaceutical company. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported revenue of $9.1 billion, which grew by 11% from the same period last year. The revenue also beat analysts\u2019 estimates by $216.5 million. Product sales increased by 11%, largely due to a 14% rise in volume. When excluding revenue from the Horizon Therapeutics (Horizon) acquisition, sales saw a 10% uptick, with volume growth reaching 15%.\n\nAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is generating strong returns this year, surging by over 26% since the start of 2025. The market appears to overlook the company\u2019s strong pipeline of innovations, particularly in oncology, which has been further strengthened by its acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics. This deal brings considerable growth potential, especially in the oncology segment. In addition, Amgen is actively engaged in developing promising obesity treatments, which could open the door to a multi-billion-dollar opportunity beginning in 2026.\n\nAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)\u2019s cash position also remained stable in the most recent quarter. The company\u2019s free cash flow for the quarter came in at $4.4 billion, compared with $0.3 billion in the prior-year period. Its operating cash flow also jumped to $4.8 billion, from $0.5 billion in Q4 2023. During the quarter, it returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends. Currently, it offers a quarterly dividend of $2.38 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.91%, as of March 10. The company\u2019s dividend growth streak spans 13 years.\n\nOverall, AMGN ranks 2nd on our list of Dobermans of the Dow to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for AMGN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMGN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Amgen and Kyowa Kirin\u2019s anti-OX40 antibody rocatinlimab vindicated itself this weekend, with new Phase III data pointing to its strong efficacy in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.\n\nThese findings come from the ROCKET-IGNITE study, one of eight trials under the partners\u2019 late-stage ROCKET clinical development program for rocatinlimab. Results showed that 42.3% of patients given 300-mg rocatinlimab once every four weeks saw at least a 75% reduction from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index scores (EASI-75) at 24 weeks. This treatment effect represented a significant 29.5% difference versus placebo, according to Amgen\u2019s news release.\n\nAt this dose level, 23.6% of patients achieved clear or almost-clear skin at 24 weeks, representing a 14.9% advantage over placebo. Amgen and Kyowa Kirin presented these data Saturday at the 2024 annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology\n\nAnalysts at Leerink Partners called these findings \u201csurprisingly positive\u201d in an investor note on Sunday, pointing to a prior readout from ROCKET-HORIZON. Released in September 2024, data from the HORIZON trial found that 32.8% of rocatinlimab-treated patients achieved EASI-75, representing a 19.1% difference from placebo.\n\nWhile Amgen at the time declared victory in HORIZON, calling rocatinlimab\u2019s effect a \u201cstatistically significant improvement\u201d in disease severity, analysts were unconvinced. Jefferies called the magnitude of effect \u201cmodest,\u201d while BMO Capital Markets said the data \u201cappear to fall short of agents like Ebglyss/Dupixent.\u201d Leerink, in its note on Sunday, said it found HORIZON\u2019s results to be \u201cunderwhelming.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, IGNITE\u2019s outcomes were \u201cmore compelling,\u201d according to the Leerink analysts, despite testing a similar dose as HORIZON.\n\nStill, the analysts flagged instances of pyrexia (fever) and chills\u2014which they called an \u201cadverse event of interest\u201d\u2014that occurred more frequently in rocatinlimab-treated patients. Amgen explained these side effects as \u201cmainly a first dose effect and therefore not commonly seen on subsequent doses,\u201d as per the Leerink note.\n\nAmgen and Kyowa Kirin on Saturday also released data from two other ROCKET studies. The first, dubbed SHUTTLE, showed that rocatinlimab can elicit significant rates of EASI-75 when combined with topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors. The second, named VOYAGER, found that rocatinlimab does not interfere with response to tetanus and meningococcal vaccines.\n\nCorrection (March 11): This story has been updated from its original version to clarify that Amgen is partnered with Kyowa Kirin on rocatinlimab.

            "content": "MANUFACTURER: Amgen\n\nOVERVIEW: Prolia (denosumab) was first introduced in 2010, as a treatment for osteoporosis. It was also the first drug every approved by the FDA specifically to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis. However, early on it was linked to an increased risk of bone fractures.\n\nAccording to the consumer group Public Citizen, there were concerns over Prolia side effects dating back to at least 2009; a year before it was even approved to be sold.\n\nIn 2012, Health Canada and Amgen released a Prolia bone fracture warning letter, which was designed to alert Canadian users to an increased risk of atypical femur fractures that may occur with little or no trauma to the thigh bone; the thickest, largest, and purportedly strongest, bone in the human body.\n\nSimilar warnings were placed on Prolia sold in Europe. However, Amgen has decided U.S. consumers of Prolia do not warrant the same consideration or label warnings, despite the fact it is the same drug being sold in the U.S. as is being sold in Canada and Europe\u2026just without those same warnings about the risks of bone fractures.\n\nIn 2013, the consumer watchdog Public Citizen added Prolia to its list of pills consumers should avoid, placing the drug on its \u201cDo Not Use\u201d list. Public Citizen noted that not only did Prolia triple the risk of hip fractures, femur fractures and other bone problems, but there were also concerns over infections and dermatologic adverse events.\n\nIn April 2019, Public Citizen petitioned the FDA to add a black box warning to Prolia over the risk of bone fractures. It is the most stringent label warning the agency can require a drug to carry.\n\nFIND OUT IF YOU MAY QUALIFY FOR A PROLIA LAWSUIT: As a result of the drug manufacturers\u2019 failure to adequately warn about the risk of fracture problems, Prolia lawyers are evaluating whether users may be entitled to compensation through a product liability lawsuit.\n\nTo request a free consultation and claim evaluation to determine whether you, a friend or family member may be entitled to financial compensation through a Prolia lawsuit, submit information about a potential claim for review by a lawyer.",

            "content": "Ongoing Studies are Evaluating Long-Term Maintenance and Durability\n\nTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif., and TOKYO, March 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) and Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd. (Kyowa Kirin, TSE: 4151) today announced new results from the ongoing ROCKET Phase 3 clinical trial program evaluating rocatinlimab, an investigational T-cell rebalancing therapy targeting the OX40 receptor, in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD).\n\nThe IGNITE study, which evaluated two dose strengths of rocatinlimab, met its co-primary endpoints and all key secondary endpoints, achieving statistical significance for both rocatinlimab dose strengths versus placebo. IGNITE was a 24-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of rocatinlimab monotherapy every 4 weeks in 769 adults with moderate to severe AD, including patients previously treated with a biologic or systemic Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor medication.\n\nAt week 24, 42.3% of patients in the higher dose group achieved \u226575% reduction from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index score (EASI-75), a 29.5% difference vs. placebo (p < 0.001). In the lower dose group, 36.3% of patients achieved EASI-75, a 23.4% difference vs. placebo (p < 0.001).\n\nIn the higher dose group, 23.6% of patients achieved a validated Investigator's Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD\u2122) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) with a \u22652-point reduction from baseline (vIGA-AD 0/1) at week 24, representing a 14.9% difference vs. placebo (p < 0.001). In the lower dose group, 19.1% of patients achieved this endpoint, a 10.3% difference vs. placebo (p = 0.002).\n\nIn addition, IGNITE met the endpoint of revised Investigator's Global Assessment (rIGA\u2122) score of 0/1 with a \u22652-point reduction from baseline, a more stringent measure of efficacy than vIGA-AD 0/1. At week 24, 22.7% of patients in the higher dose group achieved this endpoint, a 14.4% difference vs. placebo (p < 0.001). In the lower dose group, 16.3% of patients achieved this endpoint, an 8.0% difference vs. placebo (p = 0.01).\n\nAcross ROCKET program results to date, safety findings were generally consistent with the safety profile of rocatinlimab previously observed. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (\u22655%) with higher observed proportion in rocatinlimab groups were pyrexia, chills and headache. A higher number of patients receiving rocatinlimab vs. placebo experienced gastrointestinal ulceration events, with an overall incidence of less than 1%.1\n\n\"Many patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis struggle with chronic, life-disrupting symptoms,\" said Jay Bradner, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. \"Even with currently available therapies, they may fail to reach or maintain treatment goals. We're pleased with ROCKET program results to date, which support the potential of rocatinlimab as a new treatment option.\"\n\n\"Looking ahead, the ASCEND trial will explore the effects of rocatinlimab beyond 24 weeks, including maintenance of clinical response with continued treatment or withdrawal, and the ASTRO and ORBIT trials will evaluate rocatinlimab in adolescent patients,\" said Takeyoshi Yamashita, Ph.D., senior managing executive officer and chief medical officer at Kyowa Kirin. \"These findings will help define the full profile of rocatinlimab and its potential to inhibit and reduce pathogenic T cells.\"\n\nThe ROCKET program is also informed by the results of the SHUTTLE and VOYAGER studies. The SHUTTLE study, which evaluated two dose strengths of rocatinlimab in combination with topical corticosteroids (TCS) and/or topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) in 746 adults using the same co-primary endpoints as IGNITE, met its co-primary endpoints and all key secondary endpoints, achieving statistical significance for both rocatinlimab dose strengths plus TCS/TCI versus placebo plus TCS/TCI at week 24.\n\nFor EASI-75, 52.3% of patients in SHUTTLE's higher dose group achieved the endpoint, a 28.7% difference vs. placebo (p < 0.001), while 54.1% of patients in the lower dose group achieved the endpoint, a 30.4% difference vs. placebo (p<0.001).\n\nFor vIGA-AD 0/1, 26.1% of SHUTTLE patients in the higher dose group achieved the endpoint, a 13.8% difference vs. placebo (p<0.001). In the lower dose group, 25.8% of patients achieved the endpoint, a 13.5% difference vs. placebo (p<0.001).\n\nFor rIGA 0/1, 23.3% of SHUTTLE patients in the higher dose group achieved the endpoint, an 11.5% difference vs. placebo (p<0.001). In the lower dose group, 22.7% of patients achieved the endpoint, a 10.9% difference vs. placebo (p = 0.002). The higher rocatinlimab dose used in IGNITE and SHUTTLE was identical to the dose used in HORIZON.\n\nThe VOYAGER study successfully demonstrated that rocatinlimab does not interfere with responses to tetanus and meningococcal vaccinations.\n\nHORIZON, top-line results of which were previously shared, will be presented as a late-breaking abstract at the 2025 American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting. Results from IGNITE, SHUTTLE and VOYAGER will be presented at upcoming congresses or published in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nAbout the ROCKET Phase 3 Program\n\nROCKET is a comprehensive, global Phase 3 clinical trial program comprised of eight studies intended to establish the safety and efficacy profile of rocatinlimab in adults and adolescents with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) as well as multiple dosing regimens.\n\nAbout Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis\n\nAtopic dermatitis, the most common form of eczema, is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes excessively dry, itchy skin that can be painful.2 People with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis experience chronic symptoms, intensified by unpredictable flare-ups that can be painful and disruptive to everyday life.3 More than half of these patients report severe itching, leading to repeated scratching which can cause the skin to thicken and become vulnerable to infection.4,5 Atopic dermatitis (all severities) affects 15-20% of children and up to 10% of adults.5 T-cell imbalance is a root cause of atopic dermatitis, contributing to clinical manifestations including the disease's recurring, unpredictable symptoms.6\n\nAbout Rocatinlimab\n\nRocatinlimab is an anti-OX40 human monoclonal antibody being investigated for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Rocatinlimab has the potential to be the first and only T-cell rebalancing therapy that inhibits and reduces pathogenic T cells by targeting the OX40 receptor. OX40 is a co-stimulatory receptor responsible for driving systemic and local inflammatory responses in atopic dermatitis and other conditions.3 It has been reported that effector T cells expressing OX40 are present in the lesions of patients with atopic dermatitis and are critical in the disease pathophysiology.3,7\n\nRocatinlimab is also being studied for moderate to severe uncontrolled asthma, prurigo nodularis and potentially other conditions where T-cell imbalance is a root cause of inflammation. The initial antibody was discovered in collaboration between Kyowa Kirin and La Jolla Institute for Immunology.\n\nRocatinlimab is currently under clinical investigation, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by the U.S. FDA or any other regulatory authority.\n\nAbout Amgen\n\nAmgen discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative medicines to help millions of patients in their fight against some of the world's toughest diseases. More than 40 years ago, Amgen helped to establish the biotechnology industry and remains on the cutting-edge of innovation, using technology and human genetic data to push beyond what's known today.

Under the terms of the agreement, Amgen will lead the development, manufacturing, and commercialization for KHK4083/AMG 451 for all markets globally, except Japan, where Kyowa Kirin will retain all rights. If approved, the companies will co-promote the asset in the United States and Kyowa Kirin has opt-in rights to co-promote in certain other markets including Europe and Asia.\n\nAmgen Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd. or Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.), the performance of Otezla\u00ae (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), Amgen's acquisitions of Teneobio, Inc., ChemoCentryx, Inc., or Horizon Therapeutics plc (including the prospective performance and outlook of Horizon's business, performance and opportunities, any potential strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities expected as a result of such acquisition, and any projected impacts from the Horizon acquisition on Amgen's acquisition-related expenses going forward), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems on Amgen's business, outcomes, progress, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nNo forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those Amgen projects. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for Amgen to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and Amgen expects similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints Amgen has selected. Amgen develops product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as Amgen may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, Amgen or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products, including its devices, after they are on the market.\n\nAmgen's results may be affected by its ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing its products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of Amgen's products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, Amgen's research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Amgen's business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, Amgen's business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If Amgen fails to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between Amgen and the U.S. government, Amgen could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while Amgen routinely obtains patents for its products and technology, the protection offered by its patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by its competitors, or Amgen may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Amgen performs a substantial amount of its commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depends on third parties for a portion of its manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of its current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for Amgen's manufacturing activities, the distribution of Amgen's products, the commercialization of Amgen's product candidates, and Amgen's clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on Amgen's product development, product sales, business and results of operations. Amgen relies on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of its product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of its commercial products. In addition, Amgen competes with other companies with respect to many of its marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for Amgen's products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of Amgen's distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with Amgen. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of Amgen's products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on its business and results of operations. Amgen's efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology Amgen has acquired, may not be successful. There can be no guarantee that Amgen will be able to realize any of the strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities arising from the Horizon acquisition, and such benefits, synergies or opportunities may take longer to realize than expected. Amgen may not be able to successfully integrate Horizon, and such integration may take longer, be more difficult or cost more than expected. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach of Amgen's information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Amgen's systems and Amgen's data. Amgen's stock price may be volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Amgen's business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving its environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect Amgen's business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect Amgen's business. Amgen's business performance could affect or limit the ability of the Amgen Board of Directors to declare a dividend or its ability to pay a dividend or repurchase its common stock. Amgen may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to it, or at all.\n\nThe scientific information discussed in this news release related to Amgen's product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates.\n\nCONTACT: Amgen, Thousand Oaks\n\nKate Meyer, 872-867-0754 (media)\n\nElissa Snook, 609-251-1407 (media)\n\nJustin Claeys, 805-313-9775 (investors)\n\nCONTACT: Kyowa Kirin, Tokyo, Japan\n\nHiroki Nakamura, +81-3-5205-7205 (Media, Global)\n\nSubrenie Thomas-Smith 609-803-0539 (Media, US)\n\nRyohei Kawai, +81-3-5205-7206 (Investors)\n\nReferences\n\nROCKET results to date are from IGNITE, HORIZON, SHUTTLE and VOYAGER trials.

The stock, which has seen a pullback, is now viewed as an attractive entry point for investors. Joyce highlights the completion of corporate rebalancing activities and the acquisition of sports-related assets from parent company EDR.

Despite reporting better-than-expected earnings, the company\u2019s outlook for same-store sales growth has been revised downward. Macy\u2019s is navigating external challenges, including unfavorable weather and macroeconomic uncertainties. While efforts to enhance the store experience and scale luxury nameplates are underway, the combination of SG&A reinvestments and store closures poses risks to core retail operating income. Investors may need to exercise caution as Macy\u2019s adapts to the evolving retail landscape.\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings is capturing attention as a leader in the cryptocurrency mining sector. Analyst Chris Brendler has initiated coverage with a \u2018Buy\u2019 rating, emphasizing MARA\u2019s market dominance and strategic growth initiatives.

            "content": "Amgen Inc (AMGN, Financial) and Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd. have released new results from their ROCKET Phase 3 clinical trial program, evaluating rocatinlimab, a T-cell rebalancing therapy targeting the OX40 receptor, for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The IGNITE study, part of this program, met its co-primary and all key secondary endpoints, demonstrating significant efficacy and safety in patients. The announcement was made on March 8, 2025, highlighting the potential of rocatinlimab as a new treatment option for this chronic condition.\n\nPositive Aspects\n\nThe IGNITE study met its co-primary endpoints and all key secondary endpoints, showing significant efficacy for both dose strengths of rocatinlimab compared to placebo.\n\nRocatinlimab demonstrated a significant reduction in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) scores, with 42.3% of patients in the higher dose group achieving a \u226575% reduction.\n\nSafety findings were consistent with previous observations, with common adverse events being manageable.\n\nThe SHUTTLE study also showed positive results, reinforcing the efficacy of rocatinlimab in combination with topical treatments.\n\nNegative Aspects\n\nSome patients experienced gastrointestinal ulceration events, although the incidence was less than 1%.\n\nDespite positive results, the long-term effects and maintenance of clinical response beyond 24 weeks are still under investigation.\n\nFinancial Analyst Perspective\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, the promising results of the ROCKET Phase 3 program could significantly enhance Amgen's portfolio, particularly in the dermatology sector. The potential approval and commercialization of rocatinlimab could open new revenue streams and strengthen Amgen's market position in treating atopic dermatitis. However, investors should remain cautious about the ongoing studies and regulatory approvals that could impact timelines and financial projections.\n\nMarket Research Analyst Perspective\n\nThe successful outcomes of the IGNITE and SHUTTLE studies position rocatinlimab as a strong contender in the atopic dermatitis treatment market, which is characterized by high unmet needs. The therapy's unique mechanism of targeting the OX40 receptor could differentiate it from existing treatments, potentially capturing a significant market share. The ongoing ASCEND, ASTRO, and ORBIT trials will further define its market potential, especially in adolescent populations.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is rocatinlimab?\n\nRocatinlimab is an investigational T-cell rebalancing therapy targeting the OX40 receptor, being developed for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.\n\nWhat were the key findings of the IGNITE study?\n\nThe IGNITE study met its co-primary and all key secondary endpoints, showing significant efficacy and safety for rocatinlimab in treating moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.\n\nWhat are the next steps for rocatinlimab's development?\n\nFuture studies, including the ASCEND, ASTRO, and ORBIT trials, will explore long-term maintenance, effects in adolescents, and further define the therapy's profile.\n\nRead the original press release here.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Amgen (AMGN) announced this week that it has begun two late-stage clinical trials for its experimental weight-loss drug, MariTide. And Big Pharma is lobbying for a tax break that would have saved it at least $15 billion in 2023.\n\nCheck out those stories and more pharmaceutical news highlights from this week.\n\nA pharmacy technician grabs a bottle of drugs off a shelf at the central pharmacy of Intermountain Healthcare on September 10, 2018 in Midvale, Utah. - Image: George Frey / Stringer (Getty Images)\n\nBig Pharma is pushing to bring back a tax break that could have saved them at least $15.4 billion in 2023 alone, according to a new analysis by Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF) and Lower Drug Prices Now (LDPN). The tax break in question allows companies to deduct research and development (R&D) costs in the year they are incurred. The provision went into effect with the passing of Trump\u2019s 2017 tax law \u2014 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, much of which is set to expire at the end of this year. The companies argue that losing the expensing provision reduces their ability to fund research.\n\nRead More\n\nIn this photo illustration, boxes of the diabetes drug Ozempic rest on a pharmacy counter on April 17, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. - Image: Mario Tama / Staff (Getty Images)\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO), the maker of the popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, expects at least some short-term impacts from President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs. \u201cWe still have products moving across borders like most global companies,\u201d Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen told Bloomberg on Thursday. \u201cOf course there\u2019ll be some short-term impact as we mitigate the impact of tariffs.\u201d\n\nRead More\n\nIn this photo illustration, the injectable weight-loss medication Wegovy is available at New City Halstead Pharmacy on April 24, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois. - Image: Scott Olson / Staff (Getty Images)\n\nFollowing in the steps of its rival Eli Lilly (LLY), Novo Nordisk (NVO), the maker of the blockbuster drug Ozempic, is cutting the price of its weight loss drug by more than half for patients who pay without insurance. Novo Nordisk announced on Wednesday that it is now offering all doses of its popular weight loss drug Wegovy for $499 a month. That\u2019s a more than 60% discount from the drug\u2019s $1,349.02 list price. The catch is the offer is only available through the company\u2019s direct-to-consumer service, NovoCare Pharmacy.

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into Amgen Inc's (NASDAQ:AMGN) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-03-07, Amgen Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $278.18. It's currently trading at a price of $317.82. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -14.25%. The company is fair valued.\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Amgen Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $19.82 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.26%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 8.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 171 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 107.17 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 278.18\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $221.67. This valuation indicates that the Amgen Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -43.38%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.",

Both trials will test three different dose levels and compare MariTide\u2019s weight-loss effects to a placebo after 72 weeks of treatment, though the specific regimens and dosing frequency weren\u2019t yet revealed. MariTide is one of the more closely watched obesity drugs in clinical development because of its potential to be administered monthly, not weekly, like Novo Nordisk\u2019sWegovy or Eli Lilly\u2019sZepbound \u2014 Jonathan Gardner\n\nNovo, meanwhile, announced on Wednesday the creation of a online pharmacy through which certain patients can order Wegovy at a discounted price if they pay in cash. Called NovoCare Pharmacy, the program offers all Wegovy doses at $499 a month and is available to people who\u2019ve been prescribed Wegovy but aren\u2019t insured or don\u2019t have obesity drug coverage in their health plans. Novo\u2019s move follows a similar initiative Lilly has undertaken for Zepbound, which offers the drug at anywhere from $349 to $499 a month depending on the dose level. Novo said its program is an alternative to \u201cfake or illegitimate compounded\u201d versions of Wegovy. \u2014 Jonathan Gardner\n\nGenAssist, a Suzhou, China-based biotechnology company, has been cleared to begin testing in the U.S. a first-of-its-kind gene editing treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Called Gen6050x, the therapy uses a technology known as base editing in an attempt to permanently restore expression of the muscle-protecting protein dystrophin. It\u2019s specifically being developed for Duchenne patients who are \u201camenable\u201d to exon 50 skipping. GenAssist has already treated two patients in a study in China. \u2014 Ben Fidler\n\nMikael Dolsten, who until Jan. 1 was Pfizer\u2019s top scientist and research and development head, will lead the board of directors of Orbis Medicines, the biotechnology startup said Wednesday. Orbis raised just under $100 million in a Series A round it announced in January, funds that will help it develop a type of oral peptide drug meant to blend the strengths of biologics and small molecules. \u201cI believe Orbis Medicines has the potential to become the leading oral macrocycles and oral biologics biotech company,\u201d said Dolsten. Prior Orbis board chair Morten Graugaard became CEO of the company earlier this year. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has put on hold a Phase 1/2 trial of BioNTech\u2019s RNA-based vaccine for malaria prevention, according to a securities form filed Tuesday. The company said it paused the study while it works to \u201caddress the FDA\u2019s requests\u201d and \u201cassess next steps.\u201d Roughly 180 malaria-naive adults were enrolled into the experiment, which was designed to measure the shot\u2019s immunogenicity and safety. The FDA also recently put on hold a Moderna study of an RNA vaccine for norovirus after one case of Guillan-Barr\u00e9 syndrome was reported. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo",

            "content": "NEW YORK, March 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against Amgen on March 13, 2023 with a Class Period from July 29, 2020 and April 27, 2022. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Amgen have breached their fiduciary duties to the company.\n\nAmgen is one of the world\u2019s largest independent biopharmaceutical companies.\n\nThe Amgen class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the U.S. government claimed Amgen owed more than $3 billion in back taxes for tax years 2010, 2011, and 2012; (ii) the U.S. government claimed Amgen owed more than $5 billion in back taxes for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015; (iii) the U.S. government would likely claim Amgen owed materially more to the U.S. government than investors had been led to believe for subsequent tax years for which Amgen had used the same profit allocation treatment between its U.S. and Puerto Rico operations; (iv) Amgen had not taken sufficient accruals to account for its outstanding tax liabilities; (v) Amgen had failed to comply with ASC 450 and other rules and regulations regarding the preparation of its periodic U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings; and (vi) Amgen\u2019s refusal to pay taxes claimed by the U.S. government exposed Amgen to a substantial risk of severe financial penalties imposed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d).\n\nOn August 3, 2021, Amgen issued an earnings release for its second fiscal quarter of 2021, which, for the first time, disclosed massive outstanding tax liabilities sought by the IRS. The release stated that Amgen had received a Notice of Deficiency from the IRS in July 2021 which sought $3.6 billion in back taxes, plus interest, for tax years 2010, 2011, and 2012. On this news, the price of Amgen common stock fell by more than 6%.\n\nThen, on April 27, 2022, Amgen issued an earnings release for its first fiscal quarter of 2022, which disclosed that Amgen had received a Notice of Deficiency from the IRS in April 2022 which sought $5.1 billion in back taxes, plus interest, for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015, and proposed a $2 billion penalty as a result of Amgen\u2019s improper tax avoidance strategies. On this news, the price of Amgen common stock fell by an additional 4.3%, further damaging investors.\n\nAmgen has additionally disclosed that it is under examination by the IRS for the years 2016 to 2018 for similar issues as the prior Notices of Deficiency for years 2010 to 2015, as well as examination by various state and foreign tax jurisdictions. Amgen has also admitted that \u201cthe ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.\u201d\n\nIf you are a long-term stockholder of Amgen, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, by telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

            "content": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Amgen (AMGN). Shares have added about 2.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Amgen due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nQ4 Earnings & Revenues Beat\n\nAmgen reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $5.31 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.03 per share. Earnings rose 13% year over year as higher revenues were partially offset by higher operating costs.\n\n\n\nTotal revenues of $9.1 billion also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.9 billion. Total revenues rose 11% year over year.\n\n\n\nTotal product revenues increased 11% from the year-ago quarter to $8.72 billion as volume growth was partially offset by continued price declines. Volumes rose 14% in the quarter.\n\n\n\nOther revenues were $370 million in the quarter, up around 2% year over year.\n\n\n\nTen products, including Repatha, Blincyto, Tezspire, Tavneos and Evenity, achieved double-digit volume growth in the quarter. Rare disease drugs, mostly Horizon\u2019s products, also boosted sales growth in the quarter, contributing $1.2 billion to sales. Excluding the contribution from Horizon, sales grew 10% while volumes rose 15%. However, sales of some key drugs like Prolia and Xgeva missed estimates.\n\nPerformance of Key Drugs\n\nGeneral Medicine\n\n\n\nProlia revenues came in at $1.17 billion, up 5% from the year-ago quarter as volume growth was partially offset by lower inventory levels. Prolia sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18 billion.\n\n\n\nEvenity recorded sales of $431 million in the quarter, up 36% year over year, driven by solid volume growth in the United States. Evenity sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $413.0 million as well as our model estimate of $418.3 million.\n\n\n\nRepatha generated revenues of $606 million, up 45% year over year, driven by higher volume growth due to broad reimbursement and removal of prior authorization requirements by several payers in the United States. The volume growth was partially offset by lower prices due to higher rebates to support expanded access. Repatha sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $555.0 million and our model estimate of $542.9 million.\n\n\n\nWhile 2024 sales were impacted by price erosion, in 2025, Amgen expects less price erosion for Repatha, with net price expected to decline by mid-single digits or less.\n\n\n\nHematology-Oncology\n\n\n\nXgeva delivered revenues of $561 million, up 6% year over year, driven by volume growth. Xgeva sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $565.0 million but beat our model estimate of $556.3 million.\n\n\n\nKyprolis recorded sales of $372 million, up 6% year over year, driven by volume growth in outside U.S. markets. Vectibix revenues came in at $246 million, down 2% year over year due to lower volumes and currency headwinds.\n\n\n\nNplate sales declined 13% to $337 million. The year-ago quarter\u2019s sales included a U.S. government order. Excluding this order, Nplate sales grew 4% year over year.\n\n\n\nBlincyto sales increased 58% from the year-ago period to $381 million, driven by volume growth. Blincyto\u2019s volume growth benefited from broad prescribing across academic and community segments which is expected to continue to drive sales growth of the drug in 2025.\n\n\n\nLumakras/Lumykras recorded sales of $85 million in the quarter, up 10% from the year-ago period.\n\n\n\nImdelltra (tarlatamab), approved for pre-treated advanced small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) in May 2024, recorded sales of $67 million in the fourth quarter compared with $36 million in the third quarter. The drug\u2019s 86% sequential growth was driven by volume growth and favorable inventory levels.\n\n\n\nIn oncology biosimilars, sales of Mvasi were $173 million in the quarter, down 8% year over year due to increased competitive pressure.\n\n\n\nInflammation\n\n\n\nSales of Otezla were $624 million in the quarter, down 1% due to lower selling price, which offset the benefit from volume growth of 5%. Otezla sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $611.0 million as well as our estimate of $605.4 million.\n\n\n\nEnbrel revenues of $1 billion were flat year over year as favorable changes to estimated sales deductions were offset by lower selling prices. Enbrel sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $864.0 million as well as our estimate of $874.5 million.\n\n\n\nGoing forward, Amgen expects volumes to be flat for Enbrel, while net selling price is expected to continue to decline, including the impact from the IRA Medicare Part D price set by CMS.\n\n\n\nSales of Otezla and Enbrel are expected to be lower in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the other quarters per historical trends due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance reverification and increased co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles.\n\n\n\nTezspire (tezepelumab) recorded sales of $296 million in the quarter, up 67% year over year, driven by volume growth. Tezspire sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $293.0 million and our estimate of $274.4 million.\n\n\n\nAmjevita/Amgevita sales were $294 million in the quarter, up 84% year over year.\n\n\n\nRare Disease\n\n\n\nAmgen\u2019s acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics in 2023 added several rare disease drugs, such as Tepezza, Krystexxa and Uplizna, to AMGN\u2019s portfolio.\n\n\n\nTepezza sales rose 3% year over year to $460 million. Krystexxa rose 27% year over year to $346 million and Uplizna rose 55% year over year to $101 million\n\n\n\nAmgen recently got approval for Tepezza in Japan and expects to launch it in the country in the first half of 2025 and seven additional countries in 2025.\n\n\n\nUltra-rare products acquired from Horizon generated revenues of $214 million in the quarter, up 30% year over year.\n\n\n\nNew drug Tavneos generated $81 million in sales in the quarter, up 84% year over year, driven by new patient volume growth.\n\n\n\nEstablished Products\n\n\n\nTotal sales of established products, which include Epogen, Aranesp, Parsabiv and Neulasta, decreased 29% year over year in the quarter to $500 million.",

The stock also fell short of the S&P 500\u2019s 7% gain during that period.\n\nIs now the time to buy AMGN? Or does the price properly account for its business quality and fundamentals? Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhy Does AMGN Stock Spark Debate?\n\nFounded in 1980 to pioneer genetic engineering techniques, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a biotechnology company that develops medicines, focusing on treatments in oncology (cancers), cardiology (heart-related), and immunology (e.g. arthritis and psoriasis).\n\nTwo Positive Attributes:\n\n1. Long-Term Revenue Growth Shows Momentum\n\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Luckily, Amgen\u2019s sales grew at a decent 7.7% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth was slightly above the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\n\n2. Excellent Free Cash Flow Margin Boosts Reinvestment Potential\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\n\nAmgen has shown terrific cash profitability, enabling it to reinvest, return capital to investors, and stay ahead of the competition while maintaining an ample cushion. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin was among the best in the healthcare sector, averaging an eye-popping 32.2% over the last five years.\n\nOne Reason to be Careful:\n\nNew Investments Fail to Bear Fruit as ROIC Declines\n\nROIC, or return on invested capital, is a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\n\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Unfortunately, Amgen\u2019s ROIC has decreased over the last few years. Only time will tell if its new bets can bear fruit and potentially reverse the trend.\n\nFinal Judgment\n\nAmgen\u2019s merits more than compensate for its flaws. With its shares trailing the market in recent months, the stock trades at 15.2\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $314.91 per share). Is now the right time to buy? See for yourself in our comprehensive research report, it\u2019s free.\n\nStocks We Like Even More Than Amgen\n\nThe Trump trade may have passed, but rates are still dropping and inflation is still cooling. Opportunities are ripe for those ready to act - and we\u2019re here to help you pick them.\n\nGet started by checking out our Top 5 Growth Stocks for this month. This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 175% over the last five years.\n\nStocks that made our list in 2019 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+2,183% between December 2019 and December 2024) as well as under-the-radar businesses like Sterling Infrastructure (+1,096% five-year return).

            "content": "Amgen on Wednesday said it has started two critical late-stage trials for its experimental weight loss injection MariTide, another step in its bid to enter the booming obesity drug market.\n\n\"We're delighted to share that these trials have now been initiated, and really, the progression of the MARITIME program is going very, very well,\" Dr. Jay Bradner, Amgen's executive vice president of research and development, said during a TD Cowen conference, using the name of the drug's phase three development program.\n\nMariTide is a monthly injection that investors hope could compete against existing weight loss drugs from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly , which are weekly injectables. They are part of a class of drugs called GLP-1s, which mimic certain hormones produced in the gut to tamp down appetite and regulate blood sugar.\n\nAbout 6% of U.S. adults, or more than 15 million people, were using a prescription for GLP-1s as of May, according to a survey from health policy organization KFF. Some analysts expect the market for GLP-1s to be worth more than $150 billion annually by the early 2030s.\n\nOne of the new phase three trials is examining Amgen's drug in around 3,500 people with obesity or who are overweight without Type 2 diabetes, Bradner said. The second study examines MariTide in 999 patients who are obese or overweight and have Type 2 diabetes\n\nThe main goal of both studies is to measure the percentage of weight loss at 72 weeks. Amgen will study three target doses of MariTide and plans to use dose escalation, or starting patients at a lower dose of the drug and increasing that amount over time. The company did not share a specific regimen for dosing in the trials.\n\nAmgen in November said MariTide helped patients with obesity lose up to 20% of their weight on average after a year in a phase two trial, with no weight loss plateau. The drug also helped patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes lose up to 17% of their weight after a year with no plateau. But the results were on the lower end of Wall Street's lofty expectations for the drug.\n\nAmgen will report more data on MariTide this year. The full results of the phase two trial will be presented at the American Diabetes Association conference in June. The company is also continuing to study patients in an extension of that trial that will read out in the second half of this year.\n\nMariTide brings a new approach to weight loss compared with the existing drugs on the market because it is a so-called peptide antibody conjugate, which refers to a monoclonal antibody linked to two peptides. The peptides activate receptors of a gut hormone called GLP-1, while the antibody blocks receptors of another hormone called GIP.\n\nThat's unlike Eli Lilly's obesity drug, Zepbound, which activates both GIP and GLP-1. Novo Nordisk's Wegovy activates GLP-1 but does not target GIP, which may also affect how the body breaks down sugar and fat.",

(NASDAQ: AMGN) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against Amgen on March 13, 2023 with a Class Period from July 29, 2020 and April 27, 2022. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Amgen have breached their fiduciary duties to the company.\n\nAmgen is one of the world\u2019s largest independent biopharmaceutical companies.\n\nThe Amgen class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the U.S. government claimed Amgen owed more than $3 billion in back taxes for tax years 2010, 2011, and 2012; (ii) the U.S. government claimed Amgen owed more than $5 billion in back taxes for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015; (iii) the U.S. government would likely claim Amgen owed materially more to the U.S. government than investors had been led to believe for subsequent tax years for which Amgen had used the same profit allocation treatment between its U.S. and Puerto Rico operations; (iv) Amgen had not taken sufficient accruals to account for its outstanding tax liabilities; (v) Amgen had failed to comply with ASC 450 and other rules and regulations regarding the preparation of its periodic U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings; and (vi) Amgen\u2019s refusal to pay taxes claimed by the U.S. government exposed Amgen to a substantial risk of severe financial penalties imposed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d).\n\nOn August 3, 2021, Amgen issued an earnings release for its second fiscal quarter of 2021, which, for the first time, disclosed massive outstanding tax liabilities sought by the IRS. The release stated that Amgen had received a Notice of Deficiency from the IRS in July 2021 which sought $3.6 billion in back taxes, plus interest, for tax years 2010, 2011, and 2012. On this news, the price of Amgen common stock fell by more than 6%.\n\nThen, on April 27, 2022, Amgen issued an earnings release for its first fiscal quarter of 2022, which disclosed that Amgen had received a Notice of Deficiency from the IRS in April 2022 which sought $5.1 billion in back taxes, plus interest, for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015, and proposed a $2 billion penalty as a result of Amgen\u2019s improper tax avoidance strategies. On this news, the price of Amgen common stock fell by an additional 4.3%, further damaging investors.\n\nAmgen has additionally disclosed that it is under examination by the IRS for the years 2016 to 2018 for similar issues as the prior Notices of Deficiency for years 2010 to 2015, as well as examination by various state and foreign tax jurisdictions. Amgen has also admitted that \u201cthe ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.\u201d\n\nIf you are a long-term stockholder of Amgen, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, by telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

            "content": "Listen to the article 6 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nUpcoming patent losses are looming large for a number of pharma giants, including Amgen.\n\nIan Thompson, SVP, general manager of U.S. business operations, Amgen Permission granted by Amgen\n\nThe company reported a strong 2024, with revenue increasing 19% from the year before to $33.4 billion and 21 products that achieved record sales for the year. But Amgen is also losing exclusivity for several key products, including its blockbusters Otezla and Enbrel, which together racked up more than $1.6 billion in 2024\u2019s fourth quarter alone.\n\nAs it looks ahead, the company, like many across the industry, has refocused its long-term strategy to answer the question: What now?\n\nFor Amgen, the answers lie in a wide range of goals, including acquisitions, developing new products in four therapeutic areas, boosting its biosimilar business and maximizing the impact of its portfolio.\n\nThe roadmap ties to \u201cambitious growth aspirations over the next eight to 10 years,\u201d according to Ian Thompson, Amgen\u2019s senior vice president and general manager of U.S. business operations.\n\n\u201cWe're well positioned for sustained growth in the near time and throughout 2030,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe do have products \u2026 losing their exclusivity. But with the breadth of the portfolio that we have, we will continue to grow.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at how Amgen plans to stay on the upswing.\n\nBoosting biosimilars\n\nAmgen is investing more in developing biosimilars than it did a decade ago.\n\n\u201cWe're an innovative scientific company \u2026 that's the core of who we are,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cBut we've also recognized that one of our differentiating capabilities is manufacturing large proteins, particularly monoclonal antibodies.\u201d\n\nNow, the company is seeing that investment pay off. Amgen said in an earnings call last month that it expects biosimilar sales to reach $4 billion by the end of the decade.\n\nThe company has already notched a win on that front this year by launching Wezlana, the biosimilar for Johnson & Johnson's powerhouse inflammatory disease drug, Stelara. It also closed out 2024 with the launch of Pavblu, a biosimilar of Regeneron\u2019s blockbuster retinal disease injection Eylea.\n\nLater in 2025, Amgen plans to launch Bkemv, a biosimilar to AstraZeneca's complement inhibitor, Soliris, and anticipates a phase 3 data readout in the second half of the year for a biosimilar to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s cancer immunotherapy, Opdivo.\n\nA therapeutic focus\n\nIn R&D, Amgen is focusing on four therapeutic areas: oncology; general medicine, which includes cardiovascular, bone health and neurology; inflammation; and rare disease.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got four large portfolios, balanced in terms of their growth performance and trajectory,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cAll have a range of early products in the growth phase, but also some maturing products as well.\u201d\n\nThe company is particularly excited about bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTE) like the blood cancer drug Blincyto, which picked up its third approval last year.\n\n\u201cWe recently gained new data which brings it into the consolidation phase of acute lymphoblastic [leukemia], and also pediatric phase as well, so we\u2019re able to treat a lot earlier now for small tumors in that space. That\u2019s driving considerable expansion, treating more patients,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also pointed to the potential of Imdelltra, which nabbed FDA approval for small cell lung cancer last year for second-line plus patients.\n\n\u201cWe have ongoing studies there to bring it into earlier lines as well,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt\u2019s having a dramatic impact in a disease that was previously very difficult to treat.\u201d\n\nAmgen\u2019s moves in the rare disease space have been buoyed by its 2023 acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, which Thompson said gave the company the opportunity to take their treatments into international markets. For example, the company launched Tepezza in Japan and is filing for regulatory approval in other markets, too.\n\n\u201cWe see that path unfolding for other assets like Krystexxa,\u201d he said of the company\u2019s treatment for chronic gout.\n\nAmgen is also looking to expand the reach of its drug Uplinza, which is currently approved for a rare autoimmune disorder.\n\n\u201cUplizna\u2019s very exciting, we\u2019re got a couple of new indications coming through on that,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nIn the cardiovascular and inflammatory spaces, Thompson highlighted the company\u2019s optimism for olpasiran, a small interfering RNA drug designed to reduce lipoprotein(a) in late-stage development, and Tezspire, which is approved for severe uncontrolled asthma and has shown phase 2 promise for COPD.\n\nAnd like many companies, Amgen is playing its hand in the obesity space. Its GLP-1 candidate, MariTide, which it is developing to go up against competition like Ozempic, reported an average weight loss of up to 20% at week 52 without a weight loss plateau in a phase 2 study.\n\n\u201cWhilst there are two companies in the market today, there appears to be plenty of room for treatment options that are differentiated, whether that\u2019s through a differentiated weight loss profile or a differentiated dosing profile or the ability to treat other disorders,\u201d he said.",

(NASDAQ:AMGN) stands against the other undervalued stocks.\n\nHow Will Tariffs Affect the Market?\n\nOn March 5th, BBC reported that the US stock market had fallen after the tariffs sparked trade war fear. The recent imposition of tariffs by President Donald Trump on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China has sparked significant concerns about a potential trade war. The United States has imposed a 25% tariff on most imports from these countries, with Canadian energy products facing a 10% tariff. On the other hand, tariffs on Chinese imports have been increased from 10% to 20%. As a result, Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau announced immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of US goods, with plans for additional tariffs on $125 billion in goods over the next three weeks. Moreover, China imposed tariffs ranging from 10% to 15% on various US agricultural imports, such as chicken, pork, and soybeans. The tariffs have raised fears of inflation and a broader trade conflict, leading to a decline in US and global stock markets. As a result, the S&P 500 experienced a significant drop, and European markets also closed lower.\n\nToday, Richard Fisher, former Dallas Fed president, appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the recent tariffs and their impact on the market. Fisher stated that a tariff is a cost factor that goes into producing and distributing a product, making it a form of tax. Business operators of all sizes have to figure out a way to protect their margins against the impact. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve has to gauge the amount of revenue it would generate from these tariffs considering it is slowing down the economy and can cause inflation as the companies will have to raise prices to maintain their margins. Moreover, Richard Fisher noted that such tariffs take a long to be digested, as businesses don\u2019t change something overnight. The only way for companies to maintain their margins without increasing prices is by increasing productivity, which again does not happen overnight and takes time.\n\nWhile talking about how the Fed might react to the tariffs, Fisher mentioned that it is a little too early to guess. The Fed is bringing inflation down and we are getting closer to the 2% target, however, at the same time tariff increases the cost of doing business, which might slow down the economy and tickle up inflation. To conclude Fisher noted that tariffs won\u2019t be digested quickly and will take time.",

Notably, Amgen's recent Horizon Therapeutics acquisition, announced in 2024, and their continued investment like the US$1 billion expansion in North Carolina, have showcased their commitment to growth and innovation. This aligns with robust buyback activities, highlighted by the repurchase of 718,799 shares worth US$200.01 million from October to December 2024, signaling confidence in the company's valuation.\n\nAmgen's FDA approval of LUMAKRAS\u00ae in combination with Vectibix in 2025 for treating KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer and successful Phase III results for TEZSPIRE\u00ae further underscore their advancements in therapeutics. Despite a challenging profit landscape, with earnings declining at 9% annually over the past five years, these strategic maneuvers and product approvals have enabled Amgen to outperform the US Biotechs industry, which faced a 7.6% decline over the past year.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

            "content": "We know that weight loss drugs have been big winners for the companies that produce them. And now, biotech stock Amgen (AMGN) looks to get in on that action itself. Two new late-stage trials have kicked off, and brings Amgen that much closer to bellying up for a slice of the pie, even if many of those taking such drugs are no longer especially interested in pie. Shareholders are cautiously optimistic, and shares were up fractionally in Wednesday afternoon\u2019s trading.\n\nAmgen\u2019s MariTide, reports note, is coming up for two key late-stage trials, and if these actually go well, could give Amgen a shot at a market that is currently explosively popular. So far, things are going well, according to executive vice president of research and development Dr. Jay Bradner. In fact, MariTide has one major advantage over many of its cohorts: it is a monthly injection, where many of its competitors are weekly.\n\nMariTide is part of the GLP-1 market, which, when introduced into the body, acts like certain key hormones that reduce appetite and manage blood sugar. And with close to 15 million people currently having a prescription for GLP-1s, that suggests a major market afoot. With some drugs recently coming off shortages, and thus socking compounding pharmacies with a potential loss in the market, there will likely be room for another major player in this sector.\n\nImprovements On The Nose\n\nBut weight loss drugs are not Amgen\u2019s only iron in the fire right now. In fact, it is working with AstraZeneca (AZN) on a new treatment known as Tezspire. Tezspire addresses \u201c\u2026chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps\u2026,\u201d and once it gets a little farther, the duo will be able to present its case to the Food and Drug Administration for approval.\n\nThis is actually good news for Amgen, because several of its main products are starting to come off patent and will thus face threat from generic replacements. For instance, Enbrel and Otezla are both set to come off patent, and those two together represented $1.6 billion in revenue just in 2024\u2019s fourth quarter.\n\nIs Amgen a Buy, Sell or Hold?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on AMGN stock based on 11 Buys, six Holds and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 17.09% rally in its share price over the past year, the average AMGN price target of $333.50 per share implies 5.48% upside potential.\n\nSee more AMGN analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd. or Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.), the performance of Otezla\u00ae (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), our acquisitions of Teneobio, Inc., ChemoCentryx, Inc., or Horizon Therapeutics plc (including the prospective performance and outlook of Horizon's business, performance and opportunities, any potential strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities expected as a result of such acquisition, and any projected impacts from the Horizon acquisition on our acquisition-related expenses going forward), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems on our business, outcomes, progress, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nNo forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize any of the strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities arising from the Horizon acquisition, and such benefits, synergies or opportunities may take longer to realize than expected. We may not be able to successfully integrate Horizon, and such integration may take longer, be more difficult or cost more than expected. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach of our information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\n\nCONTACT: Amgen, Thousand Oaks\n\nElissa Snook, 609-251-1407 (media)\n\nJustin Claeys, 805-313-9775 (investors)\n\nSOURCE Amgen",

With a market cap of $165.5 billion, the company focuses on human therapeutics and concentrates on innovating novel medicines based on cellular and molecular biology.\n\nCompanies worth $10 billion or more are generally described as \u201clarge-cap stocks,\u201d and AMGN perfectly fits that description, with its market cap exceeding this mark, underscoring its size, influence, and dominance within the general drug manufacturers industry. AMGN has a diverse and innovative product portfolio, including blockbuster drugs like Prolia, ENBREL, and XGEVA. Amgen's robust pipeline features potential first-in-class medicines. With operations worldwide, Amgen has established a strong market presence and international sales growth, diversifying revenue and mitigating market-specific risks.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nDespite its notable strength, AMGN slipped 10.4% from its 52-week high of $346.85, achieved on Jul. 25, 2024. Over the past three months, AMGN stock gained 11.7%, outperforming the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLV) 1.9% gains during the same time frame.\n\nIn the longer term, shares of AMGN rose 19.2% on a YTD basis and climbed 10.9% over the past 52 weeks, outperforming XLV\u2019s YTD gains of 8.7% and 2.2% returns over the last year.\n\nTo confirm the bullish trend, AMGN has been trading above its 50-day moving average since late January. The stock is trading above its 200-day moving average since late February, with slight fluctuations.\n\nAmgen's outperformance is attributed to its commitment to biopharmaceutical innovation for the aging population. Amgen is also exploring oncology and cardiovascular disease, with a strong pipeline of new drugs. Strategic acquisitions, like Horizon Therapeutics, enhance its rare disease portfolio. Moreover, the company proactively launches biosimilars to maintain market presence, which drives further growth.\n\nOn Feb. 4, AMGN reported its Q4 results and its shares closed up more than 6% in the following trading session. Its adjusted EPS of $5.31 surpassed Wall Street expectations of $5.03. The company\u2019s revenue was $9.1 billion, beating Wall Street forecasts of $8.9 billion. AMGN expects full-year adjusted EPS in the range of $20 to $21.20, and expects revenue to be between $34.3 billion and $35.7 billion.\n\nIn the competitive arena of general drug manufacturers, Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) has taken the lead over AMGN, showing resilience with a 20.4% gain on a YTD basis and an 18.9% uptick over the past 52 weeks.\n\nWall Street analysts are moderately bullish on AMGN\u2019s prospects. The stock has a consensus \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating from the 30 analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $317.58 suggests a potential upside of 2.2% from current price levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "Amgen (AMGN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this world's largest biotech drugmaker have returned +7.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.3% change. The Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, to which Amgen belongs, has gained 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAmgen is expected to post earnings of $4.18 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.3%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $20.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +4%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.34 indicates a change of +3.4% from what Amgen is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.8%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amgen is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Amgen, the consensus sales estimate of $8.01 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.5%. The $35 billion and $35.46 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.7% and +1.3%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmgen reported revenues of $9.09 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.9%. EPS of $5.31 for the same period compares with $4.71 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.86 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.54%. The EPS surprise was +5.57%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmgen is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amgen. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nOnly $1 to See All Zacks' Buys and Sells\n\nWe're not kidding.\n\nSeveral years ago, we shocked our members by offering them 30-day access to all our picks for the total sum of only $1.

Credit: Emily Frost / Shutterstock.\n\nAmgen and AstraZeneca have reported complete outcomes from the registrational Phase III WAYPOINT trial of Tezspire (tezepelumab-ekko) for treating chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP).\n\nThe trial showed that treatment with the therapy decreased the severity of nasal polyps and congestion at week 52, as well as the need for surgery and the use of systemic corticosteroid.\n\nSeverity of nasal polyps and congestion were measured using the measurements of co-primary endpoints, Nasal Polyp Score (NPS), and participant-reported Nasal Congestion Score (NCS).\n\nThe results highlight the therapy\u2019s impact on reducing the need for nasal polyp surgery by 98% and systemic corticosteroid treatment by 88% against placebo.\n\nThey reflect Tezspire\u2019s mechanism of action, which targets the primary source of inflammation at the airway epithelium.\n\nAmgen research and development executive vice-president Jay Bradner said: \u201cChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is a recurrent condition often requiring repeat courses of systemic corticosteroids, even for patients on currently available biologics, and can require repeat surgeries.\n\n\u201cThe WAYPOINT data highlight the potential of targeting inflammation at the epithelium to provide lasting relief for those with CRSwNP, adding to the efficacy profile that has been well established for Tezspire in severe asthma.\u201d\n\nDeveloped jointly by AstraZeneca and Amgen, tezepelumab is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) activity.\n\nThe companies updated their partnership agreement in 2020, with AstraZeneca overseeing the drug\u2019s general development and Amgen leading manufacturing, sharing expenses and profits equally.\n\nGovernance of the partnership is overseen by joint bodies, with Amgen recognising sales of Tezspire in the US and AstraZeneca in Canada.\n\nAstraZeneca also leads commercialisation outside North America.\n\nAstraZeneca recently reported positive outcomes from a planned interim analysis of a Phase III trial of camizestrant with a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor for treating hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.",

            "content": "While regulatory preparations are underway, powerhouse partners AstraZeneca and Amgen continue to beef up their case for the expansion of the subcutaneous antibody Tezspire into chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.\n\nFull data from the Phase III WAYPOINT trial showed Tezspire could elicit a more than 2-point reduction in the Nasal Polyp Score (NPS) at 52 weeks versus placebo. Similarly, the biologic lowered patient-reported Nasal Congestion Score (NCS) by more than 1 point as compared with placebo. Both treatment effects were highly statistically significant, according to the companies\u2019 announcement.\n\nAside from hitting its co-primary endpoints NPS and NCS, Tezspire also aced key secondary outcomes, including the time to first use of a systemic glucocorticoid, loss of smell, total symptom score and the time before patients decide to undergo surgical removal of their polyps. Tezspire also reduced the need for subsequent surgery by 98% and for systemic corticosteroids by 88%, according to the companies.\n\nAstraZeneca and Amgen presented the data Saturday at a late-breaking oral presentation at the Joint Congress of the American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and World Allergy Organization, held in San Diego.\n\nIn an investor note on Sunday, analysts at Leerink Partners also took the WAYPOINT readout as a positive for Amgen and AstraZeneca, noting that Tezspire \u201cdemonstrated marginally better efficacy cross-trial vs. Dupixent,\u201d with better NPS and NCS improvements.\n\nStill, the analysts cautioned that cross-study comparisons could be fraught, particularly given \u201ctrial inclusion differences.\u201d WAYPOINT, in particular, \u201cenrolled a more selective group regarding respiratory comorbidities, but a broader population in terms of prior surgery,\u201d the analysts noted.\n\nSharon Barr, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals R&D at AstraZeneca, said Saturday\u2019s readout points to the \u201cpotential of Tezspire to provide a much-needed option for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP).\u201d\n\n\u201cWith its first-in-class mode of action, targeting TSLP [thymic stromal lymphopoietin] at the top of the inflammatory cascade, the data add to the body of evidence that tezepelumab can transform care for patients with epithelial-driven inflammatory diseases,\u201d Barr added.\n\nTSLP is a cytokine that is a crucial upstream player in the inflammatory cascade. Tezspire, a humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody, works by binding to TSLP and preventing its interaction with its corresponding receptor, thereby disrupting the inflammation pathway.\n\nThis mechanism of action won it the FDA\u2019s approval for severe asthma in December 2021, backed by data from the Phase III NAVIGATOR trial, where Tezspire significantly reduced the annualized rate of asthma exacerbations versus placebo, while also eliciting improvements in lung function, symptom burden, disease control and quality of life. Tezspire can only be used in patients aged 12 and above.\n\nIn its fourth-quarter business presentation, Amgen disclosed that it was preparing to file regulatory submissions for Tezspire in CRSwNP in the first half of 2025. Beyond asthma and CRSwNP, AstraZeneca and Amgen are studying Tezspire for other inflammatory respiratory indications, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and eosinophilic esophagitis.",

( ) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 40.5x P/E ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.\n\nAmgen could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\n\nIs There Enough Growth For Amgen?\n\nIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .\n\nThere's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Amgen's to be considered reasonable.\n\nRetrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 39% decrease to the company's bottom line. As a result, earnings from three years ago have also fallen 26% overall. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.\n\nTurning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 27% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 11% per year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.\n\nIn light of this, it's understandable that Amgen's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From Amgen's P/E?\n\nWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.\n\nWe've established that Amgen maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.\n\nWe don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find (1 is significant!) that you need to be mindful of.\n\nOf course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Amgen.

            "content": "Listen to the article 10 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nNovo Nordisk had, for all intents and purposes, a very good year in 2024. So why did CEO Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen see a compensation increase only in line with inflation?\n\nFor Big Pharma CEOs, compensation can swing drastically year to year \u2014 from base salary to bonus incentives to stock options and more, the performance of the company and the overall industry plays a major role. But there are many other factors at play, as well.\n\nFor example, 2023 showcased major fluctuations in pay among U.S. leaders. David Ricks, CEO of Eli Lilly, saw double-digit compensation growth that year, spurred by sales growth of its GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs. The company became the biggest pharma by market cap, and Ricks took home 24% more in overall pay in 2023. On the other end of the spectrum, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla took a 35% hit in compensation in 2023 after sales of its COVID-19 vaccine were in free fall.\n\nAmerican pharma companies have yet to reveal final CEO pay for 2024, but several European pharmas have made the information public, revealing just how closely tied pay incentives are to specific targets.\n\nOutside the U.S., CEOs are compensated similarly, but tend to have lower overall takehome pay than their American counterparts. And a number of factors beyond company performance and trigger adjustments in CEO pay \u2014 even causing them to fall when sales up up. Here, we\u2019re looking at those unique factors that impacted compensation for four CEOs last year.\n\nEmma Walmsley, CEO, GSK\n\n2024 compensation: $13.3 million\n\n2023 compensation: $16.2 million\n\nDecrease: 18%\n\nGSK\u2019s top executive saw her total compensation package fall 18% in 2024 from the year prior, according to the company\u2019s annual report. It\u2019s a stark difference from 2023, when Emma Walmsley saw the biggest pay increase from the prior year \u2014 51% \u2014 across the industry.\n\nThe U.K.-based company reported a 33% fall in operating profit for the year, driven by a $2.3 billion settlement to resolve thousands of lawsuits regarding its cancer drug Zantac. The drugmaker\u2019s vaccine sales also fell during the year, although total portfolio sales for the year were up 7%, and its stock price rose after the 2024 results were announced last month.\n\nAmid the turbulence, Walmsley didn\u2019t reap big returns in compensation. And GSK appears to be worried about \u201cretention risk\u201d due to her low pay when compared to industry peers. In the annual report, GSK noted that Walmsley\u2019s pay was more in line \u201cwith \u2018[No.] 2\u2019 roles in our peer group,\u201d and the gap between the CEO and CFO compensation was 40% less at GSK than the group average.\n\nTo fix the gap, GSK plans to move toward a higher pay package for its CEO that is more in line with biopharma peers. With a maximum 50% share price increase, Walmsley could earn up to $27.2 million in 2025.\n\nGSK also started off 2025 with a bang by announcing its $1 billion acquisition of cancer drugmaker IDRx at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in January. It was one of a handful of billion-dollar-plus deals revealed at the industry event, potentially signaling an M&A rebound for the year.\n\nLars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen, CEO, Novo Nordisk\n\n2024 compensation: $8 million (57.1 million DKK)\n\n2023 compensation: $9.5 million (68.2 million DKK)\n\nDecrease: 16%\n\nSwiss-based Novo Nordisk announced positive year-end results last month, with operating profit rising 25% and North American sales jumping 30% in 2024. Sales within the obesity and diabetes business, which includes its ultra-popular GLP-1 medications Ozempic and Wegovy, also increased 26%.\n\nDespite the successes, Novo\u2019s CEO still saw compensation fall compared to the prior year.The company\u2019s structure ensured that Lars J\u00f8rgensen\u2019s base salary only increased by 3.5% compared to 2023, in line with all employees in the company and considered as a general salary inflation increase.\n\nThe lower overall pay stems from even higher growth in 2023, when global sales and operating profit were up 36% and 44%, respectively. Therefore, J\u00f8rgensen didn\u2019t receive as high a payout for both short- and long-term incentives, Novo said in its report. Novo also took a stock price hit toward the end of 2024 after disappointing clinic results for its R&D hopeful CagriSema, a next-generation obesity med.\n\nPlus, the company failed to deliver on its DEI promises, which may have factored into J\u00f8rgensen\u2019s decline in compensation, according to Fortune. Within its short-term incentive program, Novo didn\u2019t reach its goals for increasing diversity and inclusion. While the company noted progress, it was less than desired, but all 12 other STIP targets were achieved, according to the report.\n\nThe failure comes as the U.S. is embattled in a culture war over DEI in public institutions and companies. The Trump administration\u2019s crusade to end DEI efforts at government agencies has crossed over to some large U.S. companies, although many pharmas, such as Sanofi, are still investing in their diversity goals.\n\nNovo is aiming to achieve gender parity in senior leadership positions, with a minimum of 45% women and 45% men in senior leadership positions by the end of 2025. The share of women in leadership roles reached 42% in 2024, Fortune reported.\n\nVas Narasimhan, CEO, Novartis\n\n2024 compensation: $21.2 million (19.2 million Swiss francs)\n\n2023 compensation: $18 million (16.2 million Swiss francs)\n\nIncrease: 15%\n\nWith net income up 45% in 2024, Novartis achieved strong financial results for its \u201cfirst full year as a pure-play innovative medicines company,\u201d CEO Vas Narasimhan said in the company\u2019s year-end earnings announcement. The Swiss pharma saw better-than-expected sales for several drugs at the end of the year, including the heart failure med Entresto, which will lose exclusivity this year, as well as cancer drugs Kesimpta and Kisqali, according to Reuters.\n\nThe exec\u2019s pay included $8.3 million in long-term incentives, while Narasimham\u2019s base salary rose about 13%. The long-term incentives won\u2019t actually pay out until 2026, however, as Novartis uses a three-year cycle for this variable.\n\n2024 marked a turning point for Novartis as it focused on its four core therapeutic areas \u2014 cardiovascular-renal-metabolic, immunology, neuroscience and oncology. The company snagged FDA approvals for a new kidney disease medication, expanded approval for Kisqali and accelerated approval for its leukemia drug Scemblix. Looking ahead, Narasimham anticipates 15 \u201csubmission-enabling readouts\u201d over the next few years and upwards of 30 potential new assets,\u201d he said in the earnings announcement.\n\nThomas Schinecker, CEO, Roche\n\n2024 compensation: $11.1 million (10 million Swiss francs)\n\n2023 compensation: $10.6 million (9.6 million Swiss francs)\n\nIncrease: 4.5%\n\nSwiss pharma Roche announced that pharma sales rose 8% in 2024 excluding COVID-19 products. Among the highlights for the year, Roche earned EU approval for its eye injection therapy Vabysmo, which saw a surge in sales at the start of the year despite market competition. In the U.S., Roche also received FDA nods for new cancer and multiple sclerosis drugs. Plus Roche made or announced a handful of acquisitions during the year, including its takeover of cell and gene therapy company Poseida Therapeutics in a deal worth up to $1.5 billion.\n\nSchinecker\u2019s base salary increased nearly $250,000 from 2023, to just under $3.6 million, while his bonuses increased from roughly $3.6 million in 2023 (in the form of shares) to nearly $3.8 million in 2024. Other stock awards, payments and benefits rounded out his total pay package for the year.\n\nThe company\u2019s pipeline includes several late-stage cancer targets, as well immunology and neurology assets, and Schinecker anticipates the pharma will have new readouts in 2025 with potential drug launches in 2026. Roche expects 12 key readouts throughout the year, he said during the company\u2019s earnings call.",

Postmarketing cases of anaphylaxis have been reported. These reactions can occur within hours of administration, but in some instances have a delayed onset (i.e., days). In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient to determine whether to continue or discontinue treatment with TEZSPIRE.\n\nAcute Asthma Symptoms or Deteriorating Disease\n\nTEZSPIRE should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms, acute exacerbations, acute bronchospasm, or status asthmaticus.\n\nAbrupt Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage\n\nDo not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with TEZSPIRE. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy.\n\nParasitic (Helminth) Infection\n\nIt is unknown if TEZSPIRE will influence a patient's response against helminth infections. Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before initiating therapy with TEZSPIRE. If patients become infected while receiving TEZSPIRE and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue TEZSPIRE until infection resolves.\n\nLive Attenuated Vaccines\n\nThe concomitant use of TEZSPIRE and live attenuated vaccines has not been evaluated. The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided in patients receiving TEZSPIRE.\n\nADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 3% ) are pharyngitis, arthralgia, and back pain.\n\nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n\nThere are no available data on TEZSPIRE use in pregnant women to evaluate for any drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Placental transfer of monoclonal antibodies such as tezepelumab-ekko is greater during the third trimester of pregnancy; therefore, potential effects on a fetus are likely to be greater during the third trimester of pregnancy.\n\nPlease see the full Prescribing Information including Patient Information and Instructions for Use.\n\nYou may report side effects related to AstraZeneca products by clicking here.\n\nAbout TEZSPIRE\u00ae (tezepelumab-ekko)\n\nTEZSPIRE is a first-in-class human monoclonal antibody that works on the primary source of inflammation: the airway epithelium, which is the first point of contact for viruses, allergens, pollutants and other environmental insults. Specifically, TEZSPIRE targets and blocks TSLP, a key epithelial cytokine that sits at the top of multiple inflammatory cascades and initiates an overreactive immune response to allergic, eosinophilic and other types of airway inflammation associated with severe asthma.18,19 TSLP is released in response to multiple triggers associated with asthma exacerbations, including allergens, viruses and other airborne particles.\n\nExpression of TSLP is increased in the airways of patients with asthma and has been correlated with disease severity.8,18 Blocking TSLP may prevent the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells, resulting in the prevention of asthma exacerbations and improved asthma control.18-20 By working at the top of the cascade, TEZSPIRE helps stop inflammation at the source and has the potential to treat a broad population of severe asthma patients.10,18,21\n\nTEZSPIRE is currently approved for the treatment of severe asthma in the U.S. , Europe, Japan, and more than 50 countries across the globe.22-25 It is approved as a pre-filled, single-use pen and auto-injector for self-administration in the U.S. and Europe .22, 23\n\nBeyond severe asthma and CRSwNP, TEZSPIRE is also in development for other potential indications including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).26,27 Regulatory filings for TEZSPIRE in CRSwNP are currently under review by regulatory authorities in multiple regions. In October 2021, tezepelumab was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of EoE. In July 2024, the U.S. FDA granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for tezepelumab for the add-on maintenance treatment of patients with moderate to very severe COPD characterised by an eosinophilic phenotype.\n\nAbout Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP [nasal polyps])\n\nCRSwNP is a complex inflammatory disorder characterized by persistent inflammation of the nasal mucosa accompanied by benign growths, called nasal polyps.4,5 Nasal polyps can block nasal passages and lead to breathing problems, difficulty in sense of smell, nasal discharge, facial pain, sleep disturbance and other adverse effects on quality of life.6-8\n\nEpithelial dysfunction and inflammation are important characteristics of chronic rhinosinusitis and impede the ability of the epithelium to act as a physical and immunological barrier against the external environment.9 Estimates suggest that up to 56% of patients with CRSwNP have comorbid asthma. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an epithelial cytokine that has been implicated in shared pathophysiological processes underlying severe asthma and CRSwNP.10,11\n\nCurrent treatments for CRSwNP include intranasal and/or systemic corticosteroids, surgery and biologic medication.5,8,12-17\n\nAbout the Phase 3 WAYPOINT Trial\n\nWAYPOINT is a double-blind, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tezepelumab in adults with severe CRSwNP.1,2,3 Participants received tezepelumab or placebo, administered via subcutaneous injection. The trial also included a post-treatment follow-up period of 12-24 weeks for participants who completed the 52-week treatment period.1,2,3\n\nThe co-primary endpoints of the trial were change from baseline in total nasal polyp size, measured by the endoscopic total Nasal Polyp Score, and change from baseline in bi-weekly mean nasal congestion, measured by the participant-reported Nasal Congestion Score evaluated as part of the daily Nasal Polyposis Symptom Diary.3\n\nKey secondary endpoints included loss of smell; improvement in disease-specific health-related quality of life as measured by SinoNasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) score; Lund-Mackay score; time to surgery decision and/or systemic corticosteroids for nasal polyposis; time to nasal polyposis surgery decision; time to systemic corticosteroids for nasal polyposis; Nasal Polyposis Symptom Diary total symptom score and pre-bronchodilator FEV1 in patients with comorbid asthma and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease/NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (NSAID-ERD) at Week 52.3\n\nAbout the Amgen and AstraZeneca Collaboration\n\nIn 2020, Amgen and AstraZeneca updated the 2012 collaboration agreement for TEZSPIRE. Both companies will continue to share costs and profits equally after payment by AstraZeneca of a mid-single-digit royalty to Amgen. AstraZeneca continues to lead development and Amgen continues to lead manufacturing. All aspects of the collaboration are under the oversight of joint governing bodies. Under the amended agreement, in North America , Amgen, as the principal, recognizes product sales of TEZSPIRE in the United States , and AstraZeneca, as the principal, recognizes product sales of TEZSPIRE in Canada . AstraZeneca leads commercialization for TEZSPIRE outside North America .\n\nAbout Amgen\n\nAmgen discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative medicines to help millions of patients in their fight against some of the world's toughest diseases.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd. or Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.), the performance of Otezla\u00ae (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), our acquisitions of Teneobio, Inc., ChemoCentryx, Inc., or Horizon Therapeutics plc (including the prospective performance and outlook of Horizon's business, performance and opportunities, any potential strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities expected as a result of such acquisition, and any projected impacts from the Horizon acquisition on our acquisition-related expenses going forward), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems on our business, outcomes, progress, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nNo forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.\n\nOur results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions.

            "content": "WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Full results from the positive Phase III WAYPOINT trial showed AstraZeneca and Amgen\u2019s TEZSPIRE\u00ae (tezepelumab-ekko) significantly reduced nasal polyp severity, the need for subsequent surgery, and systemic corticosteroid use in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) compared to placebo.1,2 These data were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented today as a late-breaking oral presentation at the American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI)/World Allergy Organization (WAO) Joint Congress in San Diego, CA.1,2\n\nTreatment with TEZSPIRE significantly reduced nasal polyp severity measured by the co-primary endpoints; Nasal Polyp Score (NPS) by -2.065 (95% CI: -2.389, -1.742; p<0.0001) and nasal congestion (measured by participant-reported Nasal Congestion Score [NCS]) by -1.028 (95% CI: -1.201, -0.855; p<0.0001) at week 52 compared to placebo.1,2 Improvements in NPS were observed as early as week four and NCS as early as week two (the first post-treatment assessment respectively) and were sustained through week 52.1\n\nStatistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements were observed across all key secondary outcomes assessed in the overall trial population.1 Importantly, TEZSPIRE significantly reduced the need for subsequent nasal polyp surgery by 98% (p<0.0001) and the need for systemic corticosteroid treatment by 88% ( p<0.0001) compared to placebo.1\n\nDr Joseph Han, Vice Chair of Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Old Dominion University, US, and co-primary investigator in the trial, said: \u201c Many patients living with nasal polyps are at risk of repeat surgeries and serious systemic side effects from long-term oral corticosteroids. The WAYPOINT results are clinically meaningful and suggest that tezepelumab could greatly reduce the burden of nasal polyps for patients by nearly eliminating the need for future surgery and corticosteroid use and by significantly reducing nasal polyp size and congestion.\u201d\n\nSharon Barr, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D said, \u201c The WAYPOINT results demonstrate the potential for TEZSPIRE to provide a much-needed option for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. With its first-in-class mode of action, targeting TSLP at the top of the inflammatory cascade, the data add to the body of evidence that tezepelumab can transform care for patients with epithelial-driven inflammatory diseases.\u201d\n\nTable M1: Summary of co-primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints1,2\n\nEndpoint Tezepelumab (n=203) Placebo (n=205) Difference vs. Placebo (95% CI) Co-primary endpoints Total nasal polyp score (range 0-8)* -2.458 (0.114) -0.392 (0.118) -2.065 (-2.389, -1.742) p<0.0001** Nasal congestion score (range 0-3)* -1.743 (0.062) -0.715 (0.064) -1.028 (-1.201, -0.855) p<0.0001** Key secondary endpoints Assessed in the overall trial population Time to first nasal polyp surgery decision (% patients)*** 0.5 (0.0, 2.5) 22.1 (16.4, 28.2) 0.02 (0.00, 0.09) p<0.0001** Time to first systemic glucocorticoid use (% patients)*** 5.2 (1.1, 14.7) 18.3 (13.3, 24.1) 0.12 (0.04, 0.27) p<0.0001** Time to nasal polyp surgery decision and/or systemic glucocorticoid use (% patients)*** 5.7 (1.3, 15.0) 30.6 (24.2, 37.1) 0.08 (0.03, 0.17) p<0.0001** Loss of smell score (range 0-3)* -1.26 (0.06) -0.26 (0.06) -1.00 (-1.18, -0.83) p<0.0001** Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) total score (range 0-110)* -45.02 (1.81) -17.76 (1.84) -27.26 (-32.32, -22.21) p<0.0001** Sinus Computed Tomography Lund\u2013Mackay (CT-LMK) score (range 0-24)* -6.27 (0.24) -0.55 (0.24) -5.72 (-6.39, -5.06) p<0.0001** Total Symptom Score (TSS) (range 0-24)* -10.39 (0.40) -3.50 (0.41) -6.89 (-8.02, -5.76) p<0.0001** Key secondary endpoint Assessed in a subset of patients with co-morbid asthma or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug exacerbated respiratory disease Pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1 in liters)* 0.02 (0.04) 0.03 (0.04) -0.01 (-0.12, 0.11) p=0.9362 *LS mean change (SE) from baseline at Week 52 **Denotes statistically significant at 0.01 level after adjustment for multiplicity.

Postmarketing cases of anaphylaxis have been reported. These reactions can occur within hours of administration, but in some instances have a delayed onset (ie, days). In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient to determine whether to continue or discontinue treatment with TEZSPIRE.\n\nAcute Asthma Symptoms or Deteriorating Disease\n\nTEZSPIRE should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms, acute exacerbations, acute bronchospasm, or status asthmaticus.\n\nAbrupt Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage\n\nDo not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with TEZSPIRE. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy.\n\nParasitic (Helminth) Infection\n\nIt is unknown if TEZSPIRE will influence a patient\u2019s response against helminth infections. Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before initiating therapy with TEZSPIRE. If patients become infected while receiving TEZSPIRE and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue TEZSPIRE until infection resolves.\n\nLive Attenuated Vaccines\n\nThe concomitant use of TEZSPIRE and live attenuated vaccines has not been evaluated. The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided in patients receiving TEZSPIRE.\n\nADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22653%) are pharyngitis, arthralgia, and back pain.\n\nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n\nThere are no available data on TEZSPIRE use in pregnant women to evaluate for any drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Placental transfer of monoclonal antibodies such as tezepelumab-ekko is greater during the third trimester of pregnancy; therefore, potential effects on a fetus are likely to be greater during the third trimester of pregnancy.\n\nPlease see full Prescribing Information, including Patient Information and Instructions for Use.\n\nYou may report side effects related to AstraZeneca products.\n\nNotes\n\nChronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP)\n\nCRSwNP is a complex inflammatory disorder, characterized by persistent inflammation of the nasal mucosa accompanied by benign growths, called nasal polyps.6,7 Nasal polyps and the accompanying inflammation can block nasal passages and lead to breathing problems, difficulty in sense of smell, nasal discharge, facial pain, sleep disturbance and other adverse effects on quality of life.8-10 Current treatments for CRSwNP include intranasal and/or systemic corticosteroids, surgery and biologics.7,10-16\n\nPhase III WAYPOINT trial\n\nWAYPOINT was a double-blind, multi-centre, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tezepelumab in adults with severe CRSwNP.1,2,17 Participants received tezepelumab or placebo, administered via subcutaneous injection.1,2,17 The trial also included a post-treatment follow-up period of 12-24 weeks for participants who completed the 52-week treatment period.1,17\n\nTEZSPIRE\n\nTEZSPIRE\u00ae (tezepelumab) is being developed by AstraZeneca in collaboration with Amgen as a first-in-class human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a key epithelial cytokine that sits at the top of multiple inflammatory cascades and is critical in the initiation and persistence of allergic, eosinophilic, and other types of epithelial-driven inflammation associated with severe asthma and other inflammatory diseases.18,19\n\nTSLP is released in response to multiple epithelial triggers and insults (including allergens, viruses, bacteria, smoke, air pollution and other airborne particles) associated with asthma, CRSwNP, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and other diseases.19,20 Expression of TSLP is increased in these patients and has been correlated with disease severity.10,18 Blocking TSLP can prevent the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells, resulting in the prevention of exacerbations and improved disease control.18,19,21 Tezepelumab acts at the top of the inflammatory cascade and research indicates that targeting TSLP released by the airway and gastrointestinal epithelium may be a potential approach to treating other diseases in the future.18,22,23\n\nTEZSPIRE is approved in the US, the EU and over 60 countries for the add-on maintenance treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with severe asthma.3-5\n\nBeyond CRSwNP, tezepelumab is also in development for other potential indications including COPD and EoE.24,25 In October 2021, tezepelumab was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of EoE. In July 2024, the US FDA granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for tezepelumab for the add-on maintenance treatment of patients with moderate to very severe COPD characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype.\n\nAmgen collaboration\n\nIn 2020, Amgen and AstraZeneca updated a 2012 collaboration agreement for TEZSPIRE. Both companies will continue to share costs and profits equally after payment by AstraZeneca of a mid-single-digit inventor royalty to Amgen. AstraZeneca continues to lead development, and Amgen continues to lead manufacturing. All aspects of the collaboration are under the oversight of joint governing bodies. Under the amended agreement, Amgen and AstraZeneca will jointly commercialize TEZSPIRE in North America. Amgen will record product sales in the US, with AZ recording its share of US profits as Collaboration Revenue. Outside of the US, AstraZeneca will record product sales, with Amgen recording profit share as Other/Collaboration revenue.\n\nAstraZeneca in Respiratory & Immunology\n\nRespiratory & Immunology, part of AstraZeneca BioPharmaceuticals is a key disease area and growth driver to the Company.\n\nAstraZeneca is an established leader in respiratory care with a 50-year heritage and a growing portfolio of medicines in immune-mediated diseases.

            "content": "Although Holz was unclear about the answers to such questions, he did say that anything coming out of Europe or China would obviously be fair game. The pharmaceutical companies would say that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) as part of the Biden administration is incredibly crippling, and the business that needs to be tied up to make the earnings based on that is very challenging for the sector. Adding Trump\u2019s tariffs to the list would complicate the sector possibly more than others, with the tariffs acting as a \u201cthird strike\u201d against the US pharma sector.\n\nTo him, the tariffs are not just about the generics or branded but are rather more about how the biotech or pharmaceutical industry fits into the grander plans around scaling up domestic manufacturing. Most biotech and pharma companies have a significant presence in the US. However, questions of whether they will hire more people in the US compared to Europe or Asia and whether they will bring back more business to America still stand without answers.\n\nOn February 21, Jared Holz, Mizuho Securities America\u2019s healthcare sector strategist, appeared on CNBC to talk about these tariffs and the ways they could affect the US pharmaceutical sector. Although he was unclear about the exact intention behind these tariffs, he said that he did not consider the pharmaceutical industry to be all that special with respect to other verticals, including technology and industrials, such that President Trump would intend to enlarge its presence in the US.\n\n\u201cSo the tariffs will go forward, yes, and we\u2019re going to make up a lot of territory,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe claimed that foreign nations have been taking advantage of the US in \u201cjust about everything,\u201d reiterating his plans to impose \u201creciprocal tariffs.\u201d\n\nOn February 24, CNBC reported that President Trump declared that sweeping US tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada \u201cwill go forward\u201d in a statement before the expiry of their month-long delay on their implementation. When asked about the postponed tariffs at a White House press conference, President Trump said:\n\nWe recently published a list of the 10 Best Vaccine Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN ) stands against the other best vaccine store stocks to buy now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDelving deeper into the topic, Holz said that building up manufacturing capacities and facilities from scratch is not as easy as it sounds and requires multiple years to reach a point where companies can produce at a high rate. Therefore, he is unclear about the impact of tariffs on the production capacity and on-shoring of pharma companies.\n\nWe recently discussed what Trump\u2019s tariffs could mean for the healthcare industry and looked at another analyst\u2019s perspective on the topic in a recently published article on 12 Most Oversold Healthcare Stocks to Buy Now. Here is an excerpt from the article:\n\n\u201cSince more and more companies in the US are looking towards China for deals regarding the next promising molecule, whether in the obesity or cancer space, the impact of tariffs on this ongoing trend has become a subject of significant discussion in the healthcare industry. On February 7, Carlo Rizzuto, Versant Ventures managing director, appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u2018Fast Money\u2019 to discuss the impact of tariffs on healthcare. Rizzuto believed that there are two ways in which tariffs could impact the industry. The first would be products innovated in China and brought over to the US or other markets. To understand how the tariffs would affect such trade processes, the industry would have to see how the tariffs are actually structured in the market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 20 vaccine stocks. We then selected the top 10 most popular stocks among elite hedge funds as of Q4 2024. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Amgen Inc. (AMGN) the Best Retirement Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA pharmacist filling a prescription for a complex drug developed by the company.\n\nAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 72\n\nAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a biotechnology company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets human therapeutics.

The company ended fiscal Q4 2024 with 14 medicines, each annualizing at more than $1 billion. Several of these are expected to be key growth drivers for the company through the decade.\n\nAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) also has a strong portfolio for rare diseases, which is expected to expand in 2025 with the potential regulatory approval for TEPEZZA internationally, the first and only FDA-approved medicine to treat Thyroid Eye Disease (TED). Launches in new indications for UPLIZNA, which treats neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), are expected to further strengthen the growth trajectory of the company\u2019s rare disease business.\n\nRepatha, which treats cholesterol and heart disease, and EVENITY, which targets osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, are drugs continually delivering strong growth for the company. Repatha has developed into a multi-billion dollar product. Heart disease, the leading cause of death worldwide, is further driving its growth. Analysts are bullish on the stock as its October 2023 acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics is expected to pay off in the next five years. The company ranks fifth on our list of the best vaccine stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nPGIM Jennison Health Sciences Fund stated the following regarding Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a large-cap global biotech company with a diverse portfolio of marketed and pipeline products. Amgen\u2019s discovery pipeline had led the company to broaden its focus from oncology, immunology, and renal disease to include musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and neurologic conditions. In addition, Amgen has turned its expertise in antibody manufacturing into a leading position in the development of biosimilars of competitor drugs. Most recently, Amgen shares advanced in 2Q following its announcement that its novel injectable GLP-1 agonist / GIPR antagonist, MariTide, for obesity showed promising interim Phase 2 data and has shown enough promise to warrant advancement into pivotal trials as soon as late 2024. While Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk will remain the market leaders in the diabetes/obesity space, we think there is room for Amgen to carve out a meaningful share of the market with its antibody-peptide conjugate approach that could enable monthly or better dosing for MariTide.\u201d\n\nOverall, AMGN ranks 5th on our list of the best vaccine store stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AMGN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "The GLP-1 weight loss market is a massive one, with some analysts expecting it to be worth around $200 billion by 2031. Hype around weight loss drugs isn't new, but when people are losing more than 20% of their body weight, it creates considerable enthusiasm. And by sharing their results on social media, people are amping up that excitement to a whole new level.\n\nBut to own a top drugmaker like Eli Lilly, which has an incredibly successful pair of GLP-1 drugs in Mounjaro and Zepbound, investors have to pay a significant premium -- 75 times its trailing earnings. That may be a bit steep given how competitive the GLP-1 market could become, as many healthcare companies are vying for a piece of that massive pie.\n\nIf you're looking for a more reasonably priced investment, you may want to consider Amgen (AMGN -2.00%). Here's why I think it can be the best GLP-1 stock to buy this year.\n\nAmgen's weight loss drug only needs to be taken once a month\n\nThe top GLP-1 treatments on the market today require weekly injections. But MariTide, which is Amgen's GLP-1 drug, only needs to be taken once a month. That can make it easier to stay on top of treatments. It may also result in fewer side effects, which is a key consideration for patients, as they may need to stay on their medication for the long term.\n\nWhat's especially promising is that MariTide can help people lose up to 20% of their body weight after a year, per a recent phase 2 trial. While analysts were hoping to see weight loss of up to 25%, the company noted that there didn't appear to be a plateau, suggesting that greater weight loss may be achieved over a longer time frame. And in that study, many people took it less frequently than once a month, which may also have contributed to the slightly underwhelming trial results.\n\nBut focusing just on weight loss numbers could be a mistake for investors. It's also important how well patients tolerate these drugs -- and by requiring fewer injections, MariTide could be a much easier weight loss treatment to maintain over the long haul.\n\nDespite the promising results, the stock remains cheap\n\nThere's hope that MariTide could be the real deal, and take away market share from other GLP-1 drugs in the future. But investors don't appear to be pricing in that potential. Amgen's stock is trading at 41 times its trailing earnings and just 15 times its expected future earnings (based on analyst estimates).\n\nThat's a potential steal. The average stock in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund trades at a multiple of just under 18 times its future profits. In the past 12 months, Amgen's stock has risen by only 8%, as investors don't appear to be overly enthusiastic about its prospects, despite its potential in the GLP-1 drug market.\n\nNot only is it cheap, but it's also a fairly safe investment to hang on to now. Amgen has a diversified portfolio of drugs, several of which generated more than 30% revenue growth (year over year) in the fourth quarter of 2024. Last year, the company also generated $10.4 billion in free cash flow, which is sufficient to cover its dividend payments of $4.8 billion while leaving plenty of money to reinvest in its operations and pay down its debt.\n\nAmgen is a solid stock which could be due for a big rally\n\nWhen Amgen released its recent trial results for MariTide in November and they came in below analysts' expectations, the stock fell drastically. It was an overreaction in the market, and the stock has recovered since then. But its current valuation still doesn't appear to truly price in the potential for MariTide. While the drug isn't approved yet, if it does get the green light, this can be a much more valuable business in the years ahead.\n\nWith its robust portfolio of treatments and strong financials, Amgen is one of the safer ways to invest in a company with a promising GLP-1 drug.",

The company plans to invest $200 million through 2025, with further sustained investments in the coming years, including hiring skilled professionals from India.\n\n\u201cIndia is very important to us and an integral part of our strategy. We plan to make significant investments in the country. We recognise that India has an exceptional talent pool and a dynamic global biotech ecosystem. We plan to employ over 2,000 skilled professionals from India,\u201d said Alex Koehler, Vice President, Head of Digital, Technology and Innovation at Amgen, speaking to Business Today on the sidelines of the 22nd edition of BioAsia 2025\u2014an annual lifesciences and healthcare event that was held this week in Hyderabad. \u201cIndia has the scale and capability that we want to leverage,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAs part of this expansion, Amgen has announced the launch of Amgen India, a new technology and innovation hub in Hyderabad. Located in HITEC City, the centre spans approximately 524,000 square feet across RMZ Tower 110 of Spire and Tower 20 of Nexity, marking a key step in Amgen\u2019s global strategy.\n\nA major focus for Amgen India will be developing and advancing technology solutions, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) and digital transformation. The Hyderabad facility will drive efficiencies across the organisation, supporting areas such as AI, data science, and life sciences.\n\nAmgen is also expanding its pipeline of medicines targeting cancer, heart disease, osteoporosis, inflammatory diseases, and rare conditions. The company sees India as an important centre for leveraging AI and digital solutions to accelerate drug development.\n\n\u201cAI and digital solutions are reshaping how drugs are developed and brought to market. The current process of drug development takes 10 to 15 years, but AI has the potential to reduce this timeframe by half. AI is already being used to identify and target patients for clinical trials, shortening timelines and improving efficiency. AI-driven models allow researchers to simulate millions of scenarios to identify promising drug candidates more quickly,\u201d Koehler added.\n\nHyderabad has positioned itself as a global technology and life sciences hub, attracting leading companies in IT, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology. The city\u2019s strong research ecosystem and skilled workforce made it a natural choice for Amgen\u2019s expansion.\n\n\u201cHyderabad has become a key centre for technology innovation, with a strong ecosystem of IT companies, startups, and research institutions, along with an increasing number of global players in technology, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology, including Amgen. With an initial investment of $200 million, Amgen India will drive digital capabilities across our company to support our pipeline of new medicines,\u201d said Amgen CEO Robert A. Bradway at BioAsia 2025.\n\nBradway also highlighted India\u2019s healthcare challenges, particularly the burden of cardiovascular disease in South Asia. \u201cCardiovascular disease is a significant challenge in South Asia. In 2022, the region had more than 36 million cases of ischaemic heart disease, leading to 2 million deaths. If we look at data from 2019, nearly 40% of cardiovascular deaths in South Asia were among people younger than 70, compared to fewer than 25% in the United States and Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cExpanding access to innovation is essential to addressing the burden of cardiovascular disease,\u201d he added.\n\nAmgen has nearly 28,000 employees worldwide and operates in around 100 countries. \u201cTalent at Amgen India will contribute to global projects and initiatives, drawing on expertise from our international sites,\u201d said Naveen Gullapalli, Managing Director of Amgen India.\n\nAccording to an analysis by Job Analytics Database of GlobalData, a data and analytics company, Amgen\u2019s hiring strategy in India reflects a strong emphasis on leadership in procurement, technology integration, and data-driven decision-making. The company is focused on developing and implementing innovative strategies for indirect materials procurement, overseeing data analytics governance, and spearheading efforts to improve procurement processes through technology, it said.\n\nAdditionally, Amgen is looking for professionals to drive end-to-end technology implementation and integrate new solutions to optimise procurement functions, while also focusing on supplier risk, cost analysis, and demand forecasting. GlobalData said that Amgen is prioritising roles for its Hyderabad office to lead pharmacovigilance activities. The company is actively seeking individuals with expertise in cloud technology and generative AI to drive innovation.\n\n\u201cAmgen\u2019s tech and innovation centre in Hyderabad signals a strategic move to enhance its global R&D capabilities. By tapping into India's thriving tech industry and emphasising digital transformation, the US biotech major is looking to recruit tech professionals to integrate cutting-edge data analytics, AI, and digital health technologies into its operations,\u201d said Sherla Sriprada, Business Fundamentals Analyst at GlobalData.\n\nGlobalData stated that the company is focusing on driving efficiencies and prioritising resources. This includes leveraging both automation and its newly established innovation and technology hub in India to enhance digital capabilities, such as artificial intelligence, data science, life sciences, and medical advancements.\n\n\u201cThe recent job postings, along with media reports on potential investment, suggest the company\u2019s commitment to expanding its global footprint and enhancing its capabilities in India,\u201d Sriprada added.",

(NASDAQ:AMGN) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn a recent discussion at CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street', NYU professor and AI expert, Gary Marcus shared his perspective on the limitations of current AI models, the hurdles in enterprise adoption, and the financial sustainability of major AI companies. His insights raise important questions about the future of AI and whether it can truly deliver on its ambitious promises.\n\nAI\u2019s Future Faces Hurdles in Reliability, Costs, and Enterprise Use\n\nGary Marcus challenged the idea that AI will significantly boost GDP growth in the near future, as suggested by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. While Nadella sees AI driving efficiency and benefiting multiple platforms, Marcus argued that the current technology remains unreliable, with persistent hallucinations and logical errors that have yet to be resolved. Despite advancements like Grok 3, which underwent extensive training and required large-scale infrastructure, the fundamental problems of AI accuracy are still there.\n\nHe expressed skepticism about AI\u2019s readiness for enterprise adoption and noted that while models may appear impressive, they still make subtle but costly mistakes, which undermine their reliability. He highlighted examples where AI-generated outputs contained factual errors that could go unnoticed at first but would pose risks for businesses relying on accuracy. Marcus also critiqued AI\u2019s so-called \"reasoning\" abilities, arguing that they rely more on pattern recognition from training data than true logical reasoning, limiting their real-world applicability.\n\nAdditionally, he warned that generative AI is increasingly shifting toward data collection and surveillance as a business model. He pointed toward government monitoring programs and OpenAI\u2019s access to vast amounts of personal and business data, suggesting that AI companies may monetize data rather than achieve widespread enterprise integration due to reliability concerns.\n\nWhile OpenAI is experiencing rapid user growth and generating billions in revenue, Marcus pointed out its high operational costs and continued financial losses. He argued that, unlike traditional software companies, AI firms face significant expenses in building and running models, making long-term profitability uncertain despite their rising valuations.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

However, because having high Lp(a) is almost entirely genetically inherited, lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise do not affect a person\u2019s Lp(a) levels.1\n\nWhile an estimated 20% of people worldwide have elevated Lp(a), African Americans show higher average Lp(a) levels than other populations. Despite this, most Lp(a) research to date focuses on individuals of European descent.2\n\nHear from Dr.\u2019s Ofili and Boer as they discuss the African American Heart Study and its impact in the video below.\n\nThe results of the African American Heart Study are powerful \u2013 they will not only help African American patients understand cardiovascular risk associated with Lp(a), but also help pave the way for greater inclusion of underserved communities in clinical trials. Dr. Ofili believes that other underrepresented groups such as the LatinX community and those that live in rural areas can now see a way to participate in clinical research.\n\n\u201cWhen you empower people in this way, they can see how they can take control of their health,\u201d said Dr. Ofili. \u201cAnd I think that's the power that we're seeing, especially in February, during Black History Month, allowing individuals to know that you're not without agency.\u201d\n\nAmgen is proud to sponsor this important study and is dedicated to promoting diversity in clinical research and tackling health disparities.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) stands against other best retirement stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nAfter much suspense, the US Federal Reserve finally began cutting interest rates in late 2024, dropping the federal funds rate by 75 basis points in two cuts in September and November, with the market expecting further cuts this year. The Fed\u2019s decision came in reaction to falling US inflation and employment market statistics, which suggested that the elusive soft landing was still within reach. However, as February comes to a close, things appear to have changed. For the time being, the Federal Open Market Committee is projected to leave interest rates unchanged on March 19. That\u2019s because the labor market looks to be strong, and inflation is still over goal and slightly increasing. The FOMC\u2019s most recent meeting in January also said that \u201crespondents generally judged that policy rate reductions would occur later than previously assessed,\u201d implying that any reduction (if at all) will occur sometime later in 2025.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, the 65-and-older population in the United States will grow from 58 million in 2022 to 82 million by 2050, when it is expected to account for more than a quarter of the total population. The World Economic Forum further predicts that half of kids born in the United States in 2007 would survive to the age of 103. As such, wages seem to be falling behind inflation as people live longer lives. That\u2019s especially true now that businesses have moved the burden of retirement savings to employees, giving 401(k)s instead of pensions that promise a fixed income each month.\n\nOne dilemma many face as they approach retirement is how much money they will need to live comfortably when they stop working. According to Consumer Expenditure Surveys, the average retiree household in the United States spends around $5,000 per month. With a median 401(k) balance of $210,724 for those aged 60 to 69, implementing the 4% withdrawal rule yields around $702 per month\u2014which, when combined with the average monthly Social Security payment of $1,976, still falls short of meeting basic needs. According to Dan Doonan, executive director of the National Institute on Retirement Security, non-wealthy workers still have insufficient retirement coverage, forcing them to save on their own:",

This was supported by positive results from the late-stage E1910 trial led by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group.\n\nThe study showed that Blincyto added to multiphase consolidation chemotherapy was associated with superior overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) compared to chemotherapy alone.\n\nWith a median follow-up of 4.5 years, the five-year OS was 82.4% in the Blincyto plus chemotherapy cohort versus 62.5% in the chemotherapy group, while the five-year RFS was 77% in the Blincyto/chemotherapy arm versus 60.5% for chemotherapy alone.\n\nApproximately 300 adults are diagnosed with ALL, a type of blood cancer that develops in the bone marrow, in the UK every year, with B-cell ALL accounting for the majority of cases.\n\nAlthough up to 90% of adult patients will achieve an initial haematologic complete remission after front-line treatment, as many as 50% will experience relapse and need a second line of therapy.\n\nAdministered as an intravenous infusion and already approved in the UK to treat certain cases of B-ALL, Blincyto is a bispecific T-cell engager molecule designed to target CD19 surface antigens on B cells. This helps the body\u2019s immune system recognise and destroy cancer cells that might be left behind after initial treatment.\n\nAround 80 adults per year could benefit from the Blincyto combination treatment, which will be available to eligible patients immediately through the NHS.\n\nHelen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE, said: \u201cThis treatment could give patients precious extra months and potentially years with their loved ones.

            "content": "On a bright February morning, around twenty lawyers from each pharmaceutical company filed into the courtroom of the UPC\u2019s D\u00fcsseldorf local division. The atmosphere was tense as presiding judge Ronny Thomas opened the first hearing on the merits concerning second medical use at the UPC (ACT_597355/2023 and CC_24999/2024, UPC_CFI_505/2023).\n\nIn many ways, the scene embodied what generations of lawyers had imagined a UPC hearing would look like before the court began: high stakes, copious lawyers and patent attorneys from different countries, and English as the language of proceedings.\n\nPrevious success for Sanofi\n\nThe race to develop cholesterol-lowering drugs based on PCSK9 inhibitors has been fierce among major pharmaceutical companies. Both plaintiff Sanofi, which partnered with Regeneron, and defendant Amgen were among the first to develop marketable products. In summer 2024, Sanofi and Regeneron already prevailed at the UPC in a case concerning patents for the same drugs. The Munich central division declared Amgen\u2019s EP 3 666 797 invalid for the entire UPC area.\n\nHowever, at this week\u2019s hearing at the D\u00fcsseldorf local division, Sanofi and Regeneron had sued Amgen for infringement of Regeneron\u2019s second medical use patent EP 3 536 712. Amgen had filed a counterclaim for revocation. The court heard both cases together.\n\nThe patent concerns methods for reducing lipoprotein(a) levels by administering a PCSK9 inhibitor. Much of the hearing focused on how standard it was to measure LP(a) levels in clinical research and patient treatment. Regeneron\u2019s second medical use patent seeks to claim the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on a specific lipoprotein, Lp(a).\n\nExtensive legal teams\n\nNiels H\u00f6lder from Munich firm Hoffmann Eitle and Daniel Wise from UK firm Carpmaels & Ransford led arguments for Sanofi.\n\nThe Carpmaels team included Agathe Michel-de Cazotte, Emily Nikoli\u0107, Ekaterina Langford, Hiske Roos, Elizabeth Taylor, and Hadi Godazgar. From Hoffmann Eitle the team comprised Mike Gruber and Michael Pfeifer. J\u00f6rk Zwicker led the patent attorney team from ZSP.\n\nFor Amgen, Johannes Heselberger from Bardehle Pagenberg in Munich and Koen Bijvank from Brinkhof in Amsterdam presented the defence. Bijvank and Heselberger had already led the earlier UPC proceedings in Munich along with Daan de Lange from Brinkhof and Bardehle Pagenberg\u2019s Axel Berger.\n\nIn addition, the extensive team included patent attorneys from df-mp around Ulrich D\u00f6rries. Will James and Trevor Crosse from Osborne Clarke and Lauren Martin from Quinn Emanuel also played a role.\n\nThe bench comprised presiding judge Ronny Thomas, judge rapporteur B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Thom, LQJ Andr\u00e1s Kupecz and TQJ Xavier Dorland-Galliot.",

One of the key reasons is the company\u2019s promising 2025 guidance, which has exceeded expectations and instilled confidence in its financial drivers for the year. Additionally, Amgen\u2019s recent data releases, particularly the MariTide data presented at the ADA and the upcoming Phase III Lp(a) data, have shown significant potential, especially in the obesity and cardiovascular segments.\n\nAnother reason for the Buy rating is the robust performance of Amgen\u2019s products like Repatha, Evenity, and Tezspire, which have demonstrated impressive year-over-year growth. The company also anticipates that the revenue from Evenity will more than offset any erosion from Dmab biosimilars, thanks to its strong prescriber base and chronic dosing patterns. Furthermore, Amgen\u2019s Eylea biosimilar is gaining traction in the market, adding to the company\u2019s growth prospects. These factors collectively contribute to a positive outlook for Amgen\u2019s stock, justifying the Buy recommendation.\n\nAccording to TipRanks, Yee is an analyst with an average return of -2.2% and a 41.18% success rate. Yee covers the Healthcare sector, focusing on stocks such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Gilead Sciences, and Amgen.\n\nIn another report released on February 20, Bernstein also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $350.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

(NASDAQ:AMGN) stands against other best performing Dow stocks so far in 2025.\n\nThe Dow is a renowned and significant stock market index that measures the performance of 30 publicly traded businesses listed on US stock exchanges, representing a diverse variety of industries.\n\nAs of 20 February 2025, the index has steadily increased, rising 14.41% in the last 12 months and 4.21% year to date in 2025. It rose 8.04% over the last six months, mirroring its 8.04% gain in the previous month. Over the long term, it has risen 52.37% in the last five years and has returned an astounding 3,362.55% since 1985.\n\nIn comparison, the broader market has outpaced the Dow, gaining 22% in the last year and 4% year to date in 2025. The wider market has risen 8.84% during the last six months, with a 1.13% increase in the last month. Its long-term performance has been favorable, with a five-year gain of 83.28% and a remarkable 3,717.09% increase since 1996. Its superior performance is largely due to the strength of technology and high-growth stocks.\n\nNonetheless, the Nasdaq has led the market, climbing 28.12% in the last 12 months and 3.53% year to date in 2025. Over the last six months, the Nasdaq has gone up by 11.40%, with 1.04% growth in the last month. Over the last five years, it has surged by 108.45%, proving its dominance in high-growth sectors.\n\nWhile the Dow has fallen behind the other two markets in recent years, its consistency and solid historical returns underline its long-term investment appeal. The index typically has reduced volatility and concentrates on established blue-chip companies.\n\nAccording to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the Dow is still a dependable benchmark for US market performance, following 30 blue-chip businesses with strong reputations and consistent growth. Its price-weighted system ensures stability, typically reducing losses during downturns. The index has a historical association with broader markets, but it is less volatile than the broader market due to its emphasis on well-established firms. Despite its small size, the index has shown resilience in bear markets, such as 2009, while also reaping gains during bullish cycles. Its longstanding reputation and exposure to important industries make it a reliable predictor of economic strength.\n\nHowever, the Dow lost 0.6% on Thursday, February 20, 2025, as U.S. jobless claims surged faster than expected, heightening concerns about the labor market and the overall economic outlook. The wider market fell 0.5%, while the Nasdaq fell 0.7% in early trading, signaling broader market weakness. Investors reacted to economic data and shifting market sentiment as bond yields edged lower, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling to 4.52%.",

The Amgen India facility is spread across 5,24,000 square feet.\n\nInaugurating the facility, Telangana Chief Minister A.

Assuring support to Amgen and recalling his visit and meeting with the firm\u2019s leadership during his visit to the U.S. last year, the Chief Minister said the State is also keen on positioning itself as location to benefit from the China plus one strategy of several global firms. He also urged the company to consider investing more in Hyderabad, enhance the scope of research besides contributing to the efforts of the State government in enhancing skill development.\n\nAmgen chairman Robert A. Bradway said the firm has been wanting to expand to India for sometime. Appreciating Hyderabad for the innovation work it hosts and supporting an enabling ecosystem, he said the company will be investing $200 million by this year and plans to make additional investment in future.

Trump also agreed with India\u2019s Prime Minister Modi on an initiative to collaborate on emerging technologies. Amgen\u2019s site in India is being viewed as a good example of this kind of cooperation.\n\nAmgen is known for its osteoporosis medicine Prolia and arthritis pain relief drug Enbrel. Recently its early-stage obesity asset AMG 513 was placed on clinical hold by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, though Bradway said this was not related to the drug itself. Amgen logged $9.1 billion in total revenues in its Fiscal fourth quarter, an 11% year-on-year increase.\n\nIs AMGN a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nOverall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on AMGN stock, based on 11 Buys, seven Holds and one Sell. The average AMGN price target of $328.75 implies about 8% upside, with the stock up 17% this year.\n\nSee more AMGN analyst ratings\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "The market for Amgen Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMGN) shares didn't move much after it posted weak earnings recently. We did some digging, and we believe the earnings are stronger than they seem.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amgen\n\nNasdaqGS:AMGN Earnings and Revenue History February 21st 2025\n\nA Closer Look At Amgen's Earnings\n\nOne key financial ratio used to measure how well a company converts its profit to free cash flow (FCF) is the accrual ratio. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. You could think of the accrual ratio from cashflow as the 'non-FCF profit ratio'.\n\nTherefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow. That's because some academic studies have suggested that high accruals ratios tend to lead to lower profit or less profit growth.\n\nAmgen has an accrual ratio of -0.11 for the year to December 2024. Therefore, its statutory earnings were quite a lot less than its free cashflow. In fact, it had free cash flow of US$10b in the last year, which was a lot more than its statutory profit of US$4.09b. Amgen shareholders are no doubt pleased that free cash flow improved over the last twelve months. Having said that, there is more to the story. We can see that unusual items have impacted its statutory profit, and therefore the accrual ratio.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nThe Impact Of Unusual Items On Profit\n\nAmgen's profit was reduced by unusual items worth US$2.3b in the last twelve months, and this helped it produce high cash conversion, as reflected by its unusual items. In a scenario where those unusual items included non-cash charges, we'd expect to see a strong accrual ratio, which is exactly what has happened in this case. It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later. When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated. And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies. If Amgen doesn't see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to increase over the coming year.\n\nStory Continues",

The total value of the sale is $593,933.\n\nMonitoring the market, Amgen's shares up by 0.2% at $298.52 during Friday's morning.\n\nUnveiling the Story Behind Amgen\n\nAmgen is a leader in biotechnology-based human therapeutics. Flagship drugs include red blood cell boosters Epogen and Aranesp, immune system boosters Neupogen and Neulasta, and Enbrel and Otezla for inflammatory diseases. Amgen introduced its first cancer therapeutic, Vectibix, in 2006 and markets bone-strengthening drugs Prolia/Xgeva (approved 2010) and Evenity (2019). The acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals bolstered the firm's therapeutic oncology portfolio with Kyprolis. Recent launches include Repatha (cholesterol-lowering), Aimovig (migraine), Lumakras (lung cancer), and Tezspire (asthma). The 2023 Horizon acquisition brought several rare-disease drugs, including thyroid eye disease drug Tepezza. Amgen also has a growing biosimilar portfolio.\n\nUnderstanding the Numbers: Amgen's Finances\n\nRevenue Growth: Amgen's remarkable performance in 3 months is evident. As of 31 December, 2024, the company achieved an impressive revenue growth rate of 10.86%. This signifies a substantial increase in the company's top-line earnings. In comparison to its industry peers, the company trails behind with a growth rate lower than the average among peers in the Health Care sector.\n\nProfitability Metrics:\n\nGross Margin: The company faces challenges with a low gross margin of 65.75% , suggesting potential difficulties in cost control and profitability compared to its peers.\n\nEarnings per Share (EPS): Amgen's EPS lags behind the industry average, indicating concerns and potential challenges with a current EPS of 1.17.\n\nDebt Management: Amgen's debt-to-equity ratio stands notably higher than the industry average, reaching 10.23. This indicates a heavier reliance on borrowed funds, raising concerns about financial leverage.\n\nInsights into Valuation Metrics:\n\nPrice to Earnings (P/E) Ratio: The P/E ratio of 39.41 is lower than the industry average, implying a discounted valuation for Amgen's stock.\n\nPrice to Sales (P/S) Ratio: The Price to Sales ratio is 4.82 , which is lower than the industry average. This suggests a possible undervaluation based on sales performance.\n\nEV/EBITDA Analysis (Enterprise Value to its Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization): The company's EV/EBITDA ratio of 15.59 trails industry averages, indicating a potential disparity in market valuation that could be advantageous for investors.\n\nMarket Capitalization Analysis: Above industry benchmarks, the company's market capitalization emphasizes a noteworthy size, indicative of a strong market presence.\n\nNow trade stocks online commission free with Charles Schwab, a trusted and complete investment firm.\n\nDelving Into the Significance of Insider Transactions\n\nInsider transactions contribute to decision-making but should be supplemented by a comprehensive investment analysis.\n\nWhen discussing legal matters, the term \"insider\" refers to any officer, director, or beneficial owner holding more than ten percent of a company's equity securities, as stipulated in Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This includes executives in the c-suite and significant hedge funds. Such insiders are required to report their transactions through a Form 4 filing, which must be completed within two business days of the transaction.\n\nA new purchase by a company insider is a indication that they anticipate the stock will rise.\n\nOn the other hand, insider sells may not necessarily indicate a bearish view and can be motivated by various factors.\n\nTransaction Codes Worth Your Attention\n\nWhen it comes to transactions, investors tend to focus on those in the open market, detailed in Table I of the Form 4 filing. A P in Box 3 denotes a purchase, while S indicates a sale. Transaction code C signals the conversion of an option, and transaction code A denotes a grant, award, or other acquisition of securities from the company.\n\nCheck Out The Full List Of Amgen's Insider Trades.\n\nInsider Buying Alert: Profit from C-Suite Moves\n\nBenzinga Edge reveals every insider trade in real-time.

She earned her PhD from the University of California Los Angeles in 2019 and has written for Discover Magazine, Quanta Magazine, and the Los Angeles Times. As an assistant editor at DDN, she writes about how microbes influence health to how art can change the brain. When not writing, Stephanie enjoys tap dancing and perfecting her pasta carbonara recipe.\n\nFrom dry eyes to what feels like a mouth full of cotton, people with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome deal with irritating and painful symptoms every day. While there are some medications that can treat the symptoms of this autoimmune condition \u2014 such as eye drops and steroids \u2014 none of these drugs treat the underlying immunological cause of the disease.\n\nIn many autoimmune diseases including Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, the interaction between the cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40) and its ligand becomes over activated, leading to inflammation (1). The CD40 protein is present on B cells, and the CD40 ligand is on interacting T cells. Recently, researchers have seen some success in clinical trials for Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease with drugs that target this pathway (2). One of these promising therapies is Amgen\u2019s fusion protein drug, dazodalibep.\n\nSumita Bhatta is the Vice President, Global Development Therapeutic Area Head, Rare Disease at Amgen. CREDIT: Amgen\n\n\u201cThe innovation that was demonstrated in developing this molecule as a fusion protein just highlights the expertise of our discovery folks who have worked on this for so many years,\u201d said Sumita Bhatta, Vice President, Global Development Therapeutic Area Head, Rare Disease at Amgen.\n\nWith positive Phase 2 data on dazodalibep in people with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease published last summer, Bhatta and her colleagues are currently enrolling two different groups of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease patients into two Phase 3 trials for the drug (3). Her team along with people with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome hope to soon have a therapy that halts the actual cause of the disease.\n\nHow does Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease manifest in patients?\n\nSj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease is a chronic and systemic autoimmune condition. It can be very severe in up to 50 percent of patients where the immune system attacks not only exocrine glands like tear ducts and salivary glands, but also multiple organs within the body (4). This becomes very debilitating for these patients, the majority of whom are women. Despite how frequently this disease occurs, there is no approved medication to treat the underlying cause of this disease or to prevent this autoimmune attack from happening in the first place.\n\nWhat kind of drug is dazodalibep, and how does it work?\n\nDazodalibep is a CD40 ligand antagonist, and it's designed to block the CD40/CD40 ligand pathway. Overactivation of this pathway causes immune system activation in an unchecked fashion at times, and that can result in the inflammation that we see in Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease. Blocking this ligand disrupts the ability of T cells to interact with B cells, thereby not activating that immune cell pathway. In fact, when researchers at Horizon Therapeutics (now a part of Amgen) first developed this drug, they explored it in multiple indications, and the results in Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease prompted its further investigation.\n\nThere have been many previous attempts to block the CD40 ligand. These included monoclonal antibodies that interacted with the CD40 ligand, but they actually activated it in such a way that led to adverse events, including deep vein thromboses and pulmonary embolisms. These side effects were likely related to the Fc portion of those monoclonal antibodies. What's unique about dazodalibep is that as a fusion protein, it\u2019s bound to serum albumin on one side and CD40 ligand on the other, so it doesn't have that Fc region. As a result, it truly blocks the CD40/CD40 ligand interaction in such a way that it doesn\u2019t cause that accidental immune activation and adverse effects.\n\nWhat were the results from your recent Phase 2 trial?\n\nThe Phase 2 data showed a statistically significant improvement in the endpoints that measured drug effectiveness in this disease in both of the populations that we're studying: people who have moderate-to-severe systemic disease activity (population one), and people who have low systemic disease activity but moderate-to-severe symptoms (population two).\n\nThis drug was generally safe and well tolerated, but, as with many trials, there were some adverse events. We will be studying these in the Phase 3 trials as well. For example, since we\u2019re blocking T cell activation, we may need to look for things like infections. We'll know more from our Phase 3 data to determine whether or not the benefits outweigh the risks, but as far as we can tell from Phase 2, this drug was generally safe, well tolerated, and had a good efficacy profile.\n\nThe fact that this trial had encouraging results and now has led us to pursue the Phase 3 trials in the same populations has actually been a nice story in drug development. We hope that the results of the Phase 3 trials will mimic or improve upon what we saw in Phase 2.\n\nWhat challenges have you faced in developing dazodalibep?\n\nA disease that has no effective approved therapies is a little bit of uncharted territory, so we took our time to establish endpoints in our Phase 3 trials that were meaningful for patients. We've incorporated things like Patient Reported Outcomes as endpoints in these trials to really assess the effectiveness of the therapies.\n\nWhat has been most rewarding about studying dazodalibep as a potential drug for Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease?\n\nHere's a disease for which there is no available treatment. To see something that has the potential to improve symptoms for these patients is quite rewarding. I've worked across multiple disease areas now, and I'm incredibly excited to work on a rare disease like Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s because of the potential to make such a dramatic difference for patients who really have no alternative options.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nReferences",

            "content": "by Les Luchter , November 27, 2024\n\nJust in time for the potential weight gains of Thanksgiving weekend, pharma\u2019s Amgen on Tuesday unveiled impressive results for its budding obesity drug MariTide: for participants, up to 20% average weight loss after 52 weeks of trial, with an expectation of further loss after that period.\n\nUnlike such competitors as Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy/Ozempic and Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound/Mounjaro, this potential category killer is injected once a month rather than weekly. MariTide has also been proven effective on an every-two-months basis and will soon be studied as a quarterly regimen, the company noted in a rare non-earnings related call with analysts that followed its announcement.\n\nOther differences shown versus established GLP-1 drugs included the lack of a yo-yo effect, in which weight lost is gained back once patients stop taking the medication, according to Bob Bradway, Amgen chairman and chief executive officer.\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\n\u201cWhen doses were stopped, many patients retained the benefit of weight loss that they enjoyed from the medicine,\u201d explained Jay Bradner, Amgen\u2019s chief scientific officer and executive vice president, research and development \u201cWeight loss remained progressive and did not plateau\u201d as doses were increased,\u201d he added.\n\nThe lack of the yo-yo effect helps explain how Amgen is moving to space doses further and further apart from each other, a clear distinction from the weekly doses of others.\n\nCalling MariTide an \u201cimportant breakthrough,\u201d Susan Sweeney, Amgen\u2019s executive vice president obesity and related conditions, said that beyond obesity and type 2 diabetes, the drug will also be studied for treatment of such conditions as kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea and heart failure.\n\n\"The drug still must go through additional clinical trial phases involving many more patients, and then receive approval from the Food and Drug Administration before being sold to patients,\" according to The New York Times. \"The company has yet to set a price for the drug and did not lay out a timeline for when the drug may become available.\"\n\nThe analysts call ended in time for the opening of the stock market, which didn\u2019t find Amgen\u2019s findings to its liking, as the company\u2019 stock proceeded to drop 4.8%. MariTide\u2019s 20% weight loss figure was no higher than Zepbound\u2019s and had a higher level of side effects, analysts told Investors Business Daily. Furthermore, the publication reported, another pipeline drug, from Viking Therapeutics, had achieved 14.7% weight loss after only 13 weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, stock prices for Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly both rose, which may have more to do with a proposal announced Tuesday by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) than to the news out of Amgen.\n\nThat proposal calls for Medicare and Medicaid programs to start covering obesity drugs, but the final outcome is far from assured. Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the KFF nonprofit, told NBC News that while Dr. Mehmet Oz, Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to head CMS, has praised obesity drugs, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his nominee to head Health & Human Services, which runs CMS, has been skeptical of them.\n\nIn another, unrelated, proposal, the outgoing CMS called for expansion of the Centers\u2019 oversight of Medical Advantage advertising. Under new rules implemented last year, which barred such practices as showing Medicare cards onscreen, using the Medicare name misleadingly, and providing toll-free hot line numbers other than that of the nonprofit Medicare Rights Center, CNS reported that it had prohibited over 1,500 TV ads from being aired.",

(NASDAQ:AMGN) stands against other best drug stocks to buy now.\n\nIs China the Next Big Thing in the Pharmaceutical Industry?\n\nLarge American pharmaceutical companies are showing a distinct trend never seen before: they are increasingly looking for medicines in China. According to data from DealForma, as reported by CNBC, around 30% of Big Pharma deals with at least $50 million upfront in 2024 included Chinese companies. This was up from 20% the year before and almost 0% only five years prior. The surge in China deals is materializing when US policymakers and President Donald Trump are pursuing protectionist policies in technology, such as semiconductors and AI.\n\nVarious reasons are being attributed to this trend. Experts believe that Chinese companies are developing more effective molecules than ever before, that too in large quantities. They are in a position to begin testing these molecules on human subjects quicker and at a lower price than the US. Buyers have devised a business model allowing them to essentially import the medicines through licensing deals, according to CNBC. Biotech companies are further pushed into making these deals due to the drying up of venture funding in China.\n\nDespite varying opinions among experts, there is an industry-wide consensus that this unique trend is here to stay. How this trend might affect the US biotech sector remains unclear at the moment. While some people believe it could potentially ruin American startups if large pharmaceutical companies stumble upon a promising Chinese drug at low price, others believe the competition would be fruitful for the industry. Either way, this trend is anticipated to metamorphose the landscape of the American biopharma sector. CNBC reported that Tim Opler, a managing director in Stifel\u2019s global healthcare group, said the following about the situation:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a watershed moment where the pharma industry is like, \u2018We don\u2019t really need to buy U.S. biotechs necessarily. We will if it makes sense, but we can buy perfectly good biotech assets through licensing deals with Chinese companies.\u201d\n\nWhat Does the Future of the Pharmaceutical Sector Look Like?\n\nEY believes the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity in 2025 compared to 2024, especially if interest rates remain low. Although the industry may see an increase in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, smaller strategic deals are expected to persist throughout the year. The policy environment in the US is undergoing changes due to political impacts on business, such as re-regulation, lower corporate taxes, continued drug pricing reforms, and the possibility of higher tariffs. Other factors that may affect the biotech and pharmaceutical industries include changes in leadership within health agencies and immigration.\n\nA survey by Deloitte showed that drug pricing and access are the top concerns among executives in 2025. The survey also showed that the primary concerns include competition from generic drugs and biosimilars and the looming patent cliff, with over $300 billion in sales at risk due to expiring patents by 2030. Due to this trend, executives anticipate an increase in mergers and acquisitions in 2025.\n\nWe discussed the future of the healthcare industry in the US in a recently published article on the 10 Best Medical Device Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. Here is an excerpt from the article:\n\n\u201cAccording to McKinsey, the healthcare industry is expected to continually undergo a shift in growth dynamics. Health services and technology (HST) revenue pools are anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8% between 2023 and 2028, supported by double-digit growth in software platforms and advanced data and analytics. The sales of innovative technologies such as generative AI to payers and providers are further supporting this growth. In addition, pharmacy services, especially those focused on specialty pharmacy, are expected to see continued growth. The launch of new therapies and increased utilization are expected to be the primary drivers of this growth. McKinsey estimates specialty pharmacy revenue will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8% between 2023 and 2028, growing EBITDA for managed service providers and specialty pharmacies. Therefore, optimistic trends are materializing for the healthcare industry as a whole, including the medical device sector.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 30 drug stocks. We then selected the top 12 most popular stocks among elite hedge funds as of Q3 2024. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 68\n\nAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a biotechnology company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets human therapeutics. It delivers new therapies for patients with complex cancers, especially in areas with significant unmet needs. The company ended fiscal Q4 2024 with 14 medicines, each annualizing at more than $1 billion. Several of these are expected to be key growth drivers for the company through the decade.\n\nRepatha, which treats cholesterol and heart disease, and EVENITY, which targets osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, are drugs that are continually delivering strong growth for the company. Repatha has developed into a multi-billion dollar product. Heart disease, the leading cause of death worldwide, is further driving its growth.\n\nAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) also has a strong portfolio for rare diseases, which is expected to expand in 2025 with the potential regulatory approval for TEPEZZA internationally, the first and only FDA-approved medicine to treat Thyroid Eye Disease (TED). Launches in new indications for UPLIZNA, which treats neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), are expected to further strengthen the growth trajectory of the company\u2019s rare disease business.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on the stock as its October 2023 acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics is expected to pay off in the next five years. PGIM Jennison Health Sciences Fund stated the following regarding Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a large-cap global biotech company with a diverse portfolio of marketed and pipeline products. Amgen\u2019s discovery pipeline had led the company to broaden its focus from oncology, immunology, and renal disease to include musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and neurologic conditions. In addition, Amgen has turned its expertise in antibody manufacturing into a leading position in the development of biosimilars of competitor drugs. Most recently, Amgen shares advanced in 2Q following its announcement that its novel injectable GLP-1 agonist / GIPR antagonist, MariTide, for obesity showed promising interim Phase 2 data and has shown enough promise to warrant advancement into pivotal trials as soon as late 2024. While Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk will remain the market leaders in the diabetes/obesity space, we think there is room for Amgen to carve out a meaningful share of the market with its antibody-peptide conjugate approach that could enable monthly or better dosing for MariTide.\u201d\n\nOverall, AMGN ranks 6th on our list of best drug stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMGN, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "We wouldn't blame Amgen Inc. ( ) shareholders if they were a little worried about the fact that Murdo Gordon, the Executive Vice President of Global Commercial Operations recently netted about US$2.6m selling shares at an average price of US$295. That sale reduced their total holding by 22% which is hardly insignificant, but far from the worst we've seen.\n\nAmgen Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nNotably, that recent sale by Murdo Gordon is the biggest insider sale of Amgen shares that we've seen in the last year. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$291. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.\n\nIn the last year Amgen insiders didn't buy any company stock.

While we wait, check out this free\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Amgen insiders own about US$230m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Amgen Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nInsiders sold Amgen shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company.

(Credit: Samsung Bioepis)\n\nWith the patent cliff set to trigger a wave of biosimilar launches, Samsung Bioepis, Sandoz, and Celltrion are racing to capture market share. Developed as SB16, Samsung Bioepis\u2019 biosimilars reference Prolia and Xgeva, targeting osteoporosis and cancer-related bone disease.\n\nOSPOMYV has been cleared for osteoporosis treatment in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fractures, as well as for bone mass preservation in cancer patients undergoing hormone therapy. XBRYK is approved for preventing skeletal complications in multiple myeloma and bone metastases and for treating giant cell tumors of bone and hypercalcemia of malignancy resistant to bisphosphonates.\n\nThe EC approval extends Samsung Bioepis\u2019 reach across 27 European countries, including France, Italy, and Spain. While Prolia and Xgeva\u2019s patents expired in most European markets in 2022, protections remain in France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K. until 2025, creating a staggered biosimilar rollout.\n\nMeanwhile, Celltrion is awaiting EC approval for its own denosumab biosimilars, Stoboclo and Osenvelt (CT-P41), after securing a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency\u2019s CHMP in December. If approved, Celltrion\u2019s biosimilars will be available across 30 EU member states, intensifying competition.\n\nSamsung Bioepis\u2019 approvals are backed by phase 1 and phase 3 clinical trials demonstrating equivalent efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics to the reference denosumab.\n\nA phase 1 study confirmed pharmacokinetic equivalence between SB16 and E.U.- and U.S.-sourced denosumab in healthy participants. The phase 3 trial in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients met its primary endpoint, showing comparable changes in lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) at 12 months, with 18-month follow-up data confirming stable efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity after switching from the reference drug.\n\nThe FDA also granted OSPOMYV and XBRYK a provisional interchangeability determination, which\u2014if finalized\u2014would allow pharmacists to substitute them for their reference drugs without requiring a new prescription, a key advantage in biosimilar adoption.\n\nProlia and Evenity, Amgen\u2019s key osteoporosis treatments\u2014Prolia prevents bone loss by targeting RANKL, while Evenity builds and strengthens bone by inhibiting sclerostin.\n\nSamsung Bioepis enters a crowded and legally contentious market. Sandoz will launch its Prolia and Xgeva biosimilars, Jubbonti and Wyost, on May 31, 2025, after securing FDA approval last March. Celltrion, which has yet to receive FDA clearance, reached a settlement with Amgen in January, allowing it to launch Stoboclo and Osenvelt as early as June 1, 2025.\n\nAs part of its Jan. 24 settlement with Amgen, Celltrion acknowledged that its biosimilars infringed on Amgen\u2019s patents, reinforcing the biotech giant\u2019s legal position. A similar agreement between Amgen and Sandoz last year granted Sandoz first-mover advantage in the U.S.\n\nMeanwhile, Fresenius Kabi, Teva, and Organon have all filed for FDA approval, but Amgen has aggressively pursued patent litigation, prolonging uncertainty over their market entry.\n\nAt the 43rd J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in January, Celltrion outlined an aggressive pricing strategy, positioning its Prolia biosimilar as a low-cost preventive treatment. CEO Kee Woo-sung suggested pricing it at the equivalent of eight hamburgers per year, a stark contrast to Amgen\u2019s strategy of bundling Prolia with Evenity (romosozumab) for sequential osteoporosis therapy.\n\nAmgen CEO Robert Bradway has emphasized that Evenity stimulates bone formation, while Prolia maintains newly built bone, a treatment approach designed to reinforce Amgen\u2019s market dominance even after Prolia\u2019s patent expires.\n\nBoth drugs remained key drivers in Amgen\u2019s osteoporosis portfolio, posting double-digit global volume growth in the fourth quarter of 2023, with Prolia\u2019s U.S. volume rising 26 percent and Asia-Pacific sales surging 46 percent.\n\n\u201cWe are the global leader in bone health and will maintain our position, continuing to drive growth through the 2030s,\u201d Bradway said in January.\n\nMeanwhile, OBODENCE and XBRYK mark Samsung Bioepis\u2019 10th and 11th EC approvals and its first endocrinology biosimilars in Europe, expanding the company\u2019s portfolio beyond immunology and oncology.\n\nWith 10 FDA-approved biosimilars, Samsung Bioepis continues to expand into osteoporosis and cancer-related bone disease, as competition in the denosumab biosimilar market increases.",

            "content": "Every golfer has an idol or idols that they strive to learn from, drawing inspiration from their techniques, strategies, and mental approaches to the game. For some, it\u2019s a legendary player like Tiger Woods or Jack Nicklaus, while for others, it\u2019s a contemporary star like Rory McIlroy or Justin Thomas. By studying their idols\u2019s games, golfers aim to incorporate new skills and mindsets into their own play, ultimately improving their performance and reaching new heights.\n\nThis was evident in the latest episode of Golf\u2019s Subpar on Apple Podcast, where Si Woo Kim shares his admiration for playing alongside McIlroy, Brooks Koepka, and Scottie Scheffler. Kim\u2019s motivation isn\u2019t about friendship but rather a desire to learn from the best. \u201cI like, love to learn from them and if we play together, I can catch something they do good like a special shot I can watch,\u201d Kim reveals, highlighting the value of learning from idols in the pursuit of golfing excellence.\n\nKim recalls his first time playing with McIlroy, feeling intimidated and thinking he had \u201cno chance\u201d against the Northern Irish star. \u201cIf 1 on 1, I got to no chance,\u201d he jokes. Kim even says he felt like quitting after getting outdriven by 50 yards, admitting, \u201cI feel like so poor like he drives me out 50 yards.\u201d He also shares a memorable moment from their round together at Pebble Beach, where he saw McIlroy sink an incredible eagle, describing the shot as, \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. I hit driver and between 4 and 5, I hit the five and straight pole. I don\u2019t know. I feel like it\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nBut what was the crazy shot? Well, at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, Rory McIlroy unleashed a monster 339-yard drive on the 14th hole, leaving him just a 7-iron approach to the green. He then hit a 221-yard shot to 27 feet and sunk the eagle putt, pulling three strokes ahead with four holes remaining and essentially sealing his two-shot victory. \u201cI played one time with Rory, like i feel so bad after that. I wanna quit this; I\u2019m so bad,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nvia Getty MONTREAL, QUEBEC \u2013 SEPTEMBER 24: Si Woo Kim of the International Team plays his shot from the ninth tee prior to the 2024 Presidents Cup at The Royal Montreal Golf Club on September 24, 2024 in Montreal, Quebec. (Photo by Keyur Khamar/PGA TOUR via Getty Images)\n\nDespite feeling in awe of McIlroy\u2019s skills, Kim\u2019s humility and willingness to learn from others are traits that have undoubtedly contributed to his own success on the course. And he has quite the syllabus laid out for him even when we only consider McIlroy\u2019s extraordinary moments.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nRory McIlroy\u2019s amazing history of epic shots\n\nWell, this isn\u2019t the first time McIlroy has left the fans stunned with amazing control on his golfing gear. The four-time major winner has a history of making incredible shots, and his hole-in-one achievements are no exception. His first professional ace came in 2015 at the Abu Dhabi Championship, where he perfectly hit a 9-iron shot from 177 yards out. The ball spun right towards the hole and smoothly went in, leaving everyone in awe. Even fellow golfer Rickie Fowler congratulated him on his achievement. What\u2019s remarkable about this shot is that it showcased McIlroy\u2019s precision and skill, even at a young age. He was just 25 years old at the time, and this ace was a testament to his growing talent.\n\nMcIlroy\u2019s subsequent ace was just as impressive. In 2023, he recorded his first PGA Tour ace at the Travelers Championship, where he shot a perfect trajectory from 218 yards out. This shot was a masterclass in technique and strategy, demonstrating McIlroy\u2019s ability to read the course and execute under pressure. His reaction to the ace was also notable\u2014he casually tossed the ball to a spectator, showing that he\u2019s not one to get too sentimental about his achievements. As McIlroy himself said, \u201cI\u2019m not sentimental; I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d rather have trophies than golf balls.\u201d This mindset has clearly served him well, as he continues to rack up impressive wins and achievements throughout his career.

Amgen introduced its first cancer therapeutic, Vectibix, in 2006 and markets bone-strengthening drug Prolia/Xgeva (approved 2010) and Evenity (2019).

The 2023 Horizon acquisition brings several rare-disease drugs, including thyroid eye disease drug Tepezza.

As of 30 September, 2024, the company achieved a solid revenue growth rate of approximately 23.18%. This indicates a notable increase in the company's top-line earnings. As compared to competitors, the company surpassed expectations with a growth rate higher than the average among peers in the Health Care sector.\n\nAnalyzing Profitability Metrics:\n\nGross Margin: With a low gross margin of 61.07% , the company exhibits below-average profitability, signaling potential struggles in cost efficiency compared to its industry peers.\n\nEarnings per Share (EPS): Amgen's EPS is notably higher than the industry average. The company achieved a positive bottom-line trend with a current EPS of 5.27.\n\nDebt Management: The company faces challenges in debt management with a debt-to-equity ratio higher than the industry average. With a ratio of 8.02, caution is advised due to increased financial risk.\n\nMarket Valuation:\n\nPrice to Earnings (P/E) Ratio: The P/E ratio of 39.28 is lower than the industry average, implying a discounted valuation for Amgen's stock.\n\nPrice to Sales (P/S) Ratio: A higher-than-average P/S ratio of 4.81 suggests overvaluation in the eyes of investors, considering sales performance.\n\nEV/EBITDA Analysis (Enterprise Value to its Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization): A high EV/EBITDA ratio of 26.76 reflects market recognition of Amgen's value, positioning it as more highly valued compared to industry peers.\n\nMarket Capitalization Analysis: With a profound presence, the company's market capitalization is above industry averages.

This encompasses executives in the c-suite and significant hedge funds. These insiders are mandated to inform the public of their transactions through a Form 4 filing, to be submitted within two business days of the transaction.\n\nA company insider's new purchase is a indicator of their positive anticipation for a rise in the stock.\n\nWhile insider sells may not necessarily reflect a bearish view and can be motivated by various factors.\n\nA Closer Look at Important Transaction Codes\n\nTaking a closer look at transactions, investors often prioritize those unfolding in the open market, meticulously cataloged in Table I of the Form 4 filing. A P in Box 3 denotes a purchase, while S signifies a sale. Transaction code C denotes the conversion of an option, and transaction code A signifies a grant, award, or other acquisition of securities from the company.\n\nCheck Out The Full List Of Amgen's Insider Trades.\n\nInsider Buying Alert: Profit from C-Suite Moves\n\nBenzinga Edge reveals every insider trade in real-time.

The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.\n\nWhy Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value Stock\n\nDifferent than growth or momentum investors, value-focused investors are all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under what their true value is before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nAmgen (AMGN)\n\nThousand Oaks, CA-based Amgen is one of the biggest biotech companies in the world, with a strong presence in the oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, neuroscience, inflammation, bone health and nephrology and neuroscience markets. The company used advances in cellular and molecular biology to develop two of the biotech industry\u2019s earliest and most successful drugs, Epogen (anemia) and Neupogen (white blood cell stimulant). Amgen successfully launched two next-generation products, Aranesp and Neulasta. Meanwhile, the acquisition of Immunex Corporation gave Amgen access to the multi-blockbuster drug, Enbrel. However, all these older drugs are facing declining sales due to biosimilar or branded competition, which is being somewhat offset by its blockbuster growth drugs like Prolia and Xgeva. Other products are Repatha, Blincyto, Vectibix, Nplate, Kyprolis, Evenity, Otezla, Aimovig, Lumakras/Lumykras, Tezspire, Imdelltra, Tavneos and Kanjinti, Mvasi and Amgevita biosimilars.\n\nAMGN boasts a Value Style Score of B and VGM Score of B, and holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. Shares of Amgen are trading at a forward earnings multiple of 14.4X, as well as a PEG Ratio of 2.6, a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 13.9X, and a Price/Sales ratio of 4.8X.\n\nValue investors don't just pay attention to a company's valuation ratios; positive earnings play a crucial role, too. Seven analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.25 to $20.60 per share.

            "content": "This case concerned Amgen's European patent no. 2962690 for apremilast, a drug sold under the brand name Otezla\u00ae, licensed for the treatment of e.g., psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. The patent was opposed by 15 opponents. Claim 1 of Amgen's main request was a so-called \"first medical use claim\" directed to stereomerically pure apremilast comprising greater than 80% of the (+) enantiomer and less than 20% of the (-) enantiomer, for use as a medicament administered orally. In contrast to the guidance provided by the EPO's Guidelines for Examination at Part G, VI, 6.1.2, the Board considered oral administration of the drug to be a limiting feature of the claim1. The Board also reversed their preliminary opinion on inventive step, concluding that the technical effect demonstrated by Amgen was merely a \"bonus effect\" that could not render an obvious teaching inventive.\n\nMedical use claims\n\nThe European Patent Convention (EPC) excludes methods of treatment from patentability (Article 53(c) EPC). However, substances or compositions for use in methods of treatment by therapy can be protected as medical uses (Articles 54(4) and (5) EPC). The first medical use of a substance or composition is generally protected in the form: \"composition X for use as a medicament\", while subsequent medical uses are protected as so-called second medical use claims in the form: \"composition X for use as a medicament for treating disease Y\". Both first and second medical use claims are purpose-limited product claims, with second medical use claims directed to a specific medical use rather than a general medical use claimed in the first medical use format. As explained below, however, the specificity of use required to justify protection as a second medical use claim was established by the case law to be a relatively low hurdle, and a new use could be considered \"specific\" as long as it was distinguishable from the generic use as a medicament disclosed as the first medical use.\n\nMode of Administration and EPO's Guidelines for Examination\n\nAs mentioned above, claim 1 in T 0295/22 was a \"first medical use claim\" covering stereomerically pure apremilast for use as a medicament administered orally. In deciding on patentability, the Board had to consider whether the mode of administration, i.e., oral administration, limited the scope of the claim.\n\nThe EPO's Guidelines for Examination did not consider modes of administration to be limiting on first medical use claims. According to Part G, VI, 6.1.2 a mode of administration could only be a limiting feature in relation to a subsequent (specific) medical indication. However, in the context of a first medical use in which the medical indication was unspecified, the mode of administration could not relate to any therapeutic effect.\n\nThe Board in T 0295/22 found the Guidelines to be inconsistent with the case law. Specifically, the Board did not consider that modes of administration should be construed differently in the context of first and second medical use claims. The Board noted that, in T 51/932, it was held that novelty could be acknowledged as long as one of the features of treatment (e.g., mode of administration) was novel. This was later confirmed in G2/083, which held that, although second medical use claims had to define a specific use, the specificity merely had to contrast with the generic broad protection conferred by the first medical use and did not have to be confined to any particular medical indication. In G2/08, therefore, dosage regimens were considered allowable, despite such regimens not being related to a new therapeutic use. Against this backdrop, therefore, the Board considered the Guidelines to be inconsistent with T 51/93 and G 2/08 and held that the oral mode of administration of apremilast to be a limiting feature that rendered the claim novel.\n\nLack of Inventive Step despite an Unexpected Technical Effect\n\nWith novelty established by the oral mode of administration, the Board considered whether the technical difference provided a technical effect. The opponents argued that the problem should be formulated in terms of the provision of an alternative or suitable route of administration. However, the Board noted that the patent provided evidence of an unexpectedly high selectivity, reduced propensity for emesis and improved solubility associated with orally administered stereomerically pure apremilast. Accordingly, the Board was convinced that there was sufficient evidence of a technical effect that the objective technical problem should be formulated as the provision of an administration route which allowed for the safe and well-tolerated effective treatment for PDE4-mediated diseases.\n\nGenerally, a previously unknown or unpredictable technical effect is often viewed by the EPO as a strong indicator of the presence of an inventive step. However, while the Board in this instance acknowledged that a skilled person may not have predicted the technical effects demonstrated in the patent, the Board held that it would already have been obvious for a skilled person to arrive at the claimed subject matter because an advantageous effect could be expected to result from the prior art documents. Thus, irrespective of the circumstances of the extra (or \"bonus\") technical effects, the claim nonetheless lacked an inventive step.\n\nIn the case at hand, despite known challenges with oral administration of PDE4 inhibitors, the Board considered that a skilled person would nonetheless have had a compelling motivation to seek oral administration of PDE4 inhibitors, as oral administration was a skilled person's first choice for systemic delivery of active agents because of ease of use.\n\nMoreover, at the priority date of the patent, the development of orally administered PDE4 inhibitors was ongoing and promising, and other PDE4 inhibitors were shown to provide positive (albeit inferior) results. The Board also noted that no technical prejudice against oral administration had been demonstrated. On the contrary, oral administration of a similar compound was also shown to have a decreased propensity for emesis. Collectively, therefore, the Board considered that the prior art provided the skilled person with a reasonable expectation that the oral administration of stereomerically pure apremilast would provide for the safe and well-tolerated effective treatment of PDE4-mediated diseases. Although the unexpected extent of advantages demonstrated in the patent may not have been predictable, the Board considered that there was sufficient reason in the prior art to motivate a skilled person to administer apremilast orally anyway. Thus, the significant and unexpected improvements demonstrated were considered as bonus effects that could not support an inventive step.\n\nConclusions\n\nIt will be interesting to see if the Guidelines will be amended to reflect the Board's conclusion that steps, such as modes of administration, can be relied upon to limit first medical uses despite not relating to new therapeutic uses.\n\nIt will also be interesting to see if there will be an increase in the application of bonus effect case law following this decision. In December last year, we speculated that the \"bonus effect\" case law may be increasingly relied upon in the interest of aligning conclusions on inventive step more closely with those reached by the UPC4. From what we have seen so far, the UPC's inventive step framework appears to be more holistic and focuses on whether a skilled person would have been motivated to consider the claimed solution and implement it as a next step in developing the prior art5. Although the Board in T 0295/22 did not cite the UPC as a reason for their decision, this case adds to an increasing body of recent case law in which a technical advantage was deemed insufficient to support an inventive step. That said, the chances of an opponent successfully relying on a \"bonus effect\" is likely to be fact dependent, as we have also seen the same Board in a different composition consider a \"swallowable\" tablet of deferasirox as being inventive over a dispersible form of the drug6 (T 0526/21). In the latter case, despite acknowledging that providing a swallowable tablet to improve the ease of administration was obvious per se, the Board considered that a skilled person would not have had a reasonable expectation of success of achieving good bioavailability when formulating deferasirox as a swallowable film coated table. In T 0526/21, therefore, the bioavailability of the swallowable tablet was considered to be unexpected and indicative of an inventive step. Accordingly, despite the opponents' successful reliance of the bonus effect in T 0295/22, we should not downplay the importance of data in demonstrating an unexpected technical effect for supporting an inventive step.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1 See Example 2\n\n2 Reasons, 3.1.2\n\n3 Reasons, 5.10.3\n\n4 https://www.hgf.com/news/with-the-epo-and-upc-adopting-different-frameworks-for-inventive-step-is-there-potential-for-conflicting-decisions/\n\n5 UPC_CoA_335/2023\n\n6 Reasons, 3.5.2 and 3.5.3\n\nThe content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

            "content": "Suzanne Edavettal\u2019s journey from a dairy farm in Wisconsin to leading innovative protein therapeutic discovery at Amgen is a testament to the power of curiosity, resilience and mentorship. Her story isn\u2019t just about breaking barriers as a woman in science\u2014it\u2019s about lifting others up along the way. As a scientist and vice president of Research focused on large molecule discovery, she is driven by an insatiable fascination with proteins and a commitment to transforming patient care. As a leader, she is dedicated to mentoring the next generation, ensuring they have the same support that helped her succeed.\n\nCan you tell us about your background, growing up on a dairy farm in Wisconsin? How did you navigate the path to becoming a scientist, especially coming from a rural community?\n\nMy life today feels like it\u2019s a world away from where I started\u2014it\u2019s kind of like traveling from Earth to Mars! Growing up on a farm I learned a lot of invaluable lessons, particularly the importance of hard work. But from an early age, I knew that farming wasn\u2019t for me. This wasn\u2019t about rejecting my upbringing but about embracing my passion, which was always science. I was a self-proclaimed geek even as a child, and it was clear I didn\u2019t quite fit the traditional mold of a farmer when I became a vegetarian, which was a decision that reflected my curiosity and independent thinking. It\u2019s these traits that ultimately guided me toward the career I love today.\n\nOne of my biggest challenges was navigating a career in science, especially since I didn\u2019t have role models who had gone to college. Thankfully, I was fortunate to have incredible teachers who encouraged me to pursue dual enrollment courses at Beloit College while I was still in high school. That experience opened doors for me. After completing my undergraduate degree at Beloit, I continued my education with graduate school at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I discovered my love for proteins. That fascination became the foundation of my career and drives everything I do today.\n\nWhat attracted you to the pharmaceutical industry, and what excites you about working with proteins?\n\nMy interest in the pharmaceutical industry stems from a deep desire to make a meaningful difference in patients\u2019 lives. All of us have personal stories of seeing family members suffer from grievous diseases. Witnessing the devastating impact of diseases like cancer on loved ones inspired me to combine my passion for science with the urgent needs of patients. I initially considered medical school, but my needle phobia quickly ruled that out. Instead, I pursued a Ph.D., which allowed me to channel my enthusiasm for science into drug discovery and structural biology.\n\nAlso, I love proteins. They are wildly dynamic and complex. Just when you think you\u2019ve figured them out, they surprise you. This endless fascination has fueled my imagination and drives me every day to better understand the relationship between protein structure and function, with the ultimate goal of developing more effective drugs.\n\nOver the course of my career, I\u2019ve had the privilege of contributing to both small and large molecule drug discovery at several pharmaceutical companies. In December 2020, I joined Amgen as executive director, and today I serve as vice president in the large molecule discovery organization, where I continue to explore the transformative potential of proteins to improve patient care.\n\nHow do you approach mentoring and leadership now, especially with people who might have a similar background to yours?\n\nI try to lead with empathy and patience, recognizing the value of looking past people\u2019s rough edges\u2014because I know I had plenty of my own. It\u2019s a privilege for me to support individuals with extraordinary potential who are earlier in their careers. Opening doors for them and watching them seize opportunities is deeply rewarding. Those moments of growth and success inspire my leadership approach and fill me with pride.\n\nI\u2019m also proud to be part of the Leadership Acceleration Program (LEAP), a formal sponsorship program at Amgen that supports high-potential staff. And I\u2019m part of a strong informal network of women who encourage and uplift one another. I know I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today without the unwavering support system I was fortunate to have throughout my journey. That\u2019s why I feel such a deep sense of responsibility to help others\u2014because that\u2019s how a farm girl from Wisconsin managed to achieve her dreams.\n\nHow has the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning impacted your work at Amgen?\n\nOne of the key reasons I joined Amgen was the opportunity to contribute to an organization that not only embraces AI and machine learning but one that wanted to lead and shape the development of these transformative tools. My team, Protein Therapeutics, focuses on taking early molecules discovered by the team in British Columbia and engineering them to transform those early hits into therapeutic molecules. While our fundamental inputs and outputs have remained the same, the way we approach our work has undergone a remarkable transformation over the last three years.\n\nWe\u2019ve made significant investments in predictive machine learning and generative AI, which have revolutionized our processes. Predictive machine learning enables us to identify potential issues in molecules without conducting a single wet lab experiment, dramatically increasing both speed and success. Meanwhile, generative AI empowers us to explore possibilities that were previously unimaginable. As a result, we now complete therapeutic projects three times faster, saving an entire year on each project, and have doubled our success rate.\n\nThis transformation has been profoundly impactful, not only in terms of efficiency and outcomes but also in redefining what\u2019s possible in therapeutic development.\n\nHow do you handle failure in your work, especially in such a complex field as science?\n\nIn science, failure is inevitable, but the key is to approach it as an opportunity for learning and growth. Being part of a culture that embraces this mindset is essential for success, and Amgen\u2019s continuous learning culture is a cornerstone of our Research organization. We aim to learn from every failure\u2014and, just as importantly, to avoid repeating the same mistakes. Relearning the same lesson isn\u2019t just painful; it\u2019s costly and time-consuming.\n\nOne of the key factors behind our success in driving AI transformation is the unique composition of my team. We are made up of seasoned Amgen employees with deep institutional knowledge and newer team members who bring fresh perspectives. There\u2019s something magical that happens when you bring together a group of individuals with a range of backgrounds and experiences. It creates a dynamic exchange of ideas, blending decades of hard-earned lessons with the curiosity and energy of 'what if' questions. The synergy that arises from this mix fosters innovative thinking and enables transformative breakthroughs. It\u2019s this collaborative spirit that empowers us to navigate challenges, embrace change and continuously improve.\n\nDo you have a personal philosophy or mantra that guides you, and how does it impact your work?\n\nI\u2019ll start with what I don\u2019t think is a good mantra: I\u2019ve always believed that \u201cfake it till you make it\u201d is terrible advice. If you don\u2019t know how to do something, the best approach is to be honest, ask questions and ask for help. Pretending to know more than you do not only stifles learning and growth but can also fuel imposter syndrome.\n\nThe philosophy I embrace is rooted in authenticity. Each of my colleagues brings unique expertise and personalities to the table, and I\u2019ve found that staying true to myself is key to building meaningful connections. I still carry some of the rough edges from my early days on the farm\u2014they\u2019re part of who I am\u2014and at times, those qualities show up in my work. Embracing that authenticity allows me to connect with my team on a deeper level and foster a culture of openness and trust.\n\nRather than \u201cfaking it,\u201d I believe in being yourself, staying curious, asking questions and accepting that none of us have all the answers. This mindset not only helps me grow but also strengthens collaboration and trust within my team.",

            "content": "Amgen (AMGN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this world's largest biotech drugmaker have returned +11.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. The Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, to which Amgen belongs, has gained 2.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAmgen is expected to post earnings of $4.23 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.2%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.64 points to a change of +4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.35 indicates a change of +3.5% from what Amgen is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.4%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amgen is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Amgen, the consensus sales estimate of $8.03 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.9%. The $35.02 billion and $35.41 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.8% and +1.1%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmgen reported revenues of $9.09 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.9%. EPS of $5.31 for the same period compares with $4.71 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.86 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.54%. The EPS surprise was +5.57%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmgen is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amgen. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nJust Released: Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2025\n\nHurry \u2013 you can still get in early on our 10 top tickers for 2025.

            "content": "Amgen Inc. ( ) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Accordingly, Amgen investors that purchase the stock on or after the 14th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 7th of March.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$2.38 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$9.52 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Amgen has a trailing yield of approximately 3.2% on its current stock price of US$293.54. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Amgen's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Amgen distributed an unsustainably high 118% of its profit as dividends to shareholders last year. Without more sustainable payment behaviour, the dividend looks precarious. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 46% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.\n\nIt's disappointing to see that the dividend was not covered by profits, but cash is more important from a dividend sustainability perspective, and Amgen fortunately did generate enough cash to fund its dividend. Still, if the company repeatedly paid a dividend greater than its profits, we'd be concerned. Very few companies are able to sustainably pay dividends larger than their reported earnings.\n\nClick\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nBusinesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Readers will understand then, why we're concerned to see Amgen's earnings per share have dropped 10% a year over the past five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend.\n\nMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Amgen has delivered an average of 15% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. That's intriguing, but the combination of growing dividends despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out a larger percentage of profits. Amgen is already paying out a high percentage of its income, so without earnings growth, we're doubtful of whether this dividend will grow much in the future.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nShould investors buy Amgen for the upcoming dividend? It's never great to see earnings per share declining, especially when a company is paying out 118% of its profit as dividends, which we feel is uncomfortably high. However, the cash payout ratio was much lower - good news from a dividend perspective - which makes us wonder why there is such a mis-match between income and cashflow. Overall it doesn't look like the most suitable dividend stock for a long-term buy and hold investor.\n\nWith that in mind though, if the poor dividend characteristics of Amgen don't faze you, it's worth being mindful of the risks involved with this business. For example, Amgen has we think you should know about.\n\nIf you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend\n\nNew: Manage All Your Stock Portfolios in One Place We've created the ultimate portfolio companion for stock investors, and it's free. \u2022 Connect an unlimited number of Portfolios and see your total in one currency\n\n\u2022 Be alerted to new Warning Signs or Risks via email or mobile\n\n\u2022 Track the Fair Value of your stocks\n\nTry a Demo Portfolio for Free\n\nHave feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:AMGN) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses that are leading the Dow higher in 2025.\n\nOn Thursday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, drew attention to ten stocks that have been driving the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2025. He described some of these stocks as \u201cquiet winners,\u201d noting that many of them, particularly those outside the tech sector, are often overlooked by Wall Street despite their strong contributions to the market\u2019s progress.\n\n\u201cI gotta tell you, we got some real strange leadership this year. When you look at the quiet winners of 2025, the ones that don\u2019t belong to the Magnificent Seven, the ones that are unsung, even as they got us where we are so far this year, it\u2019s a real low-key hodgepodge.\u201d He elaborated on this, emphasizing that the stocks leading the charge in 2025 form an eclectic mix that may seem unconventional. Some of these companies were prominent in the past but have been largely forgotten, while others are relatively invisible, making steady gains that often go unnoticed.\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Highlighted Buying Opportunities in 13 Stocks\n\nHe elaborated on this, emphasizing that the stocks leading the charge in 2025 form an eclectic mix that may seem unconventional. Some of these companies were prominent in the past but have been largely forgotten, while others are relatively invisible, making steady gains that often go unnoticed.\n\nAccording to Cramer, these stocks represent a sharp contrast to the giant, high-profile names that dominate everyday conversations about the market. He remarked that on a day when the Dow dropped by 126 points, the S&P rose by 0.36%, and the Nasdaq gained 0.51%, it was worth taking a closer look at the stocks driving the Dow higher, as this index is composed of some of the most established companies that, despite their storied histories, do not typically get the media attention they deserve. Cramer concluded by stating that the performance of these quieter, non-tech stocks so far this year has been significant.\n\n\u201cBottom line: So far this year, we\u2019ve had many very big winners outside of tech, and I bet most of them can keep quietly working their way higher.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on February 6. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "A retrospective observational study found no significant differences in progression-free survival or safety in patients with colorectal cancers in Japan treated with ABP 215, Amgen\u2019s bevacizumab biosimilar, or reference bevacizumab (Avastin), and estimated cost savings of 800,000 Japanese yen (approximately $5100) per patient with the biosimilar.\n\nImage credit: Dr_Microbe - stock.adobe.com\n\nThe authors noted that the treatment strategy for colorectal cancer depends on tumor characteristics, feasibility of surgical resection, and mutations. For tumors that are unresectable, advanced, or recurrent, bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the main anticancer treatment options. The bevacizumab reference product, Avastin, was launched in 2004, and works by inhibiting angiogenesis, thereby impairing tumor growth. Bevacizumab is used to treat a number of cancers, and randomized controlled trials have demonstrated improved overall and progression-free survival in patients treated with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab compared to chemotherapy alone.\n\nMultiple bevacizumab biosimilars have been approved in different regions, and ABP 215 (Mvasi; Amgen) was the first approved by the FDA and the second approved in Japan. Although previous studies on ABP 215 have been conducted in colorectal cancer, according to the authors, there have been no reports on efficacy and safety of ABP 215 in Japanese patients with colorectal cancer. Their retrospective observational study compared progression-free survival (PFS), adverse events, and costs between the reference product and ABP 215 at a single center in Japan.\n\nThe study included 121 patients receiving the reference product and 38 receiving the biosimilar. PFS was evaluated over 2 years, and no significant difference between groups was found (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.89-1.29). Median PFS was 8.41 months (95% CI, 7.33-9.43 months) in patients treated with the reference product and 7.13 months (95% CI, 5.03-9.66) in those treated with ABP 215.\n\nThe most common adverse events (AEs) in both cohorts were hypoalbuminemia, anemia, and decreased neutrophil count. Hypoalbuminemia occurred in approximately 90% of patients, and the authors said this may have been because many patients developed cachexia. The most common serious AEs with grade of 3 or higher in both groups were anemia and neutropenia. These bone marrow suppression-related AEs were likely due to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy patients received along with bevacizumab, the authors said. Proteinuria was observed in approximately 70% of patients in both groups and hypertension in 40%. The authors noted these are typical adverse events related to bevacizumab treatment. The incidence rates of any adverse event and grade 3 or higher adverse events did not differ between groups.\n\nThe median numbers of bevacizumab treatments and median doses were 13.0 and 5 mg/kg in patients treated with the reference product and 10.0 and 5 mg/kg in patients treated with ABP 215. The mean costs per patient were 1,157,707 and 362,630 Japanese yen in the originator and biosimilar groups, suggesting a potential savings of about 800,000 Japanese yen per patient.\n\nThe authors noted their PFS results were in line with previous clinical trials and retrospective studies. Although their study was small and conducted in a single center, they said, it is first study to demonstrate that ABP 215 is as effective and safe as the reference product in a real-world Japanese population with colorectal cancer, and based on their results, ABP 215 should be recommended in Japan to reduce medical costs.\n\nReference\n\nSumimoto T, Tanaka R, Tatsuta R, Kubota M, Itoh H.

            "content": "Amgen Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMGN) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to $2.38 on 7th of March. This takes the annual payment to 3.1% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amgen\n\nAmgen's Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Prior to this announcement, the company was paying out 118% of what it was earning, however the dividend was quite comfortably covered by free cash flows at a cash payout ratio of only 49%. Healthy cash flows are always a positive sign, especially when they quite easily cover the dividend.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 115.3% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 62%, which would make us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend, despite the levels currently being quite high.\n\nNasdaqGS:AMGN Historic Dividend February 6th 2025\n\nAmgen Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2015, the annual payment back then was $2.44, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $9.52. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 15% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.\n\nThe Dividend Has Limited Growth Potential\n\nInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. However, things aren't all that rosy. Amgen's EPS has fallen by approximately 10% per year during the past five years. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this becomes a long term trend.\n\nIn Summary\n\nOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. The company is generating plenty of cash, but we still think the dividend is a bit high for comfort. We don't think Amgen is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.\n\nIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Just as an example, we've come across 4 warning signs for Amgen you should be aware of, and 1 of them is potentially serious. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

The company\u2019s Q4 results showed a slight decline in total revenue compared to consensus expectations, although earnings per share exceeded estimates. Amgen\u2019s guidance for 2025 indicates modest growth in revenues and earnings per share, but there are concerns over increasing research and development spending, particularly due to potential competition from biosimilars for one of its major products.\n\nAdditionally, Amgen\u2019s valuation appears stretched, with its price-to-earnings ratio slightly higher than average, while its long-term growth profile seems average or below average. Despite a small upward revision in price objectives, the company\u2019s growth prospects are tempered by expected operating margin erosion and increased expenses in developing new treatments. These factors combine to warrant a Sell rating from Tim Anderson.\n\nAccording to TipRanks, Anderson is a 4-star analyst with an average return of 8.9% and a 68.42% success rate.

            "content": "Today, a brief rundown of news involving Amgen and Regeneron, as well as updates from Valneva, Turnstone Biologics and AdvanCell that you might have missed.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has put an obesity study run by Amgen on clinical hold, the company disclosed Tuesday in its fourth quarter earnings. The study is testing an injectable medicine called AMG 513. Amgen didn\u2019t share the reason for the hold, but executives told investors that they don\u2019t believe it\u2019s related to the medicine itself. Still, the news is a \u201cspeed bump\u201d for Amgen\u2019s obesity R&D, wrote Raymond James analyst Gary Nachman in a note to clients. The company, which is in late-stage testing with another obesity drug called MariTide, hasn\u2019t disclosed how AMG 513 works. Discussions are underway on a \u201cpath forward\u201d to reopen the study, Amgen said. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nFor the first time in its 37-year history, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals will return capital to its shareholders via a dividend. The biotech instituted a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share on Tuesday, alongside announcing fourth quarter earnings. Baird analyst Brian Skorney called the move a \u201cpositive surprise\u201d that could help expand Regeneron\u2019s investor base, but added in a client note that it didn\u2019t entirely distract from soft sales of Eylea and Dupixent, the company\u2019s two most important products. Christopher Raymond, an analyst at Piper Sandler, told clients the dividend was a \u201cclear vote of confidence\u201d from Regeneron\u2019s executive team \u201cin midst of a commercial lull.\u201d \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nRegulators in the U.K. have approved Valneva\u2019s chikungunya vaccine for adults. The clearance is the shot\u2019s fourth, following OKs in the U.S., Europe and Canada. Valneva also expects to gain approval this year in Brazil, which would be the first country where chikungunya, a mosquito-borne viral disease, is endemic. Clinical testing of the live-attenuated vaccine, called Ixchiq, showed immunization led to an immune response that can last several years. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nTurnstone Biologics is ending further development of its cancer cell therapy program TIDAL-01, laying off staff and reducing spending as part of a review of \u201cstrategic alternatives\u201d that could end in a sale or merger. TIDAL-01 was in a Phase 1 study testing Turnstone\u2019s tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy. The company made TIDAL-01 its sole focus back in October, when it laid off 60% of its staff and reshuffled its executive team. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nRadiopharmaceutical drug developer Advancell has raised $112 million in a Series C financing led by SV Health Investors, Sanofi Ventures, Abingworth and Symbiosis. Founded in 2019, Australia-based Advancell is working on therapies containing alpha-emitting radionuclides like Pb-212. Its lead treatment, dubbed ADVC001, is in a Phase 1/2 study of people with metastatic prostate cancer. The company plans to use the new funding to expand its manufacturing capacity and advance its pipeline. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo",

The company didn't specify the reason for the clinical hold, only saying \"discussions are underway on a path forward to reopen the study.\"\n\n\"Despite the current clinical hold, management still expects to develop AMG 513 and believes that the issue is not drug-related,\" Mizuho Securities analyst Salim Syed said in a report.\n\nAmgen stock jumped 6.5% to 307.81 on today's stock market.\n\nThe disclosure isn't related to Amgen's leading weight-loss drug, MariTide. Amgen says it expects to have the results of a midstage study of MariTide in patients with type 2 diabetes in the latter half of the year. The study will focus on patients living with and without obesity.\n\nAmgen Stock: Guidance Mixed\n\nThe most important numbers for Amgen are in its guidance, Syed said.\n\nFor the year, Amgen guided to adjusted earnings of $20 to $21.20 per share. The midpoint of the outlook, $20.60, lagged analysts' call for $20.92, according to FactSet. But the middle of Amgen's sales guidance for $34.3 billion to $35.7 billion came in ahead of the Street's call for $34.63 billion.\n\nEdward Jones analyst John Boylan pointed out Amgen is spending a lot of money to develop MariTide.\n\nThat \"may explain 2025 EPS guidance being modestly lower than the current consensus view,\" he said in a note to clients. \"In the meantime, MariTide speculation is overshadowing its progress on new products and its pipeline, although there are some upcoming patent expirations as well.\"\n\nBoylan rates Amgen stock a hold.\n\nBeyond MariTide, investors are also closely watching olpasiran. Amgen is developing it for patients with elevated lipoprotein A, or Lp(a). Like cholesterol, elevated Lp(a) can lead to an increased risk of heart attack, strokes and other cardiovascular problems. Amgen expects to begin an additional Phase 3 study of olpasiran in the second half of 2025 or first half of 2026.\n\nFourth-Quarter Metrics Topped\n\nThe fourth quarter represented a beat for Amgen.\n\nAcross all products, sales increased 11% to $9.09 billion, beating expectations for $8.88 billion. The company also had 13% growth in adjusted earnings, bringing in $5.31 per share. Analysts called for a lower $5.08 per share.\n\nAmgen's biggest moneymaker, osteoporosis drug Prolia, generated $1.17 billion in sales. Sales rose 5% year over year, but missed forecasts for $1.19 billion. Repatha, on the other hand, generated $606 million in sales, growing 45% and beating expectations for $558 million. Repatha is a cholesterol drug.\n\nMizuho's Syed kept his neutral rating on Amgen stock.\n\nShares have run more than 12% higher after hitting a recent bottom at 257.05 on Jan. 6. Amgen stock is involved in a lengthy consolidation with a buy point at 346.85, according to MarketSurge.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Beats On Libtayo's Back, Unveils Dividend\n\nPfizer's Covid Products Drove Its Fourth-Quarter Upside.

            "content": "In its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 business report on Tuesday, Amgen touted revenues that topped analyst expectations, while also revealing several pipeline issues and adjustments.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Amgen logged $9.1 billion in total revenues, representing an 11% year-on-year increase\u2014and a 3% beat of the consensus forecast of $8.85 billion. For the entire year 2024, Amgen surged 19% to bring in $33.4 billion.\n\nMost notably for its pipeline, the pharma disclosed that its early-stage obesity asset AMG 513 was placed on clinical hold by the FDA\u2014though CEO Robert Bradway said in an investor call that the reason for the hold is likely not related to the drug. Amgen is currently in talks with the FDA to reopen the study.\n\nAccording to its clinicaltrials.gov page, AMG 513 is an injectable drug that is currently being studied in a Phase I single- and multiple-ascending dose trial, primarily to assess its safety and tolerability in adults with obesity. During the call, chief scientific officer Jay Bradner declined to reveal AMG 513\u2019s mechanism of action, pointing to the competitiveness of the obesity space.\n\nAmgen on Tuesday also revealed that it is discontinuing the development of fipaxalparant in diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis after disappointing Phase II data, as well as a Phase III study of its antibody Tezspire in asthma due to \u201climited enrollment.\u201d\n\nDespite the hold on AMG 513, Amgen remains optimistic about its obesity pipeline, anchored by its closely watched bispecific molecule MariTide. The company has \u201cseveral new Phase III trials\u201d involving that candidate slated to launch in the first half of this year, Bradway said during Tuesday\u2019s call. The late-stage program, dubbed MARITIME, will focus on chronic weight management, kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and sleep apnea.\n\nIn November 2024, Amgen revealed early Phase II data for MariTide that disappointed many investors. At the time, the pharma announced that the obesity drug could reduce body weight by up to 20% on average at 52 weeks, an outcome that fell on the lower end of shareholders\u2019 expected range. Amgen\u2019s shares dropped 11% in the aftermath of the readout.\n\nOn Tuesday, the company announced that additional Phase II data for MariTide are expected in the second half of 2025. The company is also running a mid-stage trial of the asset in type 2 diabetes patients with and without obesity. This study is currently enrolling and is also set to return a readout later this year.\n\n\u201cOur obesity efforts fit very well with our strengths in cardiovascular disease, nephrology, and more generally, the emerging presence in primary care,\u201d Bradner said during the call, asserting that the pharma is working toward a diverse weight-loss portfolio, with treatments that can be taken orally or given subcutaneously. \u201cWe\u2019re very confident in MariTide and very confident in the pipeline behind it.\u201d\n\nKey drivers of growth in the fourth quarter included the hyperlipidemia drug Repatha, which jumped 45% to hit worldwide earnings of $606 million, and postmenopausal osteoporosis therapy Evenity, with rose 36% to $431 million. The pharma\u2019s top-performing assets were Prolia, also for postmenopausal osteoporosis, and the TNF blocker Enbrel, which earned $1.165 billion and $1.015 billion in the fourth quarter, respectively.\n\nAnalysts at BMO Capital Markets wrote in an investor note on Tuesday that Amgen\u2019s Q4 performance \u201cillustrated that mature products like Repatha still have some runway for growth which goes under the radar because of a heavier focus on its more recent launches.\u201d\n\nPavblu, Amgen\u2019s biosimilar to Regeneron\u2019s Eylea, could also see revenues \u201cgrowing more substantively in 2025,\u201d according to the BMO analysts, particularly as other biosimilars \u201care likely to be prevented from launching by injunction.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of the year, Amgen forecasts total revenues to fall between $34.3 billion and $35.7 billion, a range that Jefferies analysts called \u201csolid\u201d in an investor note, especially given \u201cheightened uncertainty\u201d due to the impending second-quarter entry of biosimilar competition to Prolia. Amgen projected a full-year earnings-per-share outlook at $20 to $21.20.",

Here are a few items of interest to help you get started. We hope you have a smashing day and conquer the world. And of course, do keep in touch. Your insights and observations are appreciated. \u2026\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered a hold on a study of an early-stage obesity drug being developed by Amgen, another potential setback in the company\u2019s efforts to join the booming weight loss drug market, STAT writes. Amgen has so far said little about the drug, dubbed AMG 513, and has not described its mechanism. On a call with analysts, Amgen executives did not explain the reason for the clinical hold, other than to say \u201cit\u2019s not related to the drug\u201d and that discussions are underway to reopen the study. More attention has been paid to a later-stage candidate, MariTide, a monthly injectable that investors hoped could help Amgen compete against drugs on the market like Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy and Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound. But the company late last year reported that MariTide produced about 20% weight loss in patients enrolled in a Phase 2 trial \u2014 results that fell short of investor expectations.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEli Lilly investors and analysts want to hear details from the company on how exactly it plans to grow U.S. sales of popular weight loss drug Zepbound after it last month forecast lower-than-expected fourth-quarter revenues for the drug, Reuters tells us. Lilly, which reports its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, said in January that wholesalers had not restocked their Zepbound inventories as expected, driving shares down 8%. It was the second time in a year its sales had come up short due to issues it attributed to the supply chain. Zepbound, the weight-loss version of diabetes drug Mounjaro, was approved in late 2023 and has had a meteoric rise since, with millions of customers seeking it or its rival, Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy. Demand was so high that Zepbound was in shortage for much of last year, according to the U.S. drugs regulator. The medicine, which has been shown to reduce weight by up to 20%, sells for $650 per month on its website for patients who have insurance that does not cover the drug.",

Cost of Sales as a percentage of product sales decreased 4.0 percentage points for the fourth quarter primarily driven by lower amortization expense from the fair value step-up of inventory acquired from Horizon, partially offset by changes in our sales mix, and higher profit share and royalty expense. For the full year, cost of sales as a percentage of product sales increased 8.7 percentage points driven by higher amortization expense from Horizon acquisition-related assets and, to a lesser extent, higher profit share and royalty expense, partially offset by the Puerto Rico excise tax. Research & Development (R&D) expenses increased 12% for the fourth quarter driven by higher spend in later-stage clinical programs, partially offset by lower research and early pipeline spend. R&D expenses increased 25% for the full year driven by higher spend in later-stage clinical programs and marketed products support, including spend from Horizon-acquired programs. Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased 17% for the fourth quarter primarily driven by lower Horizon acquisition-related expenses. SG&A expenses increased 15% for the full year primarily driven by expenses from the acquired Horizon business and other commercial expenses, partially offset by lower Horizon acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2024. Other operating expenses for the full year primarily consisted of impairment charges associated with in-process R&D (IPR&D) intangible assets related to our Teneobio, Inc. acquisition in 2021 and expenses related to cost-savings initiatives incurred in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\ndecreased 2% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and increased 29% for the full year. as a percentage of product sales decreased 4.0 percentage points for the fourth quarter primarily driven by lower amortization expense from the fair value step-up of inventory acquired from Horizon, partially offset by changes in our sales mix, and higher profit share and royalty expense.

The fourth quarter tax rate increase was related to deferred tax adjustments associated with the U.S. minimum tax on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and prior year favorable items, partially offset by the change in earnings mix as a result of the fourth quarter 2024 unrealized losses on our strategic equity investments (primarily BeiGene). The full year tax rate decrease was due to the change in earnings mix, including the net unrealized impacts of our strategic equity investments (primarily BeiGene), partially offset by the deferred tax adjustments associated with the U.S. minimum tax on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis:\n\nTotal Operating Expenses increased 11% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and increased 24% for the full year.

We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize any of the strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities arising from the Horizon acquisition, and such benefits, synergies or opportunities may take longer to realize than expected. We may not be able to successfully integrate Horizon, and such integration may take longer, be more difficult or cost more than expected. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach of our information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\n\nCONTACT: Amgen, Thousand Oaks\n\nElissa Snook, 609-251-1407 (media)\n\nJustin Claeys, 805-313-9775 (investors)\n\nAmgen Inc.

Generally, the tax impact of adjustments, including the amortization of intangible assets and acquired inventory, gains and losses on our investments in equity securities and expenses related to restructuring and cost-savings initiatives, depends on whether the amounts are deductible in the respective tax jurisdictions and the applicable tax rate(s) in those jurisdictions. Due to these factors, the effective tax rate for the adjustments to our GAAP income before income taxes for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, was 20.7% and 19.4%, respectively, compared to 18.6% and 20.3% for the corresponding periods of the prior year.\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)\n\nThe adjustments related to certain acquisition items, prior period and other items excluded from GAAP earnings.\n\nAmgen Inc.

Analysts say it needs to succeed in weight-loss because its current pipeline won\u2019t be enough to replenish its revenue in the long term.\n\nThe company has MariTide, which is promising because it\u2019s taken less frequently than weekly shots from Eli Lilly & Co. and Novo Nordisk A/S. The drug is in trials and a study in 2024 fell short of expectations. More results from that trial are expected later this year, the company said.\n\nInvestors are focused on obesity for good reason, analysts expect that market to hit $130 billion by 2030. Meanwhile, almost a third of Amgen\u2019s portfolio is facing patent expirations and two of its best-selling bone medicines, Prolia and Xgeva, will face competition from cheaper biosimilars this year.\n\nGrowth Forecast\n\nAmgen sees the potential for 2025 revenues to top Wall Street estimates thanks to growth in cholesterol and cancer drugs.\n\nAnnual sales will be $34.3 billion to $35.7 billion this year, the company said in the statement. The top end of that guidance is higher than Wall Street\u2019s average estimate of $34.6 billion.\n\nLast quarter, Repatha, a cholesterol-lowering drug, was a top performer, with sales surging 45% to $606 million in topping estimates. That helped total revenue in the quarter rise 11% to $9.1 billion, beating the average estimate of $8.9 billion.\n\nQuarterly adjusted earnings were $5.31 a share, above analysts\u2019 average estimate of $5.08 a share.\n\n--With assistance from Ike Swetlitz.\n\n(Updates starting in first paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek",

Analysts estimated Q4 adjusted EPS of $5.08 and revenue of $8.88 billion, but Amgen reported $5.31 in EPS and $9.1 billion in revenue, showcasing double-digit year-on-year growth in both metrics.\n\nOverall, the quarter demonstrated Amgen's effective execution amid a competitive landscape.\n\nMetric Q4 2024 Analysts' Estimate Q4 2023 Change (YOY) Adjusted EPS $5.31 $5.08 $4.71 13% Revenue $9.1 billion $8.88 billion $8.2 billion 11% Operating margin 26.5% N/A 16.2% 10.3 pps Free cash flow $4.4 billion N/A $0.3 billion 1,367%\n\nAmgen's Business Overview\n\nAmgen specializes in biotechnology as it seeks to advance medical therapeutics. Its strategic focus encompasses diverse therapeutic areas, such as oncology and cardiovascular disease, with a robust pipeline of innovative drug candidates. Recent attention includes strategic acquisitions to bolster its presence in rare disease treatments. Success factors for Amgen include its ability to deliver novel therapeutics and manage competitive pressures from biosimilars.\n\nAmgen's keen emphasis on acquiring and integrating high-potential businesses has paved the way for significant expansion. The integration of Horizon Therapeutics (acquired in October 2023), known for rare disease treatments, notably enhanced Amgen's portfolio. This acquisition aligns with its strategy of targeting niche, high-value markets, and it sustains Amgen's long-term growth objectives.\n\nQuarterly Achievements\n\nAmgen reported impressive progress across its product lines in Q4. The standout performer was Repatha, whose sales increased 45% year over year to $606 million thanks to effective volume growth strategies. Tepezza, acquired from Horizon, generated $460 million in sales for the quarter (up 3%). These products underscore Amgen's capacity to seize growth opportunities, particularly in rare disease markets. Additionally, the operating margin expanded to 26.5%, reflecting operational efficiencies.\n\nBiosimilar competition continues to impose challenges, notably impacting legacy products like Neulasta and Enbrel. The sales of these drugs have eroded due to competitive pricing from biosimilar counterparts. However, Amgen proactively launched its own biosimilars, such as Rayos and Pennsaid, to retain its market footprint in lucrative drug categories, notably around prominent treatments like Avastin.\n\nAmgen's free cash flow reached $4.4 billion in the quarter, positioning it well for strategic maneuvers like debt reduction. This accomplishment reflects disciplined capital management amidst continuous investment in R&D and manufacturing capacity enhancement, essential for meeting future demand and sustaining growth.\n\nThe quarter also recorded substantial changes due to the acquisition process. This affected financial figures such as GAAP operating income, which decreased to $7.3 billion for the fiscal year due to expenses related to these acquisitions. However, free cash flow and revenue growth affirm Amgen's strategic positioning.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAmgen's forward guidance anticipates continued growth, forecasting 2025 revenues between $34.3 billion and $35.7 billion, with adjusted EPS projected between $20 and $21.20. These projections signal sustained robust financial performance, despite anticipated competitive and regulatory headwinds.\n\nManagement emphasized its commitment to driving pipeline development, especially in emerging therapeutic areas like oncology and rare diseases. Updates on MariTide, Amgen's weight-reduction candidate that utilizes a version of the appetite- and blood sugar-reducing hormone known as GLP-1, are in the works. Amgen management said follow-up data from a mid-stage trial for the injectible drug and from a trial of the drug in people with diabetes, will be released in the second half of this year.\n\nInvestors should note Amgen's ongoing focus on strategic acquisitions and product pipeline expansion, key drivers in the upcoming quarters. The Horizon acquisition plays a central role in expanding the rare disease treatment portfolio. Amgen also aims to navigate pricing pressures by optimizing reimbursement strategies and delivering shareholder value amidst an evolving biotech landscape.",

( AMGN ) is a global leader in biotechnology, focusing on innovative human therapeutics across various therapeutic areas including oncology, cardiovascular disease, and neuroscience. With a robust portfolio of blockbuster drugs and a promising pipeline, the company continues to drive advancements in medicine, particularly through its biosimilars and cancer treatments.\n\nShares of the world's largest biotech drugmaker have underperformed the broader market over the past 52 weeks. AMGN has decreased 10.7% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ( $SPX ) has gained 20.9% . However, AMGN stock has risen 10.8% on a YTD basis, outperforming SPX's 1.9% YTD gain.\n\nLooking closer, the Thousand Oaks, California-based company has also lagged behind the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund's ( XLV ) 4.1% rise over the past 52 weeks.\n\nAmgen's shares recovered 1.5% following its Q3 earnings release on Oct. 30 due to the company\u2019s stronger-than-expected adjusted EPS of $5.58. The revenue growth of 23% year-over-year to $8.5 billion, driven by higher product sales, also helped boost investor sentiment, particularly the strong performance of drugs like Repatha and Blincyto. Additionally, Amgen raised the lower end of its 2024 revenue guidance to a range of $33 billion to $33.8 billion. Despite higher operating costs, investors were reassured by Amgen's promising pipeline and continued success in rare disease treatments post-Horizon acquisition.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, which ended in December, analysts expect AMGN's EPS to grow 4.9% year-over-year to $19.56. The company's earnings surprise history is promising. It beat the consensus estimates in the last four quarters.\n\nAmong the 30 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 14 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings, one \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d 12 \u201cHolds,\u201d one \u201cModerate Sell,\u201d and two \u201cStrong Sells.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 28, Citi lowered its price target on Amgen to $295 , maintaining a \u201cNeutral\u201d rating due to a more challenging biotech sector outlook in 2025.\n\nAs of writing, AMGN is trading below the mean price target of $320.69. The Street-high price target of $405, implies a modest potential upside of 40.1% from the current price levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amgen Inc. AMGN, Cencora, Inc. COR, Humana Inc. HUM and Ardent Health Partners, Inc. ARDT.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\n4 Healthcare Stocks Poised to Crush Q4 Earnings Estimates\n\nThe fourth-quarter 2024 earnings cycle is here, with quite a few healthcare companies having reported results. Early reports indicate several key growth drivers at play, including increased patient volumes, utilization, admissions, patient days and rate hikes, as well as growing demand for commercial healthcare plans and technology-enabled offerings. However, rising medical costs due to increased utilization and occupancy have partly offset the positives.\n\nBased on our exclusive research and unique market insight, we present four stocks \u2014 Amgen Inc., Cencora, Inc., Humana Inc. and Ardent Health Partners, Inc. \u2014 which are set to beat earnings estimates this earnings season.\n\nSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.\n\nQ4 Expectations\n\nBefore delving into the specifics of what could have impacted fourth-quarter performance, let's examine the sector forecasts.\n\nThe healthcare space is a part of the broader Zacks Medical sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry). According to the latest Earnings Trends report dated Jan. 29, the medical sector is projected to experience 12.5% growth in earnings for the fourth quarter, while revenues are anticipated to rise by 8.6%.\n\nFactors at Play for Healthcare Stocks in Q4\n\nThe healthcare sector is vast and complex, covering hospitals, medical services, nursing homes, health insurance, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and outpatient and home healthcare. A growing aging population and rising demand for healthcare products and services continue to drive sales for industry players.\n\nHowever, investments in technology and innovation have likely pressured profit margins in the short term. Higher salaries and benefits have also increased overall costs for healthcare companies. Additionally, some HMO companies are expected to have seen a decline in Medicaid and Medicare memberships due to redeterminations.\n\nThe patient volumes likely rose in the fourth quarter, driven by more visits and surgeries. Increased revenue per admission should have further boosted top-line growth. The continued resumption of elective procedures, particularly among seniors, also contributed to higher patient volumes. However, this surge in utilization may have led to higher medical costs, potentially squeezing profit margins.\n\nStory Continues",

(NASDAQ:AMGN) stands against other best cancer stocks to buy.\n\nOverview of the Global Oncology Sector\n\nCancer is the second leading cause of death across the globe, second to cardiovascular disease. According to data by the American Cancer Society released in January 2023, the United States was expected to have around 1,958,310 cancer patients by the end of 2023 alone. This reflects a 28% increase from 2010. More than 2 million new cases of cancer were likely to be diagnosed in the US in 2024, with more than 600,000 deaths from the ailment expected in the same year. Like the increasing number of cancer patients, the cost of treating cancer is on an upward trajectory as well. While it cost around $200 billion to treat cancer in the US in 2020, the total expense is anticipated to exceed $245 billion by 2030.\n\nAccording to the \u201cOncology Pharmaceuticals Market 2024\u201d report, global funding for cancer research has grown exponentially over the past two decades. The FDA approved 161 new cancer therapies between 2017 and 2022, which reflects the fast pace with which treatment in the field is advancing. These statistics make oncology one of the most comprehensive sectors of the life science space. The oncology sector covers the entire cancer care process, from diagnosis to treatment.\n\nPharmaceutical and biotech companies around the world are continuously striving to develop more effective cancer treatments. According to Fortune Business Insights, this endeavor is expected to continue increasing in magnitude in the coming future. The global oncology drugs market was valued at around $201.75 billion in 2023. It is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.3%, going from $220.80 billion in 2024 to $518.25 billion by 2032.\n\nSome of the primary factors driving the growth of the oncology drugs market include the advancements in targeted immunotherapies for cancer care and the increasing prevalence of cancer across the globe. This growth rate makes investment in oncology-related companies a lucrative bet. North America is the most dominant geographical region in the global oncology drugs market. It held a 45.92% market share in 2023.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Stocks to Buy in 2025 for Beginners and 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025.\n\nTrends in Precision Oncology\n\nThe precision oncology market reflects similar trends. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) defines precision oncology as a form of treatment where medical professionals choose treatments by keeping the DNA signature of an individual patient\u2019s tumor in view. Statistics from Grand View Research show that the global precision oncology market size was valued at $115.8 billion in 2024.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Amgen Inc. ( ) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 7th of March to $2.38. Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 3.3%, which is fairly typical for the industry.\n\nAmgen's Projected Earnings Seem Likely To Cover Future Distributions\n\nWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Before making this announcement, the company's dividend was higher than its profits, and made up 81% of cash flows. The company could be more focused on returning cash to shareholders, but this could indicate that growth opportunities are few and far between.\n\nOver the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 98.2%. Under the assumption that the dividend will continue along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 65% which would be quite comfortable going to take the dividend forward.\n\nAmgen Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2015, the annual payment back then was $2.44, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $9.52. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 15% over that duration. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.\n\nDividend Growth Is Doubtful\n\nThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. Amgen has seen earnings per share falling at 9.7% per year over the last five years. If earnings continue declining, the company may have to make the difficult choice of reducing the dividend or even stopping it completely - the opposite of dividend growth. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend.\n\nAmgen's Dividend Doesn't Look Sustainable\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Amgen's payments are rock solid. We can't deny that the payments have been very stable, but we are a little bit worried about the very high payout ratio. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.\n\nMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.

            "content": "How To Determine The \u201cBest\u201d Biotech?\n\nBiotech is a sector that is constantly innovating and changing. It is also more technical and complex than most, so the public at large is often oblivious to the radical discoveries made to improve health and save lives.\n\nAs it is driven by scientific progress, it can be tricky for investors to pick the \u201cwinner\u201d or the \u201cbest stock.\u201d Today, the main solution for a disease might be replaced by another better treatment in a few years.\n\nSo, in this article, we will look at biotech companies with a dominant commercial position, as well as astounding intellectual property, technical expertise, and product pipeline. We can reasonably expect those companies to stay market leaders in their niche for the foreseeable future. Their technological acumen is also likely to create entirely new fields of medicine and cure what was previously incurable.\n\n(Companies are ranked by market cap at the time of the writing of this article)\n\nAmgen Inc. AMGN +0.05% )\n\nAmgen is maybe the poster child of success in biotechnology, both for its technological achievement and from an investing point of view. It went from a price of $0.11/share in 1984 to a recent price in the $225-$285/share range in 2022.\n\nIts first achievement was creating the first recombinant human erythropoietin in 1989. It would follow with treatments for rheumatoid arthritis in 1998 and osteoporosis and cancer in 2010 among other protein and biological-base therapeutics.\n\nIt currently has a total of 27 approved treatments, treating 11 million patients. Its most quickly growing products (9 products worth $ 10.5B in sales) have grown their sales volume by 16% in 2022.\n\nIt has 39 potential drugs in its pipeline, of which 18 are already in clinical trials phase 3.\n\nThe company is also routinely acquiring other biotech companies with complementary products to Amgen\u2019s or a promising R&D pipeline.\n\nThe company is giving a dividend (recent yield of 3%) and generated $9B of free cash flow in 2022 from $26B of revenues . It also spent $4B in R&D during the same year.\n\nAmgen combines:\n\nSteady cash flows and profits.\n\nA solid reputation among medical professionals.\n\nA rich portfolio of approved drugs.\n\nA solid pipeline of products in the late stages of development.\n\nA culture of successfully acquiring and integrating smaller biotech companies.\n\nAll of these factors above make Amgen a steady compounder in the biotech field and a solid choice for conservative investors looking for exposure to the biotech and healthcare sector.\n\nGilead Sciences, Inc. GILD +1.81% )\n\nGilead is the other big biotech success story of the last 30 years. Where Amgen focuses on unique proteins, Gilead is centered around specific therapeutic areas, with a predilection for untreated diseases, mostly in virology at first and then in oncology . An emerging focus is also inflammation, the root cause of many other hard-to-treat diseases.\n\nIt currently has 30 approved drugs , with most of them for HIV, Hepatitis, and cancer.\n\nIts pipeline contains 59 clinical trial programs, of which 19 are in phase 3.\n\nThe company had great commercial success recently, with its oncology sales growing by 71% year-to-year in 2022 . Still, HIV sales make up 3/5th of total sales. Total sales grew by 12% YoY. The company is highly profitable, with $9.1B in net income in 2022.\n\nThe company is currently making most of its money from HIV treatments. Successfully growing the oncology department will be key to sustaining growth, with 38/59 trials in the pipeline in this segment. This might be a reasonable assumption since 14 of these oncology trials are either in phase 3 or already approved.\n\nGilead is a surprisingly \u201cniche\u201d biotech for its market cap, very focused on HIV and, to some extent, oncology. Investors in Gilead might want to understand the dynamic of the HIV drug market as most of the company's ongoing cash flow is tied to it.\n\nVertex is the leader in Cystic Fibrosis treatment, a deadly genetic disease, with 4 different treatments targeting different patient profiles. For patients who cannot be treated with the current therapy, they have a drug in phase 3 of clinical trials, Vanzacaftor. They are also developing gene therapy for cystic fibrosis using mRNA technology.\n\nThey partner with CRISPR Therapeutics to help develop the blood disease gene therapy mentioned above.\n\nThey also have their own product in development for Type-1 Diabetes.\n\nLastly, their VX-548 treatment for acute pain is the last stage of development and might be a new alternative to opioids, without the risk of addiction and fewer side effects.\n\nVertex's dominance over cystic fibrosis is well established, and its partnership with CRISPR Therapeutic and other innovations should allow it to maintain strong control over this market.\n\nThe rest of its pipeline is a little more speculative. The stronger part is type-1 diabetes, as it comes from Vertex's acquisition of ViaCyte and is partially built on another partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics.\n\nVertex is a more risky bet than other large established biotech, considering its current valuation relies entirely on controlling the cystic fibrosis market. Cystic fibrosis is currently highly profitable, but it might be curable through gene editing in the long run.\n\nAny growth expectation must rely on the success of its painkiller or diabetes R&D effort. Nevertheless, these 2 markets are gigantic and not optimally treated, so that positive results could propel the company to new heights among biotech leaders.\n\nWith the explosion of gene therapies and tools for medical researchers in genetics, the demand for machinery in this field is growing extremely rapidly. One day, a full genome sequence will likely be a normal part of everyone\u2019s medical treatment and maybe even done at birth.\n\nThis niche market is dominated by just a handful of companies holding a quasi-monopole on this technology.\n\nBy far, the leader of the Next-Generation Genomics (NGS) sector, if measured by the number of machines installed and revenues, is Illumina.\n\nThis is also a company that we covered previously in this article, comparing it to its smaller competitor, P acific Bioscience.\n\nIt is currently challenged by startups in its home domain of genome sequencing but is likely to stay the dominant player with its new generation of sequencer, NovaSeqX, already sold out. It also owns Grail, a liquid biopsy company that detects cancer early from a blood sample.\n\nOverall, Illumina is a way to play the genomic revolution without looking to pick the winning biotech with the best treatment.\n\nA full genome currently costs $600 with a target of $200 with the recently launched new NovaSeq X. The cheaper genomic gets, the more its market grows, historically confined to research, now in diagnostic, and then as a routine procedure at some point in the future.\n\nInvestors will want to be cautious of the fact that the company is not profitable, preferring to spend its cash on improving its technology. So, growth investors are likely to be more comfortable with this stock, which could be compared to Intel in the early 1990s.\n\nBioNTech SE BNTX -1.87% )\n\nBy far the most-known biotech company after the Covid-19 pandemic. It is the trailblazer for mRNA vaccine technology and is now expanding quickly.\n\nFirst, BioNTech works on mRNA vaccines for shingles, tuberculosis, malaria, HIV, and the herpes virus. Only its direct competitor, Moderna ( MRNA ), is developing more mRNA vaccines than BioNTech.\n\nThe next step for BioNTech in maintaining its leadership in mRNA is expanding the technology to new applications. The company has no less than 12 candidate cancer treatment products in its pipeline . It is by far the leader for this potential application, as Moderna has only 2 candidate mRNA treatments for cancer, and Curevac ( CVAC ) has only 1 candidate.\n\nYou can read more about the future of mRNA technology in our article \u201c The Next Application for mRNA Technology: Cancer Therapies \u201d\n\nThe success of the COVID-19 vaccine (60% market share worldwide) also provided BioNTech with more than enough funding to expand aggressively without needing extra funding, with $13.9B in cash at the end of 2022.\n\nDespite its larger reputation, BioNTech has the smallest market cap among the top 5 on April 2023. It is currently trading at a P/E just above 3 due to the Covid profit.\n\nEven if this ratio is likely to re-balance with the end of the pandemic, BioNTech is probably a safe bet, considering its stock price also cooled down since the height of the pandemic. When valuing the company, the \u201cblue ocean\u201d strategic potential of expanding mRNA to replace traditional vaccines or treat cancer should also be part of the equation.",

            "content": "Pharmaceutical Innovation At The Core Of Healthcare\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry has been built on the back of scientific innovation. The first innovators a century ago have turned into large pharmaceutical companies regularly re-inventing themselves.\n\nThis is because life sciences and medicine have evolved equally fast in the last few generations. In addition, patent protection often expires less than 10-15 years after the commercialization of a new therapy, forcing pharmaceutical companies to invent new products constantly.\n\nThanks to this pressure to constantly innovate, even large companies kept the incentives to stay able to invent regularly life-changing medicine.\n\nIn this article, we will see some of the best healthcare innovators in all arrays of medicine, from cancer treatments to vaccines, rare diseases, neurosciences, or metabolic therapies.\n\nTop 10 Pharmaceutical Stocks for Healthcare Innovation\n\n(These stocks are organized by market capitalization at the time of writing of this article)\n\nJohnson & Johnson JNJ +1.6% )\n\nThe largest pharmaceutical company by revenues in 2022, with $94B. The company operates as a conglomerate of 3 sub-businesses: pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer healthcare (by importance order).\n\nIt operates no less than 29 products or platforms with more than $1B in annual sales. Non-medical professionals might be more familiar with some of the consumer health products like Listerine, Neutrogena, or Tylenol. Still, more than half of its revenues are from pharmaceuticals, with a focus on 6 therapeutic areas:\n\nImmunology.\n\nInfectious diseases.\n\nNeurosciences\n\nOncology\n\nCardiovascular & metabolism.\n\nPulmonary hypertension.\n\nJ&J was the second largest pharmaceutical company by R&D investment in 2022 and boasts an impressive lineup:\n\n6 new products were approved in 2022.\n\n20 large MedTech pipeline programs.\n\n81 innovation deals.\n\n20 new equity investments in 2022.\n\n8 licensing agreements in 2022.\n\nWith its highly diversified activities in consumer health, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices, J&J is a good pick for investors looking to bet on pharmaceutical innovation with as little volatility as possible.\n\n(You can read more about J&J's innovation strategy from this transcript of a speech given at Sanford C Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference )\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company BMY -0.05% )\n\nBMS is a pharmaceutical company with a strong presence in cancer, hematology, immunology, and cardiology.\n\nThe company is targeting its risk-adjusted sales to grow from $10B-$13B in 2025 to $25+B in 2030, with the growth coming from both currently commercialized blockbuster drugs increasing their market and new therapies. The new therapies are growing very quickly, having more than doubled revenues between 2022 and 2023.\n\nBMS also has more than 50 therapies in the early stage of clinical trials, of which half are in oncology.\n\nWith half of the 2020-2025 revenues expected to come from the new product portfolio, BMS has already achieved remarkable innovations and should strongly increase its operating margins.\n\nThe success is the commercialized new product portfolio is very encouraging, and BMS might be on the verge of a decade of explosive growth driven by its new product portfolio and its strong performance in all of its 4 core segments.\n\nInvestors will want to pay close attention to phase 3 of clinical trials and the continuing new product sales growth.\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S NVO +1.46% )\n\nNovo Nordisk's innovation has traditionally been razor-focused on diabetes, the core segment for the company. This is still true, with 10 clinical trials ongoing in the field .\n\nHowever, the major innovation of Novo Nordisk is in the obesity market, with its newly launched Wegovy, an injectable medicine for weight loss initially used for diabetes.\n\nThe drug is showing strong medical results and has been regularly sold out, even with Novo Nordisk increasing production capacity several times. The drug is proving so popular that a TikTok-induced mania even increased the shortage .\n\nThe company is also working on growth hormones and acquiring the connected medical device BIOCORP .\n\nWhile its diabetes business is likely stable for the next decade, innovative treatment could slowly endanger this market, especially for type-1 diabetes.\n\nSo, the expansion in the obesity market is likely to represent the long-term prospect for growth for Novo Nordisk. We discussed This market in more detail in our article \u201c Top Companies In Obesity Treatments .\u201d\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. MRK +0.86% )\n\nMerck has changed since its 2021 spin-off of women's health and biosimilar products in Organon . The company is currently most active in infectious diseases, vaccines, oncology, and cardiovascular & metabolic disorders.\n\nAt its core, Merck is a technology company that goes beyond just pharmaceuticals. For example, it has a semiconductor offer (equally useful for many biotech equipment like DNA readers). It also controls Sigma Aldrich, a leading supplier of laboratory and testing materials and consumable s , which is part of the broader life science offering , which relies on 59 manufacturing sites and proposes 300,000 products.\n\nThe company has an ambitious R&D roadmap , with 1 new pharmaceutical launch every 1.5 years. This includes the potential of a new therapeutic method for cancer, relying on targeted DNA disruption.\n\nMerck combines steady cash flow from its industrial capacities (semiconductors and life sciences) with the potential of new blockbuster drugs in cancer and neurology.\n\nWith Merck's flagship drug, Keytruda, losing its patent protection in 2028, these innovations will be needed to keep the company's income growing.\n\nSo, investors in Merck will want to keep an eye on the R&D portfolio to see if the company has been able to reinvent itself after that date.\n\nPfizer Inc. PFE +1.17% )\n\nAlready a large company, Pfizer made it big with the Covid-19 vaccine. It generated no less than $37B in 2021, for example, almost half of the company's revenues. The pandemic also boosted the sale of the antiviral pill Paxlovid by another $20B.\n\nPfizer sees the pandemic windfall profits as leverage to expand with new products and to \u201c allow us to pursue new business development opportunities going forward that could add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenue to our 2030 top-line expectation . \u201d\n\nAmong these opportunities for the next 2 years are 4 vaccines, of which 3 are mRNA, one treatment for growth hormone deficiency, and two for inflammatory diseases. It also covers 7 new indications for existing drugs and 4 business development deals.\n\nIn the longer term, a lot more potential launches could also work in a large variety of applications. This includes a potential competitor on obesity to Novo Nordisk's Wegovy, new vaccines, hemophilia therapies, and cancer treatments.\n\nPfizer is a company that has demonstrated with the pandemic its ability to cash in on innovation and taken a strong lead in the vaccine sector. Combined with its previously well-established lines of business in oncology and inflammatory disease, this should reassure investors of Pfizer's ability to keep bringing new therapies to the market.\n\nBayer is equal parts an agriculture company and a pharmaceutical company.\n\nAfter its merger with Monsanto, it is one of the world's largest biotech and seed companies. It controls most of the traditional GMO seed market and is also working on using CRISPR for the next generation of seeds for corn, soybeans, wheat, etc\u2026\n\nThe pharmaceutical activity, under prescription and over-the-counter (OTC), is roughly half of the company\u2019s revenues, with the other half made of the agricultural business. It covers a large spectrum of therapeutic areas, with a third of its sales in the cardiovascular segment.\n\nBayer\u2019s focus on innovation is on\n\nEye treatments, in partnership with Regeneron (Eylea is the second best-selling drug of Bayer)\n\nStem cell treatments for Parkinson\u2019s disease and heart attacks, in partnership with BlueRock Therapeutics .\n\n. Gene therapies, in partnership with AskBio .\n\n. Oncology (cancer treatments): 2 drugs in clinical trials in phase III, 2 in phase II, and 8 in phase I\n\nFar from a distraction, the agricultural segment of the company shares many R&D capacities and human resources with the pharmaceutical segment.\n\nHowever, Bayer's stock valuation has been hammered down due to legal risk from its Monsanto acquisition and court case on the potential of the pesticide RoundUp to cause cancer.\n\nSo investors will want to assess if the pharmaceutical segment is at a deep discount due to these legal issues or if the risk is too high despite Bayer's other IPs and R&D pipeline quality.\n\nAmgen Inc. AMGN -0.01% )\n\nAmgen is maybe the poster child of success in biotechnology, both for its technological achievement and from an investing point of view. It went from a price of $0.11/share in 1984 to a recent price in the $225-$285/share range in 2022.\n\nIts first achievement was creating the first recombinant human erythropoetin in 1989. It would follow with treatments for rheumatoid arthritis in 1998 and osteoporosis and cancer in 2010, among other protein and biological-based therapeutics.\n\nIt currently has a total of 27 approved treatments, treating 11 million patients. Its most quickly growing products (9 products worth $ 10.5B in sales) have grown their sales volume by 16% in 2022.\n\nIt has 39 potential drugs in its pipeline, of which 18 are already in clinical trials phase 3 , with a strong predominance of inflammation and oncology for these most advanced clinical trials.\n\nAnother innovation is AMG 133, an obesity treatment that is hoped to be more powerful than the existing therapies. AMG 133\u2019s unique advantage would also be a long half-life, with a dosage every 4 weeks instead of the required weekly treatment of Wegovy .\n\nBecause it is only entering phase 2 of clinical trials and because the company focuses on a wide array of therapies, AMG 133 is less central to the investment thesis for Amgen. Still, a potential 5-20 billion dollar blockbuster drug could seriously boost the company's bottom line. So, with Wegovy showing the market is larger than expected, this is something investors in Amgen will want to keep an eye on.\n\nThe company also has a biosimilar department (the equivalent of generic drugs for biotech treatments), with 5 approved drugs and 3 drugs in the R&D pipeline .\n\nAmgen has historically been one of the most innovative pharmaceutical companies ever made, almost single-handedly creating the biotech sector. Its impressive R&D pipeline shows Amgen is determined to keep that reputation intact, including by venturing into new segments like the obesity market.\n\nGilead Sciences, Inc. GILD +1.85% )\n\nGilead is the other big biotech success story of the last 30 years. Where Amgen focuses on unique proteins, Gilead is centered around specific therapeutic areas, with a predilection for untreated diseases, mostly in virology at first and then in oncology .\n\nAn emerging focus is also inflammation, the root cause of many other hard-to-treat diseases. Still, HIV represents by far the bulk of Gilead's current income.\n\nIt currently has 30 approved drugs , most of them for HIV, Hepatitis, and cancer. Its R&D pipeline contains 59 clinical trial programs, of which 19 are in phase 3.\n\nThe R&D programs are overwhelmingly dominated by infectious diseases and oncology clinical trials, deepening Gilead's specialization, especially with 13 HIV-related clinical trials.\n\nGilead is a surprisingly \u201cniche\u201d biotech for its market cap, very focused on HIV and, to some extent, oncology. Investors in Gilead might want to understand the dynamic of the HIV drug market as most of the company's ongoing cash flow is tied to it.\n\nThe company behind the Covid mRNA vaccine sold by Pfizer is now using the money made during the pandemic to expand its offer widely.\n\nIt is now developing mRNA vaccines for shingles, tuberculosis, malaria, HIV, and the herpes virus. This makes it a leading company in the field of mRNA vaccines, with only its competitor Moderna ( MRNA ) developing more mRNA vaccines than BioNTech. You can read more about the future of mRNA technology in our article \u201c The Next Application for mRNA Technology: Cancer Therapies .\u201d\n\nBioNTech is also working on various other therapeutic methods, including cell and gene therapies, antibodies, and chemical drugs.\n\nAs the great winner of true transformation innovation with the arrival of mRNA during the pandemic, BioNTech has a spotless image with investors, even if the current stock price cooled down from the pandemic highs.\n\nThe company's future will depend on expanding mRNA to replace many older vaccines and on mRNA capacity to be used for other applications, of which cancer is the most promising financially.\n\nThe other big winner of the pandemic and the mRNA vaccine technology, Moderna, is doubling down on the vaccine application of mRNA. It has no less than 32 clinical trials for mRNA vaccines, covering 14 pathogens like the RSV, Zika, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, or cytomegalovirus .\n\nDespite the focus on vaccine application, Moderna also has some research programs regarding cancer application, cardiac regeneration, and rare diseases, including cystic fibrosis in partnership with the leader in this sector, Vertex.\n\nThis R&D frenzy is fueled by the revenues from the COVID-19 vaccine and represents a tripling of R&D spending in 2023 compared to 2020.\n\nModerna is also looking to use its available cash, $16.4B in Q1 2023, to acquire licenses from smaller biotech or directly acquire these companies. The focus seems to be on technology platforms, which include synthetic genome company OriCiro , metagenomics and AI gene discovery Metagenomi , and macrophage therapies Carisma Therapeutics .\n\nModerna is, for now, a mRNA company with strong prospects in infectious diseases and rare genetic diseases. In the long run, its collaboration with startups working on new biotech technologies could yield out-sized results, similar to how mRNA used to be just a theoretical concept for decades.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Cheap Quarterly Dividend Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) stands against the other cheap quarterly dividend stocks.\n\nGrowth stocks are typically seen as companies with the potential to outperform the market in the future, even if they are currently unprofitable or trading at high valuations. While they offer the possibility of substantial returns, they also come with significant risks. In contrast, value stocks tend to perform well when the broader economy is expanding. These are well-established companies with consistent profits, many of which pay dividends. Investors are drawn to them because they are often perceived as undervalued relative to their true worth. Sectors like banking, utilities, and healthcare fall into this category. Historically, value stocks have outpaced growth stocks for much of the market\u2019s history, but that trend has reversed over the past decade.\n\nOver the past five years, the growth stocks in the Vanguard Fund have surged approximately 111%, with much of the increase occurring after the fourth quarter of 2022. This momentum was largely driven by major tech firms introducing artificial intelligence products and services, which accelerated earnings growth and lifted valuations. Meanwhile, value stocks have struggled to keep pace. Since late 2022, the value stocks in the Vanguard Fund have lagged behind its growth-focused counterpart and have gained only 48% over the past five years. In theory, this gap suggests value stocks could eventually rebound. Many of these companies continue to generate profits and return a portion to shareholders, so at some point, buyers may step in, pushing their performance closer to historical norms.\n\nBy the end of 2024, the value fund was trading at around 16 times its projected earnings for the year, significantly lower than the growth fund, which was valued at approximately 27 times earnings. This represents a roughly 40% discount, compared to the average 30% gap over the past decade, according to Barron\u2019s analysis of FactSet data. This valuation gap makes value stocks look more appealing. If these companies deliver earnings in line with or above analysts\u2019 expectations, they could demonstrate to the market that they are worth more than their current prices suggest, potentially leading to strong stock performance.\n\nAlso read:\n\n15 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nAs noted earlier, value stocks are often associated with dividend payments. These stocks typically offer higher dividend yields and stronger fundamental ratios compared to growth stocks. When it comes to dividend investing, dividend growth plays a crucial role. The Dividend Aristocrats Index serves as a key benchmark for dividend-focused strategies, tracking companies that have increased their payouts for at least 25 consecutive years.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Biosimilars are often promoted as cost-saving alternatives to their reference medications. Designed to provide comparable therapeutic efficacy at a reduced price, they have the potential to lower healthcare costs for both patients and healthcare systems.\n\nHowever, practices nationwide are facing the opposite issue with certain infused biosimilars. Rather than saving money, the acquisition costs of these drugs exceed reimbursement rates. As a result, many practices can no longer afford to offer these \u201cunderwater\u201d medications.\n\nThe problem began with biosimilars for infliximab \u2014 a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor indicated for inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis. Pfizer\u2019s and Celltrion\u2019s Inflectra (infliximab-dyyb) was the first biosimilar to go underwater, followed by Avsola (infliximab-axxq), manufactured by Amgen.\n\nThis issue has now expanded to other biosimilars beyond the infliximab family.\n\nThis unsustainable situation threatens private practices and outpatient centers\u2019 ability to continue to provide these infused biosimilars to patients, said Ashley Beall, MD, the managing director of Arthritis and Rheumatism Associates, P.C., a seven-office rheumatology practice in Maryland; Washington, DC; and Virginia. Many other biosimilars for rheumatologic medications are launching in the next 2 years, \u201cand we\u2019re very concerned about seeing the same thing happen again,\u201d she told Medscape Medical News.\n\nWhat Is Going on Here?\n\nDrug manufacturers offer pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and insurers rebates in exchange for preferred formulary placement. For provider-administered drugs covered under Medicare Part B, these rebates are factored into calculating the average sales price (ASP) of a medication, which in turn determines reimbursement by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Commercial insurers often use ASP and CMS reimbursement to determine their own rates as well.\n\nThese aggressive price concessions to PBMs and payors contribute to a rapidly falling ASP, which is updated quarterly. However, these rebates that lower ASP do not affect the price providers pay to acquire the medication from wholesalers.\n\n\u201cThe drug may be bought for a certain price, but the reimbursement is lowered due to the rebates,\u201d explained Chris Phillips, MD, the chair of the American College of Rheumatology Committee on Rheumatologic Care. He has a solo private practice in Paducah, Kentucky.\n\nThe result is acquisition prices that can exceed reimbursement rates by more than twofold or threefold.\n\nFor Local Infusion, which operates across 17 ambulatory infusion clinics in six states, the cost to purchase Inflectra is about $400 per 100-mg vial, while CMS reimbursement totals $115, Co-Founder Ashley Knapp, RN, MBA, shared with Medscape Medical News. Avsola has similar margins, with an acquisition cost of $490 and a reimbursement rate of $198.\n\nBy taking on a patient on Avsola, \u201cyou are agreeing to lose $300 per vial, per infusion,\u201d Knapp said, \u201cand a patient is generally on four to five vials, if not more.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Inflation Reduction Act temporarily increased Medicare reimbursement for biosimilars from ASP+6% to ASP+8% \u2014 if the biosimilar\u2019s ASP is lower than that of the reference product \u2014 that doesn\u2019t solve the issue.\n\n\u201cThat 2% increase is just a drop in the bucket on what you are losing,\u201d Phillips noted.\n\nSince entering the market in 2017, the ASP of Inflectra has fallen by nearly 90%, according to CMS data. Avsola\u2019s ASP has dropped by 60% since it launched in late 2020.\n\nAnd the issue is growing. Truxima (rituximab-abbs), a biosimilar for rituximab by Teva and Celltrion, is also underwater. The tocilizumab biosimilar Tyenne (tocilizumab-aazg), which Fresenius Kabi launched in 2024, is already unaffordable for practices. Since October 2024, ASP has dropped by 16%, Phillips said.\n\n\u201cOur acquisition prices did not drop, so this one has gone underwater in record time,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the same time, more payors are requiring that patients switch to these biosimilars. In 2018, 41% of individuals with commercial insurance had plans listing Inflectra as a preferred product, according to a report by the IQVIA Institute of Human Data Science. In 2023, that percentage rose to 94%. Avsola has also seen increased uptake from commercial plans, while Remicade, the reference product, has experienced a decline.\n\nIn 2018, 93% of individuals with commercial insurance had plans that preferred Remicade compared with just 50% in 2023.\n\nRestricting Patient Access\n\nDespite increasing payor preference toward these \u201cunderwater\u201d biosimilars, most private practices cannot afford to offer these medications to patients. Referring patients elsewhere likely will not work \u201cbecause most other outpatient or freestanding infusion centers are having the same issue,\u201d Beall said, \u201cso these patients have nowhere to go.\u201d\n\nBecause hospital-based infusion centers are billed differently, hospitals may be able to offer these biosimilars. However, payors can also turn down patients receiving infusions there because of the higher cost location of care.\n\nPhillips, who also provides infusions to non-rheumatology patients from academic centers, recalled one gastroenterology patient whose insurance required that they receive care at a nonhospital facility and mandated the use of either Inflectra or Avsola. Appeals to the patient\u2019s insurance were unsuccessful.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t treat the patient, and they couldn\u2019t be infused at the hospital because the payer didn\u2019t want to pay for that, so the patient was literally stuck with no options,\u201d Phillips said, noting it was \u201cthe most egregious case of this that I\u2019ve run into.\u201d\n\nBut that patient experience is not uncommon, with both Beall and Knapp also dealing with this issue with patients.\n\nSwitching patients to a medication with a different mechanism of action, although not ideal, is another option, said Helen Hinkle, the office administrator for Rheumatology Associates of South Texas, which has two locations in San Antonio.\n\nHer practice initially embraced biosimilars to reduce healthcare costs, she said. But once these infliximab biosimilars became unaffordable, \u201cwe either had to move [patients] to the brand name \u2014 because that was still somewhat profitable \u2014 or if the plan was not allowing that, we had to change that patient\u2019s medication altogether.\u201d\n\nWhile most patients tolerated the switch, \u201cthere were some cases where patients had to try a third drug because the second drug that we moved them to didn\u2019t work as well,\u201d she said.\n\nWhite Bagging\n\nThrough \u201cwhite bagging\u201d \u2014 where the patient\u2019s medication is shipped directly to providers via a specialty pharmacy \u2014 a provider does not have to purchase the medication. However, they are only reimbursed for the administration of these medications.\n\n\u201cIf we white-bagged everybody\u2019s treatments, we wouldn\u2019t be able to stay in business,\u201d Phillips said.\n\nUnder buy-and-bill, a practice purchases the medication upfront and can provide that medication to any eligible patient on the day of their appointment. In white bagging, the drug is designated for one patient. The effort to get prior authorization and coordinate the delivery of these white-bagged medications adds administrative and personnel costs, Knapp explained.\n\n\u201cThe administration [fees] barely cover the supplies,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you factor in the nursing time, the time that the patient is in the chair, and the time our staff has spent on getting the patient approved, you are already in the red on administration.\u201d\n\nIf there are delays in shipping, a patient\u2019s drug might not arrive on time for their appointment, resulting in delays in care.\n\nThese specialty pharmacies can also have their own preferred formularies, which adds another layer of confusion, Knapp said.\n\nFor example, while a patient\u2019s insurance may mandate using Avsola or Inflectra, the specialty pharmacy might prefer the reference product Remicade. So, via white bagging, a practice may end up administering a drug that initially insurance would not cover.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very confusing for everyone,\u201d Knapp said, and results in further delays in treatment.\n\nThat also means white bagging a drug that would have been profitable under the traditional buy-and-bill system, she said.\n\nLooking for Solutions\n\nA coalition of over 40 provider and patient advocacy organizations is currently working to address this issue, meeting last year with CMS to discuss concerns around calculating ASP and the resulting inadequate reimbursement.\n\nIn a letter to leaders in Congress, the coalition outlined three potential solutions.\n\nThe first would base reimbursement on the provider\u2019s acquisition cost, though this option could be \u201cvery burdensome\u201d to providers, Phillips said. It would require all providers to report to the payer exactly what they paid for the drug, and the payor would reimburse them based on that number. \u201cThe workload on that would be massive,\u201d he said.\n\nThe second, and currently favored, option is to base provider reimbursement on the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) \u2014 the manufacturer\u2019s list price \u2014 of a medication until the ASP stabilizes. CMS already uses WAC to inform reimbursement when a medication first comes to market, Phillips explained, until ASP information is available. Extending WAC-based pricing is currently the goal of advocacy groups, but it would require legislation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that Medicare or CMS can just do on their own,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ideal long-term solution, he said, would be to remove manufacturer rebates from the ASP formula, so it accurately reflects what providers pay for these medications. However, lobbying for that change is \u201ca little more than we can bite off and chew in the first pass,\u201d Phillips said.\n\nBeall, Phillips, and Hinkle had no relevant disclosures. Knapp is on the advisory board for Cencora (a distributor) and the advisory committee for the National Infusion Center Association.\n\nFebruary 5, 2025 \u2014 Editor's note: This article has been updated to clarify the name of an institute providing a report mentioned in the article.",

In the last reported quarter, the company beat earnings expectations by 9.20%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter sales and earnings is pegged at $8.84 billion and $5.01 per share, respectively.\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nFactors to Consider for Amgen\n\nAmgen\u2019s product sales are expected to have been driven by strong volume growth of products like Evenity, Repatha, Prolia, Kyprolis and Blincyto, among others. However, prices of most products are expected to continue to decline due to higher rebates to support expanded access.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Prolia, Repatha, Evenity and Blincyto sales is pegged at $1.18 billion, $551.0 million, $413.0 million and $339.0 million, respectively.\n\nOur estimates for Prolia, Repatha and Evenity sales are pegged at $1.05 billion, $542.9 million, $418.3 million and $316.3 million, respectively.\n\nIn addition, higher volumes of newer drugs like Tezspire and Tavneos are expected to have contributed to top-line growth driven by new patient volume growth.\n\nOur estimates for Tezspire and Tavneos are pegged at $274.4 million and $102.9 million, respectively.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tezspire and Tavneos is $285 million and $93 million, respectively.\n\nThe U.S. launch of Imdelltra (tarlatamab), approved for pre-treated advanced small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) in May 2024, is progressing well. The drug recorded sequential growth of 200% in the third quarter. The growth momentum is expected to have continued in the fourth quarter.\n\nEnbrel sales are likely to have declined due to flat volumes and declining prices. Otezla sales were soft in the last three reported quarters. It remains to be seen if sales improved in the third quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Otezla is $611.0 million, while our estimate is $605.4 million.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Enbrel is $861.0 million, while our estimate is $874.5 million.\n\nSales of Tepezza, Krystexxa and Uplizna, acquired from the October 2023 acquisition of Horizon, are likely to have pulled up the top line.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Tepezza sales are expected to have been flat to down slightly on a sequential basis. In order to improve Tepezza sales, Amgen has been reorganizing and expanding its sales force to reach out to low clinical activity score (CAS) patients. Amgen expects to launch the drug in Japan, where it was recently approved, in 2025. An update is expected on the fourth-quarter conference call.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "BLINCYTO Added to Multiphase Consolidation Chemotherapy Significantly Reduced the Risk of Death Versus Chemotherapy Alone\n\nTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Jan. 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved BLINCYTO\u00ae (blinatumomab) monotherapy as part of consolidation therapy for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-negative CD19-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).\n\n\"This approval represents a significant advancement, offering patients the opportunity to receive BLINCYTO earlier in their treatment pathway, with the potential to improve outcomes,\" said Jean-Charles Soria, senior vice president of Global Oncology Development at Amgen. \"The E1910 data that served as the basis of this approval adds to the growing body of evidence of the meaningful survival impact of BLINCYTO.\"\n\nThe Phase 3 E1910 clinical trial led by ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group studied patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL receiving postinduction consolidation treatment, which aims to deepen remission to achieve durable responses. Study results demonstrated that BLINCYTO added to multiphase consolidation chemotherapy showed superior overall survival (OS) versus chemotherapy alone. With a median follow-up of 4.5 years, the 5-year OS was 82.4% in the BLINCYTO plus chemotherapy arm (n=112) and 62.5% in the chemotherapy arm (n=112).\n\n\"While there has been some treatment progress, many patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL remain at high risk of relapse,\" said Robin Fo\u00e0, M.D., emeritus professor of hematology, Sapienza University of Rome. \"The E1910 study results highlight that BLINCYTO has the potential to advance frontline consolidation treatment, including patients who are minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative, offering a crucial new option to achieve deeper remissions and improve long-term survival.\"\n\nThe E1910 study was designed and conducted independently from industry. ECOG-ACRIN led the trial with public funding and sponsorship provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Other NCI-funded network groups took part in the study. In addition, Amgen provided BLINCYTO and support through an NCI Cooperative Research and Development Agreement.\n\nAbout Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)\n\nALL, also known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, is a fast-growing type of blood cancer that develops in the bone marrow and can sometimes spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, liver, spleen and central nervous system. In Europe, ALL has an estimated prevalence of 1.28 persons per 100,000 people.1 Among both children and adults, the most common subtype of ALL is B-ALL.1 B-ALL begins in immature cells that would normally develop into B-cell lymphocytes, which are white blood cells that grow in bone marrow.2,3 B-ALL is the most common type of ALL, constituting approximately 75% of cases in adults.4\n\nAbout BLINCYTO\u00ae (blinatumomab)\n\nBLINCYTO is the first globally approved Bispecific T-cell Engager (BiTE\u00ae) immuno-oncology therapy that targets CD19 surface antigens on B cells. BiTE\u00ae molecules fight cancer by helping the body's immune system detect and target malignant cells by engaging T cells (a type of white blood cell capable of killing other cells perceived as threats) to cancer cells. By bringing T cells near cancer cells, the T cells can inject toxins and trigger cancer cell death (apoptosis). BiTE\u00ae immuno-oncology therapies are currently being investigated for their potential to treat a wide variety of cancers.\n\nIn the European Union (EU), BLINCYTO is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of:\n\nAdults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative CD19-positive relapsed or refractory B-ALL. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive B-ALL should have failed treatment with at least two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and have no alternative treatment options.\n\nchromosome-negative CD19-positive relapsed or refractory B-ALL. Patients with chromosome-positive B-ALL should have failed treatment with at least two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and have no alternative treatment options. Adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative CD19-positive B-ALL in first or second complete remission with MRD greater than or equal to 0.1%.\n\nchromosome-negative CD19-positive B-ALL in first or second complete remission with MRD greater than or equal to 0.1%. Pediatric patients aged 1 month or older with Philadelphia chromosome-negative CD19-positive B-ALL which is refractory or in relapse after receiving at least two prior therapies or in relapse after receiving prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n\nchromosome-negative CD19-positive B-ALL which is refractory or in relapse after receiving at least two prior therapies or in relapse after receiving prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Pediatric patients aged 1 month or older with high-risk first relapsed Philadelphia chromosome-negative CD19-positive B-ALL as part of the consolidation therapy.\n\nchromosome-negative CD19-positive B-ALL as part of the consolidation therapy. Adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-negative CD19-positive B-ALL as part of consolidation therapy.\n\nBLINCYTO was granted breakthrough therapy and Priority Review designations by the U.S. FDA and is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of:\n\nAdult and pediatric patients one month or older with CD19-positive Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL during the consolidation phase of multiphase therapy.\n\nchromosome-negative B-ALL during the consolidation phase of multiphase therapy. CD19-positive B-ALL in first or second complete remission with MRD greater than or equal to 0.1% in adults and pediatric patients one month or older.\n\nRelapsed or refractory CD19-positive B-ALL in adults and pediatric patients one month or older.\n\nEU SAFETY INFORMATION FOR BLINCYTO\u00ae\n\nThe safety profile of BLINCYTO in the Phase 3 E1910 study was consistent with the known safety profile for BLINCYTO.\n\nSee BLINCYTO\u00ae full Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) at www.ema.europa.eu\n\nAbout BiTE\u00ae Technology\n\nBispecific T-cell Engager (BiTE\u00ae) technology is a targeted immuno-oncology platform that is designed to engage patient's own T cells to any tumor-specific antigen, activating the cytotoxic potential of T cells to eliminate detectable cancer. The BiTE\u00ae immuno-oncology platform has the potential to treat different tumor types through tumor-specific antigens. The BiTE\u00ae platform has a goal of leading to off-the-shelf solutions, which have the potential to make innovative T cell treatment available to all providers when their patients need it. Amgen is advancing multiple BiTE\u00ae molecules across a broad range of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, further investigating BiTE\u00ae technology with the goal of enhancing patient experience and therapeutic potential. To learn more about BiTE\u00ae technology, visit https://www.amgenoncology.com/bite-platform.html.\n\nAbout Amgen\n\nAmgen discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative medicines to help millions of patients in their fight against some of the world's toughest diseases.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd. or Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.), the performance of Otezla\u00ae (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), our acquisitions of Teneobio, Inc., ChemoCentryx, Inc., or Horizon Therapeutics plc (including the prospective performance and outlook of Horizon's business, performance and opportunities, any potential strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities expected as a result of such acquisition, and any projected impacts from the Horizon acquisition on our acquisition-related expenses going forward), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems on our business, outcomes, progress, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nNo forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.\n\nOur results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize any of the strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities arising from the Horizon acquisition, and such benefits, synergies or opportunities may take longer to realize than expected. We may not be able to successfully integrate Horizon, and such integration may take longer, be more difficult or cost more than expected. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach of our information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives.

            "content": "For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals. Zacks Premium provides lots of different ways to do both.\n\nThe popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens.\n\nIt also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nThe Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nBased on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nValue Score\n\nFinding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nWhile good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum traders and investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.\n\nVGM Score\n\nWhat if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nA proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio.\n\nIt's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nWith more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nYou want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.\n\nSince the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.\n\nA stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: Amgen (AMGN)\n\nThousand Oaks, CA-based Amgen is one of the biggest biotech companies in the world, with a strong presence in the oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, neuroscience, inflammation, bone health and nephrology and neuroscience markets. The company used advances in cellular and molecular biology to develop two of the biotech industry\u2019s earliest and most successful drugs, Epogen (anemia) and Neupogen (white blood cell stimulant). Amgen successfully launched two next-generation products, Aranesp and Neulasta. Meanwhile, the acquisition of Immunex Corporation gave Amgen access to the multi-blockbuster drug, Enbrel. However, all these older drugs are facing declining sales due to biosimilar or branded competition, which is being somewhat offset by its blockbuster growth drugs like Prolia and Xgeva. Other products are Repatha, Blincyto, Vectibix, Nplate, Kyprolis, Evenity, Otezla, Aimovig, Lumakras/Lumykras, Tezspire, Imdelltra, Tavneos and Kanjinti, Mvasi and Amgevita biosimilars.\n\nAMGN is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.\n\nIt also boasts a Value Style Score of B thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 13.66; value investors should take notice.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, two analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.05 to $19.56 per share. AMGN boasts an average earnings surprise of 4.1%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, AMGN should be on investors' short list.\n\n7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days\n\nJust released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys. They deem these tickers \"Most Likely for Early Price Pops.\"\n\nSince 1988, the full list has beaten the market more than 2X over with an average gain of +24.3% per year.

            "content": "Today, a brief rundown of news involving BioAge Labs and Roche, as well as updates from Akero Therapeutics, Allakos and Vanda Pharmaceuticals that you may have missed.\n\nBioAge Labs said Tuesday it has stopped developing azelaprag, the obesity drug at the center of its $198 million initial public offering last year. BioAge licensed azelaprag from Amgen and positioned it as a way to preserve muscle mass in people taking weight loss drugs like Zepbound and Wegovy. But safety concerns led the company to stop Phase 2 testing in December and shift strategy. BioAge is now working on newer, \u201cstructurally distinct\u201d drugs aimed at azelaprag\u2019s target and plans to nominate one for development next year. It also expects to start human testing this year of a drug designed to treat diseases associated with neuroinflammation. \u2014 Gwendolyn Wu\n\nAkero Therapeutics and 89bio raised a combined $600 million in two stock offerings following study results from Akero that lifted shares of both companies. Akero on Monday showed that its drug reversed liver damage in a Phase 2 trial of people with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, or MASH. While Akero's shares doubled, 89bio \u2014 which is developing a similar type of drug \u2014 also saw its stock price climb nearly 40%. They priced equity offerings the next day, with Akero raising $350 million and 89bio securing $250 million. \u2014 Ben Fidler\n\nRoche said Tuesday that its breast cancer drug Itovebi, when used alongside hormone therapy and Pfizer's Ibrance, extended survival compared to the latter two drugs alone in a Phase 3 trial. Itovebi was approved in October to treat people whose HR-positive, HER2-negative breast tumors have a mutation called PIK3CA. That approval, though, was based on the drug\u2019s ability to delay disease progression \u2014 a survival benefit wasn\u2019t yet clear. According to Roche, updated study results have revealed a \u201cstatistically significant and clinically meaningful\u201d impact on overall survival. It didn\u2019t reveal details. They\u2019ll be presented at a future medical meeting. \u2014 Delilah Alvarado\n\nAllakos will lay off three-quarters of its workforce after its top experimental drug, called AK006, failed to show \u201ctherapeutic activity\u201d in early testing for chronic form of hives, or urticaria, the company said Monday. It\u2019s the second reset for Allakos in two years, as disappointing results for an earlier urticaria medicine led to a 50% workforce reduction last January. The company said it will retain about 15 employees to explore \u201cstrategic alternatives,\u201d a process that typically leads to a sale or merger.\u2014 Ben Fidler\n\nVanda Pharmaceuticals is advancing plans to challenge the Food and Drug Administration's decision last year to reject its experimental drug for gastroparesis. Vanda previously claimed the FDA \"disregarded the evidence\" from two placebo-controlled trials and asked for new studies that were \"inconsistent with the advice\" of experts in the field. On Monday, it said it has accepted the agency's offer of an opportunity for a hearing, which it claims must take place within 120 days by law. \"Vanda hopes that, in break from prior practice, the FDA will adhere to this statutorily mandated time frame,\" the company said. \u2014 Ben Fidler",

            "content": "Amgen (AMGN) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 4. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis world's largest biotech drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.4%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $8.84 billion, up 7.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.17% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory Continues",

As a result, the trial is now set to proceed with combination dosing using the CD19-targeting drug blinatumomab (Blincyto Registered , marketed by Amgen) for patients with solid tumors.The United States holds the largest share of the Oncolytic Virus market, representing over 70% of the total market, in contrast to regions like the EU4 (Germany, Spain, Italy, France), the United Kingdom, and Japan. Compared to other tumor immunotherapies, oncolytic viruses offer several advantages, including high efficiency in killing cancer cells, precise targeting, and fewer side effects or drug resistance.Currently, only two oncolytic virus therapies have been approved: IMLYGIC (Talimogene laherparepvec/T-VEC; Amgen), which was approved in the US, Europe, and Japan in 2015, and DELYTACT (teserpaturev/G47; Daiichi Sankyo), which was approved in Japan in 2021. The oncolytic virus pipeline remains strong, with major pharmaceutical companies such as Replimune, Genelux, Imugene, and EpicentRx conducting active research to expand cancer treatment options.Among all emerging therapies, RP1 stands out as the most promising, expected to capture around 40% of the market over the next decade due to its high efficacy. In November 2023, Genelux announced that the US FDA granted Fast Track designation (FTD) for its Olvi-Vec (olvimulogene nanivacirepvec) development program for treating patients with platinum-resistant or refractory ovarian cancer.As per DelveInsight analysis, the Oncolytic Viruses market is anticipated to witness growth at a considerable CAGRStrategise your business goals by understanding market dynamics @ Oncolytic Viruses Market Landscape [Oncolytic Viruses OverviewOncolytic viruses are a type of anti-cancer therapy that help reduce tumors by replicating preferentially within tumor cells, inducing immunogenic cell death, and activating the body's immune response against the tumor. These viruses, whether native or engineered, are used to target and destroy cancer cells.Though not fully understood, oncolytic viruses eliminate tumor cells through two primary mechanisms: direct destruction of infected cells (oncolysis) and indirectly enhancing the host's immune response to fight the tumor.Oncolytic viruses can be either RNA or DNA viruses. RNA viruses, such as reoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and picornaviruses, typically encode a small number of genes and replicate quickly, leading to rapid tumor cell destruction. In contrast, DNA oncolytic viruses like herpes viruses, adenoviruses, or poxviruses can accommodate multiple foreign genes but replicate and amplify more slowly.Do you know the treatment paradigms for different countries?

Oncolytic viruses, which have the unique ability to selectively infect and replicate within tumor cells, have emerged as a promising approach in cancer treatment. Factors such as increased research and development, growing investments from pharmaceutical companies, and an expanding pipeline of clinical trials are driving market growth.With continued advancements and strategic partnerships, oncolytic viruses are set to play a significant role in the future of oncology, offering patients new hope and supporting the development of more effective and personalized cancer therapies.In 2015, IMLYGIC (talimogene laherparepvec/T-Vec; Amgen) became the first oncolytic virus approved by the US FDA and later by the European Commission (EC) for treating unresectable melanoma lesions. This therapy utilizes a genetically modified Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) to replicate inside tumors and activate the immune system.In 2021, DELYTACT (teserpaturev/G47; Daiichi Sankyo) received conditional approval in Japan as the first oncolytic virus for malignant glioma. Its triple mutation within the viral genome enhances tumor cell replication and stimulates a stronger immune response.Despite these achievements, ongoing development of oncolytic virus therapies continues through clinical trials by major players such as Replimune, DNAtrix, and SillaJen, pointing to a promising future for oncolytic virotherapy in treating various cancers worldwide.Oncolytic Viruses Marketed DrugsIMLYGIC (T-VEC): AmgenDELYTACT (G47): Daiichio SankyoOncolytic Viruses Emerging DrugsOlvi-Vec: GeneluxRP1: ReplimuneOncolytic Viruses Key CompaniesTargovax, Replimune, Genelux Corporation, Candel Therapeutics, DNAtrix, SillaJen, Treovir, Lokon Pharma AB, Istari Oncology, CG Oncology, Amgen, Daiichio Sankyo, and othersFor more information, visit Oncolytic Viruses Market Analysis, Patient Pool, and Emerging Therapies [Scope of the Oncolytic Viruses Market Report:11 Years Forecast7MM CoverageDescriptive overview of Oncolytic Viruses, causes, signs and symptoms, diagnosis, treatmentComprehensive insight into Oncolytic Viruses epidemiology in the 7MMOncolytic Viruses marketed and emerging therapiesOncolytic Viruses companiesOncolytic Viruses market drivers and barriersTable of Contents:1 Oncolytic Viruses Market Key Comprehensive Insights2 Oncolytic Viruses Market Report Introduction3 Competitive Intelligence Analysis for Oncolytic Viruses4 Oncolytic Viruses Market Analysis Overview at a Glance5 Executive Summary of Oncolytic Viruses6 Oncolytic Viruses Epidemiology and Market Methodology7 Oncolytic Viruses Epidemiology and Patient Population8 Oncolytic Viruses Patient Journey9 Oncolytic Viruses Treatment Algorithm, Oncolytic Viruses Current Treatment, and Medical Practices10 Key Endpoints in Oncolytic Viruses Clinical Trials11 Oncolytic Viruses Marketed Therapies12 Oncolytic Viruses Emerging Therapies13 Oncolytic Viruses: 7 Major Market Analysis14 Attribute analysis15 Access and Reimbursement Overview of Oncolytic Viruses16 Oncolytic Viruses Market Key Opinion Leaders Reviews18 Oncolytic Viruses Market Drivers19 Oncolytic Viruses Market Barriers20 SWOT Analysis21 Disclaimer22 DelveInsight Capabilities23 About DelveInsightRelated Reports:Oncolytic Viruses Epidemiology 2034DelveInsight's \"Oncolytic Viruses - Epidemiology Forecast to 2034\" report delivers an in-depth understanding of the disease, historical and forecasted Oncolytic Viruses epidemiology in the 7MM, i.e., the United States, EU5 (Germany, Spain, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom), and Japan.Oncolytic Viruses Pipeline 2024\"Oncolytic Viruses Pipeline Insights, 2024\" report by DelveInsight outlines comprehensive insights of present clinical development scenarios and growth prospects across the Oncolytic Viruses market.

            "content": "The soaring demand for antidiabetic and weight-loss drugs has lured in many biotech and big Pharma companies. Onto this crowded field comes a new player from the Bay Area that has emerged from stealth with $65 million in series A financing.\n\nHelicore Biopharma, founded in 2024, secured funds from the investors Versant Ventures, OrbiMed, Longitude Capital, and Wellington Management to clinically test its lead drug candidate, an injectable for weight loss and related conditions. The company anticipates data from its first-in-human studies in the second half of 2025.\n\nHelicore\u2019s lead candidate is in some ways different from the popular weight-loss and antidiabetes medications\u2014peptide-based drugs that work primarily by mimicking the gut hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)\u2014now on the market. The main ingredients in these drugs target GLP-1 receptors, thereby regulating blood sugar and appetite.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock\n\nIn contrast, Helicore\u2019s lead candidate, HCR-188, is a monoclonal antibody that works as an antagonist to the glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), another gut hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. HCR-199 binds to the GIP hormone in a person\u2019s bloodstream, preventing the hormone\u2019s transit into the brain and leading to increased satiety, reduced food consumption, and lower body mass, says Heliocore CEO Gerrit Klaerner.\n\nKlaerner has cofounded other biotechnology companies, including Tricida, a start-up whose kidney drug was denied US Food and Drug Administration approval in 2022; the company filed for bankruptcy the following year.\n\nKlaerner\u2019s other companies enjoyed better success. Relypsa, a company he cofounded in 2007, received FDA approval for the kidney disease drug Veltassa in 2015. Vifor Pharma acquired Relypsa for $1.5 billion the following year. Ilypsa, also focused on kidney disease, was acquired by Amgen in 2007 for $420 million.\n\nKlaerner says several medical conditions that his previous firms concentrated on were downstream of weight-related conditions, so he was excited by the opportunity to lead Helicore.\n\nHe explains that one reason for developing an antibody at Helicore was that these proteins stay longer in the blood than other modalities, such as peptides and small molecules.\u201cThis means that we can create a drug that patients don\u2019t have to inject every week,\u201d he says.\n\nHelicore\u2019s two other developmental molecules are conjugates of a GLP-1 agonist peptide and a GIP antagonist antibody. \u201cFor these drugs, our question was that instead of going after one, how about we go after both the hormones?\u201d Klaerner says. He points out that current weight-loss drugs need to be injected weekly. If successful, the conjugate drugs could reduce that to four injections per year, he says.\n\nMariTide, a monoclonal antibody that Amgen is developing as a weight-loss drug, takes a similar dual approach. It works by activating receptors of the GLP-1 hormone while blocking receptors of the GIP hormone. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s weight-loss drug Zepbound activates both receptors.\n\nBut Klaerner says a few pivotal differences set the Amgen and Helicore molecules apart. Notably, while Amgen\u2019s molecule targets one of the receptors on the GIP hormone, Helicore\u2019s candidates aim to mop up the GIP hormone from circulation, completely shutting down its further signaling in the brain.",

In December, the Thousand Oaks, California-based company announced it would add another $1 billion investment to build a second plant at the 118-acre site. The state is providing more than $18 million in incentives for the two projects.\n\nThe two drug substance facilities will be similar in size and combined total more than 500,000 square feet. The new positions will pay on average more than $91,500 a year. Amgen has already hired about 250 employees for the first plant with about 75% of those workers coming from North Carolina, Lewus says.\n\nComing back to North Carolina for a second investment was made easier by the state\u2019s \u201clife sciences ecosystem,\u201d says Lewus, including the NCBioTech and Wake Tech Community College.\n\nA recently started Amgen apprenticeship program at Wake Tech will include six months of classroom instruction and then a year of on-the-job training. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic way for us to build our workforce of tomorrow and for the apprentices, it\u2019s a wonderful opportunity to get introduced to biotechnology jobs,\u201d says Lewus.\n\nWhile Amgen looked at several locations for expansion, the Holly Springs site had advantages, he added. \u201cWe were already building one manufacturing facility there so you can leverage existing infrastructure when you already have the land purchased,\u201d says Lewus.\n\nThe plants will make general medicines, and medications for rare diseases, inflammation and patients with serious illnesses like heart disease and cancer.\n\nThe new plant will feature both traditional processes and next-generation technologies to increase efficiencies, says Lewus. It will have a smaller physical footprint and use 50% less water than a traditional plant, supporting Amgen\u2019s sustainability goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2027.\n\nFounded in 1980, Amgen is one of the 30 companies that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and it has more than 27,000 employees worldwide. About 14,000 are in the U.S. The company reported $28.2 billion in revenue last year.\n\nThis is Amgen\u2019s first manufacturing facility in North Carolina, and the company wants to make a good first impression with peer companies, community colleges and four-year institutions, says Lewus. \u201cWe want to make sure Amgen has a very positive presence in the local community,\u201d he says.",

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Biological Drugs - Global Strategic Business Report\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe global market for Biological Drugs was estimated at US$345.3 Billion in 2023 and is projected to reach US$634.4 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.1% from 2023 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.\n\n\n\nBiological drugs have transformed the treatment of chronic conditions such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and diabetes by offering highly targeted, effective therapies. Biologics are also at the forefront of precision medicine, enabling treatments to be tailored to an individual's genetic makeup, which enhances therapeutic outcomes and reduces side effects.\n\nHow Is the R&D Pipeline Shaping the Future of Biological Drugs?\n\n\n\nThe biological drugs market is witnessing significant innovation, particularly in monoclonal antibodies, gene therapies, and therapeutic proteins. New biologics are being developed to address unmet medical needs, especially in areas like oncology, neurology, and rare genetic disorders. Advances in biotechnology, including CRISPR and CAR-T therapies, are allowing for the development of personalized biologics that can modify disease pathways or even repair defective genes. The growing number of biologics in the development pipeline, coupled with advances in manufacturing techniques like continuous bioprocessing, is making it easier to produce biologics at scale, which will be key to meeting global healthcare needs in the future.\n\n\n\nHow Is the Adoption of Biological Drugs Impacting Healthcare Systems?\n\n\n\nAs biologics become more prevalent in treating chronic and life-threatening diseases, they are reshaping healthcare delivery systems. However, their high cost has led to challenges in terms of affordability and accessibility, particularly in developing markets. To address this, biosimilars - essentially, cheaper, highly similar versions of biologic drugs - are gaining traction.\n\n\n\nThe introduction of biosimilars is expected to reduce the overall healthcare burden and make these life-saving treatments more accessible to a broader population. Regulatory frameworks are evolving to facilitate the approval and market entry of biosimilars, which could significantly influence pricing dynamics and competition in the biological drugs market.\n\n\n\nWhat Role Does Regulatory Approval Play in the Expansion of Biological Drugs?\n\n\n\nThe regulatory landscape for biological drugs is a critical factor in market growth. Stringent approval processes ensure that biologics meet the highest safety and efficacy standards, which can be a lengthy and expensive endeavor for drug manufacturers. However, as regulatory bodies such as the U.S. FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) streamline pathways for both biologics and biosimilars, the pace of approvals has increased, particularly for drugs targeting rare diseases and unmet medical needs. Favorable regulations and accelerated approval processes for orphan drugs and breakthrough therapies are helping to bring innovative biologics to market more quickly, contributing to the overall expansion of this sector.\n\n\n\nThe growth in the biological drugs market is driven by several factors, including the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, the rise of precision medicine, and advancements in biotechnological research. The growing demand for personalized therapies that offer more effective treatment with fewer side effects is a major driver.\n\nAdditionally, the approval of novel biologics for rare and complex conditions, along with favorable government policies supporting biologics R&D, is boosting market expansion. The rise of biosimilars is also playing a critical role, as they are poised to increase market accessibility and reduce treatment costs, thereby further driving growth in the biologics segment.\n\nReport Features:\n\nComprehensive Market Data: Independent analysis of annual sales and market forecasts in US$ Million from 2023 to 2030.\n\nIn-Depth Regional Analysis: Detailed insights into key markets, including the U.S., China, Japan, Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Middle East, and Africa.\n\nCompany Profiles: Coverage of major players in the Global Biological Drugs Market such as Abbott Laboratories, Amgen, Inc., Baxter International, Inc., Biogen, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and more.\n\nComplimentary Updates: Receive free report updates for one year to keep you informed of the latest market developments.\n\nKey Insights:\n\nMarket Growth: Understand the significant growth trajectory of the Therapeutic Protein segment, which is expected to reach US$289.1 Billion by 2030 with a CAGR of a 10.3%.

            "content": "MORGANTOWN \u2013 The WVU Cancer Institute is the first provider in the state to offer a new and promising treatment for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.\n\nExtensive stage means the cancer has spread within the lung, to the other lung, or into the body, to summarize various medical sources.\n\nIt\u2019s not curable, said Dr. Mohammed Almubarak, section chief of solid tumors in the Department of Medical Oncology.\n\nThe new drug is Imdelltra, made by Amgen, a biotechnology medicine developer.\n\n\u201cIt has shown very good results and is fairly durable for many people,\u201d Almubarak said. \u201cIt gives them more time with such an aggressive disease.\u201d\n\nSmall-cell lung cancer is the deadliest form, he said. Imdelltra is FDA approved as a treatment when the cancer has metastasized and the patient has progressed beyond first-line treatment \u2013 chemotherapy and immunotherapy \u2013 and is offered as a second- or third-line therapy.\n\nThe FDA approved it mid-2024, he said, and the Cancer Institute participated in the clinical trials preceding approval. \u201cSo we had experience with it even before it got approved by the FDA.\u201d\n\nImdelltra is a form of BiTE (bispecific T-cell engager) therapy, he said. It connects to a marker on the cancer cells and a marker on the T-lymphocytes (immune cells). The connection between the cancer and immune cells results in a response that kills the cancer cells.\n\nIt\u2019s administered as an infusion, in the Cancer Institute\u2019s infusion center, with \u201cstep-up dosing.\u201d\n\nThat means it starts with a small initial dose. If the patient does OK, they come back the next week for a higher dose. And if they do OK with that, they move to the regular bi-weekly dose.\n\nThe reason for the step-up is the risk for serious complications, Almubarak said. They try to make sure the patient lives close \u2013 within an hour \u2013 or can stay close for the first two treatments. The patient needs a caretaker.\n\nThe patient requires close monitoring, should complications arise, so they can get immediate treatment for the complications.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those situations where there\u2019s definitely high reward, but there\u2019s also high risk involved with it,\u201d he said.\n\nAmgen reports that in a study of 99 adult patients who had two or more prior treatments, 40% responded to Imdelltra, meaning their tumor shrank or disappeared. Two saw their tumor completely disappear, and 38 patients saw their tumor partially shrink by at least 30%.\n\nAlmubarak said the drug can be administered until it stops working, or if toxicity or side effects arise, or if the patient just wants to stop it.\n\nIt\u2019s early in the experience with Imdelltra, he said, but it appears about half the patients get an additional year of life out of it. From there, they may switch to another approved therapy. They have people still alive who participated in the trials.\n\nThey\u2019ve used it on three or four patients so far, and have some referrals, but they\u2019re being careful and selective as they go. \u201cIt\u2019s a process to get through this.\u201d\n\nBiTE therapy has been used for blood cancers for a few years, he said, so he and his colleagues are familiar with the type of treatment and its complications. But Imdelltra creates a whole different category of people who are eligible for this treatment.\n\nHe emphasized that there are risks, and the patient needs good support and close monitoring. The treatment isn\u2019t offered at any WVU Cancer Institute regional sites, only at the Cancer Institute\u2019s Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, because of the level of monitoring needed and available services if complications arise.\n\n\u201cFor such a tough cancer, a very aggressive cancer, this is a treatment that has shown promise.\u201d Up to this point, they haven\u2019t had a lot of success getting treatments for it. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting that we have something like this now. \u2026 We have one more thing we can offer to the patients.\u201d",

He was in for a while and he was training; he is just taking a bit of time for himself. That is it.'\n\nSpeaking to EVOKE at last year's Amgen Irish Open in County Down Rian told us that while the excitement and joy of the All-Ireland still lingers it was time to concentrate on himself, some 'me time' as he called it.\n\nLiam Silke of Galway tackles Rian O'Neill of Armagh GAA Football All-Ireland Senior Championship Final Armagh and Galway at Croke Park.

The Orchard player suffered a second blow only recently when Armagh footballer and close friend Caolan Finnegan died from an aggressive cancer at just 20 years of age.\n\nLooking back he said 'I suppose one of the big things we were all able to do was get back out and train and back up to the field and we could talk to each other up there. And for that hour and a half or two hours, you can forget about things and have your mind clear before it is back to reality.'\n\nRian had been dating another sports star camogie player M\u00e9abh McAleavey for at least four years but without going into detail has revealed he is now single, enjoying life and concentrating on the game.\n\nRian O\u2019Neill of Armagh and M\u00e9abh McAleavey on their arrival at the PwC All-Stars Awards 2022 at the Convention Centre in Dublin. Pic: Brendan Moran/Sportsfile\n\nHe said 'It's just me time now. It's a very hectic schedule and you don't really have time for much else.'

Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nI don't think you can blame these companies' woes on a specific, overarching factor like high interest rates or macroeconomic volatility. Boeing has had many problems, starting with the more general pandemic-related issues like low demand and inflation, and there were major safety concerns last year. It culminated in a new CEO, and investors are waiting to see what's in store this year.\n\nNike has let competitors cut into its market share and has seen its sales decline. It also just got a new CEO, and the market is waiting for another update. Amgen, Merck, and Johnson & Johnson are all healthcare stocks and often move based on news about drug performance and new products.\n\nThe bright side of the equation for all of these companies is that excepting Boeing, they all pay dividends, and Johnson & Johnson is a dividend king. Dividend stocks aren't growth stocks, and investors buy them for reliable passive income. At the current prices, the dividend yields are quite high.\n\nAs industry leaders, they can add value to your portfolio through passive income, and if you have confidence in a rebound, you can scoop them up at a great price.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Both Clark and \u00c5berg, now teammates at Bay GC, return this year, joining a stacked field that includes Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott, and Justin Thomas. But some big names have yet to make their appearance, and the question remains: which top players are still to join the action?\n\n5. Min Woo Lee\n\nMin Woo Lee is among the young rising stars of the golf world. He turned professional in 2019, and in just five years, he has already managed to bag four international wins. He has already played forty-nine events on the PGA Tour but is yet to clinch a trophy. The Australian professional came close to winning twice, finishing in the runner-up position.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nvia Imago BMW Australian PGA, Golf Herren Championship Min Woo Lee AUS during the final round of the BMW Australian PGA Championship, Royal Queensland GC., Brisbane, Australia. 23/11/2024 Picture: Jason O Brien Golffile All photo usage must carry mandatory copyright credit Golffile Jason O Brien Copyright: xJasonxO Brienx *EDI*\n\nNonetheless, he had already managed to win a whopping $5,782,162 and ranked 53 on the OWGR list. But he is yet to begin his 2025 season, and the upcoming weekend will be his opening. Last year, the Australian professional skipped the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, and this year, he will begin the season with it.\n\n4. Tommy Fleetwood\n\nTommy Fleetwood is among the very few professionals who are exceptional at their game, but not so great when it comes to luck. The Englishman is so good that he ranks eleventh on the OWGR list, but even though it has been a decade and a half since he turned pro, he has yet to grab a win on the Tour. However, he has eight international wins under his belt, making him stand among the greatest players.\n\nHe will be a part of AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, and this will be his first 2025 event on the PGA Tour. Who knows, this year might turn out to be his year of luck.\n\n3. Jordan Spieth\n\nJordan Spieth started playing on the PGA Tour in early 2013, after turning pro in 2012. Since then, he has had a rather illustrious career. In this span, he has already managed to grab thirteen wins, which includes three Majors under his name, the 2015 Masters Tournament, the 2015 U.S. Open, and the 2017 British Open. He has appeared in 281 events so far and has bagged a whopping $62,741,970 so far.\n\nHowever, he has not been very lucky in the last two years when it comes to the signature event. He finished at T63 in 2023, and a T39 last year. However, in 2022, he came very close to winning the title but lost to Tom Hoge by just two strokes.\n\n2. Rory McIlroy\n\nThis will mark Rory McIlroy\u2019s third appearance at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. He missed the cut in 2018 and tied for 66th in 2024.

            "content": "Amgen opened its newest cutting-edge drug substance facility in Holly Springs, North Carolina, with a ribbon cutting ceremony on January 24. The event took place less than two months after the biotech leader announced plans for an additional $1 billion expansion at the Amgen North Carolina site to meet growing demand for Amgen\u2019s innovative medicines. The day featured a groundbreaking ceremony for the new expansion with remarks from key Amgen leaders and government officials, including Amgen CEO Bob Bradway and NC Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger. Together, the two drug substance facilities will total more than 500,000 square feet.\n\nThe combined $1.5 billion investment is a testament to the importance of U.S.-based manufacturing\u2014to the life sciences hub of North Carolina\u2019s Research Triangle where this facility is based\u2014and to Amgen\u2019s work ensuring a safe and reliable supply of medicines to patients through a robust global manufacturing network.\n\n\"We thought long and hard about where to build this plant. We chose Holly Springs because the Research Triangle area offers unbeatable advantages, including a welcoming investment climate, a thriving innovation ecosystem, and a diverse and skilled workforce,\" said Amgen CEO Bob Bradway at the event. \"This plant will further strengthen our ability to provide an uninterrupted supply of our medicines for patients suffering from heart disease, cancer, and other serious illnesses.\"\n\nThe Amgen North Carolina facility features a unique approach to manufacturing capability, combining a traditional stainless steel-fed batch plant with a single-use technology plant. The result is a more flexible and efficient facility, with a smaller physical footprint and 50% less water usage than a traditional plant, supporting Amgen\u2019s sustainability goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2027.\n\nLocated in the heart of North Carolina\u2019s Research Triangle, the Holly Springs site at Camp Helix Innovation Park represents a significant investment in the region. The initial facility is expected to employ more than 350 full-time staff members, and the new expansion will bring the total to more than 700 jobs for the region by 2030, including manufacturing associates, engineers, quality professionals, maintenance professionals, and process development experts.\n\n\"What an incredible day to celebrate growth and innovation here in the state of North Carolina,\u201d said North Carolina Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day a company decides to expand its operations before the initial facility is fully operational. The work being done here in North Carolina will have an impact far beyond our state\u2014medicines manufactured here in Holly Springs will help patients worldwide.\"\n\nAround 70% percent of employees currently working at the site are North Carolina locals, and Amgen is working to foster local talent and support the community. Through a partnership with Wake Tech Community College, Amgen is launching an inaugural 18-month manufacturing apprenticeship program, designed to expand opportunities for people who are new to the field of biomanufacturing, or those seeking a career change, without the requirement for a formal bachelor's degree.\n\nAmgen\u2019s decision to invest heavily in North Carolina speaks to the state\u2019s status as a premier life-sciences destination. The region\u2019s unique combination of innovation and skilled workforce played a crucial role in Amgen\u2019s choice. The new facilities will leverage decades of operational expertise and technological advancements to ensure the reliable and efficient delivery of life-saving medicines to patients around the world.\n\n\u201cWe are here to celebrate both a ribbon cutting for our first investment in North Carolina and groundbreaking of our next investment,\u201d said Paul Lewus, vice president and site head of Amgen North Carolina, as he kicked off the event. \u201cThis is a rare double win: A double win for Amgen, for North Carolina, and most importantly for the patients we serve.\u201d\n\nFollow Amgen on LinkedIn, Instagram and X for additional highlights.",

(Nasdaq: JANX) (Janux), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a broad pipeline of novel immunotherapies by applying its proprietary technology to its Tumor Activated T Cell Engager (TRACTr) and Tumor Activated Immunomodulator (TRACIr) platforms, today announced the promotion of Dr. Zachariah McIver to Chief Medical Officer.\n\n\u201cThe appointment of Zach to CMO is an important milestone for Janux. Zach\u2019s expertise in T cell engagers has brought significant value to our organization and he has been essential in our efforts to optimize the clinical development of our PSMA-TRACTr and clinical pipeline,\u201d said David Campbell, Ph.D., President and CEO of Janux. \u201cWe are excited for Zach\u2019s continued contributions which we believe will have a tremendous impact on the patients we treat.\u201d\n\nAn accomplished physician-scientist with over 20 years of experience in clinical research, Dr. McIver joined Janux after serving as Amgen\u2019s Executive Medical Director for over 4 years, leading cross-functional teams in the design, implementation, and execution of clinical and correlative study strategies. During his time at Amgen, Dr. McIver led the efforts in maximizing the value of bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) assets across multiple hematologic and solid tumor malignancies.\n\nDr. McIver earned a B.S. in Physics and General Sciences from the University of Oregon , a Medical Doctorate (D.O.) from Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medicine and a Ph.D. in Molecular Medicine and Translational Sciences at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine. He completed his internal medicine residency at the Cleveland Clinic, and his clinical fellowship in hematology and oncology at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nJanux\u2019s TRACTr and TRACIr Pipeline\n\nJanux\u2019s first clinical candidate, JANX007, is a TRACTr that targets prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and is being investigated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in adult patients with mCRPC. Janux\u2019s second clinical candidate, JANX008, is a TRACTr that targets epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and is being studied in a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of multiple solid cancers including colorectal carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, small cell lung cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer. We are also generating a number of additional TRACTr and TRACIr programs for potential future development, some of which are at development candidate stage or later. We are currently assessing priorities in our preclinical pipeline.\n\nAbout Janux Therapeutics\n\nJanux is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing tumor-activated immunotherapies for cancer. Janux\u2019s proprietary technology enabled the development of two distinct bispecific platforms: TRACTr and TRACIr. The goal of both platforms is to provide cancer patients with safe and effective therapeutics that direct and guide their immune system to eradicate tumors while minimizing safety concerns. Janux is currently developing a broad pipeline of TRACTr and TRACIr therapeutics directed at several targets to treat solid tumors. Janux has two TRACTr therapeutic candidates in clinical trials, the first targeting PSMA is in development for prostate cancer, and the second targeting EGFR is being developed for colorectal carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, small cell lung cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer.

Established in 1980 by William Bowes from Cetus Corporation and Winston Salser from UCLA, Amgen is now one of the world's largest independent biotechnology companies, with over 24,000 employees worldwide. The company's primary focus is on molecular biology and biochemistry, intending to provide healthcare solutions based on recombinant DNA technology.\n\n\n\nNeulasta, one of Amgen's most prominent selling product lines, is used to prevent infections in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy. Enbrel is another famous selling product line for Amgen, used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. The company's other products have various applications in treating cancer, anemia, osteoporosis and other conditions.\n\n\n\nAmgen has a rich history of strong leadership, with the appointment of several successful CEOs since its inception. Robert A. Bradway is the current CEO and was brought to Amgen in May 2012 following his predecessor's retirement. Bradway has led the company to new heights with strategic acquisitions and partnerships.\n\n\n\nAmgen has made at least five major corporate acquisitions. In 2019, the company announced it would acquire Nuevolution AB and the Otezla drug program from Celgene and a 20.5% stake in the Beijing-based BeiGene for $2.7 billion. These acquisitions have strengthened Amgen's drug pipeline and provided new revenue streams for the company. In March 2021, Amgen announced its plans to acquire Five Prime Therapeutics and its lead research drug candidate, bemarituzumab, for $1.9 billion. It also agreed to acquire Rodeo Therapeutics for up to $720 million. These acquisitions are part of the company's ongoing efforts to expand its drug pipeline and bring new treatments to patients.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Amgen faced legal issues when it pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $150 million in criminal penalties and $612 million in damages to resolve 11 related whistleblower complaints. Amgen has also faced criticism for lobbying for a two-year extension on sales of drugs, including Sensipar, without government controls, which will cost taxpayers an estimated $500 million. However, the company remains committed to providing innovative and effective healthcare solutions for patients.\n\n\n\nAmgen's success can be attributed to its commitment to innovation, strategic acquisitions, strong partnerships and top-end leadership.

Mutations and loss of TREM2, a receptor on the surface of microglia whose expression is restricted to the brain, is associated with late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s. Vigil\u2019s molecule is a novel mechanism that acts as an agonist for TREM2.\n\nVigil\u2019s success comes on the heels of a high-profile TREM2 failure, when Alector\u2019s AbbVie-partnered antibody AL002 failed in a Phase II trial in November 2024, prompting layoffs.\n\n\u201cThe open question here is how much the Alector failure in AD might diminish strategic interest, but given that the first Abeta attempts were outright failures, it seems reasonable that a partner might be interested in a fundamentally different approach to modulating TREM2--via a small molecule vs AL002, which was a monoclonal antibody,\u201d Stifel analyst Paul Matteis wrote in a Thursday note.",

            "content": "Scientists at deCODE genetics/Amgen have constructed a complete map of how human DNA is mixed as it is passed down during reproduction. The map marks a major step in the understanding of genetic diversity and its impact on health and fertility. It continues 25 years of research at deCODE genetics into how new diversity is generated in the human genome, and its relationship to health and disease.\n\nThe new map, appearing today in the online edition of Nature, is the first to incorporate shorter-scale shuffling, (non crossover) of grandparental DNA, which is difficult to detect due to the high DNA sequence similarity. The map also identifies areas of DNA that are devoid of major reshuffling, likely to protect critical genetic functions or prevent chromosomal problems. This insight offers a clearer picture of why some pregnancies fail and how the genome balances diversity with stability.\n\nWhile this shuffling, known as recombination, is essential for genetic diversity, errors in the process can lead to serious reproductive issues. These failures can result in genetic errors that prevent pregnancies from continuing, helping to explain why infertility affects around one in ten couples worldwide. Understanding this process offers new hope for improving fertility treatments and diagnosing pregnancy complications.\n\nThe research also reveals key differences between men and women in how and where, the genome recombination occurs. Women have fewer non-crossover recombinatios, but their frequency increases with age, which may help explain why older maternal age is associated with higher risks of pregnancy complications and chromosomal disorders of the child. Men, however, do not show this age-related change, although recombination in both sexes can contribute to mutations passed to offspring.\n\nUnderstanding the recombination process is also important in understanding how humans evolved as a species and what shapes individual differences, including health outcomes. All human genetic diversity can be traced to recombination and de novo mutations, DNA sequence present in the child but not in the parents. The map shows that mutations are elevated near regions of DNA mixing and consequently that the two processes are highly correlated.",

Enbrel is another famous selling product line for Amgen, used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. The company's other products have various applications in treating cancer, anemia, osteoporosis and other conditions.\n\n\n\nAmgen has a rich history of strong leadership, with the appointment of several successful CEOs since its inception. Robert A. Bradway is the current CEO and was brought to Amgen in May 2012 following his predecessor's retirement. Bradway has led the company to new heights with strategic acquisitions and partnerships.\n\n\n\nAmgen has made at least five major corporate acquisitions. In 2019, the company announced it would acquire Nuevolution AB and the Otezla drug program from Celgene and a 20.5% stake in the Beijing-based BeiGene for $2.7 billion. These acquisitions have strengthened Amgen's drug pipeline and provided new revenue streams for the company. In March 2021, Amgen announced its plans to acquire Five Prime Therapeutics and its lead research drug candidate, bemarituzumab, for $1.9 billion. It also agreed to acquire Rodeo Therapeutics for up to $720 million. These acquisitions are part of the company's ongoing efforts to expand its drug pipeline and bring new treatments to patients.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Amgen faced legal issues when it pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $150 million in criminal penalties and $612 million in damages to resolve 11 related whistleblower complaints. Amgen has also faced criticism for lobbying for a two-year extension on sales of drugs, including Sensipar, without government controls, which will cost taxpayers an estimated $500 million. However, the company remains committed to providing innovative and effective healthcare solutions for patients.\n\n\n\nAmgen's success can be attributed to its commitment to innovation, strategic acquisitions, strong partnerships and top-end leadership. The company's impressive portfolio of products and its commitment to the community has solidified Amgen's position as a leader in biopharmaceuticals.",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson has agreed to acquire neuroscience specialist Intra-Cellular Therapies for almost $15 billion (\u00a312 billion). This could be a harbinger for more billion-dollar deals this year, say analysts, as big companies look to replace revenues from impending patent expiries on blockbuster drugs. The trend will be helped by expectations that the new US administration could adopt a lighter touch to regulating mergers and acquisitions (M&A).\n\nThe J&J deal would be the biggest biotech deal in over a year and will add treatments for disorders of the central nervous system. The most valuable is Caplyta (lumateperone) for depression, which J&J estimates will have peak annual sales above $5 billion.\n\n\u2018This is right in [J&J\u2019s] wheelhouse and investors have been urging it to do more in face of the patent cliff that it has in the next five years or so,\u2019 says Jared Holz, healthcare equity strategist at Mizuho. J&J will face biosimilar competition for its blockbuster autoimmune antibody Stelara (ustekinumab) in 2025, after patents expired late in 2023.\n\nMerck, Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis, AstraZeneca and Amgen are all facing significant patent losses over the next five years, according to analysis by healthcare investment bank Leerink. Blockbusters whose patents are expiring include Merck & Co\u2019s cancer antibody Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in Europe in 2028; Pfizer and Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s blood thinner Eliquis (apixaban) in 2027 to 2029; and Pfizer\u2019s Prevnar pneumococcal vaccine in 2026.\n\n\u2018M&A is all about helping to drive future growth,\u2019 says Jeff Haxer, management consultant at Bain & Company. Most of the cost is in clinical development, but once products are on the market, profit margins are high. Hence acquisitions can insulate larger companies from early-stage risks and provide new revenue sources.\n\n\u2018Neurology and neuropsychiatry continue to garner interest,\u2019 says Holz. There is a high unmet medical need and many treatments for mental health conditions are old, with significant side effects. J&J has had success with Spravato, an esketamine nasal spray for depression, which looks likely to surpass $1 billion in annual sales.\n\nBiogen-Eisai\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s antibody Leqembi (lecanemab) was approved in the US for Alzheimer\u2019s in 2023 and then Europe in late 2024. While Eli Lilly\u2019s Kisunla (donanemab) injections were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for Alzheimer\u2019s last July. That success has led competitors to revive and acquire promising projects in the area. \u2018Oncology and neurology are two areas where we have lots of patients and several debilitating diseases that have high unmet needs. It is just that the science is quite difficult,\u2019 says Haxer.\n\nBut there is always risk in drug development. AbbVie bought Cerevel last year for $8.7 billion, but recently downgraded the value of the deal by $3.5 billion after the failure of a drug candidate for schizophrenia.\n\nBroad appetite\n\nLeerink\u2019s analysis confirms that large pharma has a broad appetite for mergers and acquisitions, mostly in the small- to medium-size range, with oncology, immunology and neurology making up much of the deal activity from 2022 to 2024.\n\n\u2018The small-to-mid-size biotechs, so mid-stage companies, have been the sweet spot,\u2019 says Jeffrey Jonas, an analyst with investor firm Gabelli, with lots of deals in the $1\u20135 billion range. \u2018Although it can be hard to value them when they are a few years from market,\u2019 he adds. \u2018A lot of the later-stage stuff tends to go for $10\u201315 billion and that\u2019s been a little harder to swallow and to make the maths work.\u2019\n\nThere was some trigger-shyness in the last 12 months, mostly just waiting to see what would happen with the election\n\nLeerink\u2019s analysis suggests the companies with the least exposure to sales loss from patent expiries are Takeda, Gilead, Sanofi, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. But that won\u2019t necessarily stop those firms looking for deals.\n\nLilly, along with Novo Nordisk, is flush from sales of GLP-1 diabetes and obesity drugs. The consensus view is that they have established a strong lead in this segment, with over $20 billion invested in manufacturing and supply chains, says Holz. \u2018It is almost a nonstarter for anyone else to participate in the market on the injectable side. The production costs are high and if you have missed the initial wave, it\u2019s going to be hard to make money,\u2019 he adds.\n\nLilly has also agreed to buy Scorpion Therapeutics, a private biotech developing cancer treatments, for up to $2.5 billion. \u2018Lilly has been very active in oncology in particular,\u2019 says Jonas. \u2018It\u2019s also been pretty aggressive on radiopharmaceuticals.\u2019\n\nGSK has also agreed to buy IDRx, a biotech developing treatments for rare cancers, for $1 billion up front, with promises of a further $150 million in performance milestone payments. While Biogen took an opportunistic punt, offering to buy out its R&D partner Sage Therapeutics. Biogen and Sage signed a collaboration agreement in 2020 that saw Sage receive $875 million in cash and Biogen buy a $650 million stake in the biotech\u2019s equity. One of the drugs named in that agreement, Zurzuvae (zuranolone), has been approved in the US for postpartum depression, but \u2018the drug\u2019s potential market is much smaller than hoped,\u2019 says Jonas. The second candidate, intended to treat tremors and other neurological conditions, has struggled with disappointing clinical results, depressing Sage\u2019s share price, which Biogen seems to be looking to take advantage of.\n\nSage has reportedly filed a lawsuit to block Biogen\u2019s unsolicited takeover offer, and Jonas believes it will likely hold out for a better price, but has limited options.\n\nLess scrutiny\n\nNot everyone thinks J&J\u2019s plan to acquire Intra-Cellular will sail through regulatory scrutiny. \u2018I am a little worried about the [competition] review, because J&J is already strong in mental health conditions,\u2019 says Jonas. He believes it may take time to assuage regulators, but that the incoming Trump administration could take a lighter touch.\n\n\u2018The outgoing chairwoman of the FTC [Federal Trade Commission], Lina Khan, was very strict, especially with healthcare deals,\u2019 says Jonas. \u2018Everyone is pretty excited that the new administration is going to be more permissive.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s a view shared by Haxer. \u2018There was some trigger-shyness in the last 12 months, especially in 2024, mostly just waiting to see what would happen with the election,\u2019 he says, adding that deals over $10 billion were most impacted by FTC scrutiny in the US. The FTC was seen to take a tough approach to deals between Amgen and Horizon and Novo Holdings and Catalent, for example, although both eventually went through. \u2018The regulatory environment depressed some of the mega-deals and fundamentally I think we are going to see more large deals happen,\u2019 says Haxer.",

            "content": "Charlotte Weekes and Stefan van Kolfschooten of Pinsent Masons were commenting after the Brussels Enterprises Court confirmed that Samsung Bioepis had met legal requirements for relying on the SPC manufacturing waiver to manufacture its denosumab \u2018biosimilar\u2019, with a view to exporting it from the EU, dismissing claims brought by Amgen. The Brussels court is the first across the EU to issue a judgment on the merits of a dispute relating to the SPC manufacturing waiver.\n\nSPCs are available to obtain in the EU and UK. They enable pharmaceutical patent holders to effectively extend the period for which they can exercise monopoly rights over the sale of medicinal products they have invested time and money into developing. SPCs are only available for \u2018products\u2019 that fall within the scope of SPC law and meet eligibility criteria set out in the legislation.\n\nAmgen holds an SPC for denosumab, a medicinal product used to strengthen the bones of patients undergoing certain cancer treatments. That SPC is due to expire later this year. In anticipation of that, Samsung Bioepis is exploring the development of its own rival biosimilar to denosumab \u2013 biosimilars are medicines that are highly similar, but not identical, to originator biologic products on which they are based. In March 2024, it wrote to the Belgian Intellectual Property Office (BIPO) to notify its intention to manufacture products containing denosumab in Belgium, and carry out related acts in the Netherlands, and to export them to third countries on the basis of an SPC manufacturing waiver. However, Amgen claimed that Samsung Bioepis could not rely on the SPC manufacturing waiver for its endeavours.\n\nSince 1 July 2019, SPC waivers have applied under EU law permitting manufacturing and related activities in the EU that would otherwise require consent of an SPC holder where they are undertaken for the purpose of exporting the goods to territories outside of the EU. The waiver also allows producers of generics or biosimilars to store new products in the EU ready for release on the EU market upon the expiry of an SPC during the last six months that the SPC is valid. Generic and biosimilar manufacturers must conform to a series of notification and labelling requirements to be eligible for the waiver.\n\nBefore the Brussels court, Amgen argued that the letter Samsung Bioepis sent to BIPO did not adhere to the notification requirements provided for in the EU SPC manufacturing waiver regulation, citing the fact it did not mention the reference number of the marketing authorisation in the countries to which Samsung Bioepis wants to export nor the names of the third countries for export. Amgen further claimed that, in the export countries likely to be targeted by Samsung Bioepis, its patent rights would apply, and it also argued that Samsung Bioepis\u2019 notification constituted an unfair trade practice.\n\nThe Brussels Enterprises Court dismissed Amgen\u2019s claims.\n\nThe court agreed with Samsung Bioepis\u2019 interpretation of notification requirements under Article 5 of the SPC manufacturing waiver regulation, by confirming that the notification does not need to include a marketing authorisation number or list of countries where the product will be exported.\n\nThe court further rejected Amgen\u2019s argument that countries receiving exported products must be patent-free to rely on the SPC manufacturing waiver in Europe. The court stated that such a requirement would be contrary to the regulation\u2019s objective of creating a level playing field between EU and non-EU manufacturers.\n\nThe court also rejected Amgen\u2019s argument that stockpiling under the SPC manufacturing waiver is only permitted if strictly necessary for immediate export. Instead, the court noted that the waiver allows stockpiling for a period that reflects the normal course of business.\n\nThe notification requirements under the SPC manufacturing waiver regulation had been considered by two other courts in Europe previously in the context of preliminary injunction proceedings \u2013 by the Munich Regional Court in Germany and the Hague District Court in the Netherlands, respectively. The Munich court had assessed that the reference number of the market authorisation needs to be included in the notification for the waiver eligibility criteria to be met, while the Hague court considered it was legitimate for the identity of the third countries to which products were to be exported to be omitted from notification on commercial sensitivity grounds.\n\nIn its ruling, the Brussels court said the Hague court\u2019s interpretation of the notification requirements took account of the context and the objectives of the regulation, as well as its genesis, finding the Munich court\u2019s interpretation to be too strict.\n\nThe Brussels court also dismissed Amgen\u2019s claim that Samsung Bioepis\u2019 notification constituted an unfair trade practice, as Amgen failed to prove there was a serious risk of infringement.\n\nWeekes said: \"The Belgian court's judgment offers guidance as to how a manufacturing waiver can and should be achieved, thereby enabling more medicines manufacturing in Europe. The court noted more than once that EU-based manufacturers should not be put at a disadvantage compared to competitors based outside of the EU which are not subject to manufacturing restrictions.\"\n\nVan Kolfschooten added: \"The clarifications on the interpretation of the SPC manufacturing waiver regulation provide much-needed legal certainty. Additionally, the court's flexible approach, aligning more closely with the Netherlands rather than Germany's stricter stance, is a notable development. This judgment not only solidifies the legal landscape but also paves the way for more consistent applications of the regulation across Europe.\"",

            "content": "The winners of Amgen's prestigious George B. Rathmann Award for Scientific Excellence are Simon Jackson and Chadwick (Chad) King. This award, which has only been given four other times in the company's history, is named after the legendary first CEO of Amgen. This year it recognizes the Research duo's groundbreaking work on the development of Repatha\u00ae (evolocumab), a treatment for adult patients battling high LDL (low-density lipoprotein), or \"bad\" cholesterol levels, and for adults with established cardiovascular disease at risk of cardiovascular events. Jackson and King's achievement is not only a personal triumph but also exemplifies their dedication to improving human health with a medicine that to date has been prescribed to 4.5 million patients worldwide.\n\nRepatha\u00ae is indicated: To reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events (CV death, myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina requiring hospitalization, or coronary revascularization) in adults with established cardiovascular disease. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Contraindication: Repatha\u00ae is contraindicated in patients with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to evolocumab or any of the excipients in Repatha\u00ae. Serious hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema have occurred in patients treated with Repatha\u00ae. Please see additional Important Safety Information at the end of this article.\n\nA path rooted in genetics\n\nFor Jackson, executive director in Research, and King, associate vice president in Research, their path to this award began with a scientific challenge rooted in human genetics.\n\nIn the early 2000s, researchers had discovered that mutations in a gene called PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) significantly impacted LDL cholesterol levels and, by extension, the risk of atherosclerosis\u2014a condition where arteries become clogged with fatty deposits, resulting in heart attacks, strokes and other serious cardiovascular events. These early findings set the stage for the biopharmaceutical industry to understand and target PCSK9 as a means of combating high cholesterol and cardiovascular risk. But the road was anything but straightforward.\n\nMost scientists in the field believed that PCSK9 controlled cholesterol by cutting up other proteins involved in regulating cholesterol levels. This belief led most drug developers in the industry to look for molecules that blocked this protein-cleaving function of PCSK9.\n\nJackson, however, took a different approach to understanding PCSK9's function. Through meticulous experiments, Jackson revealed that PCSK9's critical function was not in cleaving other proteins but in binding to LDL receptors on liver cells and marking them for destruction in cellular recycling centers called lysosomes. Without sufficient LDL receptors, the liver struggled to remove LDL from the bloodstream. This revelation was the key that unlocked new possibilities for treatment.\n\nKing joined the effort with his expertise in discovering antibody drugs and high-throughput screening, a method to rapidly test thousands of potential drug candidates. Working together, Jackson and King formed a powerful partnership. King's team developed assays\u2014laboratory tests\u2014to measure the interaction between PCSK9 and LDL receptors. Jackson and King's teams identified the \"sweet spot\" on PCSK9 where antibodies could potently block its harmful effects. Within six months, they scaled up their assays to screen thousands of antibodies and found candidates that potently blocked PCSK9's interaction with LDL receptors.\n\nAfter identifying promising antibodies, the teams optimized these molecules, tested them in animal models, and ultimately developed evolocumab. This therapy lowered LDL cholesterol levels by blocking and preventing PCSK9 from destroying LDL receptors, thus enhancing the body's ability to clear cholesterol from the blood.\n\nContinuing Rathmann's legacy\n\nGeorge Rathmann, a pioneer in the world of biotechnology, led Amgen as CEO from its inception in 1980. With a PhD in physical chemistry, Rathmann's career was marked by a relentless drive to bridge science and practical healthcare solutions. Under his leadership, Amgen evolved from a startup to a global biotechnology powerhouse. The George B. Rathmann Award, established in 2005, honors this legacy by celebrating Amgen employees whose work exemplifies innovation and dedication to improving human health. Jackson and King's work embodies the qualities celebrated by the Rathmann Award: bold scientific inquiry, relentless problem-solving and a deep commitment to patient care. By addressing a complex biological puzzle with creativity and collaboration, they have not only transformed lives but also added an important chapter to the legacy of George Rathmann and Amgen's mission to serve patients.\n\n\"Receiving this award is deeply humbling,\" said Jackson. \"It is a reminder of what we can achieve when science and innovation come together to serve patients.

Established in 1980 by William Bowes from Cetus Corporation and Winston Salser from UCLA, Amgen is now one of the world's largest independent biotechnology companies, with over 24,000 employees worldwide. The company's primary focus is on molecular biology and biochemistry, intending to provide healthcare solutions based on recombinant DNA technology.\n\n\n\nNeulasta, one of Amgen's most prominent selling product lines, is used to prevent infections in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy. Enbrel is another famous selling product line for Amgen, used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. The company's other products have various applications in treating cancer, anemia, osteoporosis and other conditions.\n\n\n\nAmgen has a rich history of strong leadership, with the appointment of several successful CEOs since its inception. Robert A. Bradway is the current CEO and was brought to Amgen in May 2012 following his predecessor's retirement. Bradway has led the company to new heights with strategic acquisitions and partnerships.\n\n\n\nAmgen has made at least five major corporate acquisitions. In 2019, the company announced it would acquire Nuevolution AB and the Otezla drug program from Celgene and a 20.5% stake in the Beijing-based BeiGene for $2.7 billion. These acquisitions have strengthened Amgen's drug pipeline and provided new revenue streams for the company. In March 2021, Amgen announced its plans to acquire Five Prime Therapeutics and its lead research drug candidate, bemarituzumab, for $1.9 billion. It also agreed to acquire Rodeo Therapeutics for up to $720 million. These acquisitions are part of the company's ongoing efforts to expand its drug pipeline and bring new treatments to patients.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Amgen faced legal issues when it pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $150 million in criminal penalties and $612 million in damages to resolve 11 related whistleblower complaints. Amgen has also faced criticism for lobbying for a two-year extension on sales of drugs, including Sensipar, without government controls, which will cost taxpayers an estimated $500 million. However, the company remains committed to providing innovative and effective healthcare solutions for patients.\n\n\n\nAmgen's success can be attributed to its commitment to innovation, strategic acquisitions, strong partnerships and top-end leadership. The company's impressive portfolio of products and its commitment to the community has solidified Amgen's position as a leader in biopharmaceuticals.",

            "content": "Two recent disappointing clinical trials of highly-anticipated weight-loss drugs have made it clear that it is too early to crown any winners in the race for the next generation of anti-obesity treatments.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s (NVO) CagriSema and Amgen\u2019s (AMGN) MariTide both fell short of an expected 25% average weight-loss target in late-stage trials late last year, leaving investors frustrated and sending their stock prices tumbling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese setbacks have left the door wide open for other pharmaceutical companies racing to develop more potent weight-loss drugs. But it\u2019s unclear how much better the next wave of treatments will be compared to those already on the market.\n\nThese medications, known commonly as GLP-1 or incretin drugs, have taken the world by storm \u2014 especially in the United States. Popularized by Ozempic, these treatments mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, making them highly sought after for their weight-loss effects. Popular brand names of these treatments currently on the market include Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy, which shares the same active ingredient with Ozempic, and Eli Lilly\u2019s (LLY) Zepbound.\n\nThe weight-loss drug boom has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into the world\u2019s most valuable pharmaceutical companies, with sales skyrocketing in recent years. Morgan Stanley (MS) projects the global market for these treatments could hit $105 billion by 2030. In the U.S. alone, nearly 10% of the population \u2014 31.5 million people \u2014 are expected to be using them by 2035.\n\nWith that much money at stake, it\u2019s no surprise that drugmakers are already grinding to develop the blockbuster weight-loss drugs of tomorrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaster weight loss with fewer injections and side effects\n\nSeveral pharma companies are developing weight-loss drugs promising faster results and, in some cases, less frequent injections \u2014 an improvement over weekly shots like Wegovy and Zepbound. To outperform the current options, these new treatments will need to deliver weight loss exceeding 20%, the average achieved with the highest dose of Zepbound.\n\nNovo Nordisk: The Danish pharma giant is developing a successor to its popular Ozempic medication. The company is betting that mimicking multiple hormones could deliver greater weight loss. CagriSema combines semaglutide \u2014 the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy \u2014 with cagrilintide, a dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist, hence the name CagriSema. However, in December, Novo Nordisk said patients in a phase 3 clinical trial of the drug only lost an average of 22.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks on the medication.\n\nEli Lilly: The American multinational is also developing a stronger weight-loss injection, retatrutide, which, in a small clinical trial, helped patients lose 17% of their weight in 24 weeks.\n\n\u201cRetatrutide is really exciting because the amount of weight loss you have seen there was even beyond tirzepatide (the active ingredient in Zepbound),\u201d president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health Patrik Jonsson told Quartz last year. He added this could help populations that need a greater level of weight loss.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmgen: The pharma giant said in November that its experimental weight-loss medication, MariTide, helped patients living with obesity or who are overweight lose an average of 20% of their weight in a 52-week trial. Amgen Chief Scientific Officer James E. Bradner previously told investors that MariTide is expected to be sold in a \u201cconvenient, handheld, patient-friendly auto-injector device with a monthly or even less frequent single-injection administration.\u201d\n\nViking Therapeutics (VKTX): This summer, Viking Therapeutics said it was advancing its experimental weight-loss drug, VK2735, to a late-stage clinical trial. An earlier, smaller trial found that VK2735 helped users achieve an average weight loss of 14% from baseline numbers, plus 13% compared with a placebo after 13 weeks of treatment.\n\nZealand Pharma: The Denmark-based drugmaker said that only about a third of patients who took up to 4.8-milligram doses of its drug petrelintide during an early-stage clinical trial experienced nausea \u2014 one of the most common side effects of popular GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. Zealand is pitching petrelinde as an alternative for patients who can\u2019t tolerate GLP-1 treatments, which can include common side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Zealand previously reported in June that patients taking a high dose of petrelintide over 16 weeks lost, on average, 8.6% of their weight.\n\nAn effective weight-loss pill\n\nPharma companies are also developing weight-loss pills that could potentially open the market for patients who are resistant to needles and are likely to be easier to manufacture helping meet growing demand and avoid shortages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovo Nordisk: Novo Nordisk said in September that patients who took a once-daily 50mg dose of its experimental pill amycretin lost an average of 10.4% of their weight in just three months. Trial participants who took two pills lost even more weight, 13.1% at three months. For comparison, a large clinical trial of Wegovy found that it helped users lose about 15% of their body weight over 68 weeks. It\u2019s important to note that larger phase 2, 3, and 4 trials involving thousands more participants could return different results.\n\nEli Lilly: Eli Lilly is also developing a weight-loss pill \u2014 orforglipron. The drug is currently in a phase 3 trial \u2014 its results will be published this year. Earlier trials found that it helped users lose an average of nearly 15% of weight after 36 weeks.\n\nPfizer (PFE): Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told analysts last fall that the company still expects its leading weight loss drug candidate, danuglipron, to be the second incretin weight-loss pill to enter the market. Pfizer announced in July it was advancing the development of danuglipron, a pill that mimics the gut hormone GLP-1. In December, the pharma giant said that a twice-daily version of the pill helped patients, in an early-stage trial, lose an average of 8% to 13% of their weight. However, the company decided not to advance this formulation to a late-stage trial due to a high rate of side effects.\n\nViking Therapeutics: In November, Viking Therapeutics reported that in a small phase 1 clinical study, patients who took a daily 100mg dose of Viking\u2019s weight-loss pill lost an average of up to 6.8% of their body weight over 28 days when adjusted for those taking a placebo. This result outperformed Novo Nordisk\u2019s amycretin.",

            "content": "Biogen acquired HI-Bio in 2024, and as HI-Bio became Biogen\u2019s West Coast Hub, Donna became the Head of Biomarker and Bioanalytical Sciences. \u201cGrowing up in a small town with limited resources to science, I initially didn\u2019t know much about the biotech or healthcare industry let alone potential career opportunities in this field,\u201d she explained. Now, Donna shares where her curiosity for science began and how it shaped her career.\n\nWhere it began.\n\nDonna grew up in a small-town in upstate New York. As a kid, she always had an interest in science, but her school had limited access to advanced science courses. In high school, Donna\u2019s teachers recognized her interest in science was much higher than other students and started to provide individual resources to help enrich her learning experiences. \u201cThey let me watch planaria through the microscope during lunch,\u201d Donna recalls, \u201cand pushed me to complete my high school chemistry and physics requirements early so I could take science classes at a local community college during school hours.\u201d\n\nDonna\u2019s educational pursuits didn\u2019t stop there.\n\nAfter high school, she continued her education at Rochester Institute of Technology and became the first in her family to attend a four-year university. Donna graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree, extensive teaching assistant experience, and a quest to become a professor. After forming her roots on the East Coast, she dug herself out of the snow and headed to Stanford to pursue her Ph.D. through an interdepartmental program applying cutting-edge research to problems in cellular, molecular, computational, translational, and clinical immunology.\n\nPairing her expertise in science and teaching.\n\nAt Stanford, Donna pursued antibody-driven immune disease research and eventually had the opportunity to collaborate with a Genentech researcher, joining his lab as an industry postdoc. She worked in a new immunology biomarker discovery and human genetics group\u2014and repositioned her initial research through the lens of human genetics and genomics. This opportunity helped her build a bench that landed her a teaching position at U.C. Berkeley Extension and connected her with a clinical development team working on a Phase 2 study in lupus.\n\nFrom postdoc to Amgen, motherhood and more.\n\nDonna\u2019s teaching experience shaped her career trajectory. Following her postdoc, she joined a newly formed research unit at Amgen that was focused on leveraging next generation sequencing technology. This was the perfect opportunity for her at the time. \u201cI was starting my family and looking for a job that provided the security of a full-time position, while also allowing me to continue teaching as an extracurricular,\u201d Donna explained.\n\nHer growth didn\u2019t stop there. She later transitioned into development as a clinical biomarker lead in immuno-oncology and was excited to work closer to patients. Donna found her professional sweet spot at the interface of science and medicine, translating complex biological hypotheses from research into actionable biomarker plans in clinical trials. She explains, \u201cThe patients waiting for these medicines motivate me to not only do the work, but to act with urgency. Many of us in this field have personal connections to the diseases that we study, and it is my hope that I can play a small part in bringing therapies forward that can help improve lives.\u201d\n\nFrom Amgen to the start-up world.\n\nOver her 11 years at Amgen, Donna was promoted multiple times, ultimately to Head of Oncology Clinical Biomarkers. In January 2022, she took the opportunity to move her career from a large corporation to a start-up still in stealth mode called HI-Bio, which had unique ideas to help patients with antibody-driven immune-mediated diseases. This was a challenge that she was excited for, yet initially nervous to take. Donna credits her HI-Bio experiences with helping her step outside her comfort zone, roll up her sleeves and dig in, and as she says, \u201cbuild a plane while flying it.\u201d\n\nBecoming Biogen\u2019s West Coast Hub and leading the Biomarker and Bioanalytical Sciences team.\n\nIn 2024, Biogen acquired HI-Bio, accelerating the company\u2019s expansion into other areas of immunology, including the addition of a late-stage therapeutic candidate to the pipeline, being investigated in multiple indications. The acquisition aligned with Biogen's mission to pioneer innovative science to potentially deliver new medicines that transform patients\u2019 lives.\n\nAs HI-Bio became Biogen\u2019s West Coast Hub, Donna became the Head of Biomarker and Bioanalytical Sciences, whose team helps to uncover clinical data in kidney transplant rejection and other potential indications.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a team of biology, technology, and data nerds!\u201d\n\nDonna\u2019s team plays a key role as the interface between research, development, and commercialization to identify, develop, and deploy biomarkers that enhance our understanding of disease biology, help accelerate all stages of drug development and enable precision medicine. Her team is responsible for strategic, technical, and operational aspects of biomarker and bioanalytical development in global clinical trials. They also leverage translational model systems and complex biological technologies and datasets to discover novel biomarkers and address hypotheses that emerge during clinical development. Donna explains, \u201cAs an immunologist, I am particularly excited about our work in transplant rejection. Our phase 2 study in patients with antibody mediated rejection in kidney transplant uncovered novel biological mechanisms and showed clinical proof of concept in patients with tremendous unmet medical need.\u201d\n\nDonna loves what she does and thinks others would love it at Biogen, too.\n\nBiogen is proud of its industry-leading expertise in biomarker research and is growing its biomarker and translational team and seeks adaptable, solutions-oriented scientists to apply their deep understanding of disease biology and biomarker measurement in the context of highly complex clinical trials. \u201cWhat I love about this role is the ability to be a part of a therapy\u2019s development from the beginning stages in research, through all phases of clinical development, and ultimately to health authority approvals and into patients\u2019 lives,\u201d Donna explained.\n\nFor those interested in this type of work, she explains her team looks for individuals who are collaborative, detail-oriented, and possess the ability to effectively communicate complex scientific data to different, often non-scientific, audiences.",

Anti-inflammatories are drugs that bring together a class of medication reducing inflammation in the body. Inflammation occurs once the body's defense systems react to injury or an infection. It often consists of redness, swelling, heat, and pain at any site. Although inflammation is necessary in some healing processes, chronic conditions brought about by inflammation will bring about health conditions such as arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and some types of cancers. Anti-inflammatory drugs work by inhibiting the production of substances that trigger inflammation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are a common type of anti-inflammatory medication, which encompasses over-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen, as well as prescription medications.The titled segments and sub-section of the market are illuminated below:By Treatment: Arthritis, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Multiple Sclerosis, Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Asthma, Tendonitis, Other Treatments, By Drug Class: Anti-Inflammatory Biologics, Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), Corticosteroids, Immune-selective anti-inflammatory derivative (ImSAID), Other Drug Classes, By Sales Channel: Prescription, Over the Counter (OTC)Market Drivers:Rising Incidences of Autoimmnue and Respiratory ConditionsGrowing Research for Safer New Anti-Inflammatory DrugsMarket Trends:Anti Inflammatory Drugs for Arthritis Treatment is Found Dominating the MarketRestrains:Side Effects of Anti-Inflammtory DrugsPatent ExpirationWhat can be explored with the Anti Inflammatory Drugs Industry Study?\u2022 Gain Market Understanding\u2022 Identify Growth Opportunities\u2022 Analyse and Measure the Global Anti Inflammatory Drugs Industry by Identifying Investment across various Industry Verticals\u2022 Understand the Trends that will drive Future Changes in Anti Inflammatory Drugs Industry\u2022 Understand the Competitive Scenarios- Track Right Markets- Identify the Right VerticalsRegion Included are: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Oceania, South America, Middle East & AfricaCountry Level Break-Up: United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, South Africa, Nigeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Germany, United Kingdom (UK), the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Austria, Turkey, Russia, France, Poland, Israel, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, India, Australia and New Zealand etc.Have Any Questions Regarding Global Anti Inflammatory Drugs Industry Report, Ask Our Experts@Strategic Points Covered in Table of Content of Global Anti Inflammatory Drugs Industry:Chapter 1: Introduction, market driving force product Objective of Study and Research Scope the Anti Inflammatory Drugs IndustryChapter 2: Exclusive Summary - the basic information of the Anti Inflammatory Drugs Industry.Chapter 3: Displaying the Market Dynamics- Drivers, Trends and Challenges & Opportunities of the Anti Inflammatory Drugs IndustryChapter 4: Presenting the Anti Inflammatory Drugs Industry Factor Analysis, Porters Five Forces, Supply/Value Chain, PESTEL analysis, Market Entropy, Patent/Trademark Analysis.Chapter 5: Displaying the by Type, End User and Region/Country 2019-2023Chapter 6: Evaluating the leading manufacturers of the Anti Inflammatory Drugs Industry which consists of its Competitive Landscape, Peer Group Analysis, BCG Matrix & Company ProfileChapter 7: To evaluate the market by segments, by countries and by Manufacturers/Company with revenue share and sales by key countries in these various regions (2024-2032)Chapter 8 & 9: Displaying the Appendix, Methodology and Data Sourcefinally, Anti Inflammatory Drugs Industry is a valuable source of guidance for individuals and companies.Get Up to 30% Discount on This Premium Report: @Thanks for reading this article; you can also get individual chapter wise section or region wise report version like North America, Middle East, Africa, Europe or LATAM, Southeast Asia.Contact US:Craig Francis (PR & Marketing Manager)Data Insights MarketUnit No. 429, Parsonage Road Edison, NJNew Jersey USA - 08837Phone: +12315155523sales@datainsightsmarket.comAbout Author:Data Insights Market is Global leaders of Market Research Industry provides the quantified B2B research to Fortune 500 companies on high growth emerging opportunities which will impact more than 80% of worldwide companies' revenues.Our Analyst is tracking high growth study with detailed statistical and in-depth analysis of market trends & dynamics that provide a complete overview of the industry.

            "content": "Despite the failure in recent years of celiac disease candidates such as 9 Meters\u2019 larazotide and Amgen\u2019s AMG 714, multiple companies are forging ahead with development of therapies for the autoimmune disease, with promising results.\n\nCeliac disease is a chronic autoimmune disorder that damages the small intestine and prevents the body from absorbing nutrients from food. Flare-ups arise in response to contact with gluten. This disease affects 3 million Americans, and the only recommended intervention is a gluten-free diet. As patients continue to be exposed to gluten chronically, even low levels of the protein can lead to further health complications such as lymphoma, bowel cancer, osteoporosis, anemia or malnutrition.\n\nSeveral companies are working on late-stage investigational treatments to treat celiac disease via a variety of therapeutic approaches. If ultimately approved, these treatments should change care for the disease profoundly by removing the burdensome need for total gluten avoidance.\n\nThe frontrunner, Entero Therapeutics, is researching latiglutenase, an enzyme that breaks down gluten in the stomach. Also known as IMGX003, latiglutenase is an orally administered mixture of two gluten-specific recombinant proteases that degrades gluten proteins into smaller pieces. Phase III celiac disease trials for latiglutenase are slated to start early this year.\n\nEntero published results in August 2022 from a placebo-controlled Phase II trial of latiglutenase. In the 6-week gluten challenge after randomization, the mean change in the ratio of villus height to crypt depth was used as the primary endpoint, and latiglutenase was proven superior to placebo in reducing gluten-associated small intestine mucosal damage.\n\nMeanwhile, Anokion is actively enrolling patients for its Phase II SynCeD trial of KAN-101, a synthetic gluten antigen delivered to the liver and immune cells with a liver-targeting glycosylation signature.\n\nIn the Phase I ACeD trial, patients were divided into two study parts. Part A was an open-label, single ascending dose study in which intravenous KAN-101 was administered using sentinel dosing. Meanwhile, Part B was a randomized, placebo-controlled multiple ascending dose study. While commonly observed adverse events as of June 2023 included nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain and vomiting, these effects were attributed to disease symptoms caused by gluten.\n\nIn May 2024, Anokion reported results from the Phase Ib/II ACeD-it trials, revealing that KAN-101 was safe and remained well-tolerated at higher dose levels up to 3 mg/kg. In addition, functional tolerance to gluten was observed.\n\nElsewhere, Sanofi is enrolling Phase II trials of amlitelimab, an OX40L subcutaneous monoclonal antibody. OX40L is a ligand found on some immune cells, and binding it limits their activity. In the trials, Sanofi will assess patients who are not responsive to celiac disease interventions and will differentiate between different variables by making use of experimental and placebo trial arms and by comparing consistently gluten-free diets to simulated inadvertent gluten exposure. Alternatively known as SAR445229 or KY1005, amlitelimab is also undergoing research for other indications such as atopic dermatitis, systemic sclerosis, alopecia areata, hidradenitis suppurativa and asthma.\n\nFinally, Takeda is developing three investigational agents to treat celiac disease. TAK-101 is a tolerizing immune-modifying nanoparticle intravenous injection and zamaglutenase (also known as TAK-062 or Kuma062) is an orally administered glutenase enzyme, making both agents biologics. TAK-227 (a.k.a. ZED-1227), an orally administered transglutaminase 2 inhibitor, is by contrast a small molecule. While Takeda is currently enrolling for Phase II TAK-101 trials, its Phase II zamaglutenase trials were completed as of November 2024. TAK-227\u2019s Phase I proof-of-concept data, released in 2021, showed that TAK-227 attenuated gluten-induced duodenal mucosal damage in patients with celiac disease.\n\nIn conclusion, several investigational treatments are vying to treat celiac disease. Despite earlier setbacks, patients should look forward to new treatments coming within the next 3\u20135 years at the earliest in this space.",

            "content": "Amgen Inc. is a multinational biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Thousand Oaks, California. Established in 1980 by William Bowes from Cetus Corporation and Winston Salser from UCLA, Amgen is now one of the world's largest independent biotechnology companies, with over 24,000 employees worldwide. The company's primary focus is on molecular biology and biochemistry, intending to provide healthcare solutions based on recombinant DNA technology.\n\n\n\nNeulasta, one of Amgen's most prominent selling product lines, is used to prevent infections in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy. Enbrel is another famous selling product line for Amgen, used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. The company's other products have various applications in treating cancer, anemia, osteoporosis and other conditions.\n\n\n\nAmgen has a rich history of strong leadership, with the appointment of several successful CEOs since its inception. Robert A. Bradway is the current CEO and was brought to Amgen in May 2012 following his predecessor's retirement. Bradway has led the company to new heights with strategic acquisitions and partnerships.\n\n\n\nAmgen has made at least five major corporate acquisitions. In 2019, the company announced it would acquire Nuevolution AB and the Otezla drug program from Celgene and a 20.5% stake in the Beijing-based BeiGene for $2.7 billion. These acquisitions have strengthened Amgen's drug pipeline and provided new revenue streams for the company. In March 2021, Amgen announced its plans to acquire Five Prime Therapeutics and its lead research drug candidate, bemarituzumab, for $1.9 billion. It also agreed to acquire Rodeo Therapeutics for up to $720 million. These acquisitions are part of the company's ongoing efforts to expand its drug pipeline and bring new treatments to patients.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Amgen faced legal issues when it pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $150 million in criminal penalties and $612 million in damages to resolve 11 related whistleblower complaints. Amgen has also faced criticism for lobbying for a two-year extension on sales of drugs, including Sensipar, without government controls, which will cost taxpayers an estimated $500 million. However, the company remains committed to providing innovative and effective healthcare solutions for patients.\n\n\n\nAmgen's success can be attributed to its commitment to innovation, strategic acquisitions, strong partnerships and top-end leadership. The company's impressive portfolio of products and its commitment to the community has solidified Amgen's position as a leader in biopharmaceuticals.",

Morgan Healthcare Conference (JPM 2025) in San Francisco, Calif., on Tuesday last week, Celltrion announced plans to launch a biosimilar of Prolia, offering a drastically lower price plan.\n\nAfter presenting the company's agenda, Celltrion Group Chairman Seo Jung-jin made the remark at a news conference. Seo was joined on stage by his eldest son, Seo Jin-seok, Celltrion\u2019s executive vice president and CEO of its management division.\n\nCelltrion Group Chairman Seo Jung-jin (right) and CelltrionExecutive Vice President and CEO Seo Jin-seok held a news conference on Tuesday at the 2025 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference\u201d in San Francisco, Calif., last week. (Courtesy of Celltrion)\n\nChairman Seo revealed that the company plans to launch five biosimilars\u2014Stelara, Xolair, Prolia, Eylea, and Actemra\u2014in the U.S., Europe, and Japan this year.\n\nSeo presented a new way to use Prolia. The company plans to reduce the cost of the twice-yearly biosimilar to the local price of eight hamburgers, allowing it to be used as a preventive medicine for osteoporosis.\n\n\u201cThe balance between bone-building and bone-destroying cells is important, and postmenopausal women, in particular, are at high risk of osteoporosis,\u201d Seo said. \u201cA drug, which has been used only for treatment, could be used for prevention. The company's strategy is to reduce the price drastically to make it more accessible without insurance coverage.\u201d\n\nSeo\u2019s remark stirred renewed attention to Amgen's strategy for dealing with biosimilars as the developer of Prolia, which made a presentation ahead of Celltrion on its conference agenda during the JPM2025 healthcare conference. Prolia's patent is set to expire in major countries this year. The expiration is set for February in the U.S., March in South Korea, and November in Europe.\n\nOn the first day of the conference, Amgen Chairman and CEO Robert Bradway said, \u201cMillions of patients worldwide remain at high risk for fracture and in need of a treatment, but penetration of therapies for high-risk patients remains low.\u201d\n\nBradway emphasized the synergy between Prolia and the company's osteoprogenitor Evenity (romosozumab) by using it as sequential therapy, which involves a year of Evenity followed by a switch to Prolia.\n\n\u201cEvenity is unique in the market. Patients use Evenity for one year and switch to Frolia to preserve their newly formed bone,\u201d Bradway said. \u201cWe believe this 'one-two punch' combination is here to stay in treating osteoporosis.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are the global leader in bone health today, and we will continue to lead in the future,\u201d Bradway said, stressing that he is confident that the company will continue to grow in this area well into the 2030s.\n\n\u201cWe have been anticipating competition for some time and have a good sense of what it will look like,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will focus on educating payers, prescribers, and patients about treatments to prevent fractures.\u201d",

The FDA also approved the therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit (QIAGEN GmbH) as a companion diagnostic device for identifying eligible patients.\n\nApproval of sotorasib with panitumumab was based on findings from the randomized, open-label, controlled CodeBreaK 300 trial showing improved overall response rates (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) with sotorasib and panitumumab vs investigator\u2019s choice of trifluridine/tipiracil or regorafenib, which are current standard-of-care options.\n\nMedian PFS was 5.6 months in 53 patients randomized to receive 960 mg of oral sotorasib once daily plus 6 mg/kg of intravenous (IV) panitumumab every 2 weeks; median PFS was 2 months in 54 patients randomized to receive standard-of-care therapy (hazard ratio, 0.48). The ORR was 26% and 0% in the arms, respectively, and the duration of response in the sotorasib/panitumumab arm was 4.4 months. No significant difference in PFS was observed between the standard-of-care arm and a third arm with 53 patients who received 240 mg of oral sotorasib daily plus 6 mg/kg of IV panitumumab every 2 weeks.\n\nOverall survival (OS) did not differ significantly between the treatment arms in the final analysis, but the study was not statistically powered for OS.\n\nAdverse reactions occurring in at least 20% of patients receiving sotorasib/panitumumab were rash, dry skin, diarrhea, stomatitis, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain. Common grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities, which occurred in two or more patients, included decreased magnesium, decreased potassium, decreased corrected calcium, and increased potassium.\n\nThe recommended dose of sotorasib is 960 mg given orally once daily and administered before the first panitumumab infusion. The recommended panitumumab dose is 6 mg/kg as an IV infusion every 14 days until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until sotorasib is withheld or discontinued, according to the full prescribing information.\n\nSharon Worcester, MA, is an award-winning medical journalist based in Birmingham, Alabama, writing for Medscape Medical News, MDedge. and other affiliate sites.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) stands against the other high yield dividend stocks.\n\nDow is one of the most well-known and influential stock market indices globally. It monitors the performance of 30 publicly traded companies on US stock exchanges, covering a broad array of industries. In the past 12 months, the index has surged by over 15%, compared with a nearly 25% return of the broader market.\n\nToday, tech stocks have dominated the market, as seen by the NASDAQ's nearly 30% gain over the past year, outperforming both the Dow and the broader market. However, the Dow's underperformance in this period contrasts with its historical performance. A report from Barron\u2019s highlighted that in 1978, 1980, and 1992, the Dow outpaced the Nasdaq by at least seven percentage points. The most notable period of Dow dominance occurred during the dot-com bubble's collapse, with 12 instances of outperformance between 1999 and 2002.\n\nWhen comparing the Dow to the broader market, the Dow has also shown strong results. According to S&P Global, from the past 30 years up until June 2021, the market returned 10.6%, while the Dow slightly exceeded that with an 11.16% return. This outperformance is largely due to the Dow's stable, industry-leading companies that offer reliable dividends and steady yields.\n\nInvesting in high-yielding Dow Jones stocks can be an appealing strategy for those seeking reliable income and potentially higher returns. When selecting dividend stocks for their portfolios, investors often focus on dividend yields. However, it's important to recognize that companies with high yields but lacking financial stability may be at risk of cutting dividends, especially amid global economic challenges and rising interest rates. Therefore, investment strategies that target high yields should also emphasize the financial strength and stability of the companies involved.\n\nThe Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index tracks the performance of 100 high-dividend stocks selected for their reliable dividend payments and strong financial fundamentals. In any income-focused strategy, investors typically aim for both yield and capital appreciation. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Indices have consistently provided higher yields and comparable capital gains over the long term when compared to their benchmarks. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, between June 30, 2001, and June 30, 2023, the total return of the index, assuming dividends were reinvested, averaged 11.7% annually, outperforming the Dow Jones US Broad Stock Market Index, which returned 10.2% during the same period.\n\nStory Continues",

(NASDAQ:AMGN) stands against other best cheap stocks to buy for 2025.\n\nThe U.S. consumer prices report released this week revealed a less-than-expected increase in December, signaling a potential cooling in inflation pressures. This data has sparked bets on further tame inflation and a drop in interest rates. The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased by 0.2%, down from 0.3% over the previous four months. This marks the first decrease in the rate of core CPI growth in six months, driven by lower hotel prices, slower increases in medical care costs, and moderate rent growth.\n\nThe data has renewed hopes that the Federal Reserve might ease interest rates sooner than anticipated. Before the report, most market participants expected rate cuts to occur in the second half of the year, if at all. However, the latest data has bolstered expectations for two cuts this year and even the possibility of a rate cut as early as March. Following the release, Treasury yields dropped, the S&P 500 rose, and the dollar weakened.\n\nThe sharp surge in equity prices is not surprising, as lower interest rates are generally bullish for several reasons. When interest rates fall, borrowing becomes cheaper for companies, which can lead to increased investment and expansion. Stock prices are often valued based on the present value of future earnings or cash flows, discounted by interest rates. Lower interest rates reduce the discount rate, increase the present value of future earnings, and make stocks appear more valuable.\n\nRead Also: 11 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To Buy and 11 Best Potash Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on January 16, Christopher Waller, Governor of the Federal Reserve, discussed the recent economic data and its implications for future monetary policy decisions. Waller welcomed the strong jobs report from the previous week and the latest inflation prints, which he found particularly encouraging. He noted that the inflation data was very positive, with core PCE inflation coming in below 0.2% for the sixth month out of the last eight. This trend, he believes, is bringing inflation closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target in terms of core, despite a couple of bumps in September and October.\n\nWaller emphasized that while the inflation data is promising, it is crucial to see if this trend continues. He mentioned that base effects from last year will play a role, but he is hopeful that a repeat of the shock experienced in January and February of last year will not occur again. If the current trend persists, he suggested that rate cuts could be on the table in the first half of the year.\n\nStory Continues",

The FDA declined to do so in 2023, on the grounds that the CodeBreak 200 data was not strong enough to show conclusively that Lumakras improved PFS.\n\nThe study showed a 34% reduction in PFS compared to docetaxel chemotherapy in patients previously treated with at least one platinum-based chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor, a statistically significant difference. However, the FDA said it was unconvinced by the result as the trial was small, had problems with its design, and was prone to bias.\n\nThe regulator has asked for a new study to be completed by 2028, otherwise Lumakras could lose its NSCLC indication.\n\nLumakras made $280 million in sales in 2023 and another $236 million in the first nine months of last year \u2013 falling short of the upwards momentum needed to fulfil Amgen's hopes of blockbuster sales \u2013 but the new CRC indication could kickstart growth.\n\nAmgen's head of R&D, Jay Bradner, said CRC is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US, and fewer than one in five people diagnosed with metastatic disease survive beyond five years after diagnosis. KRAS mutations are among the most common genetic alterations in CRC, with the KRAS G12C mutation present in approximately 3% to 5% of cases.\n\n\"Lumakras plus Vectibix offers a targeted, biomarker-driven combination therapy that helps delay disease progression more effectively than the investigated standard of care,\" continued Bradner.\n\n\"This new option validates our combination approach to improve outcomes for patients living with advanced KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer.\"",

            "content": "The FDA on Thursday agreed to expand the label of Amgen\u2019s KRAS inhibitor Lumakras (sotorasib), opening up its use in colorectal cancer.\n\nWith the latest approval, Lumakras can now be combined with another Amgen asset, the antibody Vectibix (panitumumab), to treat adult patients with metastatic disease and who are carrying the G12C KRAS mutation. To be eligible to Amgen\u2019s combo, patients should have previously received fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, according to the FDA\u2019s press announcement of the approval.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s decision on Thursday comes as a slight surprise, given that the study Amgen used to support its application\u2014the Phase III, double-blinded, open-label and controlled CodeBreaK 300\u2014returned disappointing survival data.\n\nIn an abstract presented at the June 2024 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Amgen reported that the Lumakras regimen lowered the risk of death by 17% to 30% versus an investigator\u2019s choice of treatment\u2014efficacy estimates that failed to reach statistical significance. The pharma in its publication pointed out that CodeBreaK 300 \u201cwas not powered to detect a statistically significant difference in [overall survival (OS)],\u201d but the study nevertheless \u201cshowed a trend toward improved OS.\u201d\n\nA few months later, in October, the FDA announced that it would push back its target action date for Lumakras in its colorectal cancer indication to \u201callow for additional time for review of supplemental data recently submitted to the agency,\u201d an Amgen spokesperson told Endpoints News at the time.\n\nThe FDA indicated in its press announcement on Thursday that it based its decision on progression-free survival (PFS), which it called the \u201cmajor efficacy outcome\u201d in CodeBreaK 300. The Lumakras-Vectibix combo resulted in a significant 52% improvement in median PFS versus choice standard of care, according to the regulator.\n\nLumakras\u2019 label expansion comes after Amgen unveiled plans at the recently concluded 2025 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference to broaden its pipeline focus beyond obesity.\n\nIn an investor note on Monday, BMO Capital Markets analysts wrote that while obesity will remain one of the pharma\u2019s priorities in 2025, \u201cwe could see the hyper focus that developed in 2024 begin to shift as we enter into the new year.\u201d This strategic shift follows an underwhelming readout for Amgen\u2019s MariTide in November 2024, which showed weight-loss efficacy broadly in line with that observed in current approved therapies\u2014but fell far short of investor expectations.\n\nAmgen still plans to take MariTide forward, with a late-stage study planned for later this year, according to the BMO note.\n\nBut the pharma is also looking beyond obesity now, according to the analysts, who pointed out that 2025 will be a \u201ccatalyst-filled year for Amgen.\u201d In rare diseases, for instance, the company is looking toward an upcoming FDA decision date for its anti-CD-19 therapy Uplizna in IgG4-related disease. The regulator\u2019s verdict is expected on April 4, according to the BMO analysts.",

Study participants given a 7.2 milligram dose of Wegovy lost, on average, 20.7% of their body weight, versus 17.5% among those on a 2.4 milligram dose and 2.4% for those on placebo. One-third of people on the high dose achieved greater than 25% weight loss. Detailed results will be presented at a scientific meeting in 2025, while data are expected from a second study of high-dose Wegovy within the next few months. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s drug Calquence on Friday won Food and Drug Administration approval for adults with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma who are ineligible for transplant. A rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, MCL is considered aggressive and often leads to relapse. Calquence\u2019s clearance was based on Phase 3 results that showed treatment alongside chemotherapy and Rituxan reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 27% compared to chemoimmunotherapy. Calquence is the first so-called BTK inhibitor approved for first-line treatment of MCL. \u2014 Delilah Alvarado\n\nThe FDA has approved Amgen's KRAS-blocking drug Lumakras for use treating colorectal cancer alongside Vectibix, an older drug sold by the biotechnology company. Use is limited to patients whose tumors express a specific mutation known as KRAS G12C, and who previously received chemotherapy. The FDA based its approval on study data that showed the combination extended progression-free survival by about three-and-a-half months. Lumakras is also approved for non-small cell lung cancer. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nAtara Biotherapeutics on Thursday said it is weighing a broader range of strategic options after the FDA rejected its experimental drug, Ebvallo, for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease associated with Epstein-Barr virus. According to Atara, the agency issued a complete response letter for issues at a third-party facility contracted to make Ebvallo. There were no citations related to Ebvallo\u2019s manufacturing process specifically, or its clinical safety or efficacy, Atara said. Together with partner Pierre Fabre Laboratories, Atara submitted Ebvallo, an allogeneic cell therapy, for use in adults and children two years or older who received at least one prior therapy for their disease. Atara is now working with Redmile Group to obtain up to $15 million to fund addressing the rejection and resubmitting Ebvallo. \u2014 Delilah Alvarado\n\nAn experimental Boehringer Ingelheim drug called iclepertin failed to improve cognition or function in adults with schizophrenia, the company said Thursday. Results from three late-stage trials showed treatment did not meet either the trial\u2019s primary or secondary goals versus placebo after six months. The study program, called CONNEX, enrolled 1,840 people across 41 countries. Full data will be presented at a future medical meeting, Boehringer said. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo",

The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 1% for the day. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.78%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 1.51%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the world's largest biotech drugmaker had gained 3.15% over the past month, outpacing the Medical sector's loss of 1.36% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.14% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Amgen in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on February 4, 2025. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $5.02, indicating a 6.58% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $8.85 billion, up 7.92% from the year-ago period.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Amgen. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.05% higher. Amgen currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn the context of valuation, Amgen is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 13.23. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 21.97 of its industry.\n\nWe can also see that AMGN currently has a PEG ratio of 2.75. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.43.\n\nThe Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry is part of the Medical sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 56, putting it in the top 23% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.",

            "content": "Pivotal Study Demonstrated the Combination More Than Doubled Progression-Free Survival Compared to Investigated SOC\n\nTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Jan. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved LUMAKRAS\u00ae (sotorasib) in combination with Vectibix\u00ae (panitumumab) for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received prior fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Approval is based on the pivotal Phase 3 CodeBreaK 300 study, which demonstrated that LUMAKRAS plus Vectibix is the first and only targeted treatment combination for chemorefractory KRAS G12C-mutated mCRC to show superior progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the investigated standard-of-care (SOC).1*\n\n\"Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, and fewer than one in five people diagnosed with metastatic disease survive beyond five years after diagnosis,\" said Jay Bradner, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen.2 \"LUMAKRAS plus Vectibix offers a targeted, biomarker-driven combination therapy that helps delay disease progression more effectively than the investigated standard of care. This new option validates our combination approach to improve outcomes for patients living with advanced KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer.\"\n\nThe CodeBreaK 300 clinical trial compared LUMAKRAS at two different doses (960 mg daily or 240 mg daily) in combination with Vectibix to the investigator's choice of SOC (trifluridine and tipiracil or regorafenib) in patients with chemorefractory KRAS G12C-mutated mCRC. Study results demonstrated that LUMAKRAS 960 mg daily plus Vectibix (n=53) showed an improved median PFS of 5.6 months (4.2, 6.3) compared to 2 months (1.9, 3.9) on investigator's choice of care (n=54), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.48 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.3, 0.78) and a p-value of 0.005. The study demonstrated an improved overall response rate (ORR) of 26% (95% CI: 15, 40) compared to 0% with investigator's choice (95% CI: 0, 7). The study was not statistically powered for overall survival (OS). The median overall survival (mOS) for patients treated with LUMAKRAS plus Vectibix was not reached (NR) (8.6, NR), and mOS for patients treated with investigator's choice was 10.3 months (7, NR), with a HR of 0.7 (95% CI: 0.41, 1.18); the final analysis of OS was not statistically significant. Safety profiles were consistent with those historically observed for LUMAKRAS and Vectibix. The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) are rash (87%), dry skin (28%), diarrhea (28%), stomatitis (26%), fatigue (21%) and musculoskeletal pain (21%). PFS of LUMAKRAS 240 mg daily plus Vectibix (n=53) compared to investigator's choice was not statistically significant.\n\nThe KRAS G12C mutation is present in approximately 3-5% of colorectal cancers as determined by an FDA-approved biomarker test.3-5 This emphasizes the important role of comprehensive biomarker testing in mCRC. By detecting an actionable mutation, eligible patients are now able to receive a corresponding targeted therapy that may lead to improved responses.\n\n\"In metastatic colorectal cancer, KRAS mutations are historically associated with worse mortality rates and inferior outcomes compared to non-mutated tumors, and standard treatment options have shown minimal benefit,\" said Marwan G. Fakih, M.D., primary study investigator and co-director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Program, City of Hope.3-6 \"Designed for dual blockade of KRAS G12C and EGFR pathways, the combination of sotorasib plus panitumumab provides a needed new treatment option to better overcome cancer's escape mechanisms. The CodeBreaK 300 study showed superior progression-free survival compared to the investigated standard of care and represents a clinically meaningful benefit for patients with KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer.\"\n\n\"There is an immense need for continued innovation and precision medicine to help address metastatic colorectal cancer,\" said Michael Sapienza, Chief Executive Officer of the Colorectal Cancer Alliance. \"This new combination approach is an important breakthrough for patients with KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer, offering a new beneficial treatment option for patients living with this devastating and challenging disease.\"\n\n*Investigator's choice for SOC included trifluridine/tipiracil or regorafenib.\n\nAbout CodeBreaK 300\n\nThe CodeBreaK 300 trial enrolled 160 participants and compared LUMAKRAS\u00ae (sotorasib) at doses of 960 mg and 240 mg in combination with Vectibix\u00ae (panitumumab) to investigator's choice of standard of care (trifluridine/tipiracil or regorafenib) in patients with chemorefractory KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The study met its primary endpoint showing improved progression-free survival (PFS), and the key secondary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR) also favored the combination.\n\nAbout mCRC and the KRAS G12C Mutation\n\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, comprising 11% of all cancer diagnoses.7 It is also the third most commonly diagnosed cancer globally.8\n\nPatients with previously treated mCRC need more effective treatment options. For patients in the third-line setting, standard therapies yield median OS times of less than one year, and patients' response rates are less than 10%.9\n\nKRAS mutations are among the most common genetic alterations in CRC, with the KRAS G12C mutation present in approximately 3-5% of CRC cases as determined by a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved biomarker test.3-5\n\nAbout LUMAKRAS\u00ae (sotorasib) in Combination with Vectibix\u00ae (panitumumab)\n\nIn the U.S., LUMAKRAS is now approved in combination with Vectibix\u00ae (panitumumab) for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated mCRC, as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received prior fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy. This targeted therapy combines LUMAKRAS, a KRASG12C inhibitor, with Vectibix, a monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody. The recommended dose of LUMAKRAS is 960 mg daily, and the recommended dose of Vectibix is 6 mg/kg IV q2 weeks.\n\nAbout LUMAKRAS\u00ae/LUMYKRAS\u00ae (sotorasib)\n\nLUMAKRAS received accelerated approval from the FDA on May 28, 2021. The FDA completed its review of Amgen's supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) seeking full approval of LUMAKRAS on December 26, 2023, which resulted in a complete response letter. In addition, the FDA concluded that the dose comparison postmarketing requirement (PMR) issued at the time of LUMAKRAS accelerated approval, to compare the safety and efficacy of LUMAKRAS 960 mg daily dose versus a lower daily dose, has been fulfilled. The company said LUMAKRAS at 960 mg once-daily will remain the dose for patients with KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) under accelerated approval. The FDA also issued a new PMR for an additional confirmatory study to support full approval that will be completed no later than February 2028.\n\nAbout Vectibix\u00ae (panitumumab)\n\nVectibix is the first and only human monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody fully approved by the FDA for the treatment of mCRC. Vectibix was approved in the U.S. in September 2006 as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with EGFR-expressing mCRC following disease progression after prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy.\n\nIn May 2014, the FDA approved Vectibix for use in combination with FOLFOX as first-line treatment in patients with wild-type KRAS (exon 2) mCRC. With this approval, Vectibix became the first-and-only anti-EGFR biologic therapy indicated for use with FOLFOX, one of the most commonly used chemotherapy regimens, in first-line treatment of mCRC for patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC.\n\nIn June 2017, the FDA approved a refined indication for Vectibix for use in patients with wild-type RAS (defined as wild-type in both KRAS and NRAS as determined by an FDA-approved test for this use) mCRC, specifically as first-line therapy in combination with FOLFOX and as monotherapy following disease progression after prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy.\n\nLUMAKRAS\u00ae (sotorasib) in Combination with Vectibix\u00ae (panitumumab) U.S. Indication\n\nVectibix\u00ae in combination with sotorasib, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated mCRC, as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy.\n\nLIMITATIONS OF USE\n\nVectibix\u00ae is not indicated for the treatment of patients with RAS-mutant mCRC unless used in combination with sotorasib in KRAS G12C-mutated mCRC. Vectibix\u00ae is not indicated for the treatment of patients with mCRC for whom RAS mutation status is unknown.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR LUMAKRAS\u00ae (SOTORASIB)\n\nHepatotoxicity\n\nLUMAKRAS \u00ae can cause hepatotoxicity and increased ALT or AST which may lead to drug-induced liver injury and hepatitis.\n\ncan cause hepatotoxicity and increased ALT or AST which may lead to drug-induced liver injury and hepatitis.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd. or Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.), the performance of Otezla\u00ae (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), our acquisitions of Teneobio, Inc., ChemoCentryx, Inc., or Horizon Therapeutics plc (including the prospective performance and outlook of Horizon's business, performance and opportunities, any potential strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities expected as a result of such acquisition, and any projected impacts from the Horizon acquisition on our acquisition-related expenses going forward), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems on our business, outcomes, progress, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nNo forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future.\n\nEven when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.\n\nOur results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize any of the strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities arising from the Horizon acquisition, and such benefits, synergies or opportunities may take longer to realize than expected. We may not be able to successfully integrate Horizon, and such integration may take longer, be more difficult or cost more than expected. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach of our information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\n\nCONTACT: Amgen, Thousand Oaks\n\nElissa Snook, 609-251-1407 (media)\n\nJustin Claeys, 805-313-9775 (investors)\n\nReferences\n\nFakih M, et al.

(Credit: Amgen Inc.)\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Amgen\u2019s sotorasib (Lumakras) and panitumumab (Vectibix) for adults with KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).\n\nThis approval applies to patients who have previously received chemotherapy based on fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. However, the approval is contingent on testing using an FDA-approved test.\n\nIn parallel, the health agency has approved Netherlands-based Qiagen\u2019s therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit as a companion diagnostic. This kit helps identify colorectal cancer patients with KRAS G12C mutations who may be eligible for Lumakras and Vectibix.\n\nLumakras is an oral drug that targets a mutated form of the KRAS gene, found in 3% to 5% of colorectal cancers.\n\nThe drug was granted FDA accelerated approval in 2021 for treating KRAS G12C \u2011mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In 2022, Lumakras was approved in Japan for the same indication.\n\nVectibix is a monoclonal antibody that targets a mutated form of the EGFR gene, known for driving rapid tumour cell growth.\n\nThe combination therapy\u2019s efficacy was assessed in the CodeBreaK 300 trial. This review utilised the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot programme and the Assessment Aid.\n\nCodeBreaK 300 was a randomised, open-label study involving patients with KRAS G12C-mutated mCRC who had prior chemotherapy.\n\nKRAS mutations were identified in tumour samples using the QIAGEN therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR kit.\n\nA total of 160 patients were randomised to receive either 960 mg sotorasib plus 6 mg/kg panitumumab, 240 mg sotorasib plus 6 mg/kg panitumumab, or investigator\u2019s choice of standard of care treatments.\n\nThe major efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), evaluated by a blinded independent central review using RECIST v1.1 criteria.\n\nAdditional efficacy outcomes included overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR).\n\nThe study was not powered for OS.\n\nMedian PFS was 5.6 months for the sotorasib/panitumumab arm, compared to two months for the standard of care (SOC) arm.\n\nThe final OS analysis was not statistically significant. ORR was 26% in the sotorasib/panitumumab arm, and 0% in the SOC arm.\n\nMedian DOR was 4.4 months in the sotorasib/panitumumab arm.\n\nThe final analysis of PFS for patients in the sotorasib 240 mg/panitumumab arm, compared to the SOC arm, was not statistically significant.\n\nLast year, the FDA approved Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s Krazati for treating colorectal cancer in patients with a KRAS mutation.",

(NASDAQ:AMGN) stands against other best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy.\n\nThe NASDAQ, heavily comprised of technology stocks, has been on a consistent upward trajectory for some years. In 2023, it experienced remarkable growth, marking its best performance since 2020 with an increase of over 43%. In 2024, the index continued to surpass market expectations with a 28.64% gain. This impressive performance is largely driven by the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, which has significantly boosted major tech stocks and the broader market throughout 2023 and into this year. Analysts suggest that the NASDAQ could be the index of the future, as its companies have shown a strong ability to adapt to evolving market trends.\n\nNASDAQ\u2019s consistent outperformance can be observed over several years. According to a report by Invesco, since January 1, 2008, the Nasdaq-100 Index has delivered a cumulative total return of 750%, significantly outpacing the broader market\u2019s 315% return. This success is largely attributed to the innovation driven by tech companies, which continues to attract investors. For instance, the technology sector in the broader market has achieved an annualized total return of 20.65% over the past decade, compared to 12.80% for the market. This leadership is understandable given the rapid adoption of technology in recent years. The Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) noted that the Nasdaq-100 has approximately 55% exposure to the tech sector, in contrast to about 32% for the broader market.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Monthly Dividend Stocks with Over 5% Yield and Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Cheap Stock Picks\n\nTech companies are not only driving innovation but are also swiftly adjusting their dividend strategies. In 2024, many prominent tech firms began issuing dividends, significantly boosting the overall dividend pool. Although dividends are traditionally linked with value stocks rather than the high-growth companies fueling the AI surge, analysts suggest this shift broadens the appeal of these stocks to new investor groups while putting surplus cash to use. Typically, growth-focused companies prioritize reinvestment over returning earnings to shareholders. However, experts like Ted Mortonson from Baird argue that these dividend payments won\u2019t undermine the companies\u2019 future dominance. Here are some other comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t view it as a problem. I view it as they\u2019ve won. They\u2019ve won the technology side. They\u2019ve won on the business-model side, and they\u2019re going to win on the Gen AI cycle.\u201d\n\nStory Continues",

This rising drive corresponds to a robust CAGR of 5.3% over the forecast period from 2024 to 2032.\n\nAnti-Alzheimer drugs are developed to cure the disease by targeting at the underlying causes of Alzheimer\u2019s such as the protein fragments that collect in the brain and form plaques. The prevalence of Alzheimer\u2019s is rising owing to increasing ageing population globally, with more than 55 million people affected with dementia (Alzheimer\u2019s accounting for 60\u201370% cases). High potential therapies which target amyloid-beta plaques and tau protein tangles (the key factors involved in causing the disease) have attracted substantial patient and healthcare attention, although competition remains high as this pipeline is already saturated.\n\nBiotechnology convergence, personalized medicines and US FDA fast tracked therapies have created new opportunities for development & commercialization of therapeutics for this indication. By 2050, global dementia prevalence will triple due to rapid increase in ageing population hence there will be a strong demand for effective drugs in near future too. In 2023 an estimated 6.7 million Americans aged 65 and older were living with Alzheimer\u2019s dementia implying necessity of continuous research & innovation within this space.\n\nDo you need any industry insights on Alzheimers Drugs Market Make an enquiry now >> https://introspectivemarketresearch.com/checkout/?user=1&_sid=18492\n\nKey Industry Insights\n\nHow is the rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease impacting healthcare systems and society?\n\nThe growing number of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) cases constitutes the main reason leading to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s drugs. Because Alzheimer\u2019s is a disease that mostly affects older people, it is the main reason behind the increase in demand due to the aging population. The current number of 6.7 million Americans aged 65 and above who suffer from AD will double up to 13.8 million by 2060, with no significant hastening of the relevant technological progress. At the global level, a thousand millions of people suffered dementia in 2020. This number will have doubled every 20 years, and it will have reached 139 million by 2050. Being one of the most popular causes of death, the number of deaths has had an increase of more than 145% in the period from 2000 to 2019. The economic effect is very high as the global cost had an increase from $818 billion to over $1.3 trillion in 2015 and is expected to go up to $2.8 trillion by 2030. These tendencies demonstrate the serious need for innovative medicine to face the successive healthcare and socio-eco consequences of AD.\n\nWhat strategies can be employed to reduce the high research and development costs linked to Alzheimer's drugs and improve their accessibility?\n\nThe Alzheimer\u2019s drugs market is grappling with major challenges, primarily due to the steep research and development costs tied to creating new medications. Developing treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is not only costly but also a lengthy endeavor, often marked by high failure rates. The estimated total cost for an AD drug development program is around $5.6 billion, with an average timeline of 13 years from preclinical studies to FDA approval. In contrast, the cost of developing cancer treatments is about $793.6 million per agent, underscoring the significant financial strain unique to AD drug development. These extended timelines and hefty expenses discourage investment, as unsuccessful trials can lead to considerable financial losses. As a result, the high costs and associated risks serve as a significant barrier, hindering innovation and limiting the availability of effective treatments in the Alzheimer\u2019s drugs market.\n\n\"Research made simple and affordable \u2013 Trusted Research Tailored just for you \u2013 IMR Knowledge Cluster\"\n\nhttps://www.imrknowledgecluster.com/\n\nHow can the development of Alzheimer's disease-modifying therapies be accelerated to address unmet medical needs and improve patient outcomes?\n\nThe development of therapies that modify Alzheimer\u2019s disease (DMTs) offers a significant opportunity to tackle this pressing global health issue. Unlike treatments that only address symptoms, DMTs focus on slowing or stopping the progression of the disease by targeting harmful processes such as the buildup of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2). In 2023, 79% of the 141 Alzheimer\u2019s disease treatments in clinical trials were DMTs, which included six advanced anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in Phase 3 trials. Two of these have received FDA approval, utilizing advancements in biomarkers to inform treatment decisions. However, there are challenges to overcome, such as ensuring timely diagnoses, providing equitable access to imaging and specialist care, and managing side effects. With dementia cases expected to reach 78 million worldwide by 2030, the need for innovative therapies will only grow. The potential market for DMTs is significant, fueled by their ability to enhance quality of life and alleviate the $2.8 trillion global economic burden of dementia, highlighting a crucial advancement in Alzheimer\u2019s care. `\n\nKey Manufacturers\n\nIdentify the main players and organizations in a particular industry or market that have a strong impact on its dynamics.

            "content": "Some investors believe you make money when you buy a stock, not when you sell it. The logic behind this idea is that investing in the right stock at the right time -- and holding onto it for a while -- is one of the best formulas for earning terrific returns.\n\nSo, a company being near its 52-week low is no reason to avoid it. On the contrary, that might be the best time to invest, provided there are good reasons to believe it will bounce back.\n\nWith that in mind, let's consider two stocks that haven't performed well recently and are now near their 52-week lows but that are still worth investing in: CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP -5.00%) and Amgen (AMGN 1.70%).\n\n1. CRISPR Therapeutics\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics is a mid-stage biotech specializing in gene editing. The company has just one product on the market, Casgevy, which treats transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease, two rare blood disorders. Casgevy has been on the market for a little more than a year. It became the first gene-editing treatment that uses the Nobel Prize-winning CRISPR technique, an impressive achievement by CRISPR Therapeutics.\n\nThat said, due to the complexity of administering gene-editing treatments, it is not yet generating revenue for CRISPR. That, combined with the fact that the drugmaker remains unprofitable, explains why it is significantly lagging the market. However, there is much to like about CRISPR Therapeutics. First, Casgevy's potential is large, even if the biotech will share the spoils with Vertex Pharmaceuticals, with whom it developed the medicine.\n\nWith little competition on the market for Casgevy, a price of $2.2 million in the U.S., increased third-party coverage, and a total target population of at least 58,000 patients, the medicine should generate well over $1 billion in sales at its peak. Second, CRISPR has several other promising pipeline candidates.\n\nRecently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to the company's CTX112, a potential therapy for certain B-cell malignancies. This designation is reserved for investigational medicines that meet certain conditions, including targeting a serious or life-threatening disease with few treatment options and having produced promising preliminary evidence of efficacy.\n\nIt also helps speed up the development of therapies. So, this was a big deal for CRISPR. The biotech has several other exciting candidates beyond CX112. There are some risks associated with CRISPR Therapeutics. Its pipeline programs, even CX112, could flop, for instance, a typical issue biotech companies -- especially smaller ones -- have to deal with. However, CRISPR Therapeutics' shares could soar if it makes progress with its pipeline and Casgevy starts ramping up its sales.\n\nFor those comfortable with the risk, it is worth investing in the stock.\n\n2. Amgen\n\nThe market recently punished Amgen's shares after its leading weight loss candidate, MariTide, failed to impress in a mid-stage study. The stock has rebounded somewhat since that debacle, but it is not very far from its 52-week low. However, the market's reaction was perhaps a bit overdone. MariTide led to a 20% average weight loss after 52 weeks, with no weight loss plateau observed.\n\nThat's not bad at all. The biotech still has to conduct phase 3 studies, but if these confirm MariTide's mid-stage trial performance, the medicine could carve out a small niche in the rapidly rising weight loss space. There are many other reasons to invest in Amgen. For instance, the company's financial results remain strong. Amgen's 23% year-over-year revenue growth to $8.5 billion in the third quarter was due to an acquisition, but its sales still jumped by a strong 8% year over year organically.\n\nAmgen has several products that should drive top-line growth for many years, including Tepezza, the only medicine for thyroid eye disease approved by the FDA. The company's Tezspire, the rights of which it shares with AstraZeneca, is growing its sales fast and recently aced a phase 3 study that should lead to a label expansion. Further, Amgen has a deep pipeline that includes at least one other potential weight loss candidate and plenty of products beyond that.\n\nLastly, Amgen is a terrific dividend stock. The company has increased its payouts by 201% in the past decade, and the stock currently offers a forward yield of 3.63% compared to the S&P 500's 1.27%. So, Amgen is an excellent stock for long-term, income-seeking investors.",

The median duration of response (DOR) with the combination was 4.4 months (range, 1.9+ to 6+).\n\nThe study was not statistically powered for overall survival (OS) and the final analysis of OS was not determined to be of statistical significance. The median OS with sotorasib at 960 mg plus panitumumab was not reached (NR; 95% CI, 8.6-NR) vs 10.3 months (95% CI, 7-NR) with SOC (HR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.41-1.18).\n\nIn a recent interview, Marwan G. Fakih, MD, professor in the Department of Medical Oncology & Therapeutics Research; associate director of Clinical Sciences; medical director of the Briskin Center for Clinical Research; division chief of GI Medical Oncology; and co-director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Program at City of Hope, in Duarte, CA, discussed data from the final OS analysis presented during the 2024 ASCO Annual Meeting.\n\nDecoding CodeBreaK 300: Population, Treatment, Objectives\n\nThe global, randomized, open-label, active-controlled study enrolled patients with KRAS G12C\u2013mutated mCRC who were at least 18 years of age, had an ECOG performance status no higher than 2, and received at least 1 prior line of therapy for metastatic disease. Patients must have received fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan for metastatic disease unless there was a medical contraindication. They were required to have at least 1 measurable lesion by RECIST 1.1 criteria.\n\nParticipants were randomized 1:1:1 to receive sotorasib at a daily dose of 960 mg plus panitumumab at 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n = 53), sotorasib at 240 mg daily plus panitumumab at 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n = 53), or SOC (n = 54). Stratification factors included previous antiangiogenic therapy (yes vs no), time from diagnosis of mCRC (\u226518 months vs <18 months), and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1/2).\n\nTreatment continued until progressive disease, lack of clinical benefit, or treatment intolerance. Moreover, to discontinue sotorasib, panitumumab also needed to be discontinued; however, patients could still receive sotorasib even if panitumumab was discontinued. A total of 4 patients who were in the sotorasib 960-mg/panitumumab arm continued sotorasib monotherapy after panitumumab discontinuation.\n\nThe primary end point of the study was PFS by blinded independent central review and RECIST 1.1 criteria and key secondary end points included OS, ORR, and DOR.\n\nWhen looking at the population of patients who received sotorasib at 960 mg plus panitumumab or the control arms, the median age was 64 years (range, 34-81), with 46% of patients at least 65 years. Half of the patients were female, and most were White (74%) and had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (97%). Primary disease sites included the colon (69%) or the rectum (31%). Patients had received a median of 2 prior lines of therapy for metastatic disease. All had previously received fluoropyrimidine, 99% had prior oxaliplatin, 93% had prior irinotecan, and 18% had prior trifluridine/tipiracil or regorafenib.\n\nAdditional Efficacy Findings\n\nData from the final PFS analysis indicated that those who received sotorasib at a dose of 240 mg plus panitumumab did not experience a statistically significant PFS benefit vs SOC.\n\nSafety Spotlight\n\nIn those who received sotorasib at 960 mg once daily plus panitumumab, 36% were exposed to sotorasib for longer than 6 months and 6% were exposed to the agent for longer than 1 year.\n\nTwenty-six percent of patients in this dosing group experienced serious adverse effects (AEs). Moreover, 26% of patients experienced an AE that led to a dose interruption of sotorasib. One patient who experienced nausea needed a dose reduction of sotorasib, and 1 patient who experienced decreased corrected calcium permanently discontinued the agent.\n\nThe most common AEs experienced by at least 20% of patients who received sotorasib at 960 mg plus panitumumab included rash, dry skin (all grade, 28%; grade 3/4, 0%), diarrhea (28%; 6%), stomatitis (26%; 0%), fatigue (21%; 0%), and musculoskeletal pain (21%; 2.1%).1 The most common laboratory abnormalities that were grade 3 or 4 in severity and were reported in 2 or more patients were decreased magnesium (24%), decreased potassium (7%), decreased corrected calcium (4.3%), and increased potassium (4.3%).\n\nReferences",

            "content": "Biopharma chiefs don\u2019t like being labeled as followers, especially not in obesity. Just ask Robert Bradway, Amgen chairman and CEO.\n\nAt the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference this week, Bradway was asked what he sees as the pros and cons to Amgen\u2019s experimental drug MariTide potentially being a third major entrant in the obesity market behind Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.\n\n\u201cYou used the word \u2018third,\u2019\u201d the CEO pointed out to the analyst who posed the question. \u201cI would use the word \u2018first.\u2019 We\u2019ll be the first long-acting therapy in the treatment of obesity and obesity related conditions.\u201d\n\nThe exchange underscored how, in the race to develop the next big hit in this category, drugmakers are trying desperately to avoid a me-too.\n\nLilly and Novo\u2019s anti-diabetes and anti-obesity meds tirzepatide and semaglutide \u2014 sold under brand names Mounjaro/Zepbound and Ozempic/Wegovy, respectively \u2014 represent the undisputed royalty of the global weight-loss market. The drugs are once-weekly shots.\n\nBut both have been associated with gastrointestinal side effects. And up to 30% of patients with obesity drop off the drugs within a month, 60% to 70% within a year.\n\nAs rivals eye their $70 billion crown, they don\u2019t want to be seen as derivatives. Companies did their best to convince investors that the success of future weight-loss treatments will hinge on differentiation on multiple fronts.\n\nAs such, this succession race could also put more emphasis on marketing. If Novo and Lilly are the Coke and Pepsi of the category, whoever\u2019s Dr Pepper will need to spotlight its points of differentiation. Consumers may need help navigating what could become an array of competing products, each with unique attributes.\n\nBoasting diverse combinations of agonists that mimic GLP-1 and other gut hormones, some of the new entrants are designed to improve the quality of weight loss, including by preserving muscle mass. The contenders also may be easier to take, with less stomach discomfort, and more convenient monthly dosing or delivery via oral versus subcutaneous injection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to move on. We need to think about differentiated approaches rather than more of the same,\u201d said Adam Steensberg, CEO of Zealand Pharma, whose company is testing several obesity molecules, during its investor presentation Monday.\n\nLead drug survodutide, a dual agonist which combines glucagon and GLP-1 receptor agonists, is in Phase 3 for obesity. Dual agonist dapiglutide is in Phase 2. And Zealand is also reportedly in talks to partner with another company on its Phase 2 amylin analog petrelinutide.\n\nUnlike the Novo and Lilly top-selling incretin-based drugs, petrelinutide contains an analog of amylin, a pancreatic hormone, and has been shown to reduce body weight by 15% to 20% while potentially preserving muscle mass and improving GI tolerability, the company said.\n\nAre more contenders coming?\n\nThe other question being raised by this race is, who will be the next company to enter the obesity space in a major way? Boehringer Ingelheim, for instance, signed on to handle commercialization for survodutide.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to overlook BI because it\u2019s private, Steensburg added. \u201cIn our mind, Boehringer looks to be the third large pharma company that can actually enter the obesity space with a very differentiated molecule.\u201d\n\nOthers may beg to differ. While this year, Lilly is expected to release Phase 3 data on its obesity pill orforglipron, several others are in late-stage development.\n\nA once-daily version of Pfizer\u2019s pill danuglipron will enter Phase 3 testing in the second half, reported CEO Albert Bourla. He predicted that the pill, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, would likely follow Lilly\u2019s own oral in reaching market, as long as all goes well in danuglipron\u2019s pharmacokinetic testing.\n\nBourla added that Pfizer is \u201call-in\u201d on building a strong metabolic organization. The company has been hiring over the last 12 to 15 months, he said, adding that it\u2019s eyeing oral and injectable drugs alike to develop and sell through its considerable marketing muscle.\n\nViking Therapeutic\u2019s VK-2735, a dual agonist of GLP-1 and GIP receptors, is set to release Phase 2 data for its oral version later this year, and the injectable program is moving into Phase 3 in the year\u2019s first half. CEO Brian Lian noted Monday that pharmacokinetic testing of the subcutaneous version \u201craises the possibility of a potential monthly regimen.\u201d\n\nIn that sense, VK-2735 could compete with MariTide. Bradway said Amgen is developing the injectable to treat obesity and type 2 diabetes and that the drug has shown the potential to be administered \u201cmonthly or less frequently.\u201d\n\n\u201cExpect us to move swiftly into Phase 3 studies,\u201d Bradway added.\n\nMeanwhile, Novo isn\u2019t standing still. The Danish drug giant released Phase 3 findings for subcutaneous CagriSema at the end of 2024.\n\nAlso nipping at their heels, Kailera Therapeutics toplined positive Phase 2 data for its injectable HRS9531 this week. And further back in the pipeline is Roche. As part of the Swiss drugmaker\u2019s acquisition of Carmot Therapeutics a year ago came two obesity prospects, oral drug CT-996 and injection CT-388, in Phase 1 and Phase 1/2 trials, respectively.\n\nA focus on quality\n\nWhile it dominated discussion in 2023 and 2024, the obesity category continues to be a major talking point in investor circles, largely due to the unmet need. Some 50% of adults globally are expected to be overweight or obese by 2030, and 5 million deaths are attributed to those conditions every year. Yet just 2% of eligible patients in the U.S. receive prescriptions.\n\nWith so many programs due to report results this year, the Food and Drug Administration issued draft guidance last month that stresses shrinking actual fat, not just weight loss that may also include shrinking muscle mass.\n\nLilly and Novo themselves have acknowledged the need to focus on the quality \u2014 and not just magnitude \u2014 of weight loss. Unsurprisingly, those looking to challenge the companies\u2019 dominance have been outspoken about that need, as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we start to move away from this arms race of the \u2018Olympics of weight loss,\u2019\u201d argued Steensberg, the Zealand CEO. \u201cIt\u2019s not the goal for future medicines to develop the highest degree of weight loss. It\u2019s the goal to develop a healthy weight loss.\u201d\n\nFor most, he said, shedding between 15% and 20% of body weight is the goal, not 30%, which is on the order of bariatric surgery.\n\nThe difference now is, companies like Zealand and others are starting to get the results needed to back up that contention.",

            "content": "After an explosive opening marked by a suite of multi-billion-dollar deals, the 2025 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference frenzy has calmed down\u2014but only slightly. The second day of the conference saw several big pharma players plot their strategic roadmaps, looking back and learning from their stumbles in 2024 and scoping out avenues of growth for the year ahead.\n\nMerck Looks to Diversify Pipeline as it Braces for Keytruda Cliff\n\nWith more than 40 approved indications, Keytruda\u2014a blockbuster PD-1 inhibitor that has now become a cornerstone in cancer therapy\u2014is Merck\u2019s top-selling asset. In the first nine months of 2024, the asset brought in more than $21.6 billion for the pharma. But with key patent protections set to expire starting in 2028, Merck is now working to beef up its pipeline to absorb an expected drop in Keytruda sales as biosimilar competitors enter the market, according to reporting from PharmaVoice.\n\nIn an investor note, BMO Capital Markets analysts said that Merck\u2019s long-term guidance\u2014$25 billion for cancer and more than $5 billion each for its immunology and HIV portfolios by the mid-2030s\u2014\u201csuggests greater expansion of oncology business\u201d and reflects the company\u2019s optimism around its other units. Merck is also working on a subcutaneous formulation of Keytruda, which \u201ccould help lengthen the tail\u201d of its erosion, according to the BMO note.\n\nRoche Eyes Judicious Use of $10B M&A Budget\n\nEvery year, Roche sets aside around $10 billion for potential M&A deals, but CEO Teresa Graham revealed at JPM25 that the pharma is selective in how and whether it spends this money, Fierce Biotech reported on Tuesday.\n\nThis fiscal control was in full display last year, Richard Vosser, analyst at J.P. Morgan, pointed out during the Q&A session of Roche\u2019s presentation, according to Fierce. Some of the pharma\u2019s recent deals include its $900 million partnership with COUR Pharmaceuticals last month and potential $1.8 billion contract with Flare Therapeutics in November 2024. Most prominent is Roche\u2019s $1.5 billion acquisition of Poseida Therapeutics, also in November.\n\nStill, Graham maintained that the pharma has the capacity\u2014and willingness\u2014to make big-ticket acquisitions \u201cif and when we find transformative assets that are either complementary to our portfolio\u201d or \u201cchange the game in important diseases.\u201d\n\nAmgen Doubles Down on MariTide Despite Flat Phase II Data\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, Amgen officials defended the Phase II readout for its closely watched obesity asset MariTide.\n\n\u201cI think MariTide will differentiate itself not only on the profile\u2014that we are a different product than the weeklies, which seem to be more similar to each other than not\u2014but also in the investment that we\u2019re putting behind it,\u201d Susan Sweeney, head of obesity and related conditions, said, according to BioPharma Dive.\n\nThe company in September 2024 announced that it will push through with a late-stage program for MariTide, testing the bispecific GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist not only in obesity, but also in heart, kidney and liver diseases.\n\nA few months later, however, MariTide\u2019s Phase II data largely disappointed investors, sending the pharma\u2019s shares dropping 11% in the aftermath. The mid-stage results showed that MariTide elicited an average weight loss of up to 20% at 52 weeks, which was on the lower end of the range that stockholders were expecting.\n\nAt JPM25, Sweeney reiterated the pharma\u2019s commitment to MariTide, confirming that it will initiate a broad Phase III program for the candidate in obesity and related conditions, with an eye toward securing insurance coverage, BioPharma Dive reported.\n\nBiogen Hits Lowest Stock Price Since 2013 as Leqembi Uptake Lags\n\nBiogen CEO Chris Viehbacher at JPM25 said that the pharma remains fully committed to the Alzheimer\u2019s disease space and its therapeutic antibody Leqembi (lecanemab), according to a BMO Capital Markets note on Tuesday.\n\nThat\u2019s despite what the BMO analyst called \u201cstruggles\u201d with the Alzheimer\u2019s market, including barriers to reimbursement and the need to educate providers about appropriate treatment. Leqembi\u2019s roll-out has been slow, with Eisai\u2014Biogen\u2019s development and commercialization partner\u2014in November 2024 lowering its full fiscal year guidance.\n\nBiogen stock was trading at $142.42 on Tuesday, its lowest since February 2013, according to SeekingAlpha.\n\n\u201cBusiness development continues to be needed,\u201d the BMO analysts noted. In its own investor note, Jefferies agreed, while pointing out that Biogen appears to have slowed down this development. \u201cThey will do deals and are looking at many things - but relative urgency has actually declined slightly versus 6+ [months] ago,\u201d the Jefferies analyst wrote.\n\nLilly Crashes on Zepound, Mounjaro Q4 Miss\n\nLike Biogen, Eli Lilly saw negative stock movement on Tuesday, in its case after reporting a disappointing sales preview for its blockbuster weight-loss therapy tirzepatide.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Lilly\u2019s Zepbound, indicated for chronic weight management, brought in $1.9 billion, while its sister brand Mounjaro, approved for type 2 diabetes, earned $3.5 billion. Overall, Lilly recorded $13.5 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter, falling slightly below the analyst consensus of $13.9 billion.\n\nIn a statement, CEO David Ricks pointed to its \u201clower-than-expected channel inventory at year-end\u201d as the reason for its Q4 miss, alongside its previous guidance that had overestimated the acceleration of the U.S. incretin market. In a Tuesday note, BMO Capital Markets analysts remained optimistic about Lilly\u2019s prospects in the coming year, noting that while the tirzepatide roll-out remains \u201cconstrained,\u201d demand remains \u201crobust\u201d in the U.S.",

Conventional cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation, present several challenges, including high rates of recurrence and considerable side effects, which underscore the necessity for more targeted and precise therapeutic options. DLL3, a protein that is overexpressed on the surface of tumor cells in SCLC and other neuroendocrine malignancies, has emerged as a focal point for research and development in oncology, promising targeted therapies that reduce harm to healthy tissues.\n\nThe approval of Tarlatamab (Imdelltra) by Amgen in May 2024 represented a significant advancement for DLL3-targeted therapies. As the first and only drug of its kind available, Tarlatamab has stimulated further research and commercial interest in DLL3-based treatments. This approval was based on encouraging results from clinical trials, particularly the DeLLphi-301 study, which showcased the drug\u2019s effectiveness in treating extensive-stage SCLC. The success of Tarlatamab has set the stage for the continued development of DLL3-targeted therapies, including bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), small molecule inhibitors, and innovative cell-based therapies such as CAR-T and CAR-NK cell therapies.\n\nThe DLL3-targeted therapy market is rapidly evolving, driven by the increasing acknowledgment of DLL3 as a vital therapeutic target in SCLC and other neuroendocrine cancers. In addition to Tarlatamab, numerous other therapies are currently undergoing clinical development, with some in the early stages of trials. These therapies are investigating various mechanisms of action, ranging from engaging the immune system through bispecific antibodies to utilizing gene-modified T-cells to specifically target and eliminate DLL3-expressing tumors. Furthermore, companies, such as Abdera Therapeutics, are exploring the potential of radiopharmaceuticals that target DLL3, introducing an additional layer of innovation within the field.\n\nThe growing interest in therapies targeting DLL3 is evidenced by the growing number of both preclinical and clinical studies, with an increasing array of treatments being developed. As these therapies progress, the market is anticipated to experience significant growth, with forecasts suggesting a considerable increase in the number of approved therapies and the overall global market value for DLL3-targeted treatments in the near future. These therapies offer a more personalized and precise treatment strategy for aggressive cancers such as SCLC, which has historically been linked to poor outcomes and restricted treatment alternatives, thereby establishing DLL3-targeted therapies as a significant advancement in the field of oncology.\n\nLooking ahead, the market for DLL3-targeted therapies is expected to broaden beyond SCLC, with ongoing research investigating the role of DLL3 in other malignancies, including breast cancer, skin cancer, and glioma. This expansion of therapeutic applications for DLL3-targeted treatments is likely to enhance market potential, as the adaptability of DLL3 as a target may facilitate innovative strategies for addressing a variety of cancers. As the domain of DLL3-targeted therapies continues to develop, it holds the promise of transforming treatment approaches for numerous cancers, providing renewed hope for patients who have previously faced limited treatment options.",

            "content": "Rory McIlroy has won the 2024 Seve Ballesteros Award after being voted Player of the Year by his peers on the DP World Tour for the fourth occasion.\n\nThe Player of the Year Award, named after the late, great Ballesteros, incorporates the former Golfer of the Year Award after the two accolades were combined in 2021 to become a single honour voted for by the DP World Tour\u2019s members.\n\nThis accolade is one of several of the 35-year-old\u2019s history-making achievements, having recently claimed his sixth Harry Vardon Trophy with his fourth worldwide victory in 2024 at the season-ending DP World Tour Championship, adding to his Hero Dubai Desert Classic, Zurich Classic of New Orleans, and Wells Fargo Championship successes.\n\nMcIlroy was in imperious form on the 2024 Race to Dubai, recording seven top-five finishes in addition to his two wins in Dubai, as he equalled Ballesteros on six season-long rankings victories.\n\nThe Northern Irishman was presented with the trophy by one of Seve\u2019s sons, Javier, who travelled to Dubai ahead of this week\u2019s Hero Dubai Desert Classic, won by his father more than 30 years ago, and by McIlroy on four occasions in 2009, 2015, 2023, and 2024.\n\nMcIlroy earned 46% of the votes cast by his fellow DP World Tour members, with Amgen Irish Open champion Rasmus H\u00f8jgaard taking second place and Thriston Lawrence third. The four-time Major Champion was also voted Player of the Year in 2012, 2014, and 2015.\n\nWorld Number Three McIlroy started the 2024 DP World Tour season with a record-breaking fourth Hero Dubai Desert Classic win as he successfully defended his title on a dramatic afternoon at Emirates Golf Club. McIlroy came into the weekend ten shots back before a stunning third-round 63 put him into the final group on Sunday, where he went on to claim a famous victory in the desert. He finished second at the U.S. Open in May, then recorded top-five finishes in the next three Rolex Series events: the Genesis Scottish Open, BMW PGA Championship, and Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship. He also finished second at the Amgen Irish Open at Royal County Down, before claiming his third DP World Tour Championship win and 18th DP World Tour title. \u201cThe Seve Ballesteros Award is special, as well, because it\u2019s voted on by your peers,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cThey are the ones that have been out there on the course with you week-in, week-out, playing the same golf courses, competing. \u201cSo to get their vote is very meaningful. I said to Javier, the legacy that his dad left on not just European golf but global golf will live on forever. Our whole motivation that we rally around on the Ryder Cup team is Seve, and we feel like we have an advantage because of that.\u201d",

(January 13, 2025) \u2013 The first group of apprentices has officially signed on with Amgen in a unique program that will prepare a skilled workforce for the biopharmaceutical leader's planned expansion in Wake County.\n\nAmgen announced last month that it plans to invest $1 billion to expand its manufacturing facility in Holly Springs. Wake Tech held an athletics-style signing ceremony Monday to kick off the training program, complete with fanfare and cheers.\n\n\"There are a couple of reasons why this workforce development program is so unique,\" said Dr. Scott Ralls, president of Wake Tech. \"First, it is an extremely comprehensive and rigorous program providing the participants an opportunity to gain a unique depth and breadth of biotechnology skill sets. Secondly, as an apprenticeship program, the participants are being paid while in training and will receive a pay increase once they successfully complete the program.\"\n\nEach of the 12 apprentices has already completed the BioWork certificate program at a North Carolina community college and has been certified as a bioprocess technician:\n\nAmit Pal Singh\n\nArmani Evans\n\nChristian Stokes\n\nDeclan Beaty\n\nElijah Oquendo\n\nJan Luther McDonald\n\nJaQwan Barkley\n\nKadeja White\n\nMajayla Copeland\n\nOwen Tomaszewski\n\nPrabha Vijayakuma\n\nTilly Scriven\n\nThe apprentices will take degree courses at Wake Tech's Southern Wake Campus for the next six months to strengthen their knowledge in bioprocess practices and measurements, cGMP quality systems, industry reporting and validation. They will earn certificates in BioQuality and BioManufacturing and will have completed about a year's worth of college credit toward an associate degree.\n\n\"These students will be learning at the best community college in the state,\" said Wake County Commissioner Shinica Thomas. \"No one has a stronger commitment to building Wake County's talent pipeline than Wake Tech.\"\n\nThe apprentices will receive additional industry training in upstream processing, downstream processing and batch processing through the BioNetwork Capstone Center and will receive customized training in skills such as team building, financial literacy and Microsoft applications. After six months, they will transition to full-time on-the-job training as manufacturing associates at Amgen, and a new cohort of apprentices will begin at Wake Tech. Apprentices are paid a salary starting on Day One.\n\n\"This is the most comprehensive learn-and-earn training model I have ever seen,\" said Ralls.\n\n\"I want to say congratulations to the apprentices,\" said Paul Lewus, Amgen's North Carolina site head. \"I think you've made fantastic decision to join Amgen, and this is just the beginning. We'll be adding more and more apprentices in the years to come.\"\n\nAmgen's partnership with Wake Tech dates back three years, with the company utilizing office space and other resources at the college as it ramped up operations in Holly Springs. Amgen also sponsors a \"co-laboratory\" at Wake Tech's RTP Campus in Morrisville, a unique space where technologists and industry professionals collaborate on ideas, new technology and industry trends.\n\n\"Amgen has quickly emerged as one of Wake Tech's best partners,\" said Ralls.\n\nAmgen's expansion will be adjacent to its existing facility on the northwest side of Holly Springs, south of U.S. Highway 1. This project brings the total site investment to more than $1.5 billion, with employment projected to reach 725 by 2032. It will enable Amgen to increase capacity and meet current and forecasted demand for life-saving medications across the globe.\n\nMeanwhile, Wake Tech continues to expand its apprenticeship program, supported by Wake County's WakeWorks\u00ae initiative. The college currently has nearly 500 apprentices working at 150 companies across the Triangle. In 2024, the U.S. Department of Labor recognized Wake Tech as an \"Apprenticeship Ambassador\" for the college's work to provide apprenticeship opportunities.

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For any hopes the dealmaking that started the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference would give the overall biotechnology sector a running start to 2025, Eli Lilly deflated them Tuesday.\n\nThe company, which rose to new heights on the success of its medicines for weight loss and diabetes, revealed revenue numbers that for the second time in a row fell short of investor expectations. Lilly shares fell 7% and dragged with them the stocks of several other obesity drug developers. A biotech stock index slid by almost 3%.\n\nAmgen is one of those would-be competitors and, at the JPM meeting, executives defended recent trial results for the company\u2019s rival weight loss drug. Read on for details on that and other highlights from the conference:\n\nAmgen\u2019s MariTide defense\n\nAmgen\u2019s market value rose and fell by billions of dollars last year on the promise of an obesity drug called MariTide. The drug, which is meant to act quicker and be dosed less frequently than existing medicines, dominated earnings call discussions.\n\nBut summary results from a Phase 2 trial failed to convince Wall Street that MariTide is clearly better than other drugs, leading analysts to question not only MariTide\u2019s potential, but the optimistic picture Amgen leaders had painted before disclosing data.\n\nAt a discussion with reporters Tuesday, a group of Amgen executives defended MariTide\u2019s profile as well as the way in which the company presented results. \u201cWe don\u2019t hype data. This is a differentiated medicine,\u201d said Peter Griffith, Amgen\u2019s chief financial officer.\n\nGriffith attributed some of the especially large share price decline that hit Amgen afterwards to trading behavior amplifying the stock\u2019s initial drop. He also pointed to data suggesting MariTide resulted in comparable weight loss to existing medicines at an earlier time point, and may be able to be administered once per month or less.\n\n\u201cHow many of our peers in this industry have been searching for something once a month in Type 2 diabetes?\u201d Griffith said.\n\nWhile investors may stay skeptical, Amgen is advancing. It\u2019s initiating late-stage studies in obesity, heart failure, sleep disorders and kidney disease, aiming to better negotiate with insurers, said Susan Sweeney, Amgen\u2019s head for obesity and related conditions.\n\n\u201cI think MariTide will differentiate itself not only on the profile \u2014 that we are a different product than the weeklies, which seem to be more similar to each other than not \u2014 but also in the investment that we're putting behind it,\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nA lot of eyes will be on the full Phase 2 study results coming this year. Executives confirmed they\u2019ll be presented at a medical meeting \u2014 they didn\u2019t say which \u2014 and will include findings from a different dose escalation scheme it\u2019s working on as well. \u2014 Ben Fidler\n\nMerck\u2019s patent \u201chill\u201d\n\nKeytruda likely earned Merck & Co. something close to $29 billion last year. The dominant cancer immunotherapy, which accounts for a little less than half of Merck\u2019s sales, is patent protected in the U.S. until 2028.\n\nBut to hear Merck CEO Rob Davis tell it, the looming expiration of Keytruda\u2019s patent protection will be more of \u201ca hill, not a cliff.\u201d\n\nIn a presentation Monday afternoon, Davis said Merck was planning to offset Keytruda\u2019s loss of exclusivity by moving up plans to file for approval and launch a subcutaneous version of Keytruda by the end of 2025.\n\n\u201cWe expect to be able to see adoption of about 30% to 40% of all Keytruda [patients] into subcutaneous pembrolizumab,\u201d Davis said. He expects many of these conversions will come from people taking Keytruda on its own, or in combination with oral drugs.\n\n\"We're going to price to drive the adoption, so you should assume that and the price will evolve over time,\u201d Davis said.\n\nExecutives at Bristol Myers Squibb, which is pursuing a similar subcutaneous strategy for its competing immunotherapy Opdivo, expect a similar rate of conversion to their subcutaneous product, which won U.S. approval last month.\n\nMerck also hopes to close the future gap from loss of Keytruda sales with its pipeline of antibody-drug conjugates, sales of its Gardasil vaccine in China and the possible introduction of an oral weight loss therapy.\n\n\u201cI feel very confident that we have derisked that outcome,\u201d Davis said. \u2014 Gwendolyn Wu\n\nDual-track dealmaking\n\nGSK\u2019s buyout of IDRx and Eli Lilly\u2019s deal for Scorpion Therapeutics \u2014 both announced Monday \u2014 fit what\u2019s been a trend the past year: privately held companies opting for a deal over an initial public offering.\n\nAccording to Alexis Borisy, a venture capitalist at Curie.Bio, founder of IDRx and a board observer at Scorpion Therapeutics, both companies had confidentially filed paperwork outlining plans to go public. Neither got to the point of sharing those plans more widely, as both were running a \u201cdual M&A/IPO process,\u201d he said, and ultimately chose to sell.\n\nTo Borisy, these deals highlight the tough decisions facing IPO-ready startups. IDRx could\u2019ve gone public, since it has a promising drug in early testing for gastrointestinal cancer, he said. But it likely would not have gotten much higher of a valuation than it received in an August funding round. The company would\u2019ve had to sell about one-third of its shares to raise a couple hundred million dollars in an IPO, and risk its market value eroding after, he said.\n\nInstead, GSK offered $1 billion upfront for the whole company \u2014 compelling enough for investors to earn returns, as well as for IDRx founders and employees to do well. IDRx\u2019s drug will now move forward with a company that can easily fund future development. (Scorpion\u2019s lead drug, meanwhile, was acquired by Eli Lilly for a slightly larger upfront sum.)\n\nThose calculations are \u201ca direct factor of the market at the moment,\u201d Borisy said. \u201cBoth IDRx and Scorpion are companies that, if [this were] a booming public market, maybe would become public.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut in a \u2018meh,\u2019 market,\u201d he added, \u201cif somebody puts an attractive bid in, investors hit that bid.\u201d \u2014 Ben Fidler\n\nViking looks long term\n\nViking Therapeutics, a developer of drugs for obesity, aims to compete in a market now dominated by big pharma. As such, analysts have thought it likely the company may look to license its drug or sell entirely.\n\nCompany CEO Brian Lian isn\u2019t about to say who he\u2019s talking with, but in a presentation Monday he did outline what characteristics would make for an ideal partner.\n\n\u201cGiven the size of the obesity market, you would want a partner that has some experience in these large metabolic indications, you know, like a lipid background, or experience with diabetes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would prefer a global partnership. That would be probably the best.\u201d\n\nOn-market competitors like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have struggled to deliver enough of their obesity drugs to meet demand. On Monday, Lian sought to assure investors Viking is planning ahead on manufacturing. He said the company has enough supply of the subcutaneous formulation of its lead product, VK2735, to complete Phase 3 testing, and enough of the oral formulation to get through Phase 2.\n\n\u201cWe've been working really hard to reach a long-term supply agreement that hopefully would include fill and finish for [subcutaneous] and tablet [formulations],\u201d he said. \u201cWe're making a lot of progress. It's too early to make any announcements, but I think we should be in a position in the reasonably near term to update what our supply picture looks like.\u201d \u2014 Jonathan Gardner",

Image credit: Shutterstock / Michael Vi.\n\nAmgen has reported that its once-monthly dosing regimen and manufacturing capabilities will be key to entering the obesity market.\n\nPresenting at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference 2025 on 13 January, Amgen\u2019s CEO Robert Bradway asked potential investors not to think of MariTide (maridebart cafraglutide) as the third main weight loss candidate on the market.\n\n\u201cI hope we will be the world\u2019s first long-acting therapy in the treatment of obesity and obesity-related conditions. It\u2019s been an objective of the field for many years, to have a long-acting treatment option for type 2 diabetics (T2D),\u201d Bradway explains.\n\n\u201cWe feel the prospect of being able to offer patients a monthly or less frequent alternative is going to be very attractive in patients with T2D, in patients with obesity and overweight and in patients with various other diseases that we intend to study in the Phase III clinical programme for this medicine.\u201d\n\nFollowing the JP Morgan presentation, Amgen\u2019s stock saw a slight increase of 3.03%, from a market close of $262.23 on 10 January to a market close of $270.19 on 13 January. The California-based biopharma has a market cap of $145.42bn.\n\nIn November 2024, Amgen presented Phase II data from its obesity candidate MariTide, a bispecific glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) antagonist. If approved, it could boast a once-monthly dosing regimen, which is far more attractive than the once-weekly dosing of its main rivals Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy and Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound.\n\nThe Phase II trial (NCT05669599) investigated the candidate in patients living with obesity or overweight without T2D where MariTide demonstrated up to 20% average weight loss at week 52 without a weight loss plateau.\n\nThe trial also investigated the drug in patients with obesity or overweight and T2D, who typically lose less weight on GLP-1 therapies, achieved up to 17% average weight loss, also without a weight loss plateau, and lowered their average haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) by up to 2.2 percentage points at week 52.\n\nDespite what Amgen said was \u201cpositive data\u201d, shareholders were less convinced, and shares dropped by 4.8% after the data was released.\n\nBefore the Phase II data was announced, the company suffered another share drop after concerns related to bone mineral density (BMD) loss with MariTide were raised by an analyst prompting a $12bn market wipe. Amgen attempted to put investors\u2019 minds at ease, claiming that the company has not seen an association between the administration of MariTide and BMD changes. In the Phase II data update, the company reiterated it did not have any BMD concerns.\n\nThe company has announced Phase III trials of MariTide which it hopes to launch in H1 and H2 2025.\n\nAnother key improvement needed in the weight loss space is an expansion of manufacturing capabilities after both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have struggled to keep up with the rising demand for these therapies. Last month, Amgen said it would invest $1.02bn to expand the manufacturing capability of its facility in Holly Springs, North Carolina.\n\nBradway added: \u201cThis is a field that has been challenged by supply, and supply is something that Amgen has demonstrated an ability to maintain across our portfolio and is something that we feel we are ready to do in obesity as well.\u201d\n\nThe biopharma CEO also discussed other candidates in Amgen\u2019s pipeline including Olpasiren and Blinctyro (blinatumomab).\n\nOlpasiren is a small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy which acts by reducing lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) levels and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in patients to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. The therapy is in Phase III studies.\n\nBlinctyro is a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD19 antigen present in B cells. It is approved in Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The therapy is advancing in other therapy areas after Amgen revealed promising initial data in refractory rheumatoid arthritis. The therapy is in a Phase II study in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\nThe California-based company, best known for biosimilars, is running Phase III trials of biosimilars of Keytruda, Opdivo and Ocrevus. Amgen\u2019s biosimilars have generated $10bn of cumulative sales.\n\nBefore the 13 January presentation at JP Morgan 2025, Amgen pledged $10m in aid to Los Angeles following the devastating wildfires that have wiped out 40,000 acres of land and killed at least 24.\n\nElsewhere at the healthcare conference, NVIDIA partnered with IQVIA, Illumina and Mayo Clinic, and GSK announced a $1.15bn deal to acquire IDRx.",

These are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on value, growth, and/or momentum characteristics.\n\nIs This 1 Momentum Stock a Screaming Buy Right Now?\n\nFor momentum investors, upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook take precedent, so they'll want to zero in on the Momentum Style Score. This Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.\n\nAmgen (AMGN)\n\nThousand Oaks, CA-based Amgen is one of the biggest biotech companies in the world, with a strong presence in the oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, neuroscience, inflammation, bone health and nephrology and neuroscience markets. The company used advances in cellular and molecular biology to develop two of the biotech industry\u2019s earliest and most successful drugs, Epogen (anemia) and Neupogen (white blood cell stimulant). Amgen successfully launched two next-generation products, Aranesp and Neulasta. Meanwhile, the acquisition of Immunex Corporation gave Amgen access to the multi-blockbuster drug, Enbrel. However, all these older drugs are facing declining sales due to biosimilar or branded competition, which is being somewhat offset by its blockbuster growth drugs like Prolia and Xgeva. Other products are Repatha, Blincyto, Vectibix, Nplate, Kyprolis, Evenity, Otezla, Aimovig, Lumakras/Lumykras, Tezspire, Imdelltra, Tavneos and Kanjinti, Mvasi and Amgevita biosimilars.\n\nAMGN is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, with a Momentum Style Score of B and VGM Score of B. Shares are up 4.5% over the past one week and up 1.4% over the past four weeks. AMGN has lost 11.9% in the last one-year period as well. Looking at trading volume, an average of 3,114,364 shares exchanged hands over the last 20 trading days.\n\nA company's earnings performance is important for momentum investors as well. For fiscal 2024, three analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for AMGN, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.06 to $19.57 per share. AMGN also boasts an average earnings surprise of 4.1%.\n\nAMGN should be on investors' short list because of its impressive earnings fundamentals, a good Zacks Rank, and strong Momentum and VGM Style Scores.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "Amgen (AMGN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this world's largest biotech drugmaker have returned +1.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, which Amgen falls in, has lost 3.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Amgen is expected to post earnings of $5.02 per share, indicating a change of +6.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.57 points to a change of +4.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.36 indicates a change of +4.1% from what Amgen is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amgen is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "FDA and EMA both approve biosimilar versions of Stelara\u00ae (ustekinumab), Eylea\u00ae (aflibercept) and Prolia\u00ae and Xgeva\u00ae (denosumab).\n\nFDA approves 19 biosimilars in 2024.\n\nBiosimilars, once a niche segment in the pharmaceutical industry, are now making a significant impact on global healthcare. These products are highly similar to an already-approved reference product, offering a more affordable treatment option without compromising on safety or efficacy. As biosimilars gain traction worldwide, regulatory bodies like the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) play a critical role in shaping their market introduction. While both agencies share similar goals of ensuring patient safety and promoting access to high-quality therapeutics, their regulatory pathways and approval trends show notable differences.\n\nOne such difference is that the EMA has historically been quicker than the FDA in approving biosimilars. Since 2005, the biosimilar regulatory framework in Europe has been implemented through the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) under the EMA. The CHMP provides initial assessments for marketing authorization of new medicines that are ultimately approved centrally by the EMA. Since Sandoz\u2019s somatotropin biosimilar, Omnitrope\u00ae, was first authorized on April 12, 2006, an additional 112 applications have been approved in Europe. Sixteen of the authorizations have been withdrawn post-approval (Table 1). On average, the EMA takes about 1-2 years from submission of a biosimilar application to approval.\n\nIn contrast, the FDA\u2019s biosimilar approval process has been relatively slow, with initial approval times averaging 3-4 years for the first generation of biosimilars. This delay in approval is partly due to the FDA\u2019s more rigorous evaluation of biosimilars and the additional data required to achieve interchangeability designation. Additionally, the U.S. did not implement a regulatory framework for biosimilar evaluation until after enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009. As the EMA had already approved over a dozen biosimilars by this time, Europe had a significant head start on both the number of approved biosimilars and the regulatory process for approving more. Sandoz\u2019s filgrastim biosimilar, Zarxio\u00ae, received the first U.S. approval in 2015, whereas nine filgrastim biosimilars have been approved in Europe dating back to multiple authorizations in 2008. Despite the FDA\u2019s relatively slower biosimilar approval pace, the U.S. biosimilar market has managed to grow continuously over the past decade. Subsequent to Zarxio\u00ae\u2019s approval, 63 other biosimilar drugs have gained U.S. approval to date including 14 interchangeable products (Table 2).\n\nAs illustrated in the following graph, while the EU\u2019s significant head start and higher approval rate led to an imbalance in the number of biosimilar drugs available in the respective markets, the FDA has increased the rate of approval in recent years. In 2024 alone, the FDA approved 19 biosimilars, the most approvals in a single year by either regulatory body to date.\n\nDespite the high number of approvals in 2024, launches of several FDA-approved biosimilars, such as aflibercept and ustekinumab, are delayed due to patent litigations or settlements between parties. Additionally, there are often regulatory hurdles and costs faced by biosimilar applicants that deter or delay biosimilar products from reaching the U.S. market.\n\nLooking forward, there are currently 38 biosimilar applications under review by the EMA for marketing authorization (Table 3). As an increasing number of patents expire on blockbuster biologic drugs, the number of abbreviated biologics license applications is also increasing. Biosimilars for more than 31 different original biologics are currently navigating biosimilar pathways or are in late stage development in the U.S. (Table 4).\n\nTable 1.

            "content": "Amgen's AMGN short percent of float has fallen 3.26% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 11.17 million shares sold short, which is 2.08% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 2.8 days to cover their short positions on average.\n\nWhy Short Interest Matters\n\nShort interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.\n\nShort interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.\n\nSee Also: List of the most shorted stocks\n\nAmgen Short Interest Graph (3 Months)\n\nAs you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Amgen has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.\n\nComparing Amgen's Short Interest Against Its Peers\n\nPeer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro, Amgen's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 5.31%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.\n\nDid you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock?

            "content": "High-yield dividend stocks may not appeal to some investors. However, if you're among those investors looking for income, stocks that pay dividends regularly can be great additions to your portfolio.\n\nThree Motley Fool contributors have identified some especially great high-yield dividend stocks to buy in 2025 -- and all of them are big pharma stocks. Here's why they chose AbbVie (ABBV 0.60%), Amgen (AMGN 1.70%), and Pfizer (PFE 1.54%).\n\nA Dividend King with solid growth prospects\n\nKeith Speights (AbbVie): Income investors should like AbbVie's forward dividend yield of 3.68%. However, they should absolutely love the big drugmaker's dividend track record. AbbVie has increased its dividend for 52 years, putting it in the elite group of stocks known as Dividend Kings.\n\nFor years, the big story for AbbVie focused on its blockbuster autoimmune disease drug, Humira. Now, though, Humira's sales are falling as it faces biosimilar competition. The good news is that AbbVie has prepared well for this scenario.\n\nSales for the company's two successors to Humira -- Rinvoq and Skyrizi -- continue to soar. Other drugs in AbbVie's lineup, including Botox, migraine therapies Qulipta and Ubrelvy, cancer drug Venclexta, and antipsychotic medication Vrayalar, are also delivering strong sales growth. The company picked up several of these products through smart acquisitions.\n\nAbbVie's pipeline features over 90 programs in clinical development. More than 50 of them are in either mid- or late-stage testing. A whopping 80% are compounds with a novel mechanism of action, which could bode well for their competitive positions if they eventually win regulatory approvals.\n\nI expect AbbVie to continue delivering solid growth throughout the second half of the decade and into the 2030s. Its stock is also reasonably priced relative to these growth prospects, with a forward earnings multiple of 15.\n\nMultiple reasons to buy the dip\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny (Amgen): The market had high hopes for Amgen's investigational weight loss medicine, MariTide. That's why the company's shares dropped off a cliff after it announced positive -- but not positive enough -- phase 2 data for this product. The biotech's shares haven't recovered yet, but this setback does provide an entry point for patient investors.\n\nAmgen is still worth investing in for many reasons. For one, MariTide could still go on to be a respectable weight loss drug, and Amgen is working on at least one other obesity candidate. The company's efforts in this fast-growing area are just getting underway.\n\nSecond, Amgen has other products that could be growth drivers for years to come. That includes asthma therapy Tezspire, the rights of which it shares with AstraZeneca, and thyroid eye disease medicine Tepezza, among others.\n\nThird, Amgen's pipeline still looks attractive. One area behind weight loss that the company is targeting is the biosimilar market. It recently earned a legal win that allows it to launch a biosimilar version of Regeneron's blockbuster medicine Eylea for wet age-related macular degeneration while the two drugmakers continue to fight a patent battle in the courtroom.\n\nAmgen's biosimilar ambition is targeting several more important brands, including Bristol Myers Squibb's cancer drug Opdivo. Amgen has many other candidates across multiple therapeutic areas.\n\nLast but not least, the company is an excellent dividend pick. Amgen's forward yield currently tops 3.6%, compared to the S&P 500's average of 1.27%. Amgen has increased its payouts by 201.3% in the past decade. The company is an excellent high-yield stock, especially while its shares remain down.\n\nPfizer's dividend is safer than it looks\n\nDavid Jagielski (Pfizer): A high-yielding stock that could make for a steal of a deal this year is Pfizer. The stock hasn't gotten much traction with investors recently, falling 8% last year as its results failed to drum up much bullishness.\n\nBut buying the stock while investor sentiment is low could be an advantageous position to take. That's because Pfizer's business is still doing well, and its 6.5%-yielding dividend isn't in imminent danger. The company is focusing on trimming costs and improving its margins to help grow its profits. For 2025, it expects its adjusted diluted earnings per share to increase slightly to a range of $2.85 to $3.00 (it expects between $2.75 to $2.95 for 2024).\n\nThe company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.43 ($1.72 over the course of a full year), and in its most recent earnings report (for the quarter ended Sept. 29, 2024), its earnings per share topped $0.78. There has been a lot of noise on Pfizer's earnings results in the past year due to the volatility involving COVID-19 revenue, which pushed its payout ratio above 100%.\n\nHowever, as things normalize, investors will see the dividend is quite safe. Last year, CEO Albert Bourla referred to the dividend as a \"sacred cow,\" emphasizing just how important the payout is, not just shareholders, but also for management.\n\nIt may be a tough road ahead for Pfizer as it endeavours to find new avenues to grow its business, but with a growing pipeline and the acquisition of Seagen in 2023, there's plenty of reason to remain bullish on the stock in the long run. For dividend investors, now may be as good a time as any to add Pfizer to your portfolio.",

After adding only 11 new cases in November, just 9 new cases were added in the month of December. There are now 200 pending cases in the MDL.\n\nDecember 30, 2024: A hearing for selection of bellwether test case selection has been set for January 28, 2025 in the Tepezza MDL. A group of 12 bellwether \u201cdiscovery cases\u201d were previously selected back in June, with 4 cases selected by each side and another 4 cases randomly selected by the court. Now 3 of these cases will be selected for the first round of actual bellwether test trials. Once selected, the 3 cases will go through a more intensive, case-specific discovery phase to prep the cases for trial.\n\nDecember 2, 2024: The Tepezza hearing loss MDL saw a notable surge in November, with 11 new cases added\u2014a 450% increase from October\u2019s total of just two cases. Our take on these cases, especially given the still very low volume of claims, is that settlement will not take as long as it might in other MDLs. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are very strong, and it will not break the bank to settle what is a relatively small number of claims for a mass tort.\n\nNovember 13, 2024: The court addressed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion we discussed in our last update and we got a good ruling. The court found the defense counsel\u2019s objections were obstructive and unnecessary. The court noted that the defendant\u2019s repeated objections over document foundations were largely misplaced, as documents produced during discovery imply authentication. It also found that another defense attorney could have used a \u201crunning objection\u201d rather than repeatedly objecting.\n\nNone of this really matters but it is good for the judge to get an idea of who the good guys and the bad guys are in the litigation.\n\nNovember 4, 2024: In mass tort cases, defense lawyers are expected to limit their objections in depositions to issues of form and foundation. But they cannot help themselves. The temptation to influence the witness\u2019s testimony, subtly or otherwise, lead to speaking objections, witness coaching, or repetitive interruptions.\n\nDuring a recent deposition of Horizon\u2019s Director of Regulatory Affairs, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel alleges that defense attorneys repeatedly crossed the line with speaking objections and witness coaching. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys observed that each time they tried to question the witness about key regulatory documents, Horizon\u2019s counsel interjected with extended objections, calling into question whether the documents were relevant or if the witness was even familiar with them. At one point, before plaintiffs\u2019 counsel could complete a question, defense counsel interrupted to state that the documents at hand were only \u201cdraft exchanges\u201d not directly connected to defense lawyer. This line of objection, plaintiffs argue, was clearly aimed at shaping the witness\u2019s answers by pre-emptively suggesting that her knowledge of the documents was limited. When plaintiffs\u2019 counsel tried to proceed, defense counsel maintained a constant flow of \u201cfoundation\u201d objections, arguing the documents had not been properly authenticated or confirmed. Of course, this is nonsense. If the witness held a central role in Horizon\u2019s regulatory affairs during Tepezza\u2019s FDA approval process, she should have insight into these documents. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have filed a motion in an effort to make sure this does not continue to happen.\n\nNovember 1, 2024: The Tepezza MDL continues to experience gradual growth, with only two new cases added in October, bringing the total to 180 pending cases.\n\nThis slow increase underscores the slow pace at which plaintiffs are joining the litigation. There are many more victims out there. But despite steady efforts from plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys to build awareness, the MDL\u2019s modest growth tells us the message has not gotten through. This litigation probably will not grow all that much.\n\nAs we discuss below, we think there is more upside than downside for existing plaintiffs with the litigation so small in terms of how quickly the litigation progresses and the settlement amounts victims will ultimately receive.\n\nOctober 29, 2024: Taking advantage of a now-fixed Michigan law, Horizon was able to dismiss one of the 12 bellwether cases in the MDL. Judge Durkin ruled that Michigan law applied to the plaintiff\u2019s claim since she took the drug and experienced alleged side effects in Michigan, despite the suit being filed in Illinois where Horizon is based.\n\nHorizon relied on a now-repealed Michigan law that barred product liability claims against FDA-approved drugs. The law has since been fixed but it is not retroactive.\n\nOctober 18, 2024: In a newly filed lawsuit, an Oklahoma resident has taken legal action against Horizon Therapeutics claiming that Tepezz caused irreversible hearing damage. The plaintiff, who was treated for thyroid eye disease between November 2022 and February 2023, asserts that Horizon failed to provide adequate warnings about the risk of permanent hearing loss, despite evidence of the drug\u2019s potential side effects.\n\nThis appears to be a strong case. The lawsuit highlights that Horizon only updated the Tepezza label to include a warning about severe hearing impairment in July 2023\u2014not long after the plaintiff had already undergone several infusions. It further alleges that Horizon was aware of reports and clinical studies indicating the risk of hearing-related issues well before the warning change.\n\nThe plaintiff argues that Horizon\u2019s failure to act on this information earlier directly resulted in significant harm and seeks both compensatory and punitive damages for the company\u2019s alleged negligence in addressing known risks.\n\nOctober 1, 2024: Only five new cases were added to the Tepezza hearing loss class action MDL during September. There are now 178 pending cases in the MDL. Again, this is not going to be a huge MDL, but our lawyers think these lawsuits have high settlement values.\n\nSeptember 17, 2024: A Florida woman has filed a new lawsuit against Horizon Therapeutics USA, Inc., alleging that the company\u2019s drug, Tepezza, caused her permanent hearing loss. The plaintiff received Tepezza infusions from October 2020 to June 2021 to treat thyroid eye disease.\n\nShe claims that Horizon Therapeutics failed to provide adequate warnings about the risks of hearing damage, despite numerous reports and studies linking the drug to permanent hearing impairment and tinnitus. The lawsuit highlights that the Tepezza label did not include warnings about these risks until July 2023, several years after her treatment began.\n\nThe plaintiff seeks damages for the injuries she suffered as a result of the company\u2019s alleged failure to properly inform patients and healthcare providers about the potential side effects of Tepezza.\n\nHorizon Therapeutics, which as we discuss below was acquired by Amgen Inc. in 2023, is accused of failing to conduct adequate safety studies and delaying necessary label changes that would have warned of these severe risks. The plaintiff is requesting compensatory and punitive damages for her injuries.\n\nSeptember 3, 2024: In August, 33 new cases were added to the Tepezza hearing loss MDL. That is significantly higher than the normal volume of new cases that we have seen so far in the MDL. There are now 173 total cases pending.\n\nAugust 27, 2024: The next status conference in the MDL has been set for September 5, 2024. Earlier this summer the defense filed a motion to dismiss one of the bellwether discovery cases for failure to state a claim. Oral arguments on that motion have been set for October 16, 2024, although the outcome of that will only impact 1 specific case. Otherwise August has been a very slow month in the Tepezza MDL.\n\nAugust 18, 2024: The parties have successfully negotiated an agreement regarding the number and scheduling of depositions. According to the Joint Status Report, they have settled on the total number of depositions and divided them into two phases: those to be completed before February 14, 2025, and those to be conducted between this date and April 10, 2025. Additionally, they have reached consensus on various aspects of the deposition process.\n\nOur take continues to be these cases will likely settle much quicker than you usually see in an MDL and long before the first bellwether trial in 2026.\n\nAugust 1, 2024: Growth in the Tepezza MDL continues to be slow. Only 10 new cases were added to the MDL in July, bringing the total number of pending cases up to 148.\n\nI\u2019m surprised at how few Tepezza leads we get in 2024, honestly. There are more victims out there on the sidelines. If you have a case, you should call a Tepezza lawyer \u2013 preferably us \u2013 sooner rather than later.\n\nJuly 30, 2024: Horizon filed a motion to dismiss that will surely fail. Meanwhile, lawyers for both sides in the Tepezza MDL were scheduled to meet and work out issues regarding the scope and number of corporate and expert witness depositions that would be permitted. The defendants are seeking to limit the number of corporate depositions while the plaintiffs are pushing for as many as possible. The parties are supposed to report back to the MDL judge sometime this week.\n\nJuly 18, 2024: There will be a Tepezza settlement mediation this month. It is hard to be optimistic these settlement talks will yield a resolution but hopefully some progress can be made.\n\nJuly 14, 2024: There is good news and bad news in the Tepezza litigation. The good news the court has set bellwether trial dates:\n\nBellwether Date First Bellwether Plaintiff Trial (3-4 weeks) March 9, 2026 Second Bellwether Plaintiff Trial (3-4 weeks) May 4, 2026 Third Bellwether Plaintiff Trial (3-4 weeks) June 29, 2026 Fourth Bellwether Plaintiff Trial (3-4 weeks) August 24, 2026\n\nThe bad news is obvious \u2013 the first trial is still 20 months away. There is talk of an early Tepezza settlement long before we get to 2026. It is rare have an MDL settlement until a trial date gets closer. But the small size of this litigation makes an early settlement possible.\n\nJuly 1, 2024: The Tepezza MDL continues to grow at a steady rate. Nineteen new lawsuits were added last month. One of those lawsuits, filed last Thursday, was on behalf of a plaintiff from Arvada, Colorado who received three infusions of Tepezza from May 20, 2022, to June 30, 2022, and claims that the drug led to severe and potentially permanent hearing loss.\n\nThe plaintiff argues that the manufacturer of Tepezza was aware or should have been aware of the risks associated with the drug. Scientific studies, patient reports, and post-marketing data have indicated that Tepezza can cause significant hearing impairments. Despite this knowledge, the defendant allegedly failed to provide adequate warnings or instructions about the need for audiologic monitoring before, during, and after treatment. It wasn\u2019t until July 17, 2023, that the drug\u2019s label was updated to include warnings about the risk of severe hearing impairments and the necessity of hearing assessments.\n\nJune 5, 2024: The first bellwether trial for the Tepezza MDL is set for March 9, 2026. Following this, three additional trials are scheduled, with the second starting on May 4, 2026, the third on June 29 of the same year, and the fourth slated to begin on August 24, 2026.\n\nIs that a long time from now? It is. Unfortunately, this is how mass torts work. I do think there will be a Tepezza settlement before one of these lawsuits goes to trial. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers really like these cases, and there is not the volume of cases we thought we would see when this whole thing got started. That will make settlement much easier for Horizon.\n\nJune 3, 2024: More slow growth in the Tepezza hearing loss class action MDL. Just 7 new cases were added to the MDL over the last month, which is even less than what we saw in April. There are now 120 total cases in the MDL.\n\nJune 2, 2024: Horizon has picked four women as its bellwether selections.\n\nMay 20, 2024: The judge in the Tepezza hearing loss MDL recently set a date of March 9, 2026, for the first bellwether trial to begin. Judge Durkin has instructed both sides to collaborate and submit a proposed schedule for how discovery and bellwether case selection should proceed leading up to the bellwether trial.\n\nMay 1, 2024: We continue to see very slow growth in the Tepezza hearing loss litigation. Only 13 new cases were added to the Tepezza hearing loss MDL over the month of April. There are now just 113 total cases pending in the MDL.\n\nApril 13, 2024: The status hearing originally scheduled for April 22, 2024, before the magistrate judge, has been canceled. The joint status report, previously due on April 18, 2024, is now required to be submitted by April 24, 2024.\n\nAdditionally, an in-person status hearing before the Honorable Thomas M. Durkin is scheduled for May 1, 2024, at 1:30 p.m.\n\nApril 9, 2024: In a new Tepezza lawsuit, a Florida man alleges he sustained severe injuries due to the infusions of Tepezza.\n\nDiagnosed with eye disease, the man underwent a series of Tepezza infusions from February 25, 2022, to July 29, 2022 in Ohio. Throughout the treatment period, neither he nor his doctors were warned or had any knowledge of Tepezza\u2019s serious risk of causing permanent hearing loss and/or tinnitus. It was not until July 2023 that information about Tepezza\u2019s potential to cause permanent hearing damage became known, with no prior directives for baseline audiology testing or hearing acuity monitoring during treatment. As a result, the plaintiff now suffers from permanent hearing loss and tinnitus due to the Tepezza infusions. Consequently, he is seeking compensation for the permanent injuries sustained from these infusions.\n\nApril 1, 2024: The growth in the Tepezza hearing loss class action MDL continues to be very slow. Only 8 new cases were added to the MDL over the last month. That brings the current total of pending cases up to 101. There were 54 pending cases when the Tepezza MDL was created back in August 2023.\n\nMarch 19, 2024: Oral arguments are tomorrow on the defendants\u2019 effort to slow down the process of getting to bellwether trials. It is hard to imagine the MDL judge will not want to push this litigation forward, but we should know soon enough.\n\nMarch 13, 2024: Lawyers defending Tepezza for Horizon want to slow things down. They have submitted a request to the MDL judge to postpone for two months the deadline for choosing four lawsuits related to Tepezza hearing loss for early bellwether discovery and potential trial preparation. The company cites the ongoing review of medical records to identify the most suitable cases for this process as the reason for needing more time.\n\nIt is all the same; only the names change. Defendants want to slow the pace of litigation any way they can. What we need to do is push forward to get these lawsuits to trial because that is how we get to a Tepezza settlement.\n\nMarch 10, 2024: Last month, 19 new cases were transferred into the Tepezza hearing loss class action MDL, bringing the total number of pending cases in the Tepezza MDL to 93. This is also the largest monthly volume of new cases since the MDL was created seven months ago.\n\nMarch 1, 2024: Good news for patients looking for an alternative to Tepezza. Innovent Biologics\u2019 thyroid eye disease (TED) treatment, a direct competitor to Amgen\u2019s Tepezza, is on the verge of approval in China following a successful phase 3 trial.\n\nThe trial showcased the treatment\u2019s ability to significantly reduce eyeball protrusion compared to a placebo, with 85.8% of participants treated with Innovent\u2019s candidate, IBI311, showing a marked improvement. This promising result, along with no serious adverse events reported, positions Innovent to swiftly pursue a new drug application in China and perhaps here soon.\n\nFebruary 15, 2024: Tepezza lawyers reported yesterday that there is still disagreement over a protocol for handling data from non-custodial sources. Should unresolved issues remain, both parties will present their arguments through simultaneous submissions to the Court by 5:00 p.m. CST on February 28, 2024. Presumably, the court would resolve this difference at the status conference on March 6th.\n\nFebruary 8, 2024: The parties have agreed to a plan for how Horizon will produce documents in the Tepezza hearing loss lawsuits. For those of you hoping for a Tepezza settlement in 2024, this agreement is a dose of cold water. Horizon will not complete the full production until the end of the year.\n\nGaining access to Horizon\u2019s internal documents is key to this litigation. Tepezzaa lawsuits think these documents will fully reveal what Horizon knew about the risks associated with Tepezza and when they knew it. Effective discovery strategies will be essential to unearth emails, meeting minutes, and internal studies that could prove critical in establishing knowledge and liability.\n\nThere is talk that this will be the MDL that settles earlier than you think. That would be great, but we need to keep pressure on Horizon.\n\nJanuary 15, 2024: Since mid-December, three new cases alleging hearing loss have been added to the Tepezza class action MDL. That brings the total number of cases in the Tepezza MDL up to 74. (There was a case \u2013 Ingram v. Horizon \u2013 filed in 2024 that is not in that count, so the actual number is 75.)\n\nAgain, as our lawyers have said, this will not be huge litigation. This is bad news for Tepezza lawsuits but, by and large, probably good news for victims. It will make it easier to settle this litigation faster with a higher average settlement amount than if there were many thousands of plaintiffs.\n\nJanuary 9, 2024: Attorneys engaged in the Tepezza hearing loss litigation have jointly requested an extension from the presiding U.S. District Judge. They seek 60 days beyond the original deadlines to review medical records and other critical documents. This extension is needed to more effectively identify which cases should be included in the Initial Bellwether Discovery Pool for test trials. These test trials are key to determining settlement amounts in the litigation. So lawyers on both sides are pressed to get it right.\n\n\n\nOriginally, on November 1, Judge Durkin had allocated 60 days for the plaintiffs to choose four cases for this initial pool, while the defendants were given 90 days to select their four cases. Following these selections, the parties were to collaborate on finalizing a list of remaining eligible Tepezza lawsuits. The Court would randomly pick four additional cases from this list, bringing the total to 12. However, in a joint agreement submitted on January 2, 2024, lawyers on both sides indicated to the court that they require more time, agreeing on the necessity of a 60-day extension for selecting the bellwether cases.\n\nJanuary 8, 2024: On June 25, 2023, the JPML centralized litigation before Judge Thomas Durkin. That was six months ago. Where are we now? The answer is not far. The slow progress of this MDL, noted in the latest CMC, must end.\n\nTepezza plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are on it. They filed a motion opposing Horizon\u2019s request to postpone tomorrow\u2019s case management conference. Why do they want to postpone? They claim there\u2019s nothing for the Court to resolve. But that is not the only reason for a status conference.\n\nThe Tepezza plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys argue that disputes, like the unresolved Production Protocol, need the Court\u2019s intervention. But, more to the point, these get-togethers with the lawyers and judge advance the litigation. Defendants love to stall. Delaying the CMC would only perpetuate the MDL\u2019s slow pace.\n\nHopefully, the status conference goes off as planned tomorrow. The judge will have to rule today at some point.\n\nJanuary 1, 2024: The last week of 2023 was extremely slow for the Tepezza hearing loss class action MDL. No entry was made on the MDL over the last week of the year.\n\nDecember 18, 2023: Twelve new cases were transferred into the Tepezza hearing loss class action MDL over the last month, bringing the current case total up to 71. That may seem insignificant, but it is double the volume of new cases we saw last month and could be the start of a growth trend as we head into 2024.\n\nDecember 1, 2023: We already have an early discovery battle taking shape in the newly created Tepezza hearing loss MDL. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers recently filed a \u201cNarrative Submission\u201d before an upcoming conference. The narrative outlines a number of complaints about the way Horizon and its defense team have complied (or failed to comply) with initial discovery issues and requests.\n\nNovember 20, 2023: A Florida woman became one of the most recent plaintiffs in the Tepezza hearing loss class action litigation. According to the Complaint in her case, the woman received Tepezza infusions for thyroid eye disease from August 2022 to April 2023. After her last Tepezza infusion, the woman alleges that she suffered permanent hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing in the ears). Her lawsuit alleges that Horizon Therapeutics negligently failed to warn her and her doctor about the risk of hearing damage associated with Tepezza.\n\nNovember 19, 2023: Only five new cases were transferred into the Tepezza hearing loss class action MDL over the last month. There are now 59 pending cases in the MDL, which has grown very slowly in the first three months of its existence.\n\nThis is a good thing for victims in many ways. A smaller pool of plaintiffs in an MDL makes settlement easier and faster to effectuate.\n\nNovember 6, 2023: Lawyers for Tepezza victims knocked by a motion to dismiss, allowing claims alleging Horizon should have developed a safer version of its thyroid eye disease drug, Tepezza, before seeking FDA approval. The plaintiffs contend that the drug is linked to hearing loss. The court ruled that federal law does not preempt these \u201cpre-approval\u201d design defect claims.\n\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 willing argument was that Horizon had a duty under state law to propose a formulation that did not lead to permanent hearing damage. According to the court, at this point in the process, federal law doesn\u2019t dictate Horizon\u2019s design choices, allowing the state-law claim to stand.\n\nNovember 3, 2023: Yesterday, the judge in the Tepezza hearing loss class action MDL issued a new Case Management Order laying out the rules and procedures for the bellwether case selection process and the bellwether trials. An initial pool of 12 bellwether candidate cases will be selected in 60 days. Each side will select 4 cases, and the remaining four will be randomly selected. These 12 cases will then go through a fact-discovery process.\n\nSeptember 18, 2023: In June, 41 cases were pending in the Tepezza class action MDL. As of this week, there are not 54, a comparatively small increase. As we move forward, the volume of new cases will likely start to pick up considerably.\n\nSeptember 14, 2023: The Tepezza class action is now being overseen by Magistrate Judge M. David Weisman to manage the discovery process, including the authority to modify the discovery deadline and oversee the settlement conference.\n\nThe preliminary status hearing is set for September 19, 2023, at 9:15 a.m. Plaintiffs can listen in if they like. The conference call-in number is 1-877-411-9748, and the passcode is 1814539. (The big thing is just do not record anything because that is against court rules.)\n\nSeptember 11, 2023: Amgen Inc., one of the biggest biopharma companies in the world, has reached a deal with the FTC that will enable it to move forward with its $27 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, the manufacturer of Tepezza. Amgen\u2019s acquisition was halted when the FTC obtained an injunction to stop the deal based on concerns that it would violate anti-trust laws. Now that the deal is back on, Amgen will assume liability for the Tepezza hearing loss claims. This is a positive development for plaintiffs because Amgen is a bigger company with more financial resources to cover any eventual settlement.\n\nSeptember 10, 2023: There was a status hearing in the Tepezza class action lawsuit on Friday, September 8, 2023.\n\nDuring this hearing, Tepezza lawyers were directed to submit a proposed agreed order concerning matters related to 502(d) and privileged materials and a protective order to the Court. This would allow Horizon\u2019s lawyers to share documents or information during the discovery process without necessarily giving up their attorney-client privilege or work-product protection.\n\nThe Honorable M. David Weisman will assist the MDL judge in handling various aspects of this lawsuit, including overseeing the discovery process and facilitating potential settlements.\n\nSeptember 1, 2023: Plaintiffs in the Tepezza class action MDL are pushing for a fast schedule to get to the first round of bellwether trials as soon as possible.\n\nIn the proposed bellwether schedule submitted by the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers and discussed yesterday at a status conference, each side would select three bellwether candidate cases for a short case-specific discovery phase of 150 days.\n\nAfter that brief discovery period, three of the six lawsuits will be picked for the first test trials. Defense counsel for Horizon Therapeutics submitted its proposal, which called for a slightly larger pool of 10 cases to go through bellwether discovery.\n\nAugust 18, 2023: A new Tepezza lawsuit \u2013 Mhamdi v. Horizon Therapeutics USA, Inc. \u2013 was directly filed this week in the MDL 3568 by a Florida woman who claims that she suffered severe injuries as a direct result of the plaintiff\u2019s infusion of the biological product Tepezza.\n\nThis plaintiff was diagnosed with thyroid eye disease and/or Graves\u2019 Disease and received Tepezza infusions from Plaintiff\u2019s physician from August 2020 through February 2023. She now has permanent hearing loss and/or tinnitus.\n\nHer Tepezza suit alleges that she and her physicians were given no warning and they had no knowledge of the severe risk of permanent hearing loss or tinnitus posed by Tepezza.\n\nAugust 15, 2023: Five new Tepezza hearing loss cases were transferred into the new Tepezzza class action MDL over the last month. That brings the current number of pending cases up to 46 for an MDL only three months old. This will probably never be a huge class action, but we could quickly get to 100 by the end of the year\u2026 and every lawyer you talk to is very high on these cases. (Update: we got to 73 in 2023.)\n\nAugust 2, 2023: We are still waiting for the first major scheduling order to be issued in the new Tepezza class action MDL. In the meantime, the stream of new incoming Tepezza hearing loss lawsuits has been intermittent. Only three new Tepezza cases were filed in July, but June was the highest-volume month to date, with 16 new cases filed.\n\nJuly 25, 2023: Amid mounting lawsuits against Horizon Pharmaceuticals over allegations of Tepezza-induced hearing loss, the company is under scrutiny for purportedly failing to sufficiently warn consumers and the medical fraternity about the associated risks of their thyroid eye disease medication.\n\nThe government is stepping deeper to protect patients. The FDA has updated Tepezza\u2019s warning to include strong language that Tepezza might inflict severe and irreversible auditory damage.\n\nWhat we saw in the Elmiron litigation was lower settlement amounts if the patient continued to use the drug after the new warning. So, should you stop taking the drug to protect your future Tepezza lawsuit? Your health is more important than your lawsuit. You should talk to your doctor about the best course of action.\n\nJune 19, 2023: On June 28, 2023, the new Tepezza class action MDL judge will hold the first status conference with all parties and their attorneys. The meeting will be Judge Durkin\u2019s first opportunity to become familiar with the litigation and develop his plan for collectively managing the Tepezza hearing loss lawsuits. Judge Durkin will also explain how he will select individual lawyers to serve on the plaintiffs\u2019 steering or executive committee for the litigation.\n\nJune 5, 2023: It is official. There is now a new Tepezza class action lawsuit against Horizon Therapeutics USA Inc. The lawsuit alleges that the company failed to warn about potential hearing loss and tinnitus caused by their thyroid eye disease drug, Tepezza. The MDL Panel has consolidated the cases, and Judge Thomas M. Durkin of Chicago will preside over this class action (technically not a class action but an MDL).\n\nOur legal team is confident in the strength of these lawsuits. We expect that victims will receive just settlement compensation, particularly now that plaintiffs will have a jointly organized plan to pursue discovery and put these Tepezza lawsuits together.\n\nMay 31, 2023: A new Tepezza lawsuit was filed in Ohio last week. The plaintiff was diagnosed with thyroid eye disease (or Graves\u2019 disease) and underwent a course of Tepezza infusions from April 2021 through October 2021. During these critical times, her Tepezza lawsuit alleges neither the plaintiff nor their physicians were provided any warnings or made aware of the severe risk of permanent hearing loss and/or tinnitus associated with Tepezza. The plaintiff now suffers from permanent hearing loss (and/or tinnitus \u2013 the complaint was short on nailing down the details).\n\nMay 22, 2023: With the JPML set to hear oral arguments on whether to create a new class action MDL, the pace of new Tepezza hearing loss cases continues to accelerate. Ten new Tepezza lawsuits were filed in federal courts over the last week. Meanwhile, Amgen\u2019s acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics may be off after the Federal Trade Commission sought an injunction to block the $27 billion deal.\n\nMay 11, 2023: As we previously reported, With the number of Tepezza hearing loss lawsuits continuing to rise, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) is set to hold a hearing on May 25, 2023, to determine whether the Tepezza cases in federal courts should be consolidated into a class action MDL.\n\nHorizon Therapeutics, the manufacturer of Tepezza, has now filed a motion opposing MDL consolidation. In their opposition motion, Horizon argues that an MDL is not warranted because there are not enough pending cases. In a bit of wishful thinking, Horizon also suggests that the number of Tepezza lawsuits filed in the future will be limited.\n\nMay 8, 2023: The pace of new Tepezza hearing loss lawsuits being filed around the country has increased dramatically over the last six weeks. When a motion seeking MDL consolidation was filed back in March, it listed just 18 Tepezza cases pending in 5 different federal districts. Since that motion was filed, however, seven more Tepezza hearing loss lawsuits have been filed in federal courts across the country. The JPML is set to consider whether to create a new class action MDL at the end of this month.\n\nApril 26, 2023: The Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) panel, also known as the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML), is a group of federal judges responsible for determining whether to consolidate and centralize civil cases that involve similar questions of fact and are filed across multiple federal courts.\n\nThe panel\u2019s purpose is to streamline and coordinate pretrial proceedings, promoting efficiency, avoiding duplicate discovery, and preventing inconsistent rulings. On May 25, 2023, this panel of judges will decide whether a Tepezza class action lawsuit should be created to consolidate all federal court cases under one judge.\n\nApril 14, 2023: As more Tepezza lawsuits are filed and we await a ruling on whether there will be a class action lawsuit, Horizon keeps looking to make more money from Tepezza. Today, Horizon Therapeutics announced new FDA approval for an amendment to the indication language for Tepezza, broadening when the drug should be used in treating Thyroid Eye Disease (TED) patients.\n\nThis change comes after a Phase 4 clinical trial showed positive results, with patients receiving Tepezza experiencing a significant reduction in proptosis at Week 24 compared to those given a placebo. The revised indication aims to offer unrestricted access to all eligible patients throughout the entire range of TED, potentially alleviating the access burden for both patients and doctors and shortening the time to treatment. The company intends to present the Phase Four trial data at an upcoming medical congress and publish the findings in a peer-reviewed medical journal.\n\nThe reality is that for drug companies, what seems to us like a King\u2019s ransom in settlement payouts and jury awards is a drop in the bucket to the billions these companies can make. Horizon could weather a successful Tepezza class action lawsuit and still make a huge profit for the drug.\n\nApril 13, 2023: Recently, a motion was filed seeking consolidation of the hearing damage lawsuits into a single Tepezza class action lawsuit for federal court claims. The motion was filed with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML), and it lists 18 pending Tepezza product liability cases across five different federal districts. If the MDL is granted, the movants request that the venue be the Northern District of California.\n\nApril 4, 2023: A research team from Stanford University recently published a new case study report that indicates that hearing loss is directly connected to dosage levels of Tepezza injections. The case study looked at a 64-year-old woman who received a full round of Tepezza injections in 2021. She immediately suffered significant side effects from injections, including hearing loss in both ears. When she was taken off the injections, her hearing problems went away. A year later, her doctors tried another round of Tepezza injections, this time at a much lower dose, and the woman did not experience the same hearing loss issues as with the first round. The case study provides further evidence that there is a clear and direct link between Tepezza and hearing loss.\n\nMarch 24, 2023: Since the start of March, four new lawsuits have been filed in federal courts alleging that Tepezza injections caused permanent hearing damage. A total of 34 Tepezza hearing loss lawsuits have been filed in the federal courts to date. Voluntary dismissals were filed in 13 of those cases, indicating that they might have been settled.\n\nFebruary 28, 2023: What a Tepezza hearing loss suit looks like.\n\nFebruary 14, 2023: The maker of Tepezza, Horizon Therapeutics, is seeking to have the Tepezza hearing loss claims against it dismissed under the doctrine of federal preemption. Preemption motions are very common in product liability cases, especially those involving claims of failure to warn about prescription drug risks. Horizon\u2019s motion to dismiss argues that the tort claims asserted by the Tepezza plaintiffs are preempted by federal law because the FDA regulated Horizon\u2019s ability to change the warning label for Tepezza.\n\nJanuary 20, 2023: Lawyers for Tepezza plaintiffs have filed a motion to consolidate 10 Tepezza hearing loss cases currently pending in the Northern District of Illinois. The request seeks to consolidate these 10 cases before a single judge.\n\nThe result would be similar to a \u201clocal MDL class action lawsuit\u201d within the federal district and apply only to these ten Tepezza hearing lost suits (and perhaps more in the future).\n\nHorizon has filed an opposition. It argues each Tepezza lawsuit involves significantly different factual allegations. Fewer than 20 Tepezza product liability claims are pending in federal courts, including ten in Illinois.\n\nJanuary 18, 2023: It was announced that Amgen, a massive biopharmaceutical company, had a deal to acquire Horizon Therapeutics (the maker of Tepezza) for $116.50 per share. Recently, however, a group of Amgen investors has filed suit to block to sale, citing concerns about claims that Horizon withheld information about the risk of hearing damage associated with Tepezza.\n\nThis is a positive development if you consider bringing a Tepezza lawsuit.\n\nTepezza\n\nTepezza (teprotumumab-trbw) is a prescription medication used to treat thyroid eye disease (TED), a rare autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation and swelling of the tissues around the eyes. Tepezza is the first and only FDA-approved medication for this condition. It works by blocking the activity of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), which is believed to play a role in the development of TED. Tepezza is administered intravenously (IV) over three to six months, and it has been shown to improve symptoms such as eye bulging, double vision, and eye pain in patients with active TED.\n\nTepezza inhibits (or blocks) the activity of the protein insulin-like growth factor-1, which is believed to play a significant role in the development of the disorder. Horizon Therapeutics developed TepezzaHorizon Therapeutics, and it is still under its original patent protection. Tepezza is administered by injections.\n\nIn January 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Tepezza. This was the first approved drug indicated to treat thyroid eye disease.\n\nIn addition to the serious risk of hearing loss which is the subject of this litigation, Tepezza is associated with several other side effects that patients keep in mind. The most commonly reported side effects include muscle spasms, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, dry skin, and headaches. Some patients also experience an altered sense of taste, making certain foods taste metallic or different than usual.\n\nTepezza is also known to cause an increase in blood sugar levels, which may be problematic for patients with diabetes or those at risk for developing high blood sugar. Swelling, particularly in the hands and feet, is another commonly reported side effect. Additionally, some patients may experience high blood pressure during the course of their treatment.\n\nWhile most of these side effects are mild and temporary, they can still affect a patient\u2019s quality of life during treatment. Patients should, of course, discuss any side effects with their healthcare provider, as some may need extra management or monitoring while on Tepezza. Being aware of the full range of potential risks enables patients to make well-informed choices about their treatment options. That is where the hearing loss and tinnitus issue comes into play which we will get to in a moment.\n\nGraves Disease\n\nThyroid Eye Disease (TED) is characterized by the progressive inflammation of the tissues surrounding the eyes, leading to symptoms such as red, swollen eyelids and discomfort, with the eyes sometimes bulging outwards (proptosis). Despite Horizon Therapeutics\u2019 promotional materials suggesting a commonality of vision impairment among those with TED, such severe outcomes are actually quite rare, affecting only 3\u20135% of those with the condition. Despite this knowledge, Horizon pushed Tepezza for use in anyone diagnosed with TED, advocating for its early treatment. TED is an autoimmune condition frequently linked to hyperthyroidism, with its precise disease mechanism still not fully understood. Symptoms can greatly vary among individuals, ranging from mild to severe, and can include redness, irritation, discomfort of the eyes and eyelids, dry eyes, pain upon eye movement, and eyelid retraction. The most noticeable symptom, and it can be pretty awful for some, is exophthalmos or proptosis, which occurs when the eyes bulge outwards. Other symptoms may include blurred vision, double vision (diplopia), eye misalignment (strabismus), chronic bloody eyes, swelling near the eyelids, light sensitivity, and difficulty moving the eyes. TED progresses through two stages: an \u201cactive phase\u201d marked by worsening symptoms and visible inflammation, followed by an \u201cinactive phase\u201d with no further deterioration. The active phase typically spans six months to two years. TED is most commonly associated with Graves\u2019 disease, an autoimmune disorder affecting the thyroid, skin, and eyes, but it can also occur in individuals with an overactive or underactive thyroid. For those with mild TED, treatments may include supportive measures like dark sunglasses, ointments, artificial tears, or prism glasses. Corticosteroids may reduce inflammation in moderate-to-severe cases. Surgery might be considered for individuals with moderate-to-severe TED but is usually recommended after the active phase. The 2008 Consensus Statement of the European Group on Graves\u2019 Orbitopathy (EUGOGO) on the Management of Graves\u2019 Orbitopathy suggests that the condition is often mild, self-limiting, and potentially decreasing in frequency, with a small percentage of cases threatening eyesight. So taking mediation for Graves\u2019 disease requires careful balancing of the risks and benefits of the drug. This requires knowing all of the risks associated with the drug, right? Studies Link Tepezza to Serious Hearing Loss\n\nSeveral studies and reports have linked the use of Tepezza to hearing loss and other hearing-related issues.\n\nA small study presented at the ENDO 2021 conference found that 65% of patients taking Tepezza reported otologic symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, ear plugging sensation, and autophony (hearing one\u2019s own voice unusually loud). This rate is so much higher than the 10% reported in earlier clinical trials. These symptoms often developed after an average of 3.6 infusions, and among the patients with new hearing symptoms, some showed new or worsening sensorineural hearing loss, which is a type of hearing loss resulting from damaged hair cells in the inner ear\u200b\u200b.\n\nFurthermore, a report published in The Annals of Otology, Rhinology, and Laryngology described a case of significant hearing loss in a patient after receiving Tepezza treatments, with the patient\u2019s symptoms not improving even after the discontinuation of the drug and treatment with oral corticosteroids.\n\nThe American Journal of Ophthalmology highlighted the long-term impact of Tepezza on hearing function, revealing that only a fraction of patients who experienced subjective hearing loss or decreased word comprehension made a full recovery after eight months of discontinuing Tepezza infusions\u200b\u200b.\n\nA case series of four cases of Tepezza-associated hearing loss was reported based upon patients of three doctors who treated 28 patients. The authors proposed a mechanism for how Tepezza was causing hearing damage.\n\nIn contrast to the public statements, almost immediately after the FDA approved Tepezza, patients and doctors began reporting severe complications relating to ear and permanent hearing problems in patients taking Tepezza. New research soon began to emerge to show that not only did Horizon grossly understate the risk of hearing damage associated with Tepezza, but it also undersold how severe that hearing damage could be.\n\nDr. Liu\n\nIf you are wondering why many Tepezza lawyers think settlement amounts could be offered early in this litigation, you can start with plaintiffs\u2019 allegations with respect to Dr. Lu. According to reports and plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuits, concerns were raised internally at Horizon by employees, including Dr. Wenzhong \u201cJerry\u201d Liu, regarding hearing loss linked to the use of Tepezza.\n\nDespite clinical trial data and further analysis indicating a higher rate of hearing impairment than initially reported, Horizon continued to downplay these risks. The company\u2019s official stance suggested that most hearing-related adverse events observed in pivotal trials and after approval were minor to moderate and reversible.\n\nDr. Liu, with extensive experience in clinical development and medical affairs, questioned the accuracy of the reported 10% incidence rate of hearing impairment, suggesting that findings from later studies, including Study 401 (EAP), indicated a much higher rate. He advocated for the disclosure of this updated data to regulatory agencies, healthcare professionals, and the public, emphasizing that the true frequency of serious hearing impairment was significantly higher than the label suggested.\n\nDespite Dr. Liu\u2019s suggestions to share the findings from Study 401, which showed a 40% incidence rate of hearing impairment, and his ongoing concerns about the accuracy of public disclosures on hearing impairment risks, he was eventually dismissed from his position. Dr. Liu subsequently filed a wrongful-termination lawsuit against Horizon.\n\nHorizon Failed to Adequately Warn About the Risk of Hearing Loss from Tepezza\n\nAlthough Horizon acknowledged hearing loss as a potential side effect of Tepezza, every Tepezza lawsuit will allege this warning was inadequate because it grossly understated the level of risk. A warning that does not meaningfully convey the risk is no warning at all.\n\nHorizon knew or should have reasonably known that Tepezza presented a much higher risk of hearing loss and that this hearing loss could be permanent. There was ample medical literature suggesting that IGF-I plays a central role in hearing and that low levels of IGF-I are associated with hearing loss. Horizon arguably should have known this when Tepezza was submitted for FDA approval. At the very least, however, Horizon became of the issues with Tepezza at some point soon after the drug was approved, and reports and studies linking it to hearing damage started to emerge.\n\nTepezza Hearing Loss Lawsuits\n\nIn 2022, individuals who suffered hearing loss or tinnitus after receiving Tepezza injections began filing product liability lawsuits against Horizon. The Tepezza hearing loss lawsuits allege that Horizon negligently failed to adequately warn patients and doctors about the real risks of hearing damage associated with Tepezza.\n\nThe plaintiffs in every Tepezza lawsuit in the MDL claim that the lack of an adequate warning about the risk of hearing damage from Tepezza left them and their doctors unaware of the potential harm that the drug could cause. These plaintiffs allege that they would never have to take Tepezza for treatment of their TED had Horizon provided an adequate and accurate warning about this risk.\n\nOver 175 Tepezza lawsuits have been filed in the MDL. We expect more. There is now, was we discuss above, a class action MDL.\n\nPotential Settlement Payouts for Tepezza Hearing Loss Lawsuits\n\nIt is very premature to say how much a Tepezza lawsuit could be worth in settlement. There are too many variables at this point to determine whether these cases will be viable. But I can tell you\u2026 mass tort lawyers really believe the future settlement amounts these lawsuits could be high. So we can offer a reasonable estimate of what a successful Tepezza hearing loss lawsuit could be worth in a settlement based on the facts that are on the ground right now.\n\nOur lawyers estimate that a Tepezza hearing loss case with favorable facts could have an average settlement compensation in the range of $140,000 to $350,000. The exact value of a specific case will depend on various factors, including the age of the plaintiff and whether they had any preexisting hearing issues. Cases involving a major, permanent hearing loss in relatively young plaintiffs could be worth much more.\n\nHearing Loss Settlements and Verdicts\n\nOne of the best ways to accurately predict the potential settlement value of tort cases is to look at prior settlements and trial verdicts in cases involving the same type of injury. Below are summaries of prior verdicts and reported settlements in cases in which the plaintiff\u2019s primary injury was hearing loss or tinnitus. Most of these are verdicts from the recent bellwether trials in the 3M earplugs class action. For these verdicts, we are excluding the amount of punitive damages awarded and only listing the amount of compensatory damages.\n\nBeal v 3M Co. (Florida 2022) $72,500,000: the last of 16 bellwether test trials in the 3M earplugs class action resulted in a verdict of $72.5 million in punitive damages and $5 million in compensatory damages for hearing loss suffered by an Army veteran. These 3M verdicts are telling because they are hearing loss lawsuits against a big company for failure to warn\u2013a good comparable.\n\nthe last of 16 bellwether test trials in the 3M earplugs class action resulted in a verdict of $72.5 million in punitive damages and $5 million in compensatory damages for hearing loss suffered by an Army veteran. These 3M verdicts are telling because they are hearing loss lawsuits against a big company for failure to warn\u2013a good comparable. Vaughn v 3M Co. (Florida 2022) $2,200,000: 3M earplug bellwether verdict from April 2022 in which veteran was awarded $2.2 million in compensatory damages for hearing loss allegedly caused by defective earplugs.\n\n3M earplug bellwether verdict from April 2022 in which veteran was awarded $2.2 million in compensatory damages for hearing loss allegedly caused by defective earplugs. M. v Viola (New York 2020) $250,000: A 2-year-old suffered permanent hearing loss from injuries in a car accident. The case settled for $250,000, but this was likely the available insurance limit and would have been worth more otherwise.\n\nA 2-year-old suffered permanent hearing loss from injuries in a car accident. The case settled for $250,000, but this was likely the available insurance limit and would have been worth more otherwise. Luoma v State Farm (Washington 2020) $126,025:60-year-old plaintiff injured in an auto accident alleged permanent hearing loss. The jury awarded $101,025, and he received another $25,000 in a settlement payout before trial.\n\nRecent Tepezza Lawsuits\n\nA pair of Tepezza hearing loss lawsuits were recently filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). The first case, Weibel v. Horizon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (1:22-cv-4518), followed by a second case, Nethery v. Horizon Pharmaceuticals Inc. (1:22-cv-5005) two weeks later.\n\nBoth cases involve nearly identical factual allegations. Both plaintiffs were diagnosed with TED and prescribed a full series of Tepezza infusions by their doctor over four months. Both plaintiffs further allege that shortly after the Tepezza infusions they suffered major hearing loss and tinnitus. The Complaints alleged that the doctors were given no warning about the risk of hearing loss.\n\nLawyers for Horizon filed an identical Motion to Dismiss in both of these Tepezza hearing loss cases. The motion to dismiss is a simple two page document that argues that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on failure to warn should be dismissed based on the federal preemption doctrine. The argument (which we see all the time in pharmaceutical tort cases) is that the warning labels on Tepezza are governed by federal law and regulations that preempt the state law tort claims.\n\nThis argument failed. Federal preemption arguments in drug cases are usually not successful because federal law and FDA regulations permit drug companies to amend their warning labels without FDA approval if new evidence of risk emerges. That is exactly what is being alleged in the Tepezza cases.\n\nIn these cases and all Tepezza lawsuits, lawyers need to establish a direct link between Tepezza and hearing loss. Plaintiffs\u2019 Tepezza lawyer will rely on the strong scientific evidence and expert testimony to demonstrate that Tepezza directly caused their hearing impairments. This requires gathering detailed medical records, expert analyses, and possibly conducting independent studies that corroborate claims of hearing damage due to Tepezza.\n\nHow Does Tepezza Cause Hearing- Related Complications?\n\nThe exact mechanism through which Tepezza might cause these hearing issues is not fully understood. But some of the experts believe it related to its immunomodulatory effects, which might inadvertently affect the inner ear or auditory pathways.\n\nTepezza works by inhibiting the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), which plays a role in the inflammatory processes of TED. This inhibition modulates the immune response, potentially impacting various body systems, including the auditory system. Experts believe that these immunomodulatory effects could inadvertently affect the inner ear or auditory pathways, leading to hearing issues.\n\nSo the could involve an inflammatory response within the ear. By altering the immune system\u2019s function, Tepezza could potentially trigger inflammation that impacts hearing structures, such as the cochlea, auditory nerve, or Eustachian tube.\n\nContact Us About a Tepezza Hearing Damage Lawsuit\n\nOur firm is currently seeking Tepezza hearing damage lawsuits across the country.

            "content": "Since the late 1980s, statins have been the mainstay of cholesterol management, lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and preventing countless heart attacks. Yet many patients do not achieve their target LDL cholesterol levels, either because adherence to daily medication is a challenge or because their genetic profiles make achieving optimal cholesterol levels more difficult. Emerging RNA-based therapies, however, are changing the treatment landscape by targeting cholesterol at the genetic level in the liver (where most cholesterol is made), offering the possibility of long-lasting effects with fewer doses. Although these drugs were initially developed for people with genetic causes of high cholesterol, clinical trials are now testing their wider use.\n\nOne promising RNA-based treatment for lipid management is inclisiran (Novartis\u2019s Leqvio), a small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in late 2021 for patients with heart disease caused by heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic condition that affects 1 in 250 people and leads to high cholesterol levels, and clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which affects more than 18 million people in the USA. In 2023, its use was expanded to people with high LDL cholesterol levels who had not yet had a cardiovascular event. Inclisiran works by preventing the production of PCSK9, an enzyme that regulates LDL receptors in the liver. By preventing the translation of PCSK9 mRNA into protein, inclisiran has a mechanism of action distinct from that of PCSK9 inhibitors such as evolocumab and alirocumab, which inactivate PCSK9 proteins already in the bloodstream and need to be administrated every few weeks. A standout feature of inclisiran is its long duration of action; patients need only a few injections per year to maintain controlled cholesterol levels. The therapy is administered as a subcutaneous injection by a healthcare provider, with an initial dose, a second dose 3 months later, and subsequent doses every 6 months.\n\n\u201cThe perceived benefit of targeting RNA or DNA in the liver is that interventions can be limited to a few times per year or even once in a lifetime, ensuring adherence and higher efficacy,\u201d says Erik Stroes, a cardiovascular researcher at Amsterdam University. \u201cAdditionally, liver-specific targeting minimizes common side effects seen with statins, such as muscle complaints.\u201d\n\nInclisiran can achieve substantial and consistent reductions in LDL levels. In phase 3 trials, inclisiran showed a reduction in LDL cholesterol levels of up to 52% at month 17, with a good safety profile, in people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and elevated LDL levels despite receiving statin therapy at the maximum tolerated dose. \u201cThe only negative aspect is the expense,\u201d says John P. Cooke, medical director of the RNA therapeutics program at the Houston Methodist DeBakey Heart and Vascular Center in Houston, Texas \u2014 the Leqvio list price for uninsured patients is US $3,373.41 per dose, \u201cbut I think as time goes on, it will become less expensive.\u201d\n\nOther trials have shown promise for RNA-based lipid-lowering agents, Stroes says, particularly those that target a type of LDL called lipoprotein(a), high levels of which are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease that current treatments cannot address. Several pharmaceutical companies are developing RNA therapies to reduce the levels of lipoprotein(a), such as Novartis\u2019 pelacarsen, an antisense oligonucleotide given once a month \u2014 phase 3 results of a trial for pelacarsen may be available in 2025. Amgen\u2019s siRNA therapy, olpasiran, administered every 3 months, is being tested in the phase 3 OCEAN(a) outcomes trial, with results expected in 2027. And Eli Lilly\u2019s siRNA therapy, lepodisiran, which could be given once or twice a year, is currently in phase 2 trials. \u201cIf successful, these trials are expected to bring a huge change for patients at increased cardiovascular risk due to high lipoprotein(a),\u201d says Stroes.\n\nTaking the success of limited-dosing treatments such as inclisiran further, base-editing RNA therapies aim to provide a permanent, single-course solution for tackling high cholesterol levels. \u201cStatins and PCSK9 inhibitors are phenomenal meds and we have so much evidence that they can reduce risk, but we see a huge gap in patients receiving them,\u201d says Amit Khera, vice president of genomic medicine at Verve Therapeutics, a company that is applying in vivo base-editing technology to cardiovascular health. Unlike inclisiran\u2019s siRNA mechanism, VERVE-101 uses an mRNA-encoded adenine base editor plus a guide RNA that specifically targets the PCSK9 gene. Base editing alters a single base pair in the gene, permanently inactivating the gene and leading to a sustained reduction in cholesterol levels. This method contrasts with CRISPR\u2013Cas9, which cuts both strands of DNA and relies on natural repair mechanisms, which can sometimes lead to errors.\n\nInterim results from a phase 1b clinical trial (Heart-1) in November 2023 showed that VERVE-101 treatment led to dose-dependent reductions in LDL cholesterol levels in people with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and accelerated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Researchers saw reductions in LDL levels of up to 55% after a single infusion of the base-editing therapy. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that we can lower LDL pretty dramatically with a single dose,\u201d says Khera. \u201cAnd it looks like it\u2019s permanent. With inclisiran, the effect would have started to wear off after 3 months.\u201d\n\nHowever, VERVE-101\u2019s impressive initial results have been beset by challenges. In April 2024, the company announced it was halting enrollment in its phase 1 study, as one of the six patients treated with a higher dose of the base-editing therapy experienced an asymptomatic transient elevation in alanine transaminase levels and a low platelet count, which represents a grade 3 serious adverse event. Verve maintains that neither the guide RNA nor the base-editing process contributed to these side effects. The culprit, the firm believes, is a third part of the drug: the lipid nanoparticle delivery system. Lipid nanoparticles are effective carriers, but their use has historically been associated with side effects that, although often self-limiting, can still pose risks in a clinical setting.\n\n\u201cThe discussion of the ideal carrier is already very old,\u201d says Stroes. \u201cLocal delivery strategies using lipid nanoparticles have always been hallmarked by some side effects. Verve will have to make some minor adjustments, but this is expected to be relatively straightforward and certainly not a showstopper,\u201d says Stroes, pointing out that firms such as Intellia Therapeutics have made strides in addressing toxicity in delivery systems.\n\nWhen safety concerns arose with VERVE-101, Verve was prepared with solutions, says Khera. The firm\u2019s second candidate, VERVE-102, also targets patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and premature coronary artery disease. Although it uses the same base-editing approach as that of VERVE-101, it differs in two ways: the lipid nanoparticle is more tolerable, says Khera, and the therapy includes a targeted ligand called N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), which is also used in inclisiran. \u201cWe were the first to use GalNAc binding to [a lipid nanoparticle] for genome editing,\u201d says Khera. This innovation allows more-precise delivery by targeting receptors unique to liver cells. In May 2024, Verve dosed the first participant in the phase 1b clinical trial of VERVE-102 (Heart-2), and Khera is optimistic. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any significant laboratory abnormalities as we observed with VERVE-101. That\u2019s exciting,\u201d he says, with initial results expected in early 2025.\n\nAlthough PCSK9 is a promising genetic target, other genes that encode cholesterol-regulating molecules are also gaining attention. \u201cThere are at least eight genes [encoding molecules] regulating cholesterol, where loss-of-function mutations don\u2019t lead to significant pathology, but do lower LDL,\u201d says Cooke. Targeting these other genes broadens the scope for RNA-based lipid-management solutions. And the flexibility of base editing makes creating therapies to target these different genes relatively straightforward.\n\nFor instance, Verve has another candidate in development that targets ANGPTL3, a key regulator of cholesterol and triglycerides in the liver. VERVE-201, which entered a phase 1b clinical trial (Pulse-1) in October 2024, will recruit people with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (a rare, life-threatening genetic disease that affects 1 in 300,000 people), alongside those with refractory hypercholesterolemia; these are patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who are not at their medically recommended LDL cholesterol goal, despite being on maximally tolerated standard-of-care therapies, such as statins. VERVE-201 uses the same delivery system as that of VERVE-102, except the guide RNA is different. \u201cThis one is cool because the mechanism is pretty different from statins and PCSK9 inhibitors,\u201d says Khera. \u201cIt can lower the LDL even if patients don\u2019t have any LDL receptors. It has the potential to move relatively quickly for patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.\u201d\n\nKhera envisions a future in which cholesterol management is more flexible and doctors offer a spectrum of treatments, from daily pills and intermittent injections to advanced gene-editing therapies. Although not every patient will be comfortable with a gene-editing approach, many will appreciate the potential for a one-time, definitive treatment, Khera believes. \u201cSome patients want to take care of the problem once and for all,\u201d he says. \u201cOur goal is to provide durable solutions that lower cholesterol, significantly reduce cardiovascular risk and give patients peace of mind.\u201d",

            "content": "Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen Inc. (AMGN) discovers, develops, and manufactures innovative medicines aimed at improving the lives of millions. With a market cap of $142 billion, Amgen has been a pioneer in the biotechnology industry for over 40 years. Its portfolio includes treatments for cancer, heart disease, osteoporosis, inflammatory diseases, and rare conditions.\n\nThe drug manufacturer is expected to announce its fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, Feb. 4. Ahead of the event, analysts expect AMGN to report a non-GAAP profit of $5.02 per share, up 6.6% from $4.71 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. The company has a robust earnings surprise history. It has surpassed Wall Street\u2019s bottom-line estimates in each of the past four quarters. Amgen\u2019s adjusted EPS for the last reported quarter surged 12.5% year-over-year to $5.58, exceeding analysts\u2019 estimates by 9.2%.\n\nFor the full fiscal 2024, Amgen is expected to deliver an adjusted EPS of $19.57, up 4.9% from $18.65 in fiscal 2023. While in fiscal 2025, its earnings are expected to grow nearly 4% year-over-year to $20.35.\n\nAMGN stock has plummeted 15% over the past 52 weeks, substantially underperforming the Healthcare Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLV) marginal gains and the S&P 500 Index\u2019s ($SPX) 24.4% surge during the same time frame.\n\nAmgen stock prices rose nearly 1.5% in the trading session following the release of its mixed Q3 results on Oct. 30. Driven by a significant surge in volumes and the acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, Amgen\u2019s total revenues surged 23.2% year-over-year to $8.5 billion but missed Wall Street\u2019s expectations by a small margin.\n\nMeanwhile, due to a drop in net selling price and a massive 32.2% increase in total operating expenses to $6.5 billion Amgen\u2019s profitability took a sharp hit. Its non-GAAP adjusted net margin contracted 307-basis points compared to the year-ago quarter to 35.6%. While its adjusted net income grew 13.4% year-over-year to $3 billion.\n\nThe consensus opinion on AMGN stock is moderately bullish, with an overall \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating. Out of the 30 analysts covering the stock, 14 recommend \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d one advises \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d 12 suggest \u201cHold,\u201d one advocate \u201cModerate Sell,\u201d and two give a \u201cStrong Sell\u201d rating. Its mean price target of $323.16 indicates a staggering 23.2% upside potential from current price levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Cancer Immunotherapy - A Global Market Overview\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe global market for Cancer Immunotherapy is estimated at US$135.2 billion in 2024 and is anticipated to post a CAGR of 9.8% during the 2024-2030 analysis period and stand at a projected US$236.9 billion by 2030.\n\n\n\nThe global cancer immunotherapy market is primarily driven by the rising prevalence of cancer worldwide, leading to a growing demand for more effective treatment options. Oncolytic viral therapies and cancer vaccines use viruses to specifically target and destroy cancer cells, while Checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cell therapies are increasingly employed to treat lung cancer and melanoma.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese therapies stimulate immune responses and are gaining attention due to their precise targeting and reduced side effects, further driving market demand. Advancements in biotechnology, including gene editing and bioinformatics, have enabled the development of personalized and efficient therapies. Additionally, investments in research and development and a supportive regulatory environment have accelerated the introduction of innovative treatments.\n\n\n\nCancer Immunotherapy Regional Market Analysis\n\n\n\nNorth America dominates the market and is expected to hold an estimated share of 43.7% in 2024, primarily due to the increasing demand for advanced treatment options, a strong presence of major market players, and substantial investments in research and development. The United States leads this growth with favorable reimbursement policies and advanced healthcare infrastructure, which facilitates the adoption of immunotherapies. On the other hand, the Asia Pacific region is poised to be the fastest-growing market, with a projected CAGR of 11.3% during the forecast period 2024-2030.\n\n\n\nThis growth is driven by a rising population of cancer patients, increased healthcare expenditures, and a growing awareness of innovative therapies in countries such as China and India. Government efforts to enhance healthcare infrastructure and a growing private sector are further driving this expansion, addressing the critical need for effective cancer treatments in both regions.\n\n\n\nCancer Immunotherapy Market Analysis by Product\n\n\n\nThe Monoclonal Antibodies segment dominates the cancer immunotherapy market, holding a projected share of 55.9% in 2024. This dominance is driven by growing R&D investments in bispecific, conjugated, and naked antigen-binding antibodies, which have created new growth opportunities in oncology therapeutics. These antibodies enhance adaptive immunity and specifically target cancer antigens, resulting in improved therapeutic outcomes with reduced side effects. In contrast, the Oncolytic Viral Therapies and Cancer Vaccines segment is expected to be the fastest-growing, with a projected CAGR of 11.8% during the analysis period 2024-2030, despite facing challenges like immunogenicity and immunosuppression in tumor environments.\n\n\n\nCancer Immunotherapy Market Analysis by Application\n\n\n\nThe lung cancer application is anticipated to maintain its dominant position by holding the largest market share of 13.8% in 2024. This growth is driven by the increasing prevalence of lung cancer, primarily due to increased smoking and the popularity of harmful products such as e-cigarettes. As the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, lung cancer requires immunotherapy treatments to manage the advanced stages of the disease.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the breast cancer application is expected to be the fastest-growing segment, with a projected CAGR of 13.5% during the forecast period 2024-2030, driven by the high prevalence of breast cancer, ongoing research and development efforts, and increased investments by leading players to develop novel therapeutics. The rising number of breast cancer cases among women globally further fuels this segment's expansion.\n\n\n\nCancer Immunotherapy Market Analysis by End-User\n\n\n\nThe Hospitals & Clinics segment is the largest end-user market, with an estimated share of 49.8% in 2024, primarily driven by the rising incidence of cancer, increased treatment rates, improved awareness, and the availability of immunotherapy treatments across numerous hospitals. The segment's significance is further strengthened by the growing number of hospital admissions for cancer treatment and the increased adoption of advanced therapies. Conversely, the Cancer Research Centers segment is anticipated to record the fastest growth with a CAGR of 10.9% during the analysis period from 2024 to 2030. This growth is driven by increasing investments in cancer research from corporate and government organizations, along with advancements in immunotherapy treatments.\n\n\n\nCancer Immunotherapy Market Report Scope\n\n\n\nThis global report on Cancer Immunotherapy analyzes the market based on product, application, and end-users.

            "content": "Specialization and expansion\n\nHow to delay the patent expiration of a blockbuster?\n\nAbbVie was originally just a part of Abbott Laboratories , a company based in Abbott Park, Illinois . The company had two major segments: pharmaceuticals and medical devices. In 2012, the company decided to spin-off its innovative pharmaceutical business out of which AbbVie Inc. was established. The generic drugs business, however, remained with Abbott Laboratories. AbbVie\u2019s new headquarter is located in neighboring Lake Bluff, Illinois. During 2020, AbbVie completed its largest M&A deal so far by acquiring Ireland-based Allergan for 63 billion U.S. dollars. This is one of the biggest M&A deals of the biopharmaceutical history ever Among AbbVie\u2019s various products, Humira (adalimumab) has an outstanding position. Humira is used for the treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn\u2019s disease . Over the last four years, the product generated annual revenues of about 20 billion U.S. dollars. Before the appearance of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty , Humira was the global top drug based on revenue. In some years, the blockbuster made up around two thirds of the company\u2019s total revenues. Given the threat through patent expiration and generic/biosimilar competition, such a dependence on one product could potentially have negative effects for a pharmaceutical company. Biosimilars of Humira have already been available in several countries since 2014. In AbbVie\u2019s major market, the U.S., Humira started facing biosimilar competition only from 2023, but already combined with heavy revenue losses. AbbVie was quite \u2018famous\u2019, and often criticized, due to its aggressive patent strategy and pricing policy for Humira in the United States: dozens of patents were filed for the drug, but for various medical conditions, while between 2016 and 2021 alone Humira's net price increased by 60 percent.",

Image: Adobe Stock\n\n\u201cMariTide is a first-of-its-kind peptide antibody conjugate that activates the GLP-1 receptor and simultaneously antagonizes or blocks the GIP receptor,\u201d Narimon Honarpour, MD, PhD, senior vice president of global development for Amgen, said during a presentation. \u201cThis construction portends a long half-life with sustained predictable exposure. It also allows us to appreciate the synergistic effect on these signaling mechanisms initially suggested by preclinical models.\"\n\nPhase 2 study of weight loss\n\nThe study covered two cohorts, the first of which consisted of 465 patients with overweight or obesity but no diabetes (63% women; mean BMI, 38 kg/m2), and the second of which consisted of 127 patients with overweight or obesity and diabetes (42% women; mean BMI, 36 kg/m2).\n\nFor the cohort without diabetes, patients were assigned to placebo or one of the following maridebart cafraglutide regimens: 140 mg monthly; 280 mg monthly; 420 mg monthly; 420 mg every other month; a dose escalation strategy of 70 mg administration at baseline and again at 2 weeks followed by 420 mg monthly; and a dose escalation strategy of 70 mg administration at baseline, 140 mg at 4 weeks, 280 mg at 8 weeks followed by 420 mg monthly.\n\nIn that cohort, at 1 year, all regimens of maridebart cafraglutide were associated with significant weight loss. The highest average weight loss observed in any treatment arm was approximately 20%, without a weight loss plateau, Honarpour said.\n\nAlso at 1 year, systolic blood pressure was reduced by 11 mm Hg in those assigned to the maridebart cafraglutide 420 mg target dose compared with a reduction of 3 mm Hg in the placebo group; LDL cholesterol was reduced by 5% in those assigned maridebart cafraglutide 420 mg compared with an increase of 1% in the placebo group; triglycerides were reduced 19% in those assigned maridebart cafraglutide 420 mg compared with an increase of 1% in the placebo group; and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was reduced by 53% in those assigned maridebart cafraglutide 420 mg compared with an increase of 1% in the placebo group, Honarpour said.\n\nFor the cohort with diabetes, patients were assigned placebo or one of the following maridebart cafraglutide regimens: 140 mg monthly, 280 mg monthly or 420 mg monthly.\n\nAt 1 year, maridebart cafraglutide 420 mg monthly was associated with weight loss of approximately 17% without a weight loss plateau, compared with a loss of approximately 10% for the other maridebart cafraglutide groups and virtually no weight loss for the placebo group, according to the researchers.\n\nMaridebart cafraglutide reduced HbA1c by approximately 2.2 percentage points at 1 year compared with an increase of 0.1 percentage points for the placebo group, Honarpour said.\n\nAlso at 1 year, systolic BP was reduced by 11 mm Hg in those assigned maridebart cafraglutide 420 mg compared with a reduction of 2 mm Hg in the placebo group; glucose was reduced by 58 mg/dL in those assigned maridebart cafraglutide 420 mg compared with an increase of 22 mg/dL in the placebo group; triglycerides were reduced 28% in those assigned maridebart cafraglutide 420 mg compared with an increase of 21% in the placebo group; and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was reduced by 72% in those assigned maridebart cafraglutide 420 mg compared with a reduction of 25% in the placebo group, Honarpour said.\n\nMost patients finished the study and of those eligible to participate in part two of the trial, more than 90% agreed to continue for the additional year, he said.\n\nThere was no association between maridebart cafraglutide and changes in bone mineral density, and changes in heart rate were consistent with those for other approved weight-loss drugs, he said.\n\nThe most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, almost all were mild or moderate, with a majority associated with the first dose of maridebart cafraglutide, he said, noting that dose escalations with lower starting doses improved gastrointestinal tolerability.\n\nFuture research\n\nPart two of the study, which includes patients who lost at least 15% of body weight in part one and who will be evaluated for another year, is underway, he said.\n\n\u201cThe intention of part two is to understand more about the weight reduction effects of MariTide. For example, how long the weight reduction would last by re-randomizing some patients who were receiving MariTide in part one to placebo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also wanted to understand what doses would be necessary for maintenance, so some patients that received MariTide in part one were re-randomized to a lower dose, and for patients on the 420 mg regimen, to assess how much additional weight reduction could be achieved from part one, some patients continued 420 mg [monthly]. Lastly, some patients receiving 420 mg from part one were re-randomized to 420 mg every quarter.\u201d\n\nAmgen's phase 3 MARITIME clinical program will evaluate maridebart cafraglutide for treatment of patients with overweight or obesity, and potentially type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea and/or other conditions, Honarpour said.\n\n\u201cThis is the first obesity treatment being investigated with a monthly or less frequent dosing regimen,\u201d Honarpour said during the presentation. \u201cWe saw substantial improvements across a variety of cardiometabolic parameters.\u201d",

After pharma and biopharma biggies such as Amgen, Sanofi, Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Zoetis, the city is now learnt to be on the radar of pharma giants such as Eli Lilly, GSK, and Merck.TOI has learnt that the US-headquartered Eli Lilly, which has a market capitalisation of over $734 billion, has already zeroed in on a facility in the heart of Hyderabad's IT hub, a stone's throw from IKEA. The global development centre (GDC) is expected to become operational by mid-2025, sources indicated. The American drug giant acquired about 2.5 lakh sq ft to 2.75 lakh sq ft of space spanning over one floor at Phoenix Equinox, where it will accommodate over 2,500 people, realty sources said. However, TOI could not get a confirmation on the development from the company at the time of going to press.Buzz about Eli Lilly's plans to set up shop in Hyderabad, which has emerged as a key global capability centres (GCC) hub for the life sciences sector, comes almost a year after Eli Lilly's global CEO David Ricks visited Hyderabad. He had delivered the keynote address at the BioAsia 2024 conclave, where he also held a meeting with Telangana industries & IT minister D Sridhar Babu. Realty sources said while players like GSK were scouting the Hyderabad market for viable options, Amgen has already acquired 6 lakh sq ft at RMZ Nexity and is scouting for more space in the city in locations such as Genome Valley.Apart from pharma and biopharma giants, Hyderabad has also seen healthcare and medtech players such as Cigna's Evernorth, HCA Healthcare, Providence, Medtronic, and Olympus Corporation set up some of their largest GCCs and global innovation centres. Telangana's lifesciences sector bagged investments worth more than Rs 36,000 crore in 2024 with 13 GCCs deciding to set up shop in the state.",

            "content": "SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Asher Biotherapeutics, a biotechnology company developing precisely-targeted immunotherapies for cancer and infectious diseases, today announced a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) to evaluate etakafusp alfa (formerly known as AB248), Asher Bio\u2019s investigational CD8+ T cell targeted interleukin-2 (IL-2) immunotherapy, in combination with IMDELLTRA\u00ae (tarlatamab), Amgen\u2019s DLL3-targeting Bispecific T-cell Engager (BiTE\u00ae) therapy, in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).\n\n\u201c This clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Amgen allows us to further expand on the Phase 1 results for etakafusp alfa in a new combination with IMDELLTRA\u00ae in a global Phase 1b study in ES-SCLC,\u201d said Don O\u2019Sullivan, Ph.D., Chief Business Officer of Asher Bio. \u201c Based on emerging data to date, we believe etakafusp alfa has the potential to improve the efficacy of T cell engagers (TCEs) by selectively expanding the CD8+ T cell population, improving effector function, tumor infiltration and reversing TCE-induced T cell desensitization. We look forward to collaborating with Amgen to assess the potential for the novel combination to improve outcomes for patients with ES-SCLC.\u201d\n\nAs part of this collaboration agreement, Amgen will sponsor and operationalize a global Phase 1b study to evaluate the safety and early efficacy of etakafusp alfa in combination with IMDELLTRA\u00ae in patients with ES-SCLC. Asher Bio will retain full ownership of etakafusp alfa and will supply Amgen with etakafusp alfa at no cost.\n\nAbout SCLC\n\nSCLC is one of the most aggressive and devastating solid tumor malignancies, with a median survival of approximately 12 months following initial therapy and a 3% five-year relative survival rate for ES-SCLC.1,2,3 Current second-line treatments impart a short duration of response (median DoR: 3.3\u20135.3 months) and limited survival (median OS: 5.8-9.3 months), while current third-line treatments for SCLC, which consist primarily of chemotherapy, yield a short median DoR of 2.6 months and a median OS of 4.4-5.3 months.4-8 SCLC comprises ~15% of the 2.4 million plus patients diagnosed with lung cancer worldwide each year.9-11 Despite initial high response rates to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, most patients quickly relapse within months and require subsequent treatment options.13\n\nAbout Etakafusp Alfa (AB248)\n\nEtakafusp Alfa (AB248) is a novel CD8+ T cell selective IL-2, generated by fusing a reduced potency IL-2 mutein to an anti-CD8\u03b2 antibody. It was specifically engineered to selectively and potently activate CD8+ T-cells which are the immune cells that drive anti-tumor efficacy, while avoiding natural killer (NK) cells, which can act as a pharmacological sink and contribute to toxicity, and regulatory T (Treg) cells, which are immunosuppressive. Asher Bio is currently evaluating etakafusp alfa in a Phase 1a/1b clinical trial, AB248-101. The trial consists of a dose escalation and expansion phase to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and anti-tumor activity of etakafusp alfa alone and in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors who failed prior therapies. Initial pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from the ongoing Phase 1a/1b clinical trial support etakafusp alfa\u2019s proof of mechanism and activity with a highly differentiated clinical profile. Early data shows potent and selective CD8+ T cell activation without substantial changes to Treg and NK cell numbers and initial evidence of anti-tumor activity, including confirmed objective responses, with a generally well-tolerated safety profile. Please refer to www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05653882) for additional details related to this Phase 1a/1b clinical trial.\n\nAbout Asher Bio\n\nAsher Bio is a biotechnology company developing therapies to precisely engage specific immune cells to fight cancer and chronic viral infection. We utilize our proprietary cis-targeting platform to develop therapies engineered to overcome limitations of other immune-based treatments by selectively activating specific immune cell types with validated disease fighting functionality. Our candidates feature an antibody connected to a modified immunomodulatory protein, such as a cytokine. Our candidate design is intended to enable our candidates to selectively activate the desired immune cells and not other cells that contribute to toxicity or immune suppression. Our lead program etakafusp alfa (AB248), an IL-2 molecule specifically targeted to CD8+ effector T cells, is currently in Phase 1 trials for oncology. Our broader portfolio includes AB821, an IND-ready CD8-targeted IL-21 immunotherapy, and early-stage programs targeting CAR-T cells, myeloid cells and CD4+ T cells. Asher Bio was founded by Ivana Djuretic and Andy Yeung with support from Third Rock Ventures and is located in South San Francisco.

            "content": "Anticipated advancements in obesity, oncology, gene therapy and other areas poised to revolutionize patient care\n\nLONDON, Jan. 8, 2025 /CNW/ -- Clarivate Plc (NYSE:CLVT) a leading global provider of transformative intelligence, today announced the release of the twelfth annual Drugs to Watch\u2122 report, a trusted guide to the therapies poised to redefine the future of healthcare. This year, the highly anticipated resource highlights 11 drugs projected to achieve blockbuster status or revolutionize treatment paradigms within five years. Since its inception, Drugs to Watch has identified over 98 transformative therapies, cementing its role as an essential resource for navigating the ever-evolving pharmaceutical landscape.\n\nThis year\u2019s report, powered by insights from the Clarivate Cortellis intelligence suite of products, highlights 11 therapies that have recently launched or are set to debut in 2025. These innovations, addressing critical challenges in areas such as obesity, oncology, and gene therapy, are forecast to achieve blockbuster sales by 2030 or dramatically improve patient outcomes on a global scale. The report also explores pivotal trends shaping the industry, including the surging demand for obesity treatments, the transformative potential of gene editing, and the growing impact of regulatory innovation.\n\nThe report offers an in-depth analysis of the chronic disease market in Mainland China, spotlighting five therapies expected to exceed $1 billion in annual sales over the next five years or deliver transformative outcomes for patients. It also explores critical topics shaping global healthcare, including regulatory advancements, the role of radiopharmaceutical theranostics in oncology, and the growing use of real-world data (RWD) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to drive health equity and enhance regulatory submissions.\n\nHenry Levy, President, Life Sciences & Healthcare, Clarivate, remarked: \u201cInnovation in the life sciences is reaching unprecedented heights, and this year\u2019s Drugs to Watch\u2122 report once again demonstrates the industry\u2019s ability to deliver therapies that address unmet medical needs and challenge existing paradigms of care. At Clarivate, we take pride in the precision and reliability of our predictions\u2014last year, we identified 13 molecules as Drugs to Watch, with 12 already approved and launched and one poised for launch. This track record reflects the strength of our comprehensive data and deep expertise. By continuing to provide actionable insights, we empower the sector to navigate opportunities, overcome challenges and drive progress in advancing global health.\u201d\n\nMike Ward, Global Head of Thought Leadership, Life Sciences & Healthcare, Clarivate, stated: \u201c2025 represents a turning point for the life sciences sector as it embraces cutting-edge technologies such as AI and machine learning to enhance drug discovery and development. This year\u2019s report captures the dynamic forces at play, including groundbreaking progress in precision oncology, the rise of radiopharmaceuticals, and the growing focus on addressing global health disparities.\u201d\n\nThe 2025 Drugs to Watch\u2122 report highlights key trends reshaping the life sciences landscape, emphasizing the transformative impact of emerging technologies and therapeutic breakthroughs. Advances in AI and machine learning are streamlining drug discovery, clinical trials, and real-world data integration, enabling precision medicine approaches. The obesity market is undergoing a revolution driven by next-generation GLP-1 therapies, while radiopharmaceutical theranostics are redefining cancer treatment with a \u201csee it and treat it\u201d paradigm. Gene editing technologies are unlocking new opportunities in personalized medicine, and evolving regulatory frameworks are fostering greater emphasis on patient-reported outcomes and health equity. Together, these trends showcase the sector\u2019s resilience and its ability to navigate challenges while driving innovation to improve patient care worldwide.\n\nThis year\u2019s drugs to watch exemplify the fusion of innovation and dedication to advancing patient care in an increasingly complex healthcare ecosystem. The Drugs to Watch\u2122 2025 list include:\n\nAWIQLI\u00ae (LAI 287; insulin icodec) developed by Novo Nordisk | Type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus\n\nAustralia\n\nCanada\n\nJapan\n\nAWIQLI\u00ae, the first once-weekly, subcutaneous insulin, has launched in, the EU, Mainland China, and. Its weekly dosing offers a significant advantage over daily basal insulin, potentially reducing the treatment burden for patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (T1DM and T2DM).\n\nCagriSema (cagrilintide + semaglutide) developed by Novo Nordisk | Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus\n\nCagriSema, combining cagrilintide, a long-acting amylin analog, with semaglutide, promises superior efficacy over semaglutide (OZEMPIC/WEGOVY\u00ae) and tirzepatide (MOUNJARO/ZEPBOUND\u00ae) in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. This next-generation GLP-1 therapy leverages the benefits of GLP-1s, such as enhanced insulin secretion and appetite reduction, while incorporating amylin\u2019s effects, including slowed glucose absorption and release. If approved, CagriSema will be the first fixed-dose combination of amylin and GLP-1 receptor agonists in the obesity and T2DM markets.\n\nCOBENFY\u2122 (KarXT; xanomeline-trospium) developed by Bristol Myers Squibb | Schizophrenia and psychosis related to Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\nAmid setbacks for emerging schizophrenia treatments, the approval of COBENFY marks a transformative milestone as the first drug in over 30 years with a novel mechanism of action for treating schizophrenia. Combining xanomeline and trospium, COBENFY selectively targets M1 and M4 receptors, rather than traditional dopamine pathways, while minimizing cholinergic side effects. While further data is needed to assess its effectiveness in Alzheimer\u2019s disease-related psychosis, COBENFY shows strong commercial potential if proven effective in treating AD-related hallucinations and delusions.\n\nEBGLYSS\u2122 (lebrikizumab) developed by Eli Lilly and Co and Almirall | Atopic dermatitis\n\nEBGLYSS\u2122, the third biologic targeting IL-13 for atopic dermatitis, follows DUPIXENT\u00ae (dupilumab) and ADBRY\u00ae/ADTRALZA\u00ae (tralokinumab) to market. Its less frequent dosing, more selective IL-13 inhibition, and strong efficacy and safety data position it as a likely first-line treatment for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis when topical corticosteroids are inadequate.\n\nFitusiran developed by Alnylam\u00ae Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi | Hemophilia A and B\n\nFitusiran, shown to be effective in phase 3 trials for both hemophilia A and B, regardless of inhibitor status, has the potential to offer a new approach to hemophilia treatment. This small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy works by inhibiting SerpinPC1 mRNA, reducing antithrombin levels, promoting thrombin generation, and helping to rebalance hemostasis to prevent bleeds. Leveraging Alnylam\u00ae Pharmaceuticals\u2019 ESC-GalNAc conjugate technology, fitusiran could become the first antithrombin-lowering therapy based on a double-stranded RNA molecule, pending approval.\n\nGSK-3536819 (MenABCWY) developed by GSK plc | Meningococcus\n\nGSK plc\u2019s GSK-3536819 vaccine candidate, a 5-in-1, first-generation formulation, targets the five groups of(A, B, C, W, and Y) responsible for most invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) cases worldwide. It combines the antigenic components of GSK\u2019s licensed meningococcal vaccines, BEXSERO (MenB) and MENVEO (MenACWY), both of which have established efficacy and safety profiles.\n\nIMDELLTRA\u2122 (tarlatamab-dlle) developed by Amgen | Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC)\n\nIMDELLTRA\u2122 is a first-in-class immunotherapy for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Using Amgen\u2019s bispecific T cell engager (BiTE\u00ae) molecules, it targets CD3 on T cells and DLL3 on tumor cells, enabling T cells to attack and lyse the tumor. DLL3 is expressed on the surface of SCLC cells in more than 85% of patients but is minimally expressed on healthy cells making it an attractive target. This mechanism positions IMDELLTRA as a potential standard of care for previously treated ES-SCLC.\n\nmRESVIA (mRNA-1345) developed by Moderna Inc | RSV\n\nMay 2024\n\nWith its U.S. FDA approval in, mRESVIA\u00ae joined AREXVY and ABRYSVO, both featured in Drugs to Watch 2024, as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines currently available for adults ages 60 years and older, helping further support the public health initiative to reduce the RSV-related disease burden. Even with available vaccines, RSV infections continue to be a public health concern, particularly for infants and older adults (65 years and older).\n\nSEL-212 developed by Sobi\u00ae and Cartesian Therapeutics Inc/Selecta Biosciences Inc | Gout\n\nSEL-212 is a novel, once-monthly treatment combining pegylated uricase (pegadricase; SEL-037) with ImmTOR\u2122, an immune tolerance technology designed to inhibit the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). For this application, ImmTOR consists of SEL-110.36, an inhibitor of uricase-specific ADA. This approach may help overcome the limitations of reduced efficacy and tolerability seen with other biologic treatments, such as KRYSTEXXA\u00ae (pegloticase), in patients with chronic gout.\n\nVepdegestrant (ARV-471) developed by Arvinas Inc and Pfizer Inc | Breast cancer\n\nA global collaboration between Arvinas Inc and Pfizer Inc, vepdegestrant may become the first PROteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC\u00ae) protein degrader on the market. Designed to target and degrade the estrogen receptor (ER) protein, early studies suggest PROTAC-induced degradation is more complete than with oral selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs). This offers potential for overcoming endocrine resistance in breast cancer. Label expansions, including combination with IBRANCE\u00ae (palbociclib), are being explored.\n\nZanzalintinib (XL092) developed by Exelixis Inc | Colorectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck\n\nZanzalintinib is a third-generation oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting VEGF receptors, MET, and TAM kinases involved in tumor growth and immunosuppression. Currently in phase 3 trials for non-clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (nccRCC), colorectal cancer (CRC) and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), the company anticipates one potential zanzalintinib launch per year starting as early as 2026. Compared to CABOMETYX\u00ae (cabozantinib), zanzalintinib may offer benefits, including approval for nccRCC histology and a broader patient population.\n\nAccess the Drugs to Watch 2025 report from Clarivate, here.\n\nFor more Drugs to Watch updates and analyses throughout the year, visit the Drugs to Watch web page and follow Clarivate for Life Sciences & Healthcare on LinkedIn and X.

            "content": "The 2024 \u201cwinners\u201d of the annual Shkreli awards, given each year to perpetrators of the most egregious examples of profiteering and dysfunction within the healthcare industry, have been released from the Lown Institute, an independent healthcare thinktank.\n\nThe recipients are chosen by a panel made up of health policy experts, clinicians, journalists and advocates. The awards are named after Martin Shkreli, the infamous \u201cpharma bro\u201d who rose to international notoriety after increasing the price of lifesaving anti-parasitic drug Daraprim 50-fold.\n\n\u201cAll these stories paint a picture of a healthcare industry in desperate need of transformation. In 2024, healthcare practices were put in the spotlight,\u201d Vikas Saini, president of the Lown Institute, said during the ceremony.\n\n\u201cBut doing these awards every year shows us that this is nothing new. We\u2019re hoping that these stories illuminate what changes are needed.\u201d\n\nThe No 10 spot this year went to the University of North Texas health science center in Fort Worth for allegedly neglecting to notify next of kin before selling body parts of deceased people.\n\nAn NBC News investigation uncovered that the school did not properly receive consent from the deceased or their family members before dissecting and distributing unclaimed bodies, despite the network finding that said family members were fairly easy to identify and contact.\n\nThe ninth spot was given to the outdated practice of baby tongue-tie cutting, which continues to be falsely touted as a cure for several ailments, from sleep apnea to nursing trouble, according to the New York Times.\n\nShady billing practices from Zynex Medical, a company specializing in nerve-stimulation devices used for pain management, took the No 8 slot. Patients received Zynex devices understanding the expense would be covered by insurance, according to a report from Stat News. Users then got unsolicited supplies of items like batteries and electrode pads delivered to them (often excessive quantities), which they ultimately got charged for. The report states that almost 70% of Zynex\u2019s $184m in revenue in 2023 came from batteries and electrode pads.\n\n\u201cThis is just classic over-billing. It\u2019s fraud,\u201d Patricia Kelmar, a senior director at the research group US Pirg and judge on the panel, said. \u201cThe patients feel that they owe the money because they already received the supplies. We see a lot of this kind of abuse within the pain-management field.\u201d\n\nThe seventh spot was given to the case of Sara England and her infant son, Amari Vaca. After the three-month-old experienced severe respiratory distress two months after open-heart surgery, doctors at Natividad medical center in Salinas, California, chose to have him transferred via air ambulance to a medical center in San Francisco. He recovered and Cigna later deemed the service \u201cnot medically necessary\u201d. The family was given a $97,599 bill.\n\n\u201cThis is happening everywhere,\u201d Kelmar said. \u201cThe insurance denial here is that it should have been a ground ambulance instead of air, but how is the patient supposed to know that? This is a mother taking medical advice from the doctors.\u201d\n\nAt No 6 was Medicare\u2019s mass billing for urinary catheters. As many as 450,000 beneficiaries had bills for catheters submitted on their behalf in 2023, representing an 800% increase over previous years. Just seven suppliers were responsible for $2bn of these suspicious charges.\n\nTaking the No 5 spot was Memorial medical center (a former non-profit turned for-profit) in Las Cruces, New Mexico, for allegations of refusing cancer treatment to patients or demanding upfront payments, even from those with insurance.\n\nProPublica\u2019s uncovering of a once-celebrated oncologist\u2019s pattern of malpractice and trails of suspicious deaths came in at No 4. Dr Thomas C Weiner of Helena, Montana, reportedly subjected one patient to unnecessary cancer treatments for more than a decade, amid a myriad of other shocking revelations.\n\nLumakras, a cancer drug from Amgen that was granted accelerated FDA approval at a daily dose of 960mg, despite findings that a 240mg dose offered similar efficacy with reduced toxicity and risk of side effects, grabbed the third spot.\n\n\u201cPharma companies have that same incentive to get a return on profits,\u201d said Kelmar. \u201cThe healthcare industry is a business, and businesses will try to get the highest profits possible.\u201d\n\nAt No 2 was the behemoth that is UnitedHealth and how it\u2019s become the fourth-largest business in the nation. Doctors for United have reported pressure to reduce time spent with patients, and make patients seem as sick as possible through aggressive medical coding tactics.\n\nIn a highly competitive year, the top spot went to Steward Health Care, whose CEO, Ralph de la Torre, is accused of prioritizing private-equity profits over patient care. His financial scheming led to bankruptcy, leaving hospitals in shambles, employees laid off and communities with less healthcare access.\n\n\u201cI want to say that this is our backyard,\u201d said Saini.\n\n\u201cWhat was going on here was on the grapevine for many years. And if we knew about it, then we have to ask: \u2018Where are the regulators? Where are the people who should\u2019ve known better?\u201d",

The report \u2013 which can be viewed here \u2013 highlights the following new medicines:\n\n1) Novo Nordisk's Awiqli (LAI 287; insulin icodec), a long-acting basal insulin analogue for type 1 and type 2 diabetes that is the first drug in the class to offer once-weekly subcutaneous administration, rather than daily dosing. The drug has already been launched in Australia, Canada, the EU, mainland China, and Japan and, although it was rejected by the US FDA last year, is predicted to make $4.7 billion in sales from G7 markets (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US) by 2030.\n\n2) Novo Nordisk's CagriSema (cagrilintide and semaglutide), a fixed-dose combination of an amylin analogue and GLP-1 agonist for obesity and type 2 diabetes and successor to the company's big-selling Wegovy and Ozempic based on semaglutide monotherapy. Despite a recent data readout that disappointed investors and led to a steep decline in Novo Nordisk's share price, Clarivate is predicting G7 sales potential of $4.7 billion in obesity and $3.6 billion in diabetes.\n\n3) Bristol Myers Squibb's Cobenfy (KarXT; xanomeline and trospium chloride), a dual M1/M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist for schizophrenia and psychosis related to Alzheimer's disease. The drug is the first in over 30 years with a novel mechanism of action for treating schizophrenia and, while its potential in Alzheimer's remains uncertain, is tipped for sales of $1.6 billion.\n\n4) Eli Lilly and Almirall's Ebglyss (lebrikizumab), an anti-IL-13 antibody for atopic dermatitis that offers less frequent dosing than its two predecessors in the class, Sanofi/Regeneron's Dupixent (dupilumab) and LEO Pharma's Adbry/Adtralza (tralokinumab). According to Clarivate, Ebglyss could become a first-line treatment of choice for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis when topical steroids are inadequate and make sales of $6 billion.\n\n5) Sanofi and Alnylam's fitusiran, a once-monthly small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy for haemophilia A and B that works by inhibiting SerpinPC1 mRNA, reducing antithrombin levels, promoting thrombin generation, and helping to rebalance haemostasis to prevent bleeds. According to the report, fitusiran could become the first antithrombin-lowering therapy based on a double-stranded RNA molecule, pending approval, and has a sales prediction of $1 billion.\n\n6) GSK's GSK-3536819, a five-in-one vaccine for protecting against meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis A, B, C W, and Y strains that are responsible for most invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) cases worldwide. The vaccine combines the antigenic components of GSK's already licensed meningococcal vaccines Bexsero (B) and Menveo (ACWY) in one shot and is expected to make $905 million from the US and the top four EU markets.\n\n7) Amgen's Imdelltra/Imdylltra (tarlatamab), DLL3\u00d7CD3-targeting bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) for extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), the first DLL3-directed therapy to reach the market that has been approved in the US and the UK. DLL3 is an antigen with low expression in normal tissues, but is significantly overexpressed in SCLC and some other solid tumours, making it an attractive drug target. Clarivate thinks the drug could become a standard of care for previously treated SCLC and expects G7 sales to reach $2.1 billion.\n\n8) Moderna's mResvia mRNA vaccine for protection against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease in adults aged 60 and over, which was approved in the US last year as a rival to GSK's Arexvy and Pfizer's Abrysvo \u2013 both of which featured on Clarivate's 2024 list. While Moderna has said it overestimated the initial sales potential for mResvia \u2013 mainly because of a US decision to narrow the recommended use of RSV shots in older adults \u2013 Clarivate reckons it could become a $1.4 billion seller.\n\n9) Sobi and Cartesian Therapeutics/Selecta Biosciences' SEL-212 (nanoparticle encapsulated sirolimus and pegylated uricase), a novel, once-monthly treatment for gout that could overcome the limitations of reduced efficacy and tolerability seen with other biologic treatments, including the two companies' current therapy Krystexxa (pegloticase). The report is modelling G7 sales of $1.7 billion for SEL-212, which has been filed for approval in the US.\n\n10) Arvinas and Pfizer's vepdegestrant (ARV-471), a protein degrader targeting oestrogen receptors for breast cancer, which could become the first drug in the PROteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) class to reach the market. Clarivate says early studies suggest PROTAC-induced degradation is more complete than drugs in the oral selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERD) class like fulvestrant and could overcome endocrine resistance in breast cancer. It has a 2030 sales prediction for the drug of $1.19 billion.\n\n11) Exelexis' zanzalintinib (XL092), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting VEGF receptors, MET, and TAM kinases that is currently in phase 3 testing for colorectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). It is billed as a next-generation follow-up to Exelixis and Ipsen's Cabometyx (cabozantinib), approved for RCC, with potential for broader use that could drive sales to $2.6 billion in five years if it gets approved across all three indications.\n\nImage by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay",

            "content": "It seems inevitable that 2025 will not be a pleasant year. US President-elect Donald Trump laying claim to Greenland and the Panama Canal only serves to emphasise this. As if there were not enough absurdities and challenges on our planet.\n\nIt is precisely such turmoil that companies abhor. Stable framework conditions and predictability are important factors for business development, and this is especially true for the invention and protection of new technologies.\n\nThe new Unified Patent Court has recently shaken up the global patent system. It has become an established and integral part. But at less than two years old, it needs more time and politically reliable conditions to stabilise.\n\nMore pharma cases for the UPC\n\nThe UPC already has everything a functioning court needs. Good judges, many cases, well-developed case law and, above all, technological breadth. Nevertheless, the court still lacks pharmaceutical cases. Despite some individual cases, such as the lawsuit Accord recently filed against Novartis at the Milan central division, the industry is still hesitant.\n\nInitial decisions in main proceedings could help alleviate this. In this respect, the new year will be decisive as the first early infringement suits from pharmaceutical companies will be heard and probably decided this year.\n\nOn 25 February, for example, D\u00fcsseldorf local division will hear Sanofi\u2019s infringement claim against Amgen in the saga over cholesterol-lowering drugs Repatha and Praluent. If the two companies do not settle, the UPC can be expected to issue its first judgment on the merits in a pharmaceutical dispute.\n\nIf the UPC remains true to its strict timeline, the local division is also likely to hear Sanofi\u2019s infringement claims against various generic manufacturers over cancer drug cabazitaxel this year. These judgments ought to provide more clarity for the pharmaceutical industry in 2025.\n\nA CMS overhaul\n\nIn 2024 the UPC also announced a major project: a new case management system. The court is developing the system together with the European Patent Office. According to the court\u2019s announcement, both organisations are \u201cfully committed to fast track the development work and aim at having a system that can be operational by mid-2025\u201d.\n\nThe current CMS does not work smoothly, is overly complicated and has caused a good deal of resentment among judges and users. The new system must therefore be a good one. Only a well-functioning system will ensure greater trust and predictability for users.\n\nClarity on jurisdiction\n\nMeanwhile, the European Court of Justice is becoming increasingly important in European patent law. Last year, there were requests in UPC proceedings to submit legal issues to the CJEU for clarification. So far, however, the UPC judges have felt confident enough not to grant these requests and have decided such cases without the guidance of the judges in Luxembourg.\n\nNevertheless, the court will probably make an important decision this year on what jurisdiction European courts have over European patents. The dispute between the German company BSH Hausger\u00e4te and the Swedish company Electrolux is currently in its second round at the CJEU. There will no longer be a hearing, the court must only hand down its ruling.\n\nThe Grand Chamber must decide whether a Swedish court can rule on the parts of a European patent that have not been validated for Sweden when it comes to invalidity arguments. The court\u2019s decision could impact cross-border patent proceedings in Europe. If the CJEU agrees with Advocate General Nicholas Emiliou\u2019s opinion, European courts would have greater competence in patent infringement proceedings. This could significantly increase competition between patent courts in Europe.\n\nFRAND discussion continues\n\nFRAND was already on everyone\u2019s lips in 2024. In particular, the decision of the UK Court of Appeal to oblige Panasonic to grant an interim licence in the dispute with Xiaomi underpinned London\u2019s importance as the main venue for global FRAND-rate setting. Companies are now submitting applications for a global FRAND-rate determination to the UK High Court as standard.\n\nHowever, the court will next decide on the FRAND rate in connection with a patent pool. Observers expect the UK Court of Appeal to deliver its judgment in the case brought by Tesla against Avanci and InterDigital in just a few days\u2019 time, although the court has not set an exact date.\n\nTesla is seeking a FRAND determination, claiming that the terms of the Avanci licence are not FRAND. The High Court had dismissed the claim. Now the Court of Appeal must first decide whether the UK courts have jurisdiction at all.\n\nOn 6 February, the Higher Regional Court Munich will deliver its judgment in VoiceAge vs HMD over speech-coding standard EVS. The EU Commission set out its FRAND view in an amicus brief. The Higher Regional Court Munich countered with a new approach to the willingness of licensees. The decision will therefore have an impact on German and European SEP law. A referral to the CJEU is also possible, though rather unlikely.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s SEP regulation\n\nMeanwhile, the EU Commission\u2019s proposal for a new set of regulations has attracted little attention at the European Council lately. The proposal was hotly debated in 2023 and 2024, with many companies up in arms. Nevertheless, the EU Parliament voted in favour of the EU proposal. Now the European Council needs to vote on it. However, the Hungarian Council Presidency recently had no interest in pushing it forward.\n\nThis could now change since Poland took over the leadership of the European Council at the beginning of 2025. Opponents and supporters of the regulation are already positioning themselves to exert influence.\n\nPatent firms look inwards\n\nEconomic stability is important for companies\u2019 business. But their advisors also need reliability. Therefore, in politically turbulent times, patent attorneys and patent litigators are likely to be more concerned about the development of their own business.\n\nMost national courts in Europe have seen fewer cases of late. At the UPC, however, cases are steadily increasing. As of January there were 635 in total. This shift is politically intentional. The question that concerns patent professionals, however, is whether the new UPC cases are sufficient to keep their utilisation rates high.\n\nIt is widely believed that in economically uncertain times companies are more likely to enforce their patents against competitors. But even this may no longer hold water. It is becoming increasingly clear that the conditions that could be relied upon in the past might no longer apply.",

Kite Pharma, Inc. from the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit \u2013 have called into question the validity of broad antibody patent claims, leading some commentators to declare the death of the antibody genus claim.1\n\nIn the aftermath of those cases, some practitioners have suggested means-plus-function claiming as one strategy to obtain antibody claims that are broader in scope than the specific antibodies provided in the application as filed. This previously untested strategy cleared a first hurdle in the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) decision in Ex parte Chamberlain, where the USPTO held that a patent specification need not describe the \u201cequivalents\u201d to an antibody claimed in means-plus-function format.\n\nPatent at issue and its initial rejection\n\nEx parte Chamberlain involved Xencor Inc.\u2019s Patent Application No. 16/803,690, which included the following claim to an antibody in means-plus-function2 format:\n\n\u201c9. A method of treating a patient by administering an anti-C5 antibody comprising:\n\na) means for binding human C5 protein; and\n\nb) an Fc domain comprising amino acid substitutions M428L/N434S as compared to a human Fc polypeptide, wherein numbering is according to the EU index of Kabat, wherein said anti-C5 antibody with said amino acid substitutions has increased in vivo half-life as compared to said antibody without said substitutions.\u201d\n\nThe specification described a \u201c5G1.1\u201d antibody as capable of binding to the C5 protein. Murine and humanized versions of the \u201c5G1.1\u201d antibody were known in the art, but the specification did not indicate which it was referring to and did not provide an amino acid sequence for either. The specification did not identify any other antibodies that were capable of binding to the C5 protein or were otherwise \u201cequivalent\u201d to 5G1.1.\n\nThe USPTO examiner rejected this claim under 35 US Code \u00a7 112 as lacking adequate written description because the specification\u2019s disclosure of the 5G1.1 anti-C5 antibody was insufficient to identify a particular structure that correlates to \u201cmeans for binding human C5.\u201d Xencor subsequently appealed to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) at the USPTO.\n\nThe PTAB found:\n\nThat \u201cmeans for binding human C5 protein\u201d lacked sufficient written description because the specification did not disclose \u201csufficient structure\u201d corresponding to the claimed function of \u201cbinding human C5 protein.\u201d\n\nThe specification\u2019s disclosure of the 5G1.1 antibody insufficient because \u201cthe claimed \u2018means for\u2019 is not restricted by the [s]pecification to this specific antibody species.\u201d\n\nThat the term was indefinite because a skilled artisan would not know whether 5G1.1 referred to the mouse or humanized antibody and, thus, could not identify sufficient structure for the claimed means.\n\nThe PTAB subsequently denied a request for rehearing, and Xencor filed a notice of appeal to the Federal Circuit.\n\nLate in 2023, the USPTO filed a motion requesting an administrative remand of the proceeding to the USPTO so an Appeals Review Panel (ARP) could clarify the USPTO\u2019s position on the proper analysis of \u201cmeans-plus function claims in the field of biotechnology, and particularly in the antibody art\u201d and \u201cissue a revised decision.\u201d The Federal Circuit granted that motion on January 23, 2024, and the ARP issued its decision on May 21, 2024.\n\nARP\u2019s decision\n\nIn its decision, the ARP considered the PTAB\u2019s written description and indefiniteness rejections of the means-plus-function claim 9.3 The ARP first found \u201cthat the phrase \u2018means for binding human C5 protein\u2019 is a means-plus-function limitation subject to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 \u00b6 6.\u201d The ARP further found that claimed function was \u201cbinding human C5 protein\u201d and that the 5G1.1 antibody was the sole structure disclosed in the specification that performs the claimed function.\n\nOn the indefiniteness rejection, the ARP found that a person of ordinary skill would have understood \u201c5G1.1\u201d to refer to two related antibodies: the original mouse 5G1.1 antibody and a humanized version of the mouse antibody, known as ecluzimab, which were described in the specification. Thus, the ARP found the term to be definite and withdrew the PTAB\u2019s rejection on indefiniteness grounds.\n\nWith respect to the written description rejection, the ARP noted that a means-plus-function claim literally covers structures described in the specification and equivalents thereof, but it rejected the PTAB\u2019s reasoning that equivalents of the structure need to be described in the specification. The ARP reasoned that \u00a7 112 \u00b66 explicitly distinguished between the \u201ccorresponding structure \u2026 described in the specification\u201d and \u201cequivalents.\u201d emphasis added). The ARP noted that while \u00a7 112 \u00b66 specifically states that the corresponding structure must be described in the specification, it \u201cdoes not state that the [s]pecification must also describe the equivalents of that structure.\u201d The ARP further cited Supreme Court and Federal Circuit case law that \u201csupports reading \u2018equivalents\u2019 to cover structures, materials or acts beyond what is explicitly described in the [s]pecification.\u201d Accordingly, the ARP concluded that it was not necessary for the specification to describe equivalents of 5G1.1 to meet the written description requirement.\n\nAs a result, the ARP disagreed with the PTAB and concluded that the claim limitation \u201cmeans for binding human C5 protein\u201d met both the written description requirement of 35 USC \u00a7 112 \u00b6 1 and the definiteness requirement of 35 USC \u00a7 112 \u00b6 2.4\n\nImplications of ARP\u2019s decision\n\nAlthough Xencor\u2019s means-plus-function claims remain rejected for lack of written description on other grounds, the ARP decision suggests that the use of this format might provide applicants with a chance to obtain broader antibody claims that could potentially cover those antibodies specifically recited in a specification as well as \u201cequivalent\u201d antibodies. However, it is unclear how the USPTO will view the use of means-plus-function language in composition of matter antibody claims, as opposed to the method of treatment claims presented in Xencor. In addition, it remains to be seen whether the federal courts will abide by this decision and, if they do, how they will determine what antibodies are deemed to be \u201cequivalent\u201d to antibodies explicitly described in a specification. Moreover, it is important to note that the ARP\u2019s decision only addressed the written description of means-plus-function claims and did not consider enablement.\n\nWhile we wait to see what comes next, patent applicants should consider including means-plus-function claims when drafting new antibody applications.\n\nNotes",

More than 34,000 people die from lung cancer in the UK each year.2 There is a vital need for novel treatments, particularly for the extensive stage of small cell lung cancer, where outcomes are especially poor,\u201d said Tony Patrikios, Executive Medical Director, Amgen UK & Ireland. \u201c This licence brings us one step closer to offering a new treatment option to eligible patients.\u201d\n\nThe conditional marketing authorisation is based on results from the Phase 2 open label, multicentre study DeLLphi-301, which evaluated tarlatamab in patients with ES-SCLC who had failed two or more prior lines of treatment.4 Results from the study found that tarlatamab at the 10 mg every two weeks (Q2W) dose (N=99) demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 41% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 32 to 52) and a median duration of response (DoR) of 9.7 months (range: 5.9, not estimable [NE]).1\n\n\u201c Extensive-stage small cell lung cancer is an extremely difficult cancer to treat. While initial response rates to current treatment of chemotherapy, with the addition of radio- and immunotherapy, are high, duration of response is often short. Subsequent current treatments have had low success rates,\u201d said Alastair Greystoke, MBChB, MSc, PhD, FRCP, Professor of Precision Oncology and Honorary Consultant Medical Oncologist, Newcastle University & Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle, UK.\n\nIMDYLLTRA (tarlatamab) is a bispecific DLL3-directed CD3 T-cell engager that binds to DLL3 expressed on the surface of tumour cells and CD3 expressed on the surface of T cells. The bispecific binding of tarlatamab to T cells and DLL3-positive tumour cells triggers T-cell activation, production of inflammatory cytokines, release of cytotoxic proteins, which results in redirected lysis of tumour cells.1\n\nThe most common side effects reported with tarlatamab were cytokine release syndrome (53.8%), pyrexia (36.9%), dysgeusia (30.0%), decreased appetite (29.4%), constipation (27.5%), fatigue (26.9%), anaemia (25.0%) and asthenia (21.9%). Other very common side effects include nausea, hyponatraemia and dyspnoea.1\n\nIMDYLLTRA\u00ae has been granted a conditional marketing authorisation by the MHRA. This means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited.\n\n\u25bc This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.\n\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n\nAbout Small Cell Lung Cancer\n\nSCLC is one of the most aggressive and devastating solid tumour malignancies, accounting for ~15% of the 49,000 patients diagnosed with lung cancer in the UK each year.2,3,10 ES-SCLC has a median survival of approximately 9\u201312 months and less than a 2% 5-year relative survival rate.11 Despite patients being initially sensitive to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, most patients relapse within months and require subsequent treatment options.12 Current second-line treatments have shown limited survival (median overall survival: 25.9 weeks),11 while there are very limited options available for third-line treatment.7\n\nAbout IMDYLLTRA\u00ae\n\nIMDYLLTRA (tarlatamab) is a bispecific DLL3-directed CD3 T-cell engager that binds to DLL3 expressed on the surface of tumour cells and CD3 expressed on the surface of T cells. The bispecific binding of tarlatamab to T cells and DLL3-positive tumour cells triggers T-cell activation, production of inflammatory cytokines, release of cytotoxic proteins, which results in redirected lysis of tumour cells.1\n\nFor further product information, please see the Summary of Product Characteristics, which will be available at: https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/15878\n\nIndications\n\nIn the UK, IMDYLLTRA\u00ae is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with ES- SCLC with disease progression on or after at least two prior lines of therapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy.1\n\nAbout Amgen UK\n\nAmgen\u2019s mission is to serve patients.

            "content": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Amgen (AMGN), which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\n\nThis world's largest biotech drugmaker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 5%.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, Amgen came out with earnings of $5.58 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.11 per share, representing a surprise of 9.20%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $4.93 per share and it actually produced earnings of $4.97 per share, delivering a surprise of 0.81%.\n\nPrice and EPS Surprise\n\nWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Amgen. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nAmgen currently has an Earnings ESP of +5.83%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.\n\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.",

Image credit: Shutterstock / Marlon Trottmann.\n\nAmgen has said the UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) conditional approval of Imdylltra (tarlatamab) for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) marks a \u201csignificant step forward\u201d for those with lung cancer.\n\nAdults with ES-SCLC who have not responded to at least two prior lines of therapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy, will be eligible for the antineoplastic treatment, as per a 6 January press release by Amgen. The therapy was approved by the MHRA on 31 December.\n\nIn the announcement, Amgen\u2019s UK and Ireland executive medical director Tony Patrikios said: \u201cThere is a vital need for novel treatments, particularly for the extensive stage of small cell lung cancer, where outcomes are especially poor.\u201d\n\nShares in the company have remained level since the authorisation, though are still down from 2024 highs in August, primarily due to disappointing data from its weight loss drug MariTide.\n\nImdylltra\u2019s conditional marketing authorisation \u2013 a type of approval given where clinical data is not yet complete but is judged to be available soon \u2013 was based on results from the Phase II DeLLphi-301 trial (NCT05060016). Administered intravenously every two weeks at 10mg, Imdylltra led to an objective response rate (ORR) of 41% and a median duration of response (DoR) of 9.7 months.\n\nSCLC is an aggressive disease subtype and accounts for 15% of patients with lung cancer, being less common than non-small-cell lung cancer (NCSLC). ES-SCLC has a median survival of around 9-12 months. While first-line platinum-based chemotherapy is initially effective, relapse is frequent after a few months of treatment. Amgen states that median overall survival is around 26 weeks with current second-line treatments, with third-line options lacking.\n\nImdylltra is a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) that targets the protein delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) in tumour cells. It also binds to T-cells, causing the drug to trigger immune pathways that lead to the lysis of tumour cells. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tarlatamab, under the brand name Imdelltra, in May 2024, making Amgen\u2019s drug the first and only T-cell engager therapy for ES-SCLC treatment.\n\nImdylltra is globally forecast to generate $217m this year, with it reaching blockbuster status by 2029, according to GlobalData\u2019s Pharma Intelligence Centre.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Pharmaceutical Technology.\n\nWhilst Imdylltra has produced promising efficacy, the treatment does come with side effects. The FDA label for the drug includes a boxed warning for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity. Warnings and precautions for cytopenias, infections, hepatotoxicity, hypersensitivity, and embryo-fetal toxicity are also included.\n\nMSD\u2019s blockbuster Keytruda (pembrolizumab) used to be an option for patients in the US with metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other prior line of therapy.

The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nShares of Microsoft have gained +13.8% over the past year against the Zacks Computer - Software industry\u2019s gain of +17.6%. The company is riding on robust Azure and Office 365 performance, amplified by surging AI Copilot adoption. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 60,000 customers holds promise.\n\n\n\nIntelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Productivity and Business Processes revenues continue to rise due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, is encouraging. We expect fiscal 2025 net sales to grow 12.8% from fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\nHowever, the office's declining commercial licensing due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings is an headwind.

            "content": "Amgen Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMGN) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to $2.38 on 7th of March. This makes the dividend yield 3.6%, which is above the industry average.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Amgen\n\nAmgen's Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, the company was paying out 113% of what it was earning and 81% of cash flows. This indicates that the company could be more focused on returning cash to shareholders than reinvesting to grow the business.\n\nThe next year is set to see EPS grow by 95.3%. Assuming the dividend continues along the course it has been charting recently, our estimates show the payout ratio being 66% which brings it into quite a comfortable range.\n\nNasdaqGS:AMGN Historic Dividend January 6th 2025\n\nAmgen Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $2.44 in 2015, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $9.52. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 15% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.\n\nDividend Growth Is Doubtful\n\nSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. However, things aren't all that rosy. In the last five years, Amgen's earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 9.7% per annum. If earnings continue declining, the company may have to make the difficult choice of reducing the dividend or even stopping it completely - the opposite of dividend growth. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.\n\nThe Dividend Could Prove To Be Unreliable\n\nOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Amgen will make a great income stock. In the past the payments have been stable, but we think the company is paying out too much for this to continue for the long term. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.\n\nIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Just as an example, we've come across 4 warning signs for Amgen you should be aware of, and 1 of them is concerning.

            "content": "In the last four years, the obesity drug industry has gone from nearly defunct to dominating the pharmaceutical landscape. Initially approved two decades ago for diabetes, it was their efficacy in obesity that brought GLP-1 agonists into the spotlight. Now one major focus is understanding and applying GLP-1s\u2019 heart health benefits.\n\nIn March 2024, the FDA approved a label expansion for Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy (semaglutide) to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke in adults with cardiovascular disease and obesity or overweight. The approval was based on the Phase III SELECT trial, which showed that a 2.4 mg injection of Novo\u2019s drug led to a 20% drop in major adverse cardiovascular events compared to placebo when added to standard of care.\n\nAn AI proof-of-concept study expanded on SELECT\u2019s findings to determine if GLP-1 use might reduce the risk of major cardiac events in patients without severe preexisting cardiovascular disease. The Dandelion Health study, released in September 2024 as a whitepaper, was seven times larger than Novo\u2019s trial with that inclusion criteria and determined that even those without severe disease had 15% to 20% lower risk scores for major adverse cardiac events after taking a GLP-1 drug for three years. Ultimately, the study found that GLP-1s may be effective as primary prevention against cardiovascular disease for 44 million additional at-risk patients in the U.S. who had not previously been studied.\n\nWhile companies moving into the GLP-1 space continue to target diabetes and obesity indications first, evidence is accruing for the drugs\u2019 benefits in cardiac outcomes, and multiple players are looking to join Novo in using them to address these indications.\n\nMounting Cardiac Evidence\n\nThe first-in-human trials studying the effects of GLP-1s on cardiovascular outcomes date back to 2016, Daniel Drucker, an endocrinologist and obesity expert at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai in Toronto, told BioSpace. In total, multiple cardiovascular outcomes trials have been conducted with GLP-1s, and \u201cthe benefit is pretty consistent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe were pretty confident this is a [drug] class effect. If you have type 2 diabetes and a history of heart disease or are at risk for heart disease, you will see a reduced number of heart attacks, strokes and reduced rates of death\u201d on GLP-1 receptor agonists, Drucker said.\n\nWhether the effect on cardiac health and other comorbidities is due to the weight loss and blood sugar control that GLP-1s provide or other mechanisms has been a point of contention. Bariatric surgery, for example, doesn\u2019t just help people lose weight; it also has a profound effect on type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, Mark Bagnall, CEO of Phenomix Sciences, told BioSpace. For the cardiovascular benefits of GLP-1s, \u201chow much of this is weight loss and how much of this is some specific mechanism that GLP-1s target?\u201d he asked. He said the question remains unresolved but noted that the drugs are known to target multiple areas of the body, suggesting the possibility of mechanisms beyond weight loss.\n\nThough the data are not yet published, Novo has presented additional results from the SELECT trial at meetings that suggest the extent of the cardiovascular benefit is not strictly tied to weight loss or control of blood sugar in type 2 diabetes patients, Drucker said. That evidence would support the idea that other actions of GLP-1 agonists contribute to countering heart disease.\n\nGLP-1 drugs are known to have a direct effect on the endothelial cells that line blood vessels, lymph vessels and the heart, providing a biologically plausible mechanism for the cardiovascular benefit, noted Blai Coll, chief medical officer at Structure Therapeutics.\n\n\u201cWhen you put everything together\u2014the body weight reduction, blood pressure, lipids, metabolic and direct effect\u2014the common denominator to all those is a reduction in systemic inflammation. That can also bring additional cardiovascular benefits,\u201d Coll told BioSpace.\n\nAdditional studies of GLP-1s\u2019 efficacy in cardiovascular indications are underway. Novo conducted a Phase IIIb trial dubbed STRIDE to evaluate the effects of a 1 mg dose of semaglutide versus placebo in patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease and type 2 diabetes. The primary endpoint is patients\u2019 maximum walking distance, with secondary endpoints of quality of life and cardiometabolic assessments. The trial is complete but results have not yet been shared.\n\nMeanwhile, Lilly is conducting a head-to-head comparison of Zepbound (tirzepatide) against its older GLP-1 Trulicity (dulaglutide) looking at major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Trulicity was approved for reduction of cardiovascular event risk in type 2 diabetes patients in 2020.\n\nLilly is also studying Zepbound in a five-year placebo-controlled study, SURMOUNT MMO, investigating the benefits of the weight loss drug for reducing obesity-related diseases and death in participants with cardiovascular risk factors.\n\nExpanding the Pool\n\nWith Zepbound predicted to become the one of the top-selling drugs of all time, it\u2019s no surprise biotech and big pharma companies alike are all vying to get their obesity candidates through the clinic and onto the market. And with the latest estimates forecasting a $200 billion obesity drug market by 2031, there\u2019s room at the table for everyone.\n\n\u201cTraditionally obesity had been discarded as a market,\u201d Drucker said. \u201cNow these medicines are the hottest things, growing at the fastest rates and expected to continue to dominate the pharmaceutical landscape.\u201d\n\nAmgen recently released Phase II data for MariTide, its once-monthly GLP-1 agonist and GIP antagonist injection. The results came in at the lower end of investor expectations with weight loss of up to 20% on average at week 52. Overall, its profile looked similar to Zepbound, but with less frequent dosing, which could give it a leg up in the market. Amgen is pushing MariTide into late-stage development for cardiovascular event risk and other indications. Amgen CEO Robert Bradway noted at a conference in September that an obesity treatment with other applications \u201crepresents an exciting opportunity.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Structure initiated a Phase IIb dose escalation study last month for its oral GLP-1R selective small molecule. CEO Ray Stevens told BioSpace that after seeing data from the competition, Structure believes it has a potentially best-in-class molecule in terms of off-target safety and efficacy. Alongside weight loss endpoints, the company has an eye on indicators of cardiovascular benefits, collecting data on lipids, blood pressure and metabolic control to include as exploratory data at the end of its 36-week study, Stevens said.\n\nDepending on how the chronic weight management indication goes, Structure has said it may propose an additional cardiovascular outcome trial for the candidate.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for GLP-1s\n\nBagnall emphasized the broad value of GLP-1s. \u201cIf body weight loss and side effects are the only two things we really focus on, we got it wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many other aspects of benefits here.\u201d He highlighted, for example, the ultimate effect he expects GLP-1s and other obesity medicines to have on patients\u2019 overall well-being.\n\n\u201cThere are opportunities yet to be exploited in this area,\u201d Drucker said. While the medicines have first been tested against cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes and/or obesity, the next step may be to see if they reduce heart disease in all patient types. \u201cThey should work in people who have residual risk for ongoing cardiovascular disease, who may not have any diabetes or any obesity\u2014that\u2019s a hypothesis, and [we] need to have a company take this on.\u201d\n\nThe number of clinical studies involving GLP-1s is only increasing as researchers and companies alike pit the drug class against not only cardiovascular disease, but also type 1 diabetes, kidney disease, metabolic liver disease, arthritis, Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, cystic fibrosis and even addiction. The NIH\u2019s clinical trials site shows over 400 active trials involving GLP-1 intervention.\n\nWith so much attention on the potential uses of this drug class and expanding into oral formulations, Stevens said, \u201c2025 is really going to be the year for small molecules, particularly for GLP-1s.\u201d",

Patients were dialysis-dependent and were new users of denosumab (n = 658) or oral bisphosphonates (n = 374) for osteoporosis. The mean age was 74.5 years and 62.9% were women. Compared with bisphosphonate users, those on denosumab had a longer mean time since initial diagnosis of osteoporosis and starting therapy, were more likely to have a history of diabetes, and had a greater likelihood of having undergone bone mineral density testing.\n\nOver 3-year follow-up, MACE occurred in 34.6% of denosumab users and 21% of bisphosphonate users. Acute MI occurred in 5.9% and 1.5%, respectively (weighted RR 3.50; 95% CI 1.44-21.40), while hospitalization for HF occurred in 11.8% and 8.2%, respectively (weighted RR 1.31; 95% CI 0.74-2.18).\n\nHopefully the folks who are more expert in these therapies can continue to dig into this more and get us the information we need to know. Geoff Barnes\n\nCardiovascular death was high in both groups at 23.8% for the denosumab patients and 18.1% for those on bisphosphonates (weighted RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.70-1.53). Total mortality also was high at 28.4% and 22.6%, respectively (weighted RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.72-1.48).\n\nComposite fracture (including vertebral, hip, pelvis, femur, leg, ankle, shoulder, arm, forearm, and wrist) occurred in 5.7% of denosumab users and 11.7% of bisphosphate users.\n\nIn subgroup analyses, denosumab users with a duration since first eligibility for fracture therapy exceeding 18 months had a MACE rate at 3 years of 14.9%, compared with 4.1% for those with a shorter time since first eligibility. Longer duration since first eligibility was associated with a -2.4% risk of composite fracture, compared with -9.9% for those with shorter durations.\n\nMasuda and colleagues note that safety data in dialysis-dependent patients on denosumab is scarce, but that their findings are consistent with a recent meta-analysis of postmenopausal women taking denosumab for osteoporosis, which found a 46% increase in CV events compared with bisphosphonates.\n\nWhile bisphosphonates have been hypothesized to reduce coronary calcification and have anti-inflammatory effects on vascular cells, the authors say denosumab carries a higher risk for severe hypocalcemia in dialysis-dependent patients, which may increase the risk for some CV events.\n\n\u201cAlthough we found increased rates of hypocalcemia with denosumab based on claims data, these mostly occurred within a few weeks after administration of treatments and may not fully explain the differences in MACE, which were greater after 6 months,\u201d Masuda and colleagues write. \u201cWe did not have actual clinical or laboratory data, and future studies are needed to confirm this potential mechanism.\u201d\n\nHigh MACE Rate Overall\n\nAnother area of uncertainty is whether denosumab is more likely to be prescribed in patients with more severe kidney disease or risk factors, \u201cwhich would have biased the findings toward overestimation of cardiovascular event risk with denosumab use,\u201d they add.\n\nAccording to Barnes, the high rate of CV events in both treatment groups is a key takeaway.\n\n\u201cOne in five developed MACE over 3 years with the bisphosphonates, and one in three with denosumab. That\u2019s really staggering. It highlights the fact that when our patients have end-stage renal disease, they are at very high risk of adverse cardiovascular events,\u201d he said.\n\nYet another consideration in this patient population is that bisphosphonates can be associated with worsening of kidney disease, potentially making denosumab the better option for fracture prevention depending on what the primary concerns are for an individual patient and their risk factors for CV disease, Barnes said.\n\n\u201cIf you have somebody who\u2019s maybe a CKD stage 3 or CKD stage 4 where we are very concerned about progression, you might think about selecting your therapies differently [than in] someone with a lower stage of disease [where] you\u2019re thinking primarily about the impact on their cardiovascular health,\u201d he added.",

( ) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 78% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Amgen.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amgen?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nAmgen already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Amgen, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Amgen. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.7% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.6% and 5.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Amgen\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Amgen Inc..

The TGL will be very different from the other leagues since it will be completely tech-based played at the 250,000 square-foot venue with a massive simulator screen.\n\nThe players will be teeing off against the screen instead of the field. And as it turns out, the promotions are still in full swing. They are expanding beyond the golf world. Take the Sunday ESPN interview for instance. Rory McIlroy provided a preview of what the fans could be expecting for the inaugural season of the new league.\n\nDuring halftime of Saturday\u2019s NFL matchup between the Baltimore Ravens and Cleveland Browns, Rory McIlroy joined ESPN commentator Scott Van Pelt to talk about the Tomorrow\u2019s Golf League \u2013 a tech-driven circuit that the Northern Irish golfer envisions will transform how the sport is both watched and played.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nHe started by saying, \u201cI think the first thing that I would like to have people know is it\u2019s golf, but it\u2019s reimagined. Sort of trying to take golf into the 21st century.\u201d The Northern Irishman went about further explaining the format of the event and what made the venue and everything so special about it.\n\nNow, this might be great news of excitement for the golf fans. But for the NFL fans, the interview was regarded as a sheer disrespect rather than news.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nNFL fans were enraged at ESPN for bringing Rory McIlroy in between the match\n\nThe entire season of TGL will be broadcast and streamed exclusively on ESPN platforms, featuring 15 regular-season matches, playoffs, and the top two teams battling for the SoFi Cup in a best-of-three Finals Series on Monday, March 24, and Tuesday, March 25. And so, ESPN brought in Rory McIlroy to promote the event on their channel before airing it. But the backlashes were unexpected. While one of them sarcastically wrote, \u201cAnd now let\u2019s bring in respected ESPN NFL analyst, Rory McIlroy to get his thoughts on that first half\u2026\u201d While another commented, \u201cRory McIlroy on to promote a new golf league at halftime tells you all you need to know about what ESPN thinks of this #Browns #Ravens game.\u201d\n\nColt McCoy is a quarterback for the Arizona Cardinals in the NFL. Having joined the team in 2019, McCoy has served as a reliable backup to starting quarterback Kyler Murray. Known for his experience and poise, McCoy has stepped in during key moments when Murray has been injured, providing steady play and leadership. Now, having him during the halftime would have made much more sense rather than having McIlroy there. Taking to this, one of them even wrote, \u201cThat man, Rory Mcilroy, popped up on my screen, and u thought it was Colt McCoy for a second \u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nTGL has been receiving a lot of backlash. From not being able to create a good enough logo for the league, to copying practically everything from LIV Golf, fans have accused it of a lot of things. And while the format might sound interesting, a lot of people think bringing in the technology will make it lose the essence of the traditions of conventional golf. Well, the comments section had similar remarks against the league too. People left comments like, \u201cThis golf league Rory Mcilroy is plugging on ESPN is just guys playing Wii Golf but with actual clubs\u201d and \u201cRory McIlroy made a new golf that\u2019s just Top Golf.\u201d\n\nWhat are your thoughts about TGL?

            "content": "No one knows for sure what the new year will hold for the market. However, some stocks' chances for success look particularly good.\n\nWe asked three Motley Fool contributors to pick healthcare stocks they think could be big winners in 2025. Here's why they chose Amgen (AMGN 1.70%), Eli Lilly (LLY 0.06%), and Summit Therapeutics (SMMT -4.08%).\n\nAmgen is a mispriced stock with a ton of upside\n\nDavid Jagielski (Amgen): Shares of Amgen started crashing in late November following the release of data from a phase 2 clinical trial for its weight loss candidate, MariTide. I think that plunge set the stock up for some serious gains in 2025.\n\nWhen I read that the stock price was falling because Amgen's monthly injection only helped people lose an average of 20% of their body weight after 52 weeks -- as opposed to the 25% that analysts were expecting -- I thought it was truly indicative of how speculative the markets have become. Seemingly everything has been reduced to whether something beats expectations, whether it's an earnings result or data from a clinical trial. Forget the fact that the data didn't indicate that participants' weight loss had plateaued (suggesting further weight loss could be attainable over longer periods of use), or that some patients took MariTide even less frequently than once a month. No, the market's whole response gets reduced down to whether the treatment candidate met expectations. It didn't, so let the selling begin.\n\nBut for those who want to buy the stock, and who see the results for what they are -- a clear indication that MariTide is a promising treatment that could be a more attractive alternative to weekly injections from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) -- the sell-off is great news.\n\nWhen the markets overreact like this, it creates a chance for investors to jump in and get a stock at a discount. Such opportunities may not last for long. I think that as cooler heads prevail and investors realize the study's results really weren't that bad at all, Amgen's stock will more than recoup the losses it has incurred in recent weeks.\n\nThis top healthcare company trades at 13 times forward earnings. It has a diverse portfolio of products, yields 3.6% at the current share price, and has a GLP-1/GIPR combination treatment in the works that could offer serious competition to Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. I think Amgen is hands down one of the best healthcare stocks to buy right now.\n\nMultiple catalysts on the horizon\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny (Eli Lilly): Despite a recent pullback, Eli Lilly's shares are up by 32% over the past year. And in 2025, the company could turn in yet another excellent performance, as it generally has over the past decade. Several catalysts could jolt the drugmaker's stock price this year.\n\nFirst, tirzepatide, which it markets as Zepbound and Mounjaro, could earn label expansions, including for reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\nThere will also be clinical readouts for the medicine as it is being tested for other conditions such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, an area with a high unmet need. Positive results could help Eli Lilly's shares move in the right direction.\n\nSecond, the company has other exciting pipeline programs, some of which will make progress next year. Eli Lilly's work in the weight loss area looks particularly exciting. Its late-stage pipeline features retatrutide and orforglipron, two potential weight loss treatments, and it has many others in the early stages of development. Good news on the R&D front could be a major catalyst for Eli Lilly's share price.\n\nLastly, the pharmaceutical giant's financial results should remain strong. Besides the fact that Zepbound and Mounjaro will continue to grow their sales rapidly, and that its other established medicines are still performing well, newer products could start making an impact. That's especially the case for Kisunla, a therapy for Alzheimer's that earned regulatory approval in July. With all that going Eli Lilly's way, the stock could once again deliver market-beating returns in 2025.\n\nHowever, regardless of what happens in the next 12 months, Eli Lilly is an excellent stock to buy and hold for the long term.\n\nPoised for another explosive year\n\nKeith Speights (Summit Therapeutics): Shares of Summit Therapeutics skyrocketed by 583% in 2024. The main catalyst behind this staggering gain was great news from a phase 3 study of ivonescimab in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, that clinical trial was conducted by Summit's partner, Chinese drugmaker Akeso.\n\nI think Summit Therapeutics is poised for another explosive year, and there's one simple reason behind my optimism: It should report results from its own late-stage study near mid-year. Granted, this trial is evaluating ivonescimab in combination with chemotherapy as a second-line treatment for NSCLC instead of as a first-line treatment, which was the case in the Akeso study. But if the results look good, it could set the stage for Summit to advance toward the regulatory approval of its first product.\n\nWhile Akeso's study didn't directly benefit Summit, investors understood its significance for the Florida-based drugmaker. Ivonescimab beat Merck's blockbuster cancer immunotherapy Keytruda in a head-to-head study -- something that had never happened before. The stellar results from Akeso's late-stage study bode well for Summit's study.\n\nSummit isn't staking all of its fortunes on ivonescimab in the second-line setting for NSCLC, either. The company has a phase 3 study underway of the drug in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for NSCLC. It also plans to initiate another late-stage study early this year of ivonescimab as a monotherapy in the first-line setting.\n\nEven without a product on the market yet, Summit's market cap stands at around $13.5 billion. If the candidate's late-stage results are positive (and I think they will be), this up-and-coming drugmaker could quickly grow much larger.",

            "content": "Lawsuits concerning medicinal products are still a rarity at the Unified Patent Court. Alexion is in dispute with Amgen and Samsung Bioepis over Soliris, a drug for treating rare blood diseases. Amgen and Sanofi extended their epic battles over the cholesterol-lowering drugs Repatha and Praluent respectively. Sanofi has also challenged various generics manufacturers such as Accord over cancer drug cabazitaxel, while GSK sued Pfizer over a patent regarding an RSV vaccine.\n\nBut compared to the number of mobile communications and medical devices cases, pharmaceutical cases at the UPC are still few and far between. Now, however, the next major dispute is on the horizon. Accord filed a declaration of non-infringement with the Milan central division at the end of November. Andrea Postiglione will lead the case as presiding judge, assisted by Dutch judge Marije Knijff.\n\nThe secret sauce\n\nThe exact motions are not known to JUVE Patent. What is certain, however, is that Accord wants to establish that its product for the active ingredient nilotinib does not infringe Novartis patent EP 2 501 384. The patent protects a method of treating proliferative disorders and other pathological conditions mediated by BCR-ABL, C-KIT, DDR1, DDR2 or PDGF-R kinase activity. In simpler terms, it protects the administration of the active ingredient nilotonib together with apple sauce.\n\nNilotonib is an anti-cancer medication used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) but Novartis is also currently researching its use in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The company sells nilotonib under the brand name Tasigna. Nilotonib is mainly administered in the form of capsules. Novartis recommends taking the capsules on an empty stomach because taking it with food can lead to side effects. However, this poses problems for patients with difficulties swallowing. Administration with apple sauce therefore ought to alleviate this.\n\nThe basic patent for nilotonib has already expired, which makes the market entry of generic products likely. In August 2024, for example, Accord received approval for a generic hard-capsule preparation called Nilotinib Accord. However, Accord is not yet selling this.\n\nAccord has already carved out the new form of administration together with apple sauce from is labels. By means of its declaration of non-infringement lawsuit in Milan, Accord now apparently wants to establish that its generic product is not at risk from an infringement suit at the UPC or national courts in Europe. Originators usually file PI applications against new generic products.\n\nOpt-out, opt-in\n\nIn 2023, Novartis initially opted EP 384 out of the UPC\u2019s jurisdiction. In June 2024 the Swiss company then withdrew the opt-out. Generic drug manufacturers are likely to have understood this as a preparatory measure for attacks on generic nilotinib products. So far, however, JUVE Patent is not aware of any lawsuits filed by Novartis.\n\nPreviously, the patent\u2019s path to grant was eventful. In 2018, the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office initially withdrew the grant of EP 384 due to a lack of inventive step. Various pharmaceutical companies and law firms had filed oppositions against the grant as straw men. However, Novartis, with the support of Hoffmann Eitle, appealed against the decision to the EPO Boards of Appeal. They then granted EP 384 in amended form in 2023.\n\nAccord and Novartis no newcomers\n\nBoth companies already have experience with UPC lawsuits. Novartis, for example, sued Celltrion at the local division D\u00fcsseldorf for infringing a patent for the asthma drug Xolair but failed to get a PI in September 2024. Accord is one of the generics companies sued by Sanofi regarding cancer drug cabazitaxel.\n\nNovartis is relying on Bristows partners Gregory Bacon and Brian Cordery for the dispute with Accord. Novartis is one of the UK law firm\u2019s most important clients. Bacon is a UK solicitor, but also has a licence in Belgium and therefore with the UPC.\n\nBristows backed the UPC early on, even after the UK pulled out of the UPC project. So far, however, the patent team has only represented Winnow Solutions in a suit concerning a technology for food waste monitoring at the local division The Hague. The Novartis case is therefore a success for the UK law firm \u2014 especially if active infringement claims extend the dispute.\n\nIn the dispute with Celltrion, Novartis is relying on lawyers from Freshfields and Carpmaels & Ransford. Both law firms are also regular advisors to the Swiss pharmaceutical giant.\n\nTaylor Wessing for Accord\n\nTaylor Wessing is currently one of the busiest law firms at the UPC. It is highly active for Abbott, for example, in medical devices proceedings against Dexcom. In the pharmaceuticals segment, the firm has so far only represented Zentiva in the dispute with Sanofi. Here, Accord relies on a team from Pinsent Masons.\n\nFor the lawsuit against Novartis at the Milan central division, however, Accord chose the Dutch Taylor Wessing partner Wim Maas. Alexander Rubusch from D\u00fcsseldorf, David Mulder and Iris van der Heijdt from the Amsterdam office and Charlotte Garnitsch from Eindhoven complete the team. According to JUVE Patent information, Accord has also retained Fabrizio Jacobacci from the law firm of the same name as local advisor in Milan.",

Along the way, Carter collaborated with some of the biggest pharma companies in the world to deliver innovations that addressed daunting global challenges.\n\nLaunched a few years after his re-election loss in 1980, The Carter Center pulled together a range of major partners including multiple governments, official health organizations, large philanthropic foundations and pharma companies.

That got the ball rolling for the former president and his organization to branch out to other infectious diseases, invoking the help of the pharmaceutical sector for needed treatments.\n\n\u201cAs a tireless advocate for health and social justice, President Carter was a compassionate and committed voice for impoverished communities worldwide,\u201d the World Health Organization wrote in tribute. \u201cHis unwavering dedication to combating neglected tropical diseases leaves an unparalleled legacy in global health, saving millions from debilitating illnesses.\u201d\n\nHere are some of the pharma companies that joined Carter in his efforts to leverage the powerful public platform for good.\n\nMerck & Co.\n\nMerck teamed up with The Carter Center in the 1980s to work toward eradicating river blindness, an infectious disease that primarily affects African countries. What started as a large donation of the antiparasitic drug ivermectin \u2014 which was branded as Mectizan and also a part of Merck\u2019s veterinary portfolio \u2014 became a promise to donate \u201cas much as needed, for as long as needed\u201d to treat patients with river blindness, according to a Merck tribute. The drug has been free for that purpose since 1987.\n\nCarter and then-Merck CEO Dr. Roy Vagelos visited Chad together in 1994, where they distributed Mectizan for a small village in which nearly everyone was afflicted with the disease, according to a release at the time.\n\n\"The Mectizan donation story is a powerful reminder that it is possible to help people change their lives,\" Carter said. \"This partnership among private, public and nonprofit organizations has significantly improved the health of millions of Africans who are at risk for river blindness.\"\n\nMuch later, when Carter was diagnosed with melanoma in 2015, the former president received Merck\u2019s leading cancer drug Keytruda as a treatment.\n\nGSK\n\nIn 1998, an executive from the company called SmithKline Beecham spoke with Carter and offered to become part of a drug donation program. The former president immediately took the executive up on the offer, according to a report this week in the New York Times.\n\nThe U.K. drugmaker, now GSK, has worked with The Carter Center since that time to donate and distribute the medicine albendazole \u2014 along with Merck\u2019s Mectizan \u2014 to treat lymphatic filariasis, a mosquito-borne disease also known as elephantiasis. The disfiguring disease affects millions in Nigeria and nearby African countries.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\n\nJ&J has collaborated with The Carter Center since the early 2000s to provide medical supplies and consumer products like Tylenol and Neosporin to countries impacted by Guinea worm. The supplies have helped communities in Africa mitigate infections, according to The Carter Center.\n\n\"With less than [3%] of the original caseload left to tackle, this significant new corporate commitment from Johnson & Johnson provides critical momentum for total eradication,\" President Carter said in a 2001 release when J&J donated supplies.\n\nThe company has continued to provide support to treat neglected tropical diseases.\n\nPfizer\n\nPfizer and The Carter Center have worked together since 1998 to bring hundreds of millions of doses of the antibiotic Zithromax to sub-Saharan Africa in the fight against the infectious eye disease blinding trachoma. Along with the International Trachoma Initiative, the company has now donated 1 billion doses to more than 40 countries.\n\n\u201cThe Pfizer donation of Zithromax was momentous in trachoma control, and The Carter Center was pleased to go to scale in trachoma endemic countries to get the medicine into the villages and demonstrate the world could end blinding trachoma,\u201d Carter said in 2013, celebrating 15 years of collaboration.\n\nAmgen\n\nCarter visited Amgen\u2019s headquarters in 1991 to thank the company for donating 398,000 vials of the anemia treatment Epogen to China through The Carter Center. The company commemorated the moment in a post on LinkedIn early last year.",

            "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average contains 30 handpicked companies that are, or at least once were, leaders in their respective industries. This makes the index an interesting hunting ground for high-yield stocks. Right now the three highest yielding Dow stocks are Verizon Communications (VZ 0.64%), Chevron (CVX -1.18%), and Amgen (AMGN 1.70%). They are all worth looking at right now, but are any of them worth buying?\n\n1. Verizon has its work cut out for it\n\nVerizon is one of the largest telecom companies in the United States. It holds a material share of the cellphone market, offers high-speed connections to people's homes, and provides video services. Since it would be very difficult to build a competitor from scratch, Verizon's industry position is very strong. That's highlighted by the two decades of annual dividend increases it has laid down. Add in a lofty 6.8% yield and investors should probably find the company attractive.\n\nThere's just one big caveat that you have to consider. In order to protect its industry position, Verizon must constantly invest in its business via large capital projects. As new technology arrives Verizon has to integrate it into its service or it will fall behind, and its competitors, which are also large and well-positioned, will steal customers away.\n\nAlone, this fact isn't too troubling, but Verizon happens to carry more leverage than either of its two closest peers. In this way, it is at a bit of a competitive disadvantage. That said, the lofty yield, strong dividend history, and industry position suggest that the risk/reward balance here is probably worthwhile for investors willing to take on a little risk.\n\n2. Chevron isn't at the top of its game\n\nChevron is one of the largest integrated energy companies in the world. Having exposure across the energy landscape helps to soften the peaks and valleys inherent to the energy sector, given the volatility of oil and natural gas. For most investors, an integrated energy company like Chevron will be the best option for investing in the sector. Chevron backs that up with a 37-year streak of annual dividend increases and a very low debt-to-equity ratio of roughly 0.2. The dividend yield is an attractive 4.5%.\n\nThat yield, however, is notably higher than ExxonMobil's 3.7%. Exxon is Chevron's closet peer. So what's going on? For starters, Chevron's core business isn't doing as well as Exxon's right now. Businesses ebb and flow over time; given Chevron's long history of success this probably shouldn't worry long-term investors too much.\n\nChevron is also in the middle of buying Hess, but the process has been a bit of a struggle. One key reason for this acquisition problem is that Hess has a business relationship with Exxon that has turned into a major roadblock. And yet, even if the Hess deal falls apart, Chevron could easily find another acquisition target if it wanted.\n\nAll in, it seems like Chevron is being punished for short-term problems. That is probably opening up a long-term opportunity for dividend investors.\n\n3. Amgen is working on getting its mojo back\n\nAmgen is one of the largest biotech companies you can buy. It has a storied history, including 13 consecutive annual dividend increases. To be sure, this healthcare company is a pretty complex investment. If you don't want to dig into the finer details of medical trials and research pipelines, you probably shouldn't buy it. However, it has a long and successful track record of producing valuable, life-saving medications. The yield is around 3.6% today, which happens to be at the high end of the stock's historical yield range.\n\nRecent history has been a bit tough, as you might expect given the relatively lofty yield. Biosimilar drugs have been gaining traction and eating away at some of Amgen's biggest successes. The company's pipeline hasn't exactly been hitting it out of the park. And some new launches aren't doing as well as hoped. That's a trifecta of bad news.\n\nHowever, no company goes through life without eventually experiencing weak patches. Given Amgen's long-term success and the fact that it often acts as an industry consolidator, it seems likely that this biotech giant will get back on track at some point. As such, the historically high yield is probably a buying opportunity for those who think in decades and not days.\n\nMostly good options on the high-yield side of the Dow\n\nThere are always caveats when it comes to investing since every company has some warts to consider. But right now, the top high yielders in the Dow seem to offer more positives than negatives. Verizon's high leverage and heavy spending needs probably make it the riskiest option of the trio, but even there the risk/reward balance seems fairly desirable. If you are looking at Verizon, Chevron, and Amgen, and have a long-term investment horizon, you'll probably want to pull the trigger on at least one as 2025 gets underway.",

Early drug development attempts ran into problems, however, most notably when AbbVie abandoned the development of Rova-T, an anti-DLL3 ADC acquired as part of a $5.8 billion takeover of Stemcentrx, after a phase 3 failure as a post-chemo maintenance therapy in SCLC.\n\nAccording to Innovent, IBI3009 has shown encouraging anti-tumour activity in multiple animal models, particularly in chemo-resistant cancer types, and has also demonstrated a \"favourable safety profile.\"\n\nTolerability could be an important differentiator for the drug, as Imdelltra does have safety issues, with its FDA-approved label, including a boxed warning for cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicities, including immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS).\n\nDespite that, analysts have suggested that Imdelltra could reach annual sales of $2 billion if it also gets approval for patients with limited-stage SCLC who have not progressed following chemoradiation therapy, a follow-up indication. Amgen priced its drug at $166,500 per patient course.\n\nThere's a long way to go before Roche can see if IBI3009 will be a contender that can take on Imdelltra, but it has been cleared for clinical testing in China, the US, and Australia, with the first patient dosed in December. The two companies will work together on the early-stage development of the ADC, after which Roche will take over full development if it passes muster.\n\nOther companies with DLL3 programmes in clinical testing include Boehringer Ingelheim with BI 764532, a CD3xDLL3 bispecific in phase 2 development for advanced or metastatic DLL3-expressing large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) of the lung, and MSD's MK-6070, a DLL3-targeting T-cell engager acquired as part of its takeover of Harpoon Therapeutics, which is in a phase 1/2 study.",

            "content": "It was only a matter of time before Panasonic formally ended its global patent dispute with Xiaomi and Oppo. The patent holder and the two Chinese implementers had already reached an agreement in principle in October. The UPC local division Mannheim thus did not hear proceedings between Panasonic and Xiaomi that month. However, the parallel dispute with Oppo continued.\n\nLD Munich accepts claim withdrawal\n\nTwo decisions from the local division Munich, where Panasonic had sued both Chinese mobile phone manufacturers, now show that the companies applied to withdraw the lawsuits and the court has confirmed this. With regard to Xiaomi, this concerns the lawsuits UPC_CFI_213/2023, UPC_CFI_220/2023 and UPC_CFI_224/2023. With regard to Oppo, the lawsuits UPC_CFI_208/2024, UPC_CFI_221/2024 and UPC_CFI_225/2024 have now been dropped.\n\nAccording to JUVE Patent information, Xiaomi and Oppo reached a final agreement with Panasonic before Christmas and signed corresponding settlement agreements. As a result, the parties have applied to the local division to withdraw the lawsuits, and the same should also apply to the lawsuits at the regional courts of Mannheim and Munich. However, the courts have not yet announced any corresponding decisions.\n\nThe agreement in principle came after the UK Court of Appeal found Panasonic an unwilling licensor and obliged the company to accept an interim licence for Xiaomi. Both companies quickly agreed on general terms of a settlement.\n\nAlthough Oppo did not join Xiaomi\u2019s UK claim on a FRAND rate determination, the ruling had an impact on the UPC cases. Mid-October, Panasonic and Oppo also agreed on general terms of a settlement. Prior to this, the Mannheim local division had held an initial FRAND hearing in the case.\n\nIt then took around two months for both companies to sign the settlement agreement, and in the meantime the Mannheim local division ruled against Oppo for infringing one of Panasonic\u2019s SEPs. The judgment is now considered fundamental for all subsequent SEP and FRAND proceedings at the UPC.\n\nThe two companies will meet again on 16 January at the local division in Munich for an interim hearing in a parallel infringement suit by Huawei. The oral hearing will then take place on 25 March 2025.\n\nFirst AASI order\n\nShortly before Christmas, the local division Munich issued a so-called anti-anti-suit injunction in the dispute between Huawei and Netgear over wifi-6 technology. The court has now published its decision (case ID: UPC_CFI_791/2024).\n\nIt prohibits Netgear from pursuing an anti-suit or anti-enforcement application at the US District Court of California. The judgment also prohibits the company from pursuing or even enforcing ASI motions directed against proceedings at the UPC in the future.\n\nThe Munich local division under presiding judge Matthias Zigann issued the ex-parte decision on 11 December. The division published the decision on 27 December. It is the UPC\u2019s first published decision on an AASI application to date. JUVE Patent is not aware of any other ASI or AASI decisions in other disputes.\n\nThe Munich Regional Court is also said to have approved a corresponding application by Huawei and issued an AASI against Netgear. However, the court has not yet confirmed this to JUVE Patent.\n\nASI withdrawn in US\n\nBefore Christmas Netgear withdrew its ASI application in the US. On 4 December Netgear had filed a motion with the District Court of California (case ID: 2:24-cv-00824-AB-AJRx) requesting the court enjoin Huawei from seeking or enforcing injunctions obtained through proceedings in foreign courts which would enjoin the manufacturing or sale of Netgear wifi-capable products based on SEPs subject to the worldwide licensing claims filed by Netgear at the California Federal Court.\n\nNetgear also requested the court set an interim licence, but apparently did not withdraw this request.\n\nNetgear\u2019s application was likely directed against a potential injunction from the local division Munich. On 18 December the local division ruled against Netgear and banned the company from selling wifi-6-capable routers in Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy and Sweden.\n\nAs in the infringement dispute, Huawei was represented in the AASI application by a Bird & Bird team led by Christian Harmsen and a team led by Tobias Hessel from Clifford Chance. A Freshfields team led by Stephan Dorn and Frank-Erich Hufnagel generally represents Netgear in the disputes with Huawei at the UPC, but did not appear in the ex-parte proceedings.\n\nAlexion unsuccessful at Court of Appeal\n\nWith its two PI applications against Amgen and Samsung Bioepis, Alexion has now also failed before the UPC Court of Appeal. Under its president Klaus Grabinski, the first senate of the Court of Appeal comprising Peter Blok, Emmanuel Goug\u00e9 and the two technically qualified judges Eric Enderlin, and Anna Hedberg rejected Alexion\u2019s appeal against the rulings from the local division Hamburg (case IDs: UPC_CoA_405/2024 and UPC_CoA_402/2024).\n\nIn July 2024, AstraZeneca subsidiary Alexion had failed to gain PIs against Amgen and Samsung Bioepis at the local division Hamburg. The court under presiding judge Sabine Klepsch found infringement, but had doubts that Alexion\u2019s patent EP 3 167 888 B1 would survive an opposition at the EPO and thus rejected the applications.\n\nAlexion wanted the court to prohibit Amgen and Samsung Bioepis from selling their drugs, Bekemv and Epysqli respectively, for treating rare blood diseases in the UPC territory. The two products are based on biosimilars of the antibody eculizumab. Alexion markets the original product under the brand name Soliris. The EPO had granted EP 888, whereupon Samsung Bioepis filed an opposition in May 2024. In addition, Amgen filed a central revocation action against EP 888 with the UPC\u2019s central division in Paris (case ID: ACT_59173/2024).\n\nDoubts for opposition\n\nThe Court of Appeal in Luxembourg has now confirmed the decision of the local division Hamburg. The appeal judges also have doubts that EP 888 will survive the EPO opposition proceedings. According to their own case law, UPC courts may not issue PIs in such cases. The dispute is worth \u20ac100 million.\n\nAlexion had filed the PIs with the help of a German lawyer team from Freshfields around Wolrad Prinz zu Waldeck und Pyrmont, Christopher Stothers and Elena Hennecke. The team also included Gregor K\u00f6nig and Claudia Hertzsch from D\u00fcsseldorf patent attorney firm K\u00f6nig Szynka Tilmann von Renesse.\n\nAmgen retained a Bardehle Pagenberg team consisting of lawyers Tilman M\u00fcller-Stoy, Tobias Wuttke and Dominik Woll and patent attorneys Axel Berger and Markus Ackermann. Osborne Clark UK partner Tim Harris was also present on behalf of Amgen.\n\nSamsung Bioepis relied on Simmons & Simmons lawyers Peter Meyer, Scott Parker, Andrea Ritter and Elsa Glauert as well as patent attorney Fritz Lahrtz.\n\nThe parties are also facing off in the US, as well as in revocation actions at national courts in the UK and the Netherlands. In Germany, Alexion and Amgen were involved in a case concerning orphan drug exclusivity.",

This activates the T cells to attack SCLC cells that express DLL3 directly.\n\nTarlatamab is the first therapy approved in the U.S. for treating SCLC. On May 16, 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to tarlatamab monotherapy for treating adult patients with expanded-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) whose disease progressed during or after platinum-based chemotherapy, based on encouraging response rates and duration of response observed in early clinical trials of tarlatamab.\n\nKorean physicians and patients also played an essential role in the development of tarlatamab, including Professor Ahn Myung-ju of the Department of Hematology-Oncology at Samsung Medical Center, who was the first author of the phase 2 DeLLphi-301 study that led to the FDA approval and helped determine the approved dose of tarlatamab.\n\nAmgen is also conducting a randomized, open-label phase 3 study (DeLLphi-304) comparing tarlatamab to the standard of care in patients with SCLC who have relapsed after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy as a confirmatory trial for full FDA approval, which is expected to enroll about 400 patients in Korea. This is the largest number in Asia, suggesting a robust level of data for tarlatamab in Koreans.\n\nSCLC, which accounts for about 10-15 percent of all lung cancers, is known to metastasize faster and have a poorer prognosis than non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nCurrently, only a limited number of new drugs for SCLC are available in Korea. The immuno-oncology drug Imfinzi (dervalumab) and the chemotherapy drug Zepzelca (lurbinectetin) are licensed for treating extended-stage SCLC. However, neither of these drugs is covered by health insurance, putting a heavy financial burden on patients.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, tarlatamab has emerged as a new treatment option and is gaining attention. Notably, solid clinical data led by Korean researchers and the U.S. FDA's quick approval have raised the expectations of Korean doctors and patients.\n\nAmgen Korea applied to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety for approval of tarlatamab last year and expects approval in the first half of this year.",

This usually means that there are no clear support levels at this time, so buying the stock as it falls could be considered catching a falling knife. Buy signals only exist if resistance breaks higher.\n\nThis often is a signal that the stock you are watching is weak. Waiting for a turn higher may be more intelligent than trying to catch a falling knife. In any case, new support levels are usually revised to the database at the beginning of the next trading session. Short AMGN slightly under 275.37, target n/a, stop loss @ 276.17 Details The technical summary data is suggesting a short of AMGN as it gets near 275.37, but the downside target is not available from the current data. This tells us to hold that position if it is triggered until a new downside target has been established (updates occur at the beginning of every trading session) or until the position has been stopped. The summary data tells us to have a stop loss in place at 276.17. 275.37 is the first level of resistance above 260.64, and by rule, any test of resistance is a short signal.

They had witnessed a growth of 12.5 per cent in revenues from the US market in H1 FY2025.\n\nHowever, high incidences of warning letters and import alerts by the United States Food & Drug Administration (USFDA) remain a key credit risk. These not only lead to delays in product launches, but also failure in supplying penalties and the incurring of additional costs towards remedial measures, thus impacting revenue growth and profit margins.\n\nPharma companies have taken several measures to combat various US market-related risks. These include optimisation of product portfolio, cost saving measures and increased focus on complex molecules including injectables, inhalations, specialty products and biosimilars.",

The company has roughly three dozen individual drug lines, including well-known drugs such as Prolia, Embrel and Otezla. Recently, Amgen has been integrating drug lines from Horizon Therapeutics, the Irish pharmaceutical company that it acquired late last year.\n\nTo produce all these drugs, Amgen has a global manufacturing network, including facilities in its home state of California, Ohio, Rhode Island, Puerto Rico, Ireland, the Netherlands and Puerto Rico. The plant in Ohio, which is nearly 300,000 square feet, opened earlier this year.\n\nAmgen has long eyed the Holly Springs, North Carolina, area as a potential manufacturing hub because of its proximity to the biotech cluster in the Research Triangle Park area in the Raleigh-Durham metro region and its considerable talent pool.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina will be an important part of our global manufacturing network as we continue to meet the growing demand for our innovative therapies while generating significant local economic impact,\u201d Bradway said.\n\nIn 2021, the company announced its first plant in Holly Springs; ground was broken on that $550 million, 350,000-square-foot facility in March 2022, and it\u2019s expected to open early next year.\n\nThe company has not disclosed the square footage for this second plant, but if the $1 billion cost figure is any guide, it could should be nearly double the 350,000 square feet of the first facility.\n\nAccording to Amgen spokeswoman Elissa Snook, the company currently has about 220 employees in North Carolina. That number is expected to increase early next year as the first plant opens. After the second plant opens and ramps up production, Snook said the total employment at the two plants should reach about 725 by 2030.",

The NDA, which was completed in October 2024, has been granted Priority Review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of June 30, 2025. In addition, the FDA has stated that it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe FDA filing acceptance and Priority Review for the combination of avutometinib and defactinib underscores the critical unmet need among patients diagnosed with this rare and insidious disease. We are excited by today\u2019s news and to potentially bring the first ever FDA-approved treatment specifically for recurrent KRAS mutant LGSOC to patients in the U.S.,\u201d said Dan Paterson, president and chief executive officer of Verastem Oncology. \u201cWith the acceptance of this NDA, we\u2019re taking an important step forward in addressing a condition that has long been overlooked, and we look forward to working with the FDA during its review process and preparing for a commercial launch in mid-2025.\u201d\n\nThere are currently no FDA-approved treatments specifically for LGSOC, a rare and distinct ovarian cancer that differs from high-grade serous ovarian cancer in both its biology and how it responds to treatment. Priority Review is granted by the FDA for treatments that offer, if approved, significant improvements over available options or that provide a treatment option where no adequate or approved therapy currently exists.\n\nThe filing was based on a primary analysis of the Phase 2 RAMP 201 clinical trial that evaluated the combination of avutometinib and defactinib in patients with recurrent LGSOC. The results were presented in an oral presentation at the International Gynecologic Cancer Society (IGCS) Annual Global Meeting in October 2024 and demonstrated that the combination of avutometinib plus defactinib resulted in a substantial overall response rate confirmed by blinded independent central review, with responses that were typically durable, and that the combination was generally well-tolerated in patients with recurrent KRAS mutant LGSOC. The NDA also includes supportive data from the FRAME Phase 1 trial, the first study conducted with the combination therapy in recurrent LGSOC.\n\nThe Company is currently enrolling patients with recurrent LGSOC regardless of KRAS mutation status for RAMP 301, an international Phase 3 trial, which will serve as a confirmatory study for the initial indication and has the potential to support an expanded indication regardless of KRAS mutation status.\n\nAbout RAMP 201\n\nRAMP 201 (ENGOTov60/GOG3052) (NCT04625270) is an adaptive, two-part multicenter, parallel cohort, randomized, open-label Phase 2 registration-directed trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of avutometinib alone and in combination with defactinib in patients with recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC). The first part of the study (Part A) determined the selection of the go-forward regimen, which was the combination of avutometinib and defactinib versus avutometinib alone, based on overall response rates. The expansion phases of the trial (Parts B and C) are evaluating the safety and efficacy of the go-forward regimen of avutometinib 3.2 mg twice weekly and defactinib 200 mg twice daily. The Part D portion of the trial is evaluating a low dose of avutometinib in combination with defactinib to inform individualized dose reduction.\n\nAbout Low-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (LGSOC)\n\nLGSOC is a rare ovarian cancer that is insidious, persistent, and ultimately fatal. LGSOC is distinct and different from high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and requires different treatment. LGSOC is highly recurrent and less sensitive to chemotherapy compared to HGSOC. Approximately 6,000-8,000 women in the U.S. and 80,000 worldwide are living with this disease. LGSOC affects younger women with bimodal peaks of diagnosis at ages between 20-30 and 50-60 and has a median survival of approximately ten years. The majority of patients report a negative impact of LGSOC on their mental and physical health, fertility, and long-term quality of life. The current standard of care for this disease includes hormone therapy and chemotherapy, but there are no treatments specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat LGSOC.\n\nAbout the Avutometinib and Defactinib Combination\n\nAvutometinib is an oral RAF/MEK clamp that potentially inhibits MEK1/2 kinase activities and induces inactive complexes of MEK with ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF, potentially creating a more complete and durable anti-tumor response through maximal RAS/MAPK pathway inhibition. In contrast to currently available MEK-only inhibitors, avutometinib blocks both MEK kinase activity and the ability of RAF to phosphorylate MEK. This unique mechanism allows avutometinib to block MEK signaling without the compensatory activation of MEK that appears to limit the efficacy of the MEK-only inhibitors.\n\nDefactinib is an oral, selective inhibitor of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and proline-rich tyrosine kinase-2 (Pyk2), the two members of the focal adhesion kinase family of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases. FAK and Pyk2 integrate signals from integrin and growth factor receptors to regulate cell proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion. FAK activation has been shown to mediate resistance to multiple anti-cancer agents, including RAF and MEK inhibitors.\n\nVerastem Oncology is currently conducting clinical trials with avutometinib with and without defactinib in RAS/MAPK-driven tumors as part of its Raf And Mek Program or RAMP. Verastem is currently enrolling patients and activating sites for RAMP 301 (GOG-3097/ENGOT-ov81/NCRI) (NCT06072781), an international Phase 3 confirmatory trial evaluating the combination of avutometinib and defactinib versus standard chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for the treatment of recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC).\n\nVerastem was granted Priority Review and a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of June 30, 2025, for its New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for the investigational combination of avutometinib and defactinib in adults with recurrent KRAS mutant LGSOC who received at least one prior systemic therapy. Verastem initiated a rolling NDA in May 2024 to the FDA and completed its NDA submission in October 2024. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of patients with recurrent LGSOC after one or more prior lines of therapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy, in May 2021. Avutometinib alone or in combination with defactinib was also granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of LGSOC.\n\nVerastem Oncology has established a clinical collaboration with Amgen to evaluate LUMAKRAS\u2122 (sotorasib) in combination with avutometinib and defactinib in both treatment-na\u00efve patients and in patients whose KRAS G12C mutant non-small cell lung cancer progressed on a G12C inhibitor as part of the RAMP 203 trial (NCT05074810). Verastem has received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for the triplet combination in April 2024. RAMP 205 (NCT05669482), a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating avutometinib and defactinib with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in patients with front-line metastatic pancreatic cancer, is supported by the PanCAN Therapeutic Accelerator Award. FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to the avutometinib and defactinib combination for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.\n\nAbout Verastem Oncology\n\nVerastem Oncology (Nasdaq: VSTM) is a late-stage development biopharmaceutical company committed to the development and commercialization of new medicines to improve the lives of patients diagnosed with cancer.

(VSTM, Financials) jumped 24.8% to $4.58. Setting a Prescription Drug User Fee Act action deadline of June 30, 2025, the FDA granted Priority Review, Verastem stated in a statement.\n\nShould approval be granted, the treatmentwhich is the first FDA-approved one expressly aimed at adults with recurrent KRAS mutant LGSOCwould Based on information from the Phase 2 RAMP 201 study, which showed notable response rates and tolerability for the combination treatment, the firm said, the application expands on data.\n\nWith few therapeutic choices, LGSOC is an uncommon kind of ovarian cancer afflicting between 6,0008,000 women in the United States. Verastem underlined the ability of the treatment to solve this unmet medical need.\n\nVerastem's president and CEO, Dan Paterson, hailed the FDA's approval as a major step toward giving patients a much needed medication. Depending on regulatory permission, the business is getting ready for a commercial release by mid-2025.\n\nEmphasizing its therapeutic potential, the FDA has additionally given Breakthrough Therapy and Orphan Drug Designations to the combo treatment. To assess more general uses of the treatment, Verastem is doing several studies including the Phase 3 RAMP 301 research.\n\nVerastem has teamed with Amgen (AMGN, Financials) to investigate in non-small cell lung cancer and other indications the combination of avutometinib, defactinib, and Amgen's KRAS inhibitor Lumakras. Initial results for this triplet treatment seem encouraging.\n\nVerastem's pipeline's emphasis is on RAS/MAPK-driven tumors, so the FDA's ruling might have a major influence on their treatment. It also emphasizes the rising importance of targeted treatments in changing oncology therapy.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

SCLC is one of the two main forms of primary lung cancer, accounting for around 1 in 7 of all lung cancers. It is less common than non-small-cell lung cancer and spreads more quickly.\n\nTarlatamab belongs to a group of medicines called antineoplastic agents, which kill cancer cells that rapidly divide.\n\nTarlatamab can only be prescribed to patients that have previously been treated with two other types of treatments and if those treatments did not work or are no longer working.\n\nJulian Beach, MHRA Interim Executive Director of Healthcare Quality and Access, said:\n\nThis approval is a great example of how international collaboration between trusted regulatory authorities under Project Orbis get can accelerate the approval of promising cancer treatments. We\u2019re assured that the appropriate regulatory standards of safety, quality and efficacy for the approval of tarlatamab have been met. As with all products, we will keep its safety under close review.\n\nTarlatamab is intended to be given through a vein (intravenously) as an infusion on three occasions in the first 3 weeks and then it is expected to be every 2 weeks thereafter.\n\nThe efficacy of Tarlatamab was primarily demonstrated in patients enrolled in a phase 2, open label multicentre trial, where tarlatamab was studied in patients with extensive-stage SCLC which had progressed or recurred following two previous lines of chemotherapy (with or without a checkpoint inhibitor).\n\nAn overall response rate of 40% was seen, and the median duration of response was 9.7 months. Overall, these results are encouraging in patients with advanced SCLC who have limited treatment options and for whom there is a high unmet need for effective treatment options.\n\nAs with any medicine, the MHRA will keep the safety and effectiveness of tarlatamab under close review. Anyone who suspects they are having a side effect from this medicine are encouraged to talk to their doctor, pharmacist or nurse and report it directly to the MHRA Yellow Card scheme, either through the website (https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) or by searching the Google Play or Apple App stores for MHRA Yellow Card.\n\nENDS\n\nNotes to editors",

Value investors often look for strong earnings strength from dividend stocks.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average includes many dividend-paying stocks, including many blue-chip companies that have consistently raised their dividends.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the top-yielding Dow Jones stocks heading into 2025.\n\nWhat Happened: The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record high of 45,000 in December as one of many stock indexes to post gains after the 2025 presidential election.\n\nAs of Dec. 27, 18 of the Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks have gained year-to-date, while 12 components are trading lower compared to the start of 2024.\n\nWhile investors can bet on the entire Dow Jones Industrial Average through ETFs like the Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF DIA, investors can also pick individual stocks from the 30 components of the index. Through Dec. 27, the ETF is up 13.4% year-to-date.\n\nOne popular strategy is to look at the \u201cDogs of the Dow,\u201d which often coincides with the beaten-down stocks of the index that also offer high dividend payouts.\n\nHere are the highest-yielding Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks to start 2025, with the dividend yield and stock performance in 2024 listed below.\n\nVerizon Communications VZ : 6.79% yield, +5.9% in 2024 Chevron Corporation CVX : 4.53% yield, -3.5% in 2024 Amgen Inc AMGN : 3.62% yield, -8.8% in 2024 Johnson & Johnson JNJ : 3.42% yield, -7.5% in 2024 Merck & Company MRK : 3.25% yield, -8.5% in 2024 Coca-Cola Company KO : 3.11% yield, +6.0% in 2025 International Business Machines IBM : 3% yield, +36.2% in 2024 Cisco Systems CSCO : 2.68% yield, +18.0% in 2024 McDonald's Corporation MCD : 2.41% yield, -1.0% in 2024 Procter & Gamble PG : 2.37% yield, +15.7% in 2024\n\nSeven of the top 10 highest-yielding stocks heading into 2025 also appeared on the top 10 list to start 2024 with Merck, McDonald's and Procter & Gamble the newcomers to the Dogs of the Dow list for the new year.\n\nRead Also: Nvidia Joining Dow Jones Industrial Average: Where Tech Giant Ranks In The Index, Why Sherwin-Williams Addition Could Be More Important\n\nComponent Changes Impact Yields: It's worth noting that dividend investors will have to look elsewhere to chase some of the higher-yielding stocks they have become accustomed to.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance WBA, which yields 10.40% and Dow Inc DOW, which yields 6.99% have been replaced and removed from the index.\n\nNew 2024 Dow Jones Industrial Average components don't come with high dividend yields. Sherwin-Williams Co SHW has a dividend yield of 0.80%, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA has a dividend yield of 0.03% and Amazon.com Inc AMZN does not pay a dividend.\n\nThis means that the yield on ETFs that track the Dow Jones Industrial Average will be lower, with the goal of potentially stronger returns by replacing the underperforming stocks with stocks that have performed better over the past five years.\n\nThe latest 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components see 28 stocks paying out dividends with Amazon and Boeing Co BA the exceptions.\n\nThe average dividend yield of the Dow Jones Industrial Average is around 2%.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nCongress Is Making Huge Investments.

It\u2019s next door to a $550 million facility that broke ground in 2022 and is set to open early next year.\n\n\u201cThis expansion underscores our unwavering focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients around the world,\u201d Robert Bradway, Amgen\u2019s chief executive, said in the announcement.\n\nAmgen is one of the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies with revenue last year of $28 billion and a global workforce of approximately 25,000. The company has roughly three dozen individual drug lines, including well-known drugs such as Prolia, Embrel and Otezla. Recently, Amgen has been integrating drug lines from Horizon Therapeutics, the Irish pharmaceutical company that it acquired late last year.\n\nTo produce all these drugs, Amgen has a global manufacturing network, including facilities in its home state of California, Ohio, Rhode Island, Puerto Rico, Ireland, the Netherlands and Puerto Rico. The plant in Ohio, which is nearly 300,000 square feet, opened earlier this year.\n\nAmgen has long eyed the Holly Springs, North Carolina, area as a potential manufacturing hub because of its proximity to the biotech cluster in the Research Triangle Park area in the Raleigh-Durham metro region and its considerable talent pool.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina will be an important part of our global manufacturing network as we continue to meet the growing demand for our innovative therapies while generating significant local economic impact,\u201d Bradway said.\n\nIn 2021, the company announced its first plant in Holly Springs; ground was broken on that $550 million, 350,000-square-foot facility in March 2022, and it\u2019s expected to open early next year.\n\nThe company has not disclosed the square footage for this second plant, but if the $1 billion cost figure is any guide, it could should be nearly double the 350,000 square feet of the first facility.\n\nAccording to Amgen spokeswoman Elissa Snook, the company currently has about 220 employees in North Carolina. That number is expected to increase early next year as the first plant opens. After the second plant opens and ramps up production, Snook said the total employment at the two plants should reach about 725 by 2030.",

(NASDAQ:AMGN) stands against the other pharma dividend stocks.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry in 2024 faced a relatively quiet year, with deal volumes similar to 2023 but lower deal values, reflecting a shift toward smaller, more strategic transactions. Despite challenges such as patent expirations and market uncertainty, innovation remains strong, and there is a better investment environment for biotech. Lower interest rates have also eased capital costs, contributing to increased mergers and acquisitions activity. Biotech IPOs and venture capital investments are seeing a slight recovery, though investment is more concentrated in established companies. However, major pharmaceutical companies face a $300 billion growth gap due to patent expirations, making dealmaking crucial for future growth.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, EY believes that the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity, especially if interest rates remain low. There may be a rise in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, although smaller, strategic deals are likely to persist. Politically, the US policy environment is shifting with potential impacts on business, including lower corporate taxes and deregulation, but also the possibility of higher tariffs and continued drug pricing reforms. Changes in immigration and leadership within health agencies could also affect the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, with new appointees potentially disrupting the regulatory landscape.\n\nAs executives prepare for 2025, drug pricing and access remain their top concerns, according to a Deloitte survey. The survey highlighted that primary concerns include competition from generic drugs and biosimilars and the looming patent cliff, with over $300 billion in sales at risk due to expiring patents by 2030. This has executives expecting a surge in mergers and acquisitions in 2025.\n\nInnovation remains at the forefront as companies look to fill gaps left by expiring patents. However, competition in profitable areas like oncology and immunology is fierce, leading to price pressures even before generics or biosimilars hit the market. On the flip side, the success of GLP-1 receptor agonists is sparking renewed interest in general medicines, with companies racing to tap into the $200 billion market. Additionally, about 20% of companies are adjusting their portfolios to focus on high-potential candidates and better meet market demands. Advanced therapies like cell and gene therapies are also gaining attention, with a shift away from more traditional drugs.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "In the latest trading session, Amgen (AMGN) closed at $259.30, marking a -1.28% move from the previous day. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.07%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.97%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 1.19%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the world's largest biotech drugmaker had lost 7.15% over the past month. This has lagged the Medical sector's loss of 5.64% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.36% in that time.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Amgen in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is expected to report EPS of $4.97, up 5.52% from the prior-year quarter. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $8.82 billion, indicating a 7.66% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nAMGN's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $19.53 per share and revenue of $33.16 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +4.72% and +17.65%, respectively.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Amgen. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.11% upward. Currently, Amgen is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nWith respect to valuation, Amgen is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 13.45. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 24.21.\n\nWe can additionally observe that AMGN currently boasts a PEG ratio of 2.79. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.69.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "The 2024 advancements in ophthalmology biosimilars marked a transformative phase for aflibercept alternatives, with multiple FDA approvals signaling expanded treatment options for retinal conditions. Interchangeability designations and robust clinical data emphasized the potential for improved access, cost savings, and healthcare innovation. However, ongoing patent disputes underscore the complexities of bringing these promising therapies to market.\n\nHere are the top 5 ophthalmology biosimilar articles for 2024.\n\nImage credit: eevl - stock.adobe.com\n\n5. SB15 Effective, Safe in Treating nAMD Before, After Switching\n\nA multiregion phase 3 study demonstrated that SB15, a biosimilar to Eylea (aflibercept), showed comparable efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics in treating neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), both as a first-line therapy and after switching from the originator. Across 56 weeks, changes in visual acuity, retinal thickness, and choroidal neovascularization were minimal, with treatment-emergent adverse events being mild or moderate and similar across groups. The findings support the safety and effectiveness of switching patients from reference aflibercept to SB15.\n\nTo read the full article, click here.\n\n4. FDA Approves Biosimilar Enzeevu for Eye Conditions\n\nSandoz's Enzeevu (aflibercept-abzv) has become the fourth FDA-approved biosimilar referencing Eylea and includes interchangeability, enabling substitution at the pharmacy level without provider consent. Approved for treating nAMD, Enzeevu demonstrated comparable efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics to the reference product in a phase 3 study, with no significant differences in vision improvement or adverse events. This approval represents greater hope for more cost-effective options for managing nAMD, a leading cause of vision impairment.\n\nTo read the full article, click here.\n\n3. Ahzantive Receives FDA Approval as New Eylea Biosimilar\n\nFormycon and its licensing partner Klinge Biopharma secured FDA approval for Ahzantive (aflibercept-mrbb), marking it as the third biosimilar referencing Eylea to receive approval. This milestone builds on prior approvals for Biocon Biologics' Yesafili and Samsung Bioepis' Opuviz earlier in 2024. The approval was based on robust data from the MAGELLAN-AMD phase 3 study, which demonstrated that Ahzantive's safety, efficacy, and tolerability were comparable to Eylea, with no new safety signals identified.\n\nTo read the full article, click here.\n\n2. FDA Approves Pavblu for Retinal Conditions\n\nThe FDA has approved Pavblu (aflibercept-ayyh), developed by Amgen, as the fifth biosimilar referencing Eylea to treat retinal conditions like nAMD and diabetic retinopathy. Clinical trials demonstrated Pavblu\u2019s comparable safety and efficacy to Eylea, reinforcing its biosimilarity. Meanwhile, Amgen faces a legal challenge from Regeneron over patent infringement related to Pavblu\u2019s development, with a court decision pending.\n\nTo read the full article, click here.\n\n1. FDA Approves First Eylea Biosimilars\n\nThe FDA has approved the first 2 biosimilars referencing Eylea: Yesafili (Biocon Biologics) and Opuviz (Samsung Bioepis), both VEGF inhibitors for treating conditions like nAMD and diabetic retinopathy. These biosimilars received interchangeability designations, too, enabling pharmacy-level substitution without physician approval, improving patient access and addressing drug shortages. However, their market entry may face delays due to ongoing patent litigation with Eylea\u2019s maker, Regeneron.\n\nTo read the full article, click here.",
