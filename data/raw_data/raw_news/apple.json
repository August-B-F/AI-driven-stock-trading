Each charge delivers up to five hours of playtime and three hours of talk time; when not in use, it should be kept in the charging case to ensure you never miss a call, a podcast or a song.\n\nSince the AirPods are paired to your iOS device (like your iPad, iPhone or MacBook), you'll receive a push notification when your battery is running low. When your charging case battery pack is low, simply connect the case to a power source using the included lightning cord.\n\nThe reviews are in\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f 4.2/5 stars\n\n\ud83d\udcac 500+ reviews\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 \"These exceeded my expectations!\"\n\nAccording to one five-star reviewer, \"The sound quality is excellent\u2014crisp highs, balanced mids, and surprisingly deep bass for something so compact.\" \"The seamless pairing with Apple devices is a big plus,\" they added.\n\nThey are \"comfortable for long use,\" and the \"battery life is also impressive,\" shares another shopper. \"The design is compact and fits securely without feeling bulky,\" they continued, stating, \"These AirPods are a game-changer.\"\n\nAnother shopper said the 'buds are \"very comfortable\" in their ears and that the \"sound quality is great.\" However, they shared, \"I love my 1st gen buds more,\" and noted that \"these are not noise cancelling.\"\n\nThe verdict\n\nIf you're a loyal Apple product user, you'll probably enjoy the benefits of wireless earbuds that allow you to pair with multiple devices, especially at their current Big Spring Sale price.

While the sale focuses primarily on \"springtime favorites\" like outdoor furniture and garden supplies, last year's inaugural BSS did bring some tech deals. Best of all, exempting a few exclusive offers, most deals are available to all customers, regardless of their Prime membership status.\n\nSo far, we have spotted deals on new releases like the M3 iPad Air, 11-inch iPad, and M4 MacBook Airs. In addition to iPads, we also found a $400 markdown on the M3 13-inch MacBook Air and $170 price cut on the Beats Studio Pro. Again, while these deals aren't officially tied to the spring sale and can be found at other times of the year, these are still solid prices for any of these items.\n\nWe'll continue updating this post as the sale progresses, so check back if you're looking for the best Apple deals from Amazon's Big Spring Sale.\n\nBest MacBook deal\n\nWhy we like it\n\nCheck out our full review of the M4 MacBook Air.\n\nApple just dropped the M4 MacBook Air, and even at full price, we think it's a really good deal. In a divergence from last year's Air pricing, Apple started its 13-inch model at just $999 \u2014 with an M4 chip and the RAM upgrades Apple gave all its laptops last fall, this is the best value we've ever seen on an Apple laptop. Amazon slashed another $50 off the price, which, while admittedly not a jaw-dropping discount, helps make a great value even better. The biggest downside to this laptop is that it might be a little short on ports for some users, and then it tops out at a 60Hz refresh rate, but if you can work with that, the M4 Air is an excellent deal.\n\nMore MacBook and Mac deals\n\nMacBook Air\n\nMacBook Pro\n\nMac\n\nBest AirPods deal\n\nWhy we like it\n\nCheck out our full review of the AirPods Pro.\n\nFor Apple users, the AirPods Pro are an excellent pair of noise-cancelling earbuds, with some of the best noise cancellation and sound quality in the game. As the USB-C Pros near their second year anniversary, we can't say they're without a doubt the best on the market \u2014 their battery life could be better, for instance \u2014 but their age works in their favor for this price drop down to $169.99, which certainly makes some of their flaws easier to look past. We have seen these earbuds drop to $154 during Black Friday season, but we haven't seen that deal return since, making $170 the next best deal to grab them at.\n\nMashable Deals Want more hand-picked deals from our shopping experts?

At the time of writing, the previous generation Air costs even more on Amazon at $599 (though you can grab it on sale for $499 at Best Buy). Beyond the chip upgrade, this iPad features plenty of Apple Intelligence integration, from the Photos and Notes apps, to the Writing Tools feature that uses ChatGPT. Though we've yet to test this tablet hands-on for ourselves, the M2 Air is our favorite iPad for most people \u2014 we imagine the M3 Air will follow suit.\n\nMore iPad deals\n\niPad\n\niPad Air\n\niPad mini\n\nBest Apple Watch deal\n\nWhy we like it\n\nCheck out our full review of the Apple Watch Series 10.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 only came out this past fall, making this $100 off deal especially impressive. Along with its larger wide-angle OLED display, Mashable Senior Editor Stan Schroeder found this smartwatch to be lighter than its predecessors, with an ultra-fast charge time. This watch generation introduced fitness features like a depth gauge, sleep apnea detection, and a Vitals app, but it's worth noting those features aren't exclusive to the Series 10. However, if your Series 6 has been on the fritz for a while, or you've never owned an Apple Watch, $299 is a solid price to grab Apple's latest smartwatch.\n\nMore Apple Watch deals\n\nEven more Apple deals",

            "content": "For many, the real selling point on Apple\u2019s new M4 Mac mini lineup is the price. You can get in the current-generation M4-equipped Mac lineup with a starting price at $599 (or much less than that with the current deals that are now live on the most affordable models starting from $529 \u2013 within $29 of the Amazon all-time low). However, the more powerful M4 Pro model also delivers notable value for folks that need the extra horsepower for content creation, Logic Pro, Final Cut sessions, and so forth, and it has just hit its best price ever on Amazon at $150 off. Details below.\n\nAmazon is now offering Apple\u2019s M4 Pro Mac mini with 24GB of RAM and the 512GB SSD down at $1,249 shipped. Regularly $1,399 this is a straight up $150 price drop, $50 under our previous mention, and a new Amazon all-time low. This is the first time we have tracked this configuration at under $1,299 on Amazon.\n\nAgain, for some folks it\u2019s all about the more affordable M4 models of the new mini \u2013 they are after all the least expensive Macs in the current generation lineup and wonderful machines for those that don\u2019t need the extra horsepower.\n\nFor me, I told myself I wouldn\u2019t buy a new Mac unless it has at least 24GB of RAM, and while I tend to side-step the storage upgrades in favor of portable SSDs, I have had my eye on the upgraded 24GB/512GB M4 model. Most retailers, like Best Buy and Amazon (you know, the ones with the best deals online), don\u2019t have this configuration, which means you\u2019ll get stuck with the full $999 list price going straight to Apple to custom configure an M4 with the same RAM/storage specs as the M4 Pro model we are featuring here today.\n\nSo the ladder pricing continues\u2026do you pay full price for the 24GB M4, or just opt for the sweet $150 price drop on the much more powerful M4 Pro machine that will likely be a more further proof investment?\n\nTough call really, but when it comes down to it, it\u2019s all about what you\u2019ll be using it for if you ask me. If you\u2019re not going to be running demanding creative projects, browser apps, or 8 million tabs while YouTube is playing, and so on, you\u2019re likely better off with the M4 machine at a discount, but at $150 off with a new all-time low, that M4 Pro is calling this Logic Pro users name right now.\n\nApple M4 Pro Mac mini features:\n\nSIZE DOWN.

Read more about how we evaluate products .\n\nAmazon has kicked off another sitewide sales event. The Big Spring Sale, as this one is called, is aimed at apparel and outdoor goods more than electronics, but we\u2019ve tried to cut through the noise and pull out a few actually decent tech deals anyway. If you\u2019re specifically looking for grab a new Apple device, good news: A handful of AirPods, iPads, Apple Watches and Beats headphones are at or near their lowest prices to date.\n\n\n\nMany of these discounts aren\u2019t explicitly tied to the sale, but if you\u2019re just trying to save some cash, that shouldn\u2019t matter much. We\u2019ve rounded up the best Spring Sale Apple deals we could find below. Amazon says the event will run through March 31, so we\u2019ll update this post if prices change and other deals pop up.\n\nBest Amazon Spring Sale Apple deals\n\nApple Apple AirPods 4 $100 $129 Save $29 Apple\u2019s wireless earbuds are far from the richest-sounding or longest-lasting pair out there, and this entry-level model lacks wireless charging, Find My tracking and onboard volume controls. But it still gets you a host of Apple-friendly features \u2014 from fast pairing with iCloud devices to spatial audio to hands-free Siri \u2014 and its lightweight design should fit most ears better than past AirPods. If you truly hate the feeling of headphones that jut into your ear canal, they still sound a bit cleaner and more balanced than most open-back alternatives as well. Just keep in mind that this design inherently won\u2019t block much outside noise. This discount ties the lowest price we\u2019ve seen outside of select in-store only deals. $100 at Amazon\n\nApple AirPods 4 with ANC for $150 ($29 off): This version of the AirPods 4 is nearly identical to the base model, only it supports active noise cancellation and comes with a wireless charging case. It also supports other listening modes like Adaptive Audio, and that case can tap into Apple\u2019s Find My tracking network if you ever misplace it. The ANC isn\u2019t as effective as what you can get with a pair that fully seals off the ear canal, but it makes the earbuds a little more useful in noisy environments all the same. We gave the device a score of 86 in our review. This discount is $11 higher than the best price we\u2019ve seen, but it\u2019s about as low as the earbuds have fallen outside of that.\n\nApple AirPods Pro 2 for $170 ($79 off): The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple\u2019s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a (generally) comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid, though their six-hour battery life still isn\u2019t the best, and you should only get them if you\u2019re all-in on Apple hardware. If that\u2019s the case, though, we call them the best choice for iPhone owners in our wireless earbuds buying guide. We saw this pair drop as low as $154 back in December, but this deal comes within a dollar of its best price since then.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10. (Cherlynn Low for Engadget)\n\nApple Watch Series 10 for $299 ($100 off): The top pick in our guide to the best smartwatches, the Series 10 is a mostly iterative update, with faster charging, a slightly slimmer profile and a marginally larger display compared to the previous Series 9. That said, it remains a comprehensive fitness tracker, and no other smartwatch can integrate as neatly with iPhones and other Apple devices. It should be a welcome upgrade if you\u2019re looking to upgrade from an older Apple Watch (think pre-Series 7) \u2014 just keep in mind a patent dispute has locked it out the blood oxygen detection features found on those older models. This $100 discount matches the lowest price we\u2019ve seen for the non-cellular model with a 42mm case.\n\nApple Apple iPad Mini (A17 Pro) $399 $499 Save $100 The iPad mini is still your best bet if you specifically want a small tablet that\u2019s easier to use with one hand. The latest iteration continues to provide the full iPad experience in a compact frame, with a speedier A17 Pro chip and a more spacious 128GB of storage in this base model, though it still lacks Face ID and remains limited to a basic 60Hz refresh rate. We gave the device a score of 83 in our review. We\u2019ve seen this $100 drop off-and-on over the past few months, but it matches the 8.3-inch slate\u2019s all-time low. $399 at Amazon\n\nApple iPad (A16) for $329 ($20 off): The newest entry-level iPad only arrived three weeks ago, but Amazon is currently selling it for $20 less than Apple direct, which is a decent little savings if you planned on grabbing the tablet early anyway. This one is another small update, but it now comes with a faster A16 chip, more RAM and 128GB of storage as standard. Our review is coming soon, but TL;DR: If you only need an iPad for media consumption and lighter work, it\u2019s still a fine value.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\nApple iPad Air 11-inch (M3) for $549 ($50 off): Much like the deal on the base iPad above, this isn\u2019t a huge discount, but it\u2019s a nice chance to save a few bucks compared to buying from Apple directly. The new iPad Air was released on the same day as the iPad (A16) and is a similarly minor update; the only big addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still prefer the Air over the base model if you can swing it: Its display is more color-rich and better at fending off glare, its speakers are more robust, it works with Apple\u2019s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead. The older M2-powered model is an even better value if you can find it on sale, but either way the Air is the iPad we recommend to most people.\n\nThe 13-inch iPad Air M3. (Nathan Ingraham for Engadget)\n\nApple iPad Air 13-inch (M3) for $738 ($61 off): We gave the 13-inch iPad Air a review score of 89 earlier this month. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart; otherwise, the two slates are the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for taking in movies and multitasking for work. This is the lowest price we\u2019ve seen for the 128GB model.\n\nApple iPad Pro 13-inch (M4) for $1,099 ($200 off): The iPad Pro is more tablet than most people need, but it\u2019s the ultimate iPad for those who can stomach its price tag. It\u2019s wonderfully thin, its OLED display is one of the best we\u2019ve seen on a consumer device and its M4 chip can handle virtually anything you\u2019d ever do on an iPad. It\u2019s also the only Apple tablet with Face ID, plus it has a better speaker setup than the iPad Air. We gave it a score of 84 in our review, with the only real drawback being how expensive it all is. This deal on doesn\u2019t truly lessen that \u2014 and it\u2019s another deal we\u2019ve seen multiple times in recent months \u2014 but it still ties the 13-inch model\u2019s all-time low.\n\nBeats Beats Pill $100 $150 Save $50 The Beats Pill earned a score of 83 in our review last year and currently holds a spot in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers . It\u2019s not the best value on the market, and it can struggle at maximum volume, but it generally pumps out strong bass without sounding imbalanced. A stylish and water-resistant design, ample battery life and the ability to play lossless audio over a USB-C cable add to the appeal. This deal comes within $2 of the best price we\u2019ve tracked. $100 at Amazon\n\nBeats Studio Buds + for $130 ($40 off): The Studio Buds + might be worth a look if you want some of the AirPods Pro\u2019s Apple-friendly perks at a lower price. We gave these in-ear headphones a score of 84 back in 2023: They\u2019re relatively comfy, with decent ANC and a mostly neutral sound profile, plus they don\u2019t totally shut out Android users the way AirPods do. There\u2019s no wireless charging, wear detection or automatic switching between Apple devices, though, and the ANC is still a step down from the AirPods Pro. But if you can live with all of that, this deal matches one of the best prices we could find outside of one extremely brief drop to $80 more than a year ago.\n\nShop Spring's best sales: Brighten up your wardrobe, get your backyard back into gear, and nab tech deals you've been waiting for since Black Friday with our comprehensive coverage of Spring sales from Amazon and more major retailers.

            "content": "Apple recently rolled out the Release Candidate (RC) of iOS 18.4 to developers and beta testers, a milestone update by allowing Apple Intelligence (AI) in the European Union (EU). Yet, iPhone Mirroring is left in the dark for regional iPhone users.\n\nWhy Is iPhone Mirroring Blocked in the EU?\n\nFor those who don't know iPhone Mirroring, it's one of the most awaited features that enable users to mirror and control their iPhone screen wirelessly right from their Mac.\n\nWith this feature, users can easily control notifications, use apps without jumping from one iPhone to another, and answer messages. Ironically, this won't be available in most European countries yet, according to Bloomberg.\n\nApple blames the lack of iPhone Mirroring in the EU on \"regulatory uncertainties\" caused by the Digital Markets Act (DMA). This antitrust law is intended to encourage healthy competition and impose stringent interoperability standards.\n\nIn Apple's view, adhering to these regulations may \"compromise the integrity of our products\" and pose security threats to users.\n\nAlthough Apple Intelligence, the AI-based suite of features for the company, has been approved in the EU with iOS 18.4, iPhone Mirroring is still off-limits. The Cupertino giant hasn't specifically stated why it made that differentiation but keeps referencing regulatory issues as the major reason.\n\nSharePlay Screen Sharing is Still Off-Limits\n\nAlong with iPhone Mirroring, another feature that is disabled in the EU is SharePlay Screen Sharing. This feature, intended for effortless screen sharing while making FaceTime calls is also banned for the same legal reasons.\n\nApple Intelligence Expands with iOS 18.4\n\nDespite these limitations, iOS 18.4 brings exciting updates for EU users by introducing Apple Intelligence features in multiple languages. This move expands the accessibility of AI-driven tools to enhance the overall user experience.\n\nAs for the launch date of iOS 18.4, 9to5Mac reports that we should expect it to arrive in early April so that's only a week away from now. However, EU users can expect AI advancements, though; iPhone Mirroring and SharePlay Screen Sharing may take longer to arrive.",

            "content": "TSMC is reported to start accepting orders for its 2nm process from April 1, with the possibility that Apple will be the first customer of the company\u2019s improved wafer technology. Even though this lithography is intended for the A20 that is slated to arrive for the iPhone 18 lineup next year, we have come across multiple sets of information talking about the Taiwanese semiconductor giant\u2019s progress towards reaching a healthy production output for its bleeding-edge manufacturing process. According to the latest report, the A20 is said to deliver a decent 15 percent performance improvement over the A19 while utilizing the same power.\n\nA20 could be optimized to deliver slightly less performance than the A19, giving it better efficiency attributes\n\nIt was mentioned previously that the A20 would offer no improvements over the A19 as it would stick with TSMC\u2019s third-generation 3nm process, which is also known as 3nm \u2018N3P,\u2019 but we have seen amendments to those claims, with even TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo stating that the A20 will be mass produced on the next-generation node. As for the performance, Economic News Daily reports that the jump from the 3nm to 2nm node will result in a 15 percent performance improvement with the same power consumption.\n\nEven if the aforementioned statistic does not appear mind-blogging, Apple could simply reduce the maximum power limit of the A20, allowing the SoC to consume less wattage while also delivering on the performance front. A benefit to this silicon\u2019s efficiency metric is that Apple is exploring the use of silicon-carbon batteries, which increases the cell\u2019s capacity without compromising the device\u2019s thickness.\n\nCombine the larger battery and the A20, and we expect to see unrivaled endurance on the iPhone 18 series. Of course, it is worth remembering that gravitating to the 2nm process should have a positive effect on the \u2018performance per watt\u2019 but at the expense of increased cost. With each wafer estimated to be priced at $30,0000, Apple may have little choice but to increase the starting price of its iPhone 18 lineup, at least those models that are outfitted with the A20.\n\nNews Source: Economic News Daily",

            "content": "The opinions expressed in this article are the writer\u2019s own and do not reflect the views of Her Campus.\n\nThis article is written by a student writer from the Her Campus at VCU chapter.\n\nAs an East Coaster, I\u2019ve been able to visit New York a few times. It\u2019s always a magical experience stepping out of Penn Station and into the chaos of midtown \u2013 towering skyscrapers, yellow taxis blaring their horns, tourists straining their necks while looking at the billboards in Times Square, and pretzel street vendors shouting over the dull hum of the subway. But recently, things have felt\u2026.different. I\u2019ve begun to wonder if NYC has lost a little bit of its size? Of course not physically (the Empire State Building isn\u2019t shrinking), but in terms of its energy.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s just me, but the crowds weren\u2019t crowded. Don\u2019t get me wrong: it was still quite busy. After all, it\u2019s New York we are talking about. But, it wasn\u2019t \u201cshoulder-to-shoulder, shoved in like sardines\u201d type of busy. Instead, it was a type of breathable busy. To be honest, NYC felt way too quiet.\n\nOne theory regarding the sudden stillness of the grand city could be that people are simply leaving the city. After all, there has been a small dip in population size because of the pandemic. Many New Yorkers moved to suburban areas, substituting the city hustle for a quieter, more affordable lifestyle. And, I get it. City living expenses are no joke.\n\nBut, the signs of change are hard to ignore. The city feels\u2026 a little more spread out. Maybe it\u2019s the emptier subway cars or the abundance of open tables at previously crowded dinner spots. Or maybe it\u2019s just me growing older, seeing NYC with fresh eyes after so many visits.\n\nYet, there\u2019s still a lingering part of me that can\u2019t imagine the Big Apple becoming anything less than the buzzing, bustling, and booming city that it always was. Even as the population changes, the core of the city remains unchanged. From eating a classic New York slice of pizza to wandering around the streets of Fifth Avenue window shopping, a day in the city is immaculate in my opinion. And walking through Central Park on a sunny afternoon or hopping between neighborhoods like SoHo, the West Village, and Brooklyn allows for endless opportunities for adventure. A smaller population doesn\u2019t change the fact that NYC always delivers those larger-than-life moments.\n\nSo, is NYC really shrinking? In some ways, maybe yes. But, it\u2019s not a bad thing. Fewer crowds mean more space to explore and to fall in love with the city over and over again. And if you ask me, the Big Apple doesn\u2019t need to be huge to stay unforgettable. NYC will always have a special type of magic.",

First, the replaceable battery means you're chucking away handfuls of CR2032s every year. Then there's the shape and size. These tiny UFO-shaped devices don't have a lanyard hole and are too bulky to be placed in a wallet without giving you a pain in the rear.\n\nAlso: Forget AirTags: Tile's new trackers come in all shapes and sizes (and an SOS button)\n\nYes, some wallets have little holders for AirTags, but in my experience, they are all too bulky.\n\nBut there's a third-party AirTag-like product that takes everything that the original Apple AirTag has to offer and solves all of the above problems and more. That tag is the KeySmart SmartCard.\n\nThe first thing I love about the SmartCard is the thickness, or more specifically, its thinness!\n\nThe SmartCard is less than 2mm thin! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET\n\nWhile Apple's AirTag is 8 mm thick, the SmartCard is less than 2 mm, or the thickness of two credit cards.\n\nThis makes it perfect for use in a wallet. The end has a luggage tag hole for attaching the SmartCard to your suitcase.\n\nThe SmartCard is much thinner than the AirTag. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET\n\nKeySmart made this card so thin by eliminating the bulky CR2032 coin cell and replacing it with a rechargeable battery. This battery is recharged using a wireless charger every five months or so.\n\nWhile testing this card, I thought it'd be great if KeySmart had built MagSafe tech into the card to allow it to attach to my angled MagSafe iPhone charger. Well, KeySmart thought of everything -- this card attaches itself to wireless MagSafe chargers!\n\nBecause there are no battery compartment covers, the tag is robust, has an IPX7 rating for dustproofing and water resistance, and can survive up to 30 minutes of immersion in 3 feet of water.\n\nAlso: I found the AirTags that Android users have been waiting for\n\nDespite being thin, these things are tough and take quite a bit of bending and squeezing, so they will survive life in wallets.\n\nThese SmartCards are tough! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET\n\nOther than all of these improvements, this device works like an AirTag. It's activated using the Find My app, and you search for it when you've put your wallet down in the wrong place.\n\nThis is the AirTag that Apple should have made.\n\nZDNET's buying advice\n\nAirTags are great, but they have first-generation limitations that I'm sure Apple will one day solve with a next-generation wave of AirTags. For now, the KeySmart SmartCard is the best AirTag for those who want a thin solution for their wallet or as a luggage tag.\n\nWhen will this deal expire?

And that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nIn February, a top executive from China\u2019s Alibaba said his company partnered with Apple to help bring AI-powered iPhones to China.\n\n\u201cThey want to use our AI to power their phones, so we\u2019re very fortunate and extremely honored to be able to do business with a great company like Apple,\u201d Joe Tsai, Alibaba\u2019s chair, said at a conference in Dubai.\n\nIt was reported in January that Apple\u2019s iPhone sales dropped 5% late last year amid stronger competition from Chinese rivals and that much of the decline could be attributed to the lack of Apple\u2019s AI features on phones sold in China.\n\nOne roadblock was that Apple had not yet been able to add those features to iPhone 16s sold in China even as Chinese companies like Huawei added them. The company was trying to secure partnerships with Chinese companies to roll out its AI features.\n\nChina requires generative AI operators to secure government permission before they can debut a product.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s iPhone 16 series was met with a mixed response, partly due to a lack of availability of Apple Intelligence at launch,\u201d Tarun Pathak, director at Counterpoint Research, said at the time.\n\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.",

But a growing array of hits over the past year helped lead into Apple\u2019s biggest success yet with Severance\u2019s second season. Now, that hot streak looks set to continue with two new releases hitting Apple TV+ soon.\n\nApple TV+ winning streak kicked off last summer and hasn\u2019t let up since\n\nApple TV+ has never found greater success than it has right now. And I don\u2019t just mean that because of Severance.\n\nStarting last summer, the streamer has been launching one strong TV debut after another.\n\nIt started with Presumed Innocent, which found a lot of mainstream success\u2014no doubt thanks to Jake Gyllenhaal and its buzzy plot.\n\nLater in the summer, subscribers got to enjoy the delightful comedy Bad Monkey from Bill Lawrence and Vince Vaughn.\n\nThen in the fall, some of Apple\u2019s best shows all got new seasons in quick succession. These included:\n\nThough it wasn\u2019t quite the hit Apple hoped, Disclaimer was still a noteworthy event series for the company.\n\nAnd all of this led up to Severance, Apple\u2019s biggest triumph yet.\n\nI\u2019m now very excited to start Dope Thief, which just arrived on TV+ as an acclaimed new crime thriller starring Brian Tyree Henry.\n\nAnd somehow, Apple\u2019s upcoming slate looks just as compelling.\n\nTwo new Apple TV+ shows are getting very strong buzz\n\nIn mere days, Apple TV+ is debuting a new comedy from Seth Rogen titled The Studio.\n\nThe first two episodes drop this Wednesday, March 26, and it\u2019s hard to find another Apple TV+ show that\u2019s ever received as strong of critical acclaim.\n\nHere are some key quotes from reviews:\n\nDiscussing Film: \u201cone of the best TV shows that can be found on streaming\u201d\n\nTIME: \u201c2025\u2019s best new show to date\u201d\n\nMetro: \u201cthe best show of 2025\u201d\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter: \u201cstrong contender for the best new comedy of 2025\u201d\n\nFor a while, The Studio had a perfect 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. It\u2019s now down to a lowly\u202698%.\n\nAfter this week\u2019s premiere episodes arrive, there will be new episodes of The Studio every week through May 21.\n\nThen in just a few weeks, another potential standout series arrives.\n\nYour Friends & Neighbors stars Jon Hamm as a wealthy hedge fund manager whose luck turns bad. After his life quietly falls apart, he turns to a life of crime, stealing household possessions from his affluent neighbors.\n\nApple TV+ already gave the show an early season 2 pickup, which is a great sign. But buzz from critics has been encouraging too.\n\nReviews are still embargoed, but some strong early reactions have slipped through, like this one from Glamour:\n\nHaving seen the first few episodes, it\u2019s a mix of Big Little Lies meets Breaking Bad but with its own unique spin on class, money, and gender dynamics\u2026Your Friends & Neighbors will be your must-see weekly binge of the spring.\n\nYour Friends & Neighbors debuts Friday, April 11 with its first two episodes, with weekly releases thereafter through May 30.\n\nApple TV+ new releases: wrap-up\n\nApple TV+ still is no Netflix in terms of mainstream appeal, and its subscriber numbers are low compared to competitors. But over the past year, the streamer seems to have finally hit its stride in a big way. Severance\u2019s widespread success is evidence of that, but with two more big releases coming soon, we could be looking at a new winning era for Apple\u2019s TV efforts.\n\nApple TV+ is available for $9.99 per month and features hit TV shows and movies like Ted Lasso, Severance, The Morning Show, Silo, and Shrinking. You can also watch free in several ways.\n\nBest iPhone accessories",

Lossless audio will also extend to Personalized Spatial Audio to provide a \u201cmore sonically accurate, uncompressed, and immersive experience.\u201d Users will be able to listen to over 100 million songs in lossless audio in Apple Music.\n\nMeanwhile, the company says the AirPods Max will be better suited for music production with the ultra-low latency audio functionality. Using the USB-C cable, AirPods Max users can listen to music artists have mixed with Personalized Spatial Audio and head tracking. That means, according to the company, artists can record and mix music without losing audio quality.\n\n\u201cLossless audio and ultra-low latency audio enable music creators to fully utilize AirPods Max throughout their entire professional workflow on Logic Pro and other music creation apps,\u201d the company says.\n\n\u201cUsing the USB-C cable, AirPods Max will become the only headphones that enable musicians to both create and mix in Personalized Spatial Audio with head tracking. By delivering lossless, high-resolution digital audio with low latency, artists can seamlessly record and mix with AirPods Max without compromising fidelity.\u201d\n\nUltra-low latency audio also benefits gamers, who will experience lower audio latency in their games using the AirPods Max with their USB-C cable.\n\nBoth lossless audio and ultra-low latency audio will be available in a free firmware update next month for iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4. The new features will be available exclusively to AirPods Max using USB-C, and not the Lightning version of the headphones.\n\nAirPods Max are available in five colors \u2014 midnight, starlight, blue, purple, and orange \u2014 for $549 each, while the USB-C to 3.5 mm cable is available for $39. Using the cable, users can connect AirPods Max to 3.5 mm audio sources, like the audio-out port on an airplane.

            "content": "It may be a Hollywood era of uncertainty and contraction, but in some dealmaking situations, it is anything but.\n\nIn a pick up worth dozens of millions of dollars, Apple has closed a deal on the untitled hot package centered on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, formerly known as Unidentified Flying Objects. Joseph Kosinski is attached to direct and produce, with Zach Baylin on board to write the script. Veteran producer Jerry Bruckheimer is on board to produce as well.\n\nThe deal represents more than just a reteaming of Kosinski and Bruckheimer and Apple, who this summer are unveiling high-octane racing movie F1. It is one of the richest deals in quite some time, one that underscores a shift in the event movie landscape and shows that behind-the-scenes talent, in this case a new generation combined with a long-standing veteran, can command top market prices.\n\nSources say that Top Gun: Maverick filmmaker Kosinski, despite a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that includes only five movies, secured an eight-figure deal that puts him near the top of the director ladder, with fees that are comparable to such figures as Christopher Nolan and Steven Spielberg. Baylin is said to be making in the mid-seven figure range, more if he receives sole writing credit, also putting him in the top echelon of his profession. And Bruckheimer, whose career spans decades and includes the Top Gun and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is said to receive a top-of-the-market producing fee in the mid-seven figures.\n\nWhile Apple confirmed the closing of the deal for the project, it had no comment on the fees and other points.\n\nThe high-profile UAP package hit the Hollywood market in mid-February, igniting a fierce bidding war that quickly saw figures soar.\n\nPart of the appeal was the track record of the participants. Kosinski and Bruckheimer, as well as producer Chad Oman of Bruckheimer Films, first worked together on Top Gun: Maverick, which flew to almost $1.5 billion in 2022. Now the trio were in post on F1, a Formula 1 racing movie made by Apple, which has a theatrical release deal via Warner Bros. Buzz is high on the Brad Pitt movie, whose recent trailer was viewed dozens of millions of times.\n\nBaylin, meanwhile, is the Oscar-nominated writer behind Will Smith\u2019s King Richard whose credits also include Creed III and last year\u2019s Jude Law white supremacist thriller The Order. Adding to the sheen is the participation of David Grusch and Sonya Brown. Grusch famously testified in front of Congress on this subject and will be a consultant and associate producer on the project. Brown is an executive producer.\n\nThe story also had a timely resonance. It is described as a large-scale conspiracy thriller about two men working in national security who uncover a secret program to recover and reverse-engineer crashed UAPs.\n\nThe untitled project ended up in a pitched street fight among Warner Bros., Paramount, Skydance, Amazon, Sony and Apple, which despite its involvement with F1, wasn\u2019t initially in the mix.\n\nAt one level, the deal is a snapshot of Hollywood dealmaking in 2025. Kosinski and Bruckheimer, along with A-lister Pitt, made a groundbreaking F1 deal in 2022, while the pandemic was still a factor and when streamers were ruling the market, paying massive quotes as well as buyout fees and all but pushing the studios out of the top packaging auctions.\n\nThree years later, the studios have re-emerged as competitive forces, mainly for one reason: the theatrical release. Filmmakers and companies have come to realize that a theatrical window is key to the making of a hit and to making a cultural imprint, which many working in Hollywood are keen to do. And sources say that Netflix, which refuses to concede on that point, wasn\u2019t even in the mix for UAP.\n\nDespite the studio flex, however, in the end, the acquisition of UAP came down to Amazon and Apple, two streaming tech companies, insiders said. How did that happen? Since the days of the pandemic, Amazon has made theatrical one of its priorities and is building out an international distribution arm to launch in 2026. And Apple, on select projects, is willing to partner with studios for a theatrical release, as seen in the case of F1. (The company\u2019s more recent movie, sci-fi horror The Gorge, was only seen on the platform.)\n\nFor F1, Apple went out to the Hollywood studios to see what kind of deal could be had, eventually giving Warners the keys to the speedster.\n\nInsiders say a similar map could be followed for the UAP project \u2014 a theatrical partner will be undertaken down the road. The theatrical component would include backend participation, potentially further enriching the deal.\n\nSources say that while Amazon MGM made a strong play, it came down to the old Hollywood trope of \u201crelationships.\u201d The UAP players seemed to have had a fruitful time on F1 and were ready for more.\n\nMeanwhile, several years after leaving the life of a first-look producing deal behind and producing movies since the late 1970s, Bruckheimer remains as active as ever. And as opposed to being housed at one home, he is spread across Hollywood; he is developing new installments of Pirates and National Treasure at Disney, another Bad Boys at Sony, another Top Gun at Paramount and a project or two at Netflix on top of the ones at Apple.\n\nThe UAP project\u2019s strategy and players were put together by CAA, which represents Bruckheimer, Kosinski and Baylin. Kosinski is additionally repped by Untitled Entertainment and Sloane Offer, while Baylin is additionally repped by Brillstein Entertainment Partners.",

            "content": "I had a revelation recently while testing the wired charging speed of my trusty iPhone 16 Plus. In six months of ownership, it occurred to me as I blew the dust out like an archaeologist examining an ancient pot, I had never plugged a cable into my iPhone\u2019s USB-C port. It seemed impossible, but it was true.\n\nAnd it made me think. Do iPhone owners even need ports? When reports suggest that Apple is working on a smartphone with no port at all, everyone loses their minds. But if I can go half a year without using my iPhone\u2019s USB-C port and not even notice, where\u2019s the issue? If Apple wants to ditch the iPhone\u2019s USB-C port, I say: Good.\n\nThe port at the bottom of an iPhone used to be absolutely fundamental to its well-being. Whether 30-pin, Lightning, or latterly USB-C, the charging/data port was the main, often the only route into or out of the iPhone. Aside from charging, this port was vital in the early days for uploading music and books onto the device and getting photos and videos off it. Syncing and backing up were done via a wired connection, too. But one by one these uses switched from wired only, to wired or wireless, to MagSafe, to who still uses a wire?\n\nMost of us will have memories of times when the port connection became unreliable, and of how much of a pain this was. From that point until you got a new phone the cable had to be waggled in a specific way to make it start charging, or the phone had to be laid upside down or at some weird angle. \u201cDon\u2019t use that cable,\u201d you\u2019d warn a friend. \u201cIt only plays nicely with the official Apple one.\u201d Just another of those modern conveniences that make life hell.\n\nMagSafe is already a fantastic wireless option for (most) iPhones. shutterstock.com / serhatctk\n\nOf late, however, this particular set of annoyances has faded into the background, at least for me. I charge wirelessly overnight when the slower speed doesn\u2019t matter. I get my music via streaming, not being 87 years old, and I transfer everything else wirelessly to and from the phone, this not being 2009. Literally, the only time I\u2019ve needed the port since I bought the phone is to test how effective the port is.\n\nOkay, you\u2019re saying: bully for you, you don\u2019t need the port. But what\u2019s the problem with keeping it as an option? Where\u2019s the harm? The harm, my Socratic friend, is that including a design element the user doesn\u2019t need is a waste of resources and a cause of unnecessary compromises. As I explained when defending the notch several years ago, seemingly isolated design decisions have a knock-on effect throughout the rest of the product. And if Apple was able to ditch the USB-C port it would be able to make the phone better in various other ways.\n\nMost obviously, having a physical opening on a phone is just asking for unwanted things to work their way inside. The dust I mentioned earlier; water, and spilled coffee. The iPhone 16 Plus has an excellent ingress-protection rating of IP68 but it took Apple more than a decade to reach that point because the port made it so difficult to keep dust and water out of the device. Open up your iPhone and you\u2019ll see numerous design adaptations and compromises around the port module to waterproof the whole apparatus; these could be ditched tomorrow if the port wasn\u2019t there, freeing up room within the chassis. That\u2019s on top of the room you\u2019d gain from removing the port module itself, of course.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got extra room inside the chassis you can install a bigger battery, or move other components around into a more optimal configuration. Removing the port could enable Apple to have a speaker across the full width of the bottom edge, and it would make accessing the internals of your phone for repairs a simpler process.\n\nIt could even enable the company to make its iPhones thinner, transcending a limitation currently imposed by the thickness of the port. This year\u2019s Oppo Find N5, which resorts to a custom-designed USB-C port to shave off every possible millimeter, is a good example of the way in which manufacturers are hitting a brick wall in their quest for ever-slimmer phones. As long as customers insist on plugging cables into their phones, companies won\u2019t be able to get the size down any further.\n\nThat USB-C port prevents the device from getting any thinner. Foundry | Alex Walker-Todd\n\nMaybe the biggest reason why I want Apple to ditch the USB-C port, however, is that it will force the industry, and society, to finally bite the bullet and fully embrace wireless. Apple has massive weight as a force for change. When iPhones courageously stopped having 3.5mm headphone jacks, accessory makers shifted their focus from wired to wireless (or in some cases, for a time, Lightning or USB-C) headphones, and such devices became cheaper, better, and more widely available and understood. If a chunk of wealthy iPhone owners suddenly lost their USB-C ports, Android manufacturers would likely follow suit, and the same thing would happen for wireless chargers.\n\nCars would start to be sold as standard with Qi2 magnetic mounts rather than, or as well as, the cable ports many currently offer. Wireless charging pucks would become commonplace in homes and offices. And companies (including, I\u2019d expect, Apple itself, because it would be keen to appease EU regulators) would throw their weight behind the development of faster, more efficient and longer-distance wireless charging standards in a way that would be less appealing if wired was still an easy option.\n\nI don\u2019t imagine for a second that the USB-C port would disappear overnight. If the iPhone 18 series, for example, turned out to be portless, there would still be an iPhone 17e with a port, not to mention older generations still on sale at a lower price. For those who still want a port, the option would remain\u2013likely for many years, if the slow death of the Home button is anything to go by.\n\nNobody would be forced to join the revolution right away. But the revolution is coming, and the sooner we get started, the better.",

The report comes as smartphone makers like Apple, Google and Samsung place a growing emphasis on AI features in their latest devices.\n\n\"The current idea is to put the camera inside the display of the Series version, like the front-facing lens on the iPhone,\" Gurman wrote in his weekly newsletter. The camera lens on the Ultra would have a slightly different placement, sitting on the side of the watch near the crown and button, he wrote.\n\nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nApple Intelligence, which debuted with the iOS 18.1 update in October, offers a visual search tool that can help identify objects and places around you and surface any relevant information.\n\nGurman reported in December that Apple was exploring the possibility of adding temperature sensors and other physiological measurements to the AirPods. Both he and Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also reported that Apple was working on adding infrared cameras to future AirPods by 2026.\n\nThe IR cameras could be used in multiple ways. The report details that they could be used for in-air hand gesture detection, work with devices like the Apple Vision Pro to enhance spatial audio or detect environmental changes for software including the new Apple Intelligence.",

Early Siri worked, but only within highly limited functional silos.\n\n\u201cWhat we acquired was a demo that would work great for a couple of people but wouldn\u2019t scale to our user base \u2026 there was a lot of smoke and mirrors behind the original Siri implementation,\u201d former Apple exec Richard Williamson told the Computer History Museum in a 2017 interview so long it involves costume changes.\n\n\u201cThis notion of AI? It wasn\u2019t AI \u2026 it was a hot mess,\u201d Williamson said. \"It\u2019s super easy to trick Siri. There\u2019s no NLP [natural language processing], there\u2019s no contextualization of words. It\u2019s just keyword matching.\u201d\n\nBut now, even with AI, Siri reportedly still can\u2019t be relied on to actually work when facing real-world use. The key question is why? Chatbot tech may not be fully mature, but it is at least prevalent enough to be used daily by nontechnophiles on competing platforms.\n\nOne confounding factor: Apple\u2019s approach to this stuff is likely not close to the norm. You'll need to be comfortable handing over large amount of data to make Alexa work its best, while OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman seems happy to destroy entire categories of jobs at the altar of progress. But Tim Cook and Apple? A cleaner, more positive image has for decades been part of the company\u2019s appeal, and that includes a very clear focus on privacy.\n\n\u201cThere's one good excuse for [Apple] waiting, and that is if you really hold the privacy and data stewardship value as a sacred right. And [Apple] does say those kinds of words,\u201d says Gruber.\n\n\u201cIf they really hold that as a top priority, they may be running into conflicts of interest. If they send all the queries to OpenAI and give them all the context OpenAI needs they could probably do more, but then they're giving up on their privacy guarantee.\u201d\n\nA privacy focus was also perceived for years as a reason Siri never felt as good to use as, for example, Google Assistant. It seemed less intelligent, less naturalistic, because it literally knew less about you. And regardless of quite how true that was, it\u2019s part of the root of the problem in this new Siri too.\n\nA Tale of Two Halves\n\nThe upcoming Siri is based around two core components. A small language model runs on the iPhone itself, while more complex queries are offloaded to OpenAI. You\u2019ll have to grant the phone permission to do so.\n\nIt is estimated Apple\u2019s on-iPhone AI systems consist of around 3 billion parameters, where some estimates place the number of parameters in OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 at 1.8 trillion\u2014six hundred times the number. DeepSeek made headlines as a more efficient, lean AI model in early 2025, but it still comprises a reported 671 billion parameters.",

This is obviously a glitch with the data being served by the Apple Maps backend, and should be fixable by Apple with a server update.\n\nThe bug was first spotted by Apple Maps users on Reddit about twenty-four hours ago. If you want to see it for yourself, open the Maps app and center your viewport around Chicago. Then, zoom out to the level where you can see state abbreviations and major cities.\n\nAt this zoom level, a handful of blue baggage claim pins will also be inexplicably visible, from a variety of airport terminals. With normal behavior, these POIs would only show up when you zoom in close to a particular airport, using the indoor maps features available at places like airports and major malls.\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s a pretty harmless bug that Apple will inevitably be able to discreetly fix in due course. Still, it\u2019s a bit weird that it randomly started happening in the last day or so.\n\nA screenshot of the baggage claim dots visible through Apple Maps on Mac",

It's been my personal pick of the best streaming services for at least a couple of years now, not least because it's the most affordable if you're looking for 4K quality shows, but it also has a habit of making those shows extremely high-quality.\n\nSo, when I saw the first trailer for Dope Thief a few weeks ago, I knew I'd be tuning in, although I didn't realise how much I'd enjoy it. This is a show that casts one of my favourite actors (Brian Tyree Henry) in a story that plays with some of my favourite tropes (people committing crimes badly), and it's been great so far. Now, Apple's deployed a super intriguing trailer showing what's coming up in the weeks yet to air.\n\nDope Thief \u2014 Season 1 Official Sneak Peek | Apple TV+ - YouTube Watch On\n\nIt confirms that what has started as a very stressful show won't be letting up, as Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura's characters get further and further into trouble thanks to their calamatious screw-up early doors. The two of them play opportunistic criminals who think they've hit upon a brilliant recipe for ripping off drug dealers.\n\nThey pose as DEA agents, using the classic ballistic vests bearing those letters in bright white capitals, and turn over drug stashes to grab money and contraband before making themselves scarce. This all goes very wrong, though, when they hit a stash hiding way more than anticipated, and get the attention they'd so far been able to dodge after each job.\n\nImage 1 of 5 (Image credit: Apple TV+) (Image credit: Apple TV+) (Image credit: Apple TV+) (Image credit: Apple TV+) (Image credit: Apple TV+)\n\nI've pointed out before that this is the exact sort of scenario that some excellent Coen brothers movies have used as their hook \u2013 regular people or petty criminals who get dragged into messes they could never have anticipated. How these characters contrive to escape or fail to do so, can be endlessly compelling if handled the right way.\n\nDope Thief is handling it excellently, based on the trio of episodes available to watch at this point, and you can feel the influence of Ridley Scott in the background (he's on Executive Producer duties, along with Peter Craig, a long-time collaborator). As always, though, it's a little hard to judge the show until it finishes its run \u2013 but I recommend jumping aboard while it's still airing, for maximum suspense between episodes!\n\nSign up to the T3 newsletter for smarter living straight to your inbox Get all the latest news, reviews, deals and buying guides on gorgeous tech, home and active products from the T3 experts Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors",

            "content": "Key Takeaways Apple released the M4 MacBook Air earlier this month. Several reviews suggest that upgrading is worth it.\n\nThe latest version has a new M4 chip that improves speed and performance, which reviewers said is apparent when compared to older models.\n\nAccording to several reviewers, this laptop is a good segue into Apple\u2019s ecosystem, especially at its price.\n\nApple's newest laptop has won some admirers.\n\nApple (AAPL) earlier this month announced the release of its latest laptop, the M4 MacBook Air, which features its most powerful chip yet. The company said the new MacBook also boasts a new FaceTime camera, improved battery life, more base memory\u2014and a starting price of $999 for the base 13-inch model and $1299 for the 15-inch one.\n\nInvestopedia read a selection of reviews to get a sense of early responses to the laptop, which hit stores March 12. Here's a selection of what we found, along with links to the reviews.\n\n'Impressively Powerful.' But Is It 'Blue Enough' for You?\n\nSeveral reviews say the biggest upgrade is the M4 chip, which promises quicker speeds and overall better performance. A Mashable review called it \u201cimpressively powerful.\u201d A Wired review said the chip might not be used to its best potential in a MacBook Air, which is fanless. But even while using the laptop for gaming, the model\u2019s temperature never got \u201cunbearable,\u201d said the reviewer.\n\nWith the extra power of the M4 MacBook Air comes the ability to support two external displays, a win for people like small business owners and hybrid workers, said Wired\u2019s review. And while a How-To Geek review said the upgraded chip's capabilities might not be noticeable to everyone, if you have an M1 Air model or older, the jump to M4 would be \u201ca pretty substantial improvement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe M4 MacBook Air is an exceptional entry point into macOS and the Apple ecosystem,\u201d said the How-To Geek review, which said this model is \u201cunequivocally the best consumer laptop in its category.\u201d\n\nThe camera, microphone, and speaker quality is also an improvement from previous models, according to 9to5Mac\u2019s review.\n\nAmong the qualms reviewers have with the M4 MacBook Air are its lack of ports (all on the left side, plus a headphone jack on the right), and the price for upgraded storage space, which holds true for all Apple laptops, several reviews said. Some argued that the new sky blue color is not \u201cblue enough.\u201d\n\nBut The Verge calls the latest Air model \u201ca little more for a little less\u201d which seemed to be the consensus for several reviewers: you get a few new bells and whistles (upgraded chip and memory, a new camera and color option of sky blue, efficient battery) for less than previous models.",

            "content": "After ChatGPT broke cover in late 2022 and the tech industry embarked on its contemporary rendering of tulip mania, people started to wonder why the biggest tech giant of all \u2013 Apple \u2013 was keeping its distance from the madness. Eventually, the tech commentariat decided that there could be only two possible interpretations of this corporate standoffishness: either Apple was way behind the game being played by OpenAI et al; or it had cunning plans to unleash upon the world its own world-beating take on the technology.\n\nFinally, at its annual World Wide Developers\u2019 Conference (WWDC) on 10 June last year Apple came clean. Or appeared to. For Apple, \u201cAI\u201d would not mean what those vulgar louts at OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and Meta raved about, but something altogether more refined and sophisticated \u2013 something called \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d. It was not, as the veteran Apple-watcher John Gruber put it, a single thing or product but \u201ca marketing term for a collection of features, apps, and services\u201d. Putting it all under a single, memorable label made it easier for users to understand that Apple was launching something really novel. And, of course, it also made it easier for Apple to say that users who wanted to have all of these fancy features would have to buy an iPhone 15 Pro, because older devices wouldn\u2019t be up to the task.\n\nNeedless to say, this columnist fell for it and upgraded. (Verily, one sucker is born every minute.) As a piece of kit, the new phone was impressive: the powerful new processor chips, neural engine etc worked a treat. And the camera turned out to be astonishingly good. But the Apple Intelligence features enabled by the upgrade seemed trivial and sometimes irritating. It immediately started messing with my photo collection, for example, imposing categories on images that were intrusive, unwanted and annoying. And there was a new pre-installed app called Image Playground that apparently \u201cmakes communication and self-expression even more fun\u201d \u2013 which might possibly be true if one were a four-year-old with a short attention span, but is otherwise a turkey from central casting and should have been strangled at birth.\n\nThere was one feature, though, that looked interesting and possibly useful \u2013 a serious enhancement of Siri, Apple\u2019s attempt at a virtual personal assistant. Henceforth, the company announced: \u201cSiri will be able to deliver intelligence that\u2019s tailored to the user and their on-device information. For example, a user can say, \u2018Play that podcast that Jamie recommended,\u2019 and Siri will locate and play the episode, without the user having to remember whether it was mentioned in a text or an email. Or they could ask, \u2018When is Mom\u2019s flight landing?\u2019 and Siri will find the flight details and cross-reference them with real-time flight tracking to give an arrival time.\u201d\n\nIf Apple had stuck to the Jobs playbook, the time to have launched the enhancement would have been June this year at the earliest\n\nOn closer inspection, though, Siri \u2013 even running on my expensive new phone \u2013 could do none of these useful things. In fact, it mostly seemed as banal as ever. And then, on 7 March, came an announcement from Apple: \u201cWe\u2019ve also been working on a more personalised Siri, giving it more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps. It\u2019s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.\u201d\n\nFor Gruber, who knows more about Apple than anyone I know, this was like a red rag to a bull. The announcement meant, he wrote, that \u201cwhat Apple showed regarding the upcoming \u2018personalized Siri\u2019 at WWDC was not a demo. It was a concept video. Concept videos are bullshit, and a sign of a company in disarray, if not crisis\u201d. And because he has a long memory, it reminded him that the last time Apple had screened a concept video \u2013 the so-called \u201cKnowledge Navigator\u201d video \u2013 it was heading for bankruptcy. And it never made anything like it again once Steve Jobs had returned to turn it into the most profitable company in history.\n\nUntil \u2013 says Gruber \u2013 now.\n\nIs he overreacting? Answer: yes. Apple isn\u2019t in crisis, but this mini-fiasco with Siri and Apple Intelligence looks like the first serious misstep in Tim Cook\u2019s stewardship of the company. If there\u2019s one thing Jobs\u2019 Apple was famous for, it was not announcing products before they were ready to ship. It\u2019s clear that the company grossly underestimated the amount of work needed to deliver on what it promised for Siri last June. If it had stuck to the Jobs playbook, the time to have launched the enhancement would have been June 2025 at the earliest. The company had clearly forgotten Hofstadter\u2019s Law: Everything takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter\u2019s Law.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve been reading\n\nA million monkeys\u2026\n\nChatGPT Can\u2019t Kill Anything Worth Preserving is a marvellous essay by John Warner on AI and writing.\n\nMachines of loving grace?\n\nAI: A Means to an End or a Means to Our End?

            "content": "There are plenty of reasons to pick a MacBook Pro over a MacBook Air. For most people, it's getting the increased performance from an M4 Pro or M4 Max chip. For others, it's getting a bit more display, a 14.2-inch panel versus 13.6 inches on the smaller models or 16.2 inches to 15.3 inches on the larger MacBooks. And for others still, it's getting a better port selection with an extra Thunderbolt port to go along with an HDMI connection and SDXC card slot.\n\nMy primary laptop is a 14-inch MacBook Pro, but I don't really need Pro-level performance. After reviewing the new 15-inch MacBook Air M4, I'm nearly ready to trade my 14-inch Pro for the 15-inch Air. I love the Air's thinner and slightly lighter design and bigger display. But there's one thing holding me back. One feature exclusive to the MacBook Pro that I'm afraid I'd miss on the MacBook Air that's otherwise better suited to me. I'm not sure I can live (and scroll) without a ProMotion display.\n\nWatch this: M4 MacBook Air Review: Still Fantastic Even if Not Much Has Changed 04:44\n\nDisplay differences\n\nThe MacBook Air's Liquid Retina is a great laptop display. It's bright and sharp with accurate color. But it's not the Liquid Retina XDR display you get with a MacBook Pro. The 1,600-nit Liquid Retina Display XDR on a MacBook Pro is much brighter than the MacBook Air's 500-nit Liquid Retina display and bright enough for HDR content editing. My occasional video editing projects don't involve HDR video or extend beyond iMovie, so I'm willing to leave the extended dynamic range of an XDR display to the realm of the MacBook Pro.\n\nMacBook Pro displays also boast higher resolutions and pixels-per-inch counts but the MacBook Air's resolution presents a very sharp picture with more than enough pixels to my eyes. So I'm not asking for a higher resolution than what's currently offered on either MacBook Air model.\n\nHowever, with the amount of scrolling I do, what I want on the Air is the faster refresh rate you get on a Pro. Apple labels it as ProMotion and it provides an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz. That means it refreshes its image 120 times a second for smoother motion. With an Air, the display refreshes at a steady 60 times per second.\n\nThe MacBook Pro's ProMotion display has a refresh rate that is twice as fast as a MacBook Air's. Lori Grunin/CNET\n\nWhen I tested the new 15-inch MacBook Air, I looked at it next to my 14-inch MacBook Pro. And from this side-by-side comparison, I noticed the smoother motion when scrolling through web pages. The motion in YouTube videos or Netflix shows didn't look any smoother to me, but the more fluid motion was clear to me when I was browsing the web, an activity I do much more than watching YouTube or Netflix on a MacBook. Text stayed more legible on the Pro as I scrolled down a page. On the Air, letters and words blurred as I moved down the page, making it more difficult to keep reading while scrolling.\n\nAnd the adaptive part? A ProMotion display adapts the refresh rate depending on what's happening on your screen. When things are active and moving -- watching a movie or scrolling through an article, for example -- it cranks it up to 120Hz. When things are more static or when the display is sitting idle, it can drop the refresh rate to as low as 1Hz to conserve battery life.\n\nMy AirMotion compromise idea\n\nI suppose it is called ProMotion for a reason -- a feature exclusive to the MacBook Pro. Any MacBook Pro from 2021 and onward has a ProMotion display. You'll also find Apple's ProMotion displays on its other \"Pro\" devices. iPhone Pro models got ProMotion displays starting in 2021 along with the MacBook Pro, but Apple introduced the ProMotion display with the iPad Pro in 2017. ProMotion is doubly important on an iPad Pro because it allows for smoother movement and scrolling and provides a more natural and responsive feel for drawing, sketching and writing.\n\nA display with an adaptive refresh rate would bring smoother scrolling and longer battery life to the MacBook Air. Josh Goldman/CNET\n\nI'd argue that smoother scrolling from a ProMotion display is something all MacBook users can appreciate, unlike a true pro-level feature like a super-bright XDR panel needed for creating and editing HDR content. Plus, the adaptive part of ProMotion would help with battery life, another item that all MacBook users would certainly welcome.\n\nPlus, with MacBooks no longer the longest-running laptops I've tested -- they've fallen behind Copilot Plus PCs based on Qualcomm Snapdragon X processors -- it's in Apple's interests to bring ProMotion or something close to it to the MacBook Air to improve battery life.\n\nI understand adding a feature called ProMotion to a non-Pro product might cause Apple's marketing team some consternation. So let's do some rebranding. Call it AirMotion and give MacBook Air displays an adaptive refresh rate up to, say, 90Hz. Better yet, call it AirMotion with a 120Hz refresh rate and bump ProMotion up to 144Hz. That would maintain the Pro's edge over the Air while also helping to strengthen Apple's case that a MacBook Pro can be used for gaming.\n\nIn the end, any variety of a ProMotion (or AirMotion!) display would strengthen my ability to trade in my 14-inch MacBook Pro for the larger yet thinner and lighter 15-inch MacBook Air.",

            "content": "Apple Books is an underrated gem for how good books look in it and for how Apple has concentrated on making a tremendous reading experience -- but it still has some oddities, plus the problem of a smaller bookstore than its rivals.\n\nApple Books can be read across all Apple devices, but not on the web or any other e-reader\n\nThis isn't like Apple TV+ where the service started small but is steadily growing. Instead, it has consistently always been that if you want an ebook, it is certainly on Amazon Kindle, but only probably on Apple Books.\n\nThen Apple Books has the reputation for charging more for books than Amazon does and while that's not always the case, it still often is. If there is a difference at all, it can be a matter of just a dollar or two, though, and Apple Books is easily the better buy than Kindle just for the sheer presentation of the books and Apple's care for typography.\n\nExcept there is one more thing. Kindle books are locked to Amazon, but they can still be read everywhere -- including on iPads, iPhones, and Macs. Apple Books can only be read on Apple devices.\n\nLeft: Kindle app on iPhone. Right: Apple Books on iPhone. The difference is clearer when compared to a hardware Kindle, but Apple Books has far better typography\n\nSo if you want to build a collection and have it in just one place, if you want to be able to read any ebook you own without wondering where you saved it, there is an advantage to going for Kindle instead of Apple Books.\n\nBut if it's an advantage, it's also a compromise. Apple Books on any Apple device are vastly more a pleasure to read than on any current Kindle hardware.\n\nRead More from AppleInsider John Giannandrea out as Siri chief, Apple Vision Pro lead in Apple won't be forced into allowing third party app marketplaces in Brazil, for now Plex announces price increases for 2025, remote streaming of personal media no longer free\n\nIt's also better than the Kindle app on Apple devices, though there the typography comes more under Apple's control so the difference is less.\n\nAmazon concentrated on getting every book available on Kindle and it so devalued typography that it was years before hardware Kindles had any update to address it.\n\nApple, on the other hand, concentrated on each individual book and how it looked. Key to the whole Apple Books experience is that when you're reading a book, you are just reading the book -- all of the many options from bookmarking and highlighting are kept out of sight.\n\nLeft: an uninterrupted reading experience. Middle: a little information. Right: full Apple Books controls\n\nThat's central to the whole experience, but it does also mean that you can so very easily miss all the useful extra features that Apple Books offers. Plus until you know how it works, you can be staring at a book page entirely lost for how to get out of it.\n\nHow to read in Apple Books\n\nThere's a whole side to Apple Books that is to do with finding and buying books, and much to say about the detail of that. Yet first, you would imagine that reading a book you've got would be simple and it is, but only if you know certain things.\n\nSuch as one oddity that for some unfathomable reason is shared by both Apple Books and Kindle. If you have a book showing in your library but it doesn't happen to be downloaded onto the device you're using, naturally when you tap on the book, the first thing it does is download.\n\nOnly, you have made a positive choice that you want to read this book so it should then open, but it doesn't. You have to wait until it's downloaded and then tap again, in exactly the way you just did.\n\nIf a book you own doesn't happen to be on your current device, there are a couple of ways to download it\n\nAcross all Apple devices, there is a circular icon that shows you both that a book is being downloaded, and how far along that download is. It's particularly easy to miss on the iPhone, though, so you can be left wondering why nothing appears to have happened when you tapped.\n\nDownloading is quick -- even on a slow internet connection, books are not large -- so if you just scratch your head for a moment and then tap the book again, it's been downloaded. But since it's now downloaded, when you tap it, the book opens.\n\nIt all leaves you thinking you must have tapped it wrongly in some way.\n\nUninterrupted reading\n\nThen when you are in a book, you are just in the book -- you see its text, you see nothing of any controls, and the whole screen is taken over by that book. It is very well done, it is very freeing of distractions, and you just get to read, then tap or swipe to get to the next page.\n\nSoon enough, though, you're going to finish the book, or you'll have no more time to read just now. You can just come out of Apple Books, knowing that the title will stay on the latest page whether you open the app again on this device or any other you own.\n\nBut to come out of the book and stay in Apple Books, to get other titles for instance, you need to bring up the controls. It's not as if this is hard, but it does take a little getting used to.\n\nFor the way to bring up controls on the iPhone or iPad is to tap or click in the center of the page. If you tap for just a beat too long, however, you don't get controls, you instead highlight a word and get a definition.\n\nTop: uninterrupted reading in the Mac. Bottom: bringing up all of the Apple Books controls.\n\nIt's different on the Mac, where clicking in the middle of the book screen does nothing at all. On the Mac, you have to move your cursor up toward the top of the book's window and click.\n\nControls for reading\n\nIn its most recent redesign, Apple Books also minimized the controls you see when you even call up the controls. There is some text information -- what page you're on and, depending on how the publisher has provided the text, also how many pages are left in the chapter or the book.\n\nOtherwise, there is an X close icon at top right, and an icon of two lines over ellipses at bottom right. Tap on that bottom right icon and you get a neat set of initially seven controls.\n\nApple groups its Books controls into one neat selection\n\nContents (and a percentage read marker)\n\nSearch Book\n\nThemes & Settings\n\nSharing\n\nDevice screen lock\n\nLine Guide\n\nBookmark\n\nLine Guide is perhaps the least familiar, but may also be the most useful -- although it is solely on the iPhone. It's an accessibility option which dims the text of a book except for a single line.\n\nWhen you've read that line, you tap on the screen and it dims while the next one is highlighted instead.\n\nLine Guide is a reading aid on the iPhone version of Apple Books\n\nTo come back out of Line Guide, you tap the Line Guide icon which appears at bottom left. It includes options for controlling the dimming of other lines, plus Turn Off Line Guide.\n\nOf the other controls, which are across all devices, Themes & Settings is the most comprehensive, ranging from font and background, to how pages look as you turn them.\n\nThe many settings options include restoring the old curling page animation\n\nTapping on Themes & Settings takes you to a panel that is headed by font size controls. These two buttons marked with a small and a large A let you step up or down through different sizes of text.\n\nNext to those Aa icons is the page turn one, though the way it looks changes depending on your selection. By default, Apple Books now just Slides from one page to the next, but you can change that.\n\nMaybe the most common option is Curl. This is how Apple Books used to always work, right from when it was first released in 2010 as iBooks.\n\nAs you swipe to go to the next page, Curl animates the turning of the current page. You can also slowly swipe and control that animation, even turning the page back and forth.\n\nIt's a particularly well-done piece of Apple design, but you can also get bored of it very quickly. So Curl is no longer the default, and Themes & Settings also offers Slide, Fast Fade, and even just Scroll.\n\nWith that last, you no longer get any page turning at all. Instead, the entire book becomes one long, continuous flow of text and you simply keep scrolling down it.\n\nMore themes\n\nThis Themes & Settings section also contains an option for light or dark mode. This is particularly good for when you're reading at night and your iPhone or iPad screen seems incredibly bright.\n\nYou can choose to specifically be in light or dark mode, or you can have Apple Books change alongside your device's light/dark setting. Or perhaps most usefully, there is a Match Surroundings option that will adjust light and dark depending on the ambient lighting conditions where you are.\n\nAlongside this, you can have one-tap access to six major variations of Apple Books, such as a Calm setting that puts light black text on a sepia background. Plus there is an overall brightness slider.\n\nThen there is also, though, a Customize option. This opens up a choice of fonts -- it isn't every font on your device, but it is around a dozen of them.\n\nSettings options also include accessibility features\n\nThese same options are also on the Mac if you tap on the Aa icon toward the top right of the screen.\n\nJust as on the iPhone and iPad, doing that also presents yet another level of adjustable features. Having tapped or clicked on Customize, there is a section called Accessibility & Layout Options, which has its own further Customize control.\n\nChoose that and you can now set your preferred line spacing, character spacing, word spacing, and margins. There's also the option to have text be justified right and left, so have straight or jagged edges on the right.\n\nThe odds are that while it is startling how much control you can have in Apple Books, most people will not alter any of these options. That might be because the controls are a little hidden, but it could be because the default settings have been well chosen.\n\nStudy aids\n\nSpeaking of hidden options, Apple Books has the ability for you to mark passages, but it doesn't tell you how.\n\nTo do it, you first press and hold on the iPhone or iPad screen, then quickly swipe left or right to select a section of text. Once you do that, a popup menu offers you at least these options:\n\nHighlight\n\nAdd Note\n\nTranslate\n\nSearch\n\nCopy\n\nShare\n\nSpeak\n\nIf you have only selected one word, you get those plus Look Up, the dictionary option. Curiously, if you do just highlight one word, at first nothing happens other than it is highlighted.\n\nTo get the popup menu on a single word, you have to highlight it, then tap again in the middle of the highlight. It's like you're asking nicely.\n\nOf the controls you then get, search is an curious one. What it does is search the current book for any occurrence of what you have highlighted.\n\nIf that highlight is more than a word, then the odds are that the search will find only the page you're already on. But you can use it to search for, say, character names, or one or two particular words you think may be repeated in the book.\n\nThe very first option in the popup menu, though, is Highlight. It does just what you think -- it marks a passage so that you can easily find it later -- but it isn't quite the same as you may know from Kindle.\n\nThat's a good thing, too. What Kindle does in every book, by default, is show you where other people have highlighted passages.\n\nIt's called \"Popular Highlights\" and there must be people who want to know when a stranger has underlined a passage about dogs, but fortunately Apple doesn't think so. You can make all the highlighting you like, you are the only one who'll ever see it.\n\nOr rather, you won't bother other people, and they won't bother you, unless you positively choose to take a highlight and Share it with them directly.\n\nSelect some text and you can then highlight it\n\nHighlighting\n\nTo make a highlight for yourself on iPhone or iPad, tap on Highlight and you get the option for one of five colors, or an underline. On the Mac, drag over a passage to select it, then right-click to get a pop-up menu offering the colors, underlining, translation, searching, copying, Sharing, speech, or Add Note.\n\nPick a color, and that selected passage will forever be in that -- until you select it again, and from the popup menu choose Remove Highlight.\n\nHighlighting puts your chosen color behind the text. The text remains black, but the background for that passage is changed to your chosen color.\n\nIf you leave any section highlighted, then you will clearly see it as you go through the book again. However, you can also see all of your highlights in one place, and then jump from there to the specific page.\n\nTap a control to bookmark a page and you also get a new Bookmarks section.\n\nOnce anything is highlighted or bookmarked, the book controls change. Where there was Search Book before, there is now an extra control called Bookmarks & Highlights.\n\nThat new control also shows a number next to it, which is the count of how many highlights or bookmarks you've made.\n\nTap on the control and it defaults to showing you any bookmarks you've made. But you can tap at the top to switch to highlights.\n\nThen it lists the highlight, what page it's on, and when you added the highlight. Tap on the line and you go straight to the highlighted text in context.\n\nReading PDFs\n\nAll of this about highlighting, bookmarking, and searching, for instance, applies to anything you read in Apple Books -- except PDFs. Apple Books is a reasonable PDF reader, and especially so on the iPhone or iPad where it's perhaps even the best free viewer.\n\nApple Books on iPhone is an adequate PDF reader, plus you can sort them into Collections\n\nBut there are differences that apply to PDFs compared to every other type of document or book you can read in Apple Books. On the iPhone and iPad, you cannot, for example, change the font size.\n\nOn the Mac, you can't exactly do that either, but you can zoom in or out -- except you're not doing it in Apple Books. While Books on the Mac used to let you read PDFs, now if you open one, the Mac sends that PDF over to the Preview app.\n\nSo on the Mac, Apple Books is just a holder, a transport mechanism, for syncing PDFs across your devices.\n\nIf you read a lot of PDFs, Apple Books feels like it gets clogged up with them and since PDFs typically don't have covers, your library is filled with a lot of hard-to-distinguish documents. Apple does separate PDFs into their own section, away from all other books, but there aren't a lot of organization options.\n\nWhat you can do is create Collections. Select a couple or thirty PDFs, right click on the Mac and choose Add to Collection.\n\nOn iPhone or iPad, tap the ellipses icon at top right and choose Select. Then tap on any PDFs you want, and at the bottom of the screen tap the Add to button that appears.\n\nWhen you tap that, you get a rather pointless list that shows you sections like Books, Audiobooks, and Want to Read, all of which they're greyed out because they are unavailable. What is available is a New Collection button at the bottom.\n\nIt's fairly basic way of grouping together related titles, but it's handy with PDFs -- and it works with all books, too, wherever you get them from.\n\nWhat you can't read\n\nThere is a peculiar thing with Apple Books on the Mac. You can drag practically any type of document onto its icon in your Dock, and it appears to accept it.\n\nOn the Mac, Dock icons darken to show you that this dragged document is something that app can open. Then when you let go, with Apple Books the document appears to go into the icon, and the app launches.\n\nApple Books in the Mac's Dock will darken as you drag a book to it -- but unless it's an ePub format, good luck ever finding it\n\nUnless the document is in epub format however, good luck. Presumably it's in there somewhere, but you won't find it in your library and it won't automatically open the way a dragged book does.\n\nOn the iPhone and iPad, the equivalent to dragging is to open the document and Share it. But in Pages, for instance, Share does not include the option for sending to Books.\n\nSo this peculiarity is limited to the Mac.\n\nWhat you can read\n\nApple Books uses the epub format, so any document in that form can be read by the Books app. You just have to drag it to the Books icon on the Mac, or Share it from something like the Files app on iPhone and iPad.\n\nUnless you go around creating epub documents yourself, though, or you are somehow working with an archive of them created somewhere, the overwhelming majority of books you read will be ones from the Apple Bookstore.\n\nThat usually means buying them, but there are a very great many free books, such as public domain classics. The way you get any one of those is the same as buying a title, but the free books are also an illustration of a problem with the Bookstore.\n\nApple could not possibly find one more pixel of a way of recommending books. There are curated lists of staff favorites, there are top tens in different genres, there are promotional collections such as Coming Soon.\n\nThe Apple Bookstore is replete with recommendations, but its search feature is lacking\n\nRecommendations\n\nThere is so much recommendation that it's hard to just go in to see everything that's available. For instance, the shortest route to finding all the free books starts with tapping on Bookstore at the bottom of the screen on iPhone or iPad, or clicking on it in the sidebar on the Mac.\n\nFrom there, you need to scroll past \"Limited Time Offers\" and other promotions, until you reach \"Top Free\" -- if \"Top Free\" is even there. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't, whereas there is always a \"Top Paid\" section.\n\nWhen there is a \"Top Free\" section, you can click on that to get the full top ten list, and it will include a button to show you all free books.\n\nUnfortunately, when there isn't a \"Top Free\" section, you're screwed. There is no other way to browse only the free books.\n\nWhat you have to do is search for specific titles, and that's true whether you're hoping to find a free one, or you're just after a particular author. To do that search, you tap on the Search icon at bottom right of the iPhone or iPad screen, or in the sidebar on the Mac.\n\nSearching in Apple Books\n\nThis is more noticeable on the Mac, but when you do a search, you're not actually searching the Bookstore. Instead, you are searching your whole library plus the bookstore.\n\nThat's good because it means search results always surface what's in your library above what Apple can try to sell you.\n\nAnd on the iPhone or iPad, this isn't a big deal because while you are leaving the Bookstore to start the search, it's just a matter of tapping on the Search icon in the bottom row. The screen switches from the Bookstore to the search, and it's fine.\n\nBut on the Mac, search is in the sidebar. So you've gone into the Bookstore and your focus is on all it's trying to sell you, and to search you have mentally step back out to find that search button.\n\nThen searching in Apple Books, in any device, is not brilliant. Start typing an author's name and Apple Books will autocomplete it, which is good, but then show you an unordered list of all possible titles by that person.\n\nFrustratingly, search in Apple Books is inconsistent.\n\nFor example, if you search for \"JK Rowling\" then you get the Harry Potter books, as you'd expect, plus her novel, \"The Casual Vacancy.\" But if you instead search for \"J. K. Rowling,\" with periods, you get all of that plus the excellent \"Cormoran Strike\" novels she famously writes under the pseudonym of Robert Galbraith.\n\nWhatever you search for, and however you spell it, you tend to get a long and initially unfiltered list of results. You do have some limited options for sorting that into something more manageable.\n\nOn the iPhone, there is a row of options you can tap to show All, Books, and Audiobooks. For some reason it varies -- a search on iOS Apple Books could also give you a Series button, while the iPad may add Genres.\n\nThe Mac has the same list of options as the iPad, but it's under a dropdown list called Filter by.\n\nSearch limitations\n\nAt this point, there is no option to sort by publication date. You can't, at this stage, just find out the latest title by an author you like.\n\nSearch will group series together on the iPad and Mac, even if you haven't chosen to filter by series. When it's done that, or you have chosen Series on the iPhone, you can tap on a series to get a Bookstore page devoted to it.\n\nThat page includes an ellipses icon toward the top right, on all devices. In that you can sort by release date.\n\nIt's an unsatisfactory system because as well as sorting by release date, you can also sort by what are just called Ascending or Descending. There's nothing to say what is being sorted in these directions, but you would imagine it's the reading order of the books -- and that's most often the same as the release date.\n\nExcept Apple Books will also show different editions, and arrange those in different places depending on how you sort.\n\nTo find the real latest book, you're probably better off Googling it, checking the author's page, or looking it up in Amazon. But at least Apple Books will normally pop \"Book 1,\" \"Book 2,\" and so on above the title.\n\nThat just doesn't fully help when you've scrolled to Book 10 and don't know whether that's the latest one, or that Book 11 has been sorted somewhere further down the list.\n\nOnce you find a book in the Bookstore\n\nClick or tap on a specific book and you get a kind of pop-up card about it. What's on the card depends to an extent on the book's publisher, but typically you get at least:\n\nSeries number, if there is one\n\nTitle\n\nAuthor\n\nStar rating (and number of ratings)\n\nPrice to buy\n\n\"Want to Read\" and \"Sample\" buttons\n\nA Share icon\n\nPromotion for the audiobook version\n\nPublisher's description\n\nOnce you find a book in the store, you can buy it, get a sample, or just scroll through a lot of detail\n\nVery often, the book card will also contain a review from Publisher's Weekly, and surprisingly often also one from Apple Books staff too. There's usually a section for user reviews as well.\n\nAfter all of those there is always a lot of detail about page count (in the printed version), plus language, year of publication, and so on.\n\nIf you know you want the book, you can just ignore everything and click on the price.\n\nWhen you're not so sure, though, you have the option to click on Want to Read, or Sample. On the Mac, you get both, while on the iPhone there's just Buy and Sample on the card, with Add to Want to Read under an ellipses icon.\n\nWant to Read and Sample are practically the same option. They both download the start of a book for you try out, but Want to Read also adds it to a collection of the same name.\n\nOnly, if you tend to scroll through your library's All section -- instead of through a collection you've named, or one such as Finished -- you see the sample. It isn't just saved into that Want to Read collection, so the result is that your library still gets clogged up with samples.\n\nBut give Apple some credit here because at least it understands how sample books work. A sample is the first chapter or two -- the amount you get in the sample is decided by the publisher -- and if you like it, you can then buy the whole thing.\n\nYou can buy the whole book at any point, but you are especially prompted to when you reach the end of the sample.\n\nSo you buy it and what Apple does is replace the sample in your library with the whole book. It also remembers where you read up to in the sample, so you can now just tap on the book and carry on reading from where you are.\n\nAmazon Kindle sometimes does this too. But for reasons passing understanding, often it won't and instead your Kindle library has both the full book and the sample.\n\nApple Books is built by readers\n\nThe fact that Amazon Kindle sometimes does this thing with keeping the sample around and sometimes not, is clearly a bug. But it's also an indication that perhaps the developers aren't readers and so haven't even noticed the problem.\n\nApple Books developers could well be non-readers too, but it always feels as if they are deeply into books. Getting that sample business right feels like they know how this should work because they are readers too.\n\nAnd then there is just the overall fact that any Apple Book will look better to the eye, will present a better reading experience, than Kindle or so far any other e-reader.\n\nJust as some people can't bear iPhone screens without ProMotion and others simply cannot see it, this is all subjective. But if you do care about typography, if you do appreciate a better reading experience, Apple Books is the one to beat.",

As Mark\u2019s \u201coutie\u201d grieves the loss of his wife, his \u201cinnie\u201d lives an entirely different existence behind the walls of the shady biotech company Lumon. Of course, Lumon and its experimental severance procedure aren\u2019t exactly what they are advertised to be.\n\nIn Season 1, Mark and his co-workers Helly (Britt Lower), Dylan (Zach Cherry) and Irving (John Turturro) launch a rebellion against the company by figuring out how to awaken their innie selves in the outside world. In Season 2, they explore and grapple with the disturbing truths they learn about themselves outside the office.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cSeverance\u201d also stars Tramell Tillman, Patricia Arquette, Christopher Walken, Dichen Lachman, Jen Tullock and Michael Chernus.\n\nThe sci-fi mystery series had built a strong audience in the three-year gap between the launch of its first and second season. Creator Erickson told Variety ahead of the Season 2 premiere that \u201ca lot is mapped out\u201d for Season 3, and \u201cthere is an endpoint for the series as a whole, and we know more or less how many seasons we are going to do.\u201d\n\nExecutive producing alongside Stiller and Erickson are Nicholas Weinstock, Jackie Cohn, Mark friedman, Andrew Colville, Chris Black, John Cameron, Beau Willimon, Caroline Baron, Jordan Tappis and Scott. Fifth Season, Red Hour Productions, Westward and Animals & People are the production companies.\n\n\u201cMaking \u2018Severance\u2019 has been one of the most creatively exciting experiences I\u2019ve ever been a part of,\u201d Stiller said in a statement. \u201cWhile I have no memory of this, I\u2019m told making Season 3 will be equally enjoyable, though any recollection of these future events will be forever and irrevocably wiped from my memory as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more excited to get back to work with Ben, Dan, the incredible cast and crew, Apple and the whole \u2018Severance\u2019 team,\u201d said Scott. \u201cOh hey also \u2014 not a huge deal \u2014 but if you see my innie, please don\u2019t mention any of this to him. Thanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea of getting to make more \u2018Severance\u2019 with the greatest cast and crew on Earth is more thrilling to me than all the world\u2019s finger traps combined,\u201d said Erickson. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to continue spreading woe, frolic, dread and malice with these truly incredible people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Ben, Dan, Adam and the talented cast and crew behind \u2018Severance\u2019 have brought to the screen is undeniable magic,\u201d said Matt Cherniss, head of programming for Apple TV+. \u201cWe\u2019re so proud to be the home for this brilliant series and look forward to audiences experiencing what\u2019s in store for Season 3.\u201d",

Whether you decide to shell out for a service typically comes down to the shows and movies on offer, whether you're looking for buzzy Netflix series or HBO prestige TV. But there's an underrated competitor in the mix, especially for TV shows.\n\nApple TV+, Apple's own streaming service, has become better and better over the years, hitting it out of the park with sci-fi smashes like Severance, Silo, and Foundation, along with comedy wins like Shrinking, Bad Sisters, and Ted Lasso \u2014 plus a few curveballs mixed in here and there.\n\nOne important thing to know? Apple TV+ is not the same thing as Apple TV. As Mashable's Stan Schroeder explains it, \"Apple TV is both the name for the set-top-box hardware device that you buy and connect to your TV, as well as the app that's available on Apple TV (the set-top-box), as well as Macs, iPhones, and other TV operating systems. And then there's Apple TV+, which is Apple's streaming service and a competitor to Netflix, HBO Max, and others.\"\n\nGot it? So, what are the best TV shows on Apple TV+? Here are our picks of the streaming service's original series, ranked.\n\n33. The Shrink Next Door\n\nPaul Rudd and Will Ferrell in \u201cThe Shrink Next Door.\" Credit: Apple TV+\n\nInspired by true events, The Shrink Next Door sends Paul Rudd and Will Ferrell into a complicated web of manipulation, power plays, and mic-drop moments. The series hinges on unethical psychiatrist Dr. Ike Herschkopf (Paul Rudd) and his patient, Marty Markowitz (Will Ferrell), who have a dysfunctional relationship that becomes more and more imbalanced and twisted as Ike weasels his way into Marty's life. Kathryn Hahn stars as Marty\u2019s younger sister Phyllis, and Casey Wilson plays Bonnie, Ike's wife. \u2014 Shannon Connellan, UK Editor\n\nStarring: Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd, Kathryn Hahn, Casey Wilson, Cornell Womack, Sarayu Blue, Robin Bartlett, and Gable Swanlund\n\nHow to watch: The Shrink Next Door is streaming on Apple TV+.\n\n32. Defending Jacob\n\nChris Evans, Jaeden Martell, and Michelle Dockery in \u201cDefending Jacob.\" Credit: Apple TV+\n\nGiven its grim subject matter, Mark Bomback's crime drama won't be for everyone. Defending Jacob follows Assistant DA Andy Barber (Chris Evans), whose life is thrown into turmoil after his son Jacob (a haunted Jaeden Martell) is charged with the murder of a classmate. The show immediately chucks us in at the deep end, with the question of Jacob's innocence hanging over the Barber family like a storm cloud that threatens to badly damage or even break them altogether. It's tense, well-written, and the acting \u2014 including a disturbingly memorable turn from Michelle Dockery as Jacob's struggling mother, Laurie \u2014 is excellent across the board.\n\nSome have argued that the show doesn't do enough to justify its dark storyline, but I found it to be a horribly suspenseful exploration of how far familial bonds will stretch before they snap altogether. Can you ever fully know anyone? Can you trust your closest family members no matter what? Love them no matter what?

That means crashing the lavish Palm Royale club, where she'll be met with snobbery and disdain at every turn. While Palm Royale is far from Apple TV+'s best comedy offering, it does boast an all-star cast of comedy greats, including a fabulous Carol Burnett.

Rolling about the woods with his Essex Gang of misfits, Turpin takes on a peril of the week in Monty Python meets Our Flag Means Death meets The Mighty Boosh\u2013fashion. Throw in some cameos from Britain's biggest comedians, with standout appearances by Tamsin Greig, Greg Davies, and Sex Education's Connor Swindells, and you've got a surreal, satisfying, history-adjacent adventure on your hands.* \u2014 S.C.\n\nStarring: Noel Fielding, Tamsin Greig, Greg Davies, Connor Swindells, Michael Fielding, Mark Heap, Ellie White, Duayne Boachie, Marc Wootton, Dolly Wells, Asim Chaudhry, Sindhu Vee, and Simon Farnaby\n\nHow to watch: The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin is now streaming on Apple TV+.\n\n29.

Shining Girls\n\nElisabeth Moss in \u201cShining Girls.\" Credit: Apple TV+\n\nImagine the ghoulish love child of Sliding Doors and Zodiac, and you'll get the gist of this mini-series adaptation of Lauren Beukes' 2013 crime novel. Created by Silka Luisa, Shining Girls centers on Kirby Mazrachi (Elisabeth Moss), an archivist whose reality has been shifting without warning ever since she was viciously attacked and left for dead in 1980s Chicago. One moment she's living with her mom, and the next she's married to a co-worker she barely knows. She doesn't understand why this is happening but is certain it connects to a stalking serial killer (Jamie Bell), who's been targeting fantastic women across decades.\n\nFeaturing graphic violence, time-travel twists, and harrowing revelations, Shining Girls can be a tough watch. But its finale episode makes it all worthwhile. Luisa smartly buttons up the mysteries of these murders, their un-aging perpetrator, and what it means to become disentangled on a molecular level. More than answers, however, this finale gives poetic justice to its villain and a hard-won empowerment to its harried heroine. Which, considering how Kirby's quest to be believed plays like the most extreme version of a domestic violence survivor's experiences coming forward, is darkly and deeply satisfying. \u2014 Kristy Puchko, Entertainment Editor\n\nStarring: Elisabeth Moss, Phillipa Soo, Wagner Moura, Jamie Bell, Erika Alexander, Amy Brenneman, Chris Chalk, and Madeline Brewer\n\nHow to watch: Shining Girls is now streaming on Apple TV+.\n\n26.

Austin Butler and Callum Turner lead the charge as the real Major Gale \"Buck\" Cleven and Major John \"Bucky\" Egan, and the series moves through the missions, downtime, tragedies, and sense of camaraderie within the unit. Yes, the series takes some creative liberties, but producers Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, and Gary Goetzman threw 10 years and $250 million at the show \u2014 so when you're experiencing a live-or-die tactical manoeuvre, you're in the pilot's seat. \u2014 S.C.\n\nStarring: Austin Butler, Callum Turner, Barry Keoghan, and Anthony Boyle\n\nHow to watch: Masters of the Air is now streaming on Apple TV+.\n\n27.

But it's only through a series of flashbacks that we find out what happened to him, learning the ways he wronged each of the Garvey sisters and their various misjudged attempts to take him out of the picture.

The inhabitants, ranked in class by floor, put immense trust in their overlords: Mayor Ruth Jahns (Geraldine James), head of the IT Department (Tim Robbins), and the silo's sheriffs, including Sheriff Holston (David Oyelowo) and Deputy Sam Marnes (Will Patton). But when suspicious events occur, an engineer from the silo's lower levels, Juliette (Rebecca Ferguson), races to figure out the truth. \u2014 S.C.\n\nStarring: Rebecca Ferguson, David Oyelowo, Rashida Jones, Tim Robbins, Common, Harriet Walter, Iain Glen, Tanya Moodie, Geraldine James, Avi Nash, Chinaza Uche, Steve Zahn, Shane McRae, Remmie Milner, Alexandria Riley, Clare Perkins, Billy Postlethwaite, Ashley Zukerman, Olatunji Ayofe, and Ferdinand Kingsley\n\nHow to watch: Silo is now streaming on Apple TV+.\n\n3. Pachinko\n\nKim Min-ha and Jung Eun-chae in \"Pachinko.\" Credit: Apple TV+\n\nBased on Min Jin Lee's best-selling novel, Pachinko spans not only decades but also generations, following a family line from an impoverished community in 1915 Korea to a prosperous Japan in 1989. The center of this moving saga is matriarch Kim Sunja, who grows from an intrepid child (Yu-na Jeon) to a pregnant, unwed teen (Kim Min-ha), to a grandmother (Academy Award\u2013winning star of Minari, Youn Yuh-jung) too often patronized by her doting son (Soji Arai) and hotshot banker grandson Solomon (Jin Ha).\n\nCreated by Soo Hugh, this sensational two-season drama series slides back and forth across its timeline, paralleling Sunja's journey with Solomon's. Though she was raised in poverty and he in prosperity, both face challenges of racism, weighty family expectations, and impossible loves. Incredibly, though Pachinko hits on many dark elements, it's resiliently hopeful, delivering on the promise of its exhilarating opening title sequence. If you're looking for a series to grab you heart and soul, Pachinko is a safe bet for satisfaction, a series Mashable's Belen Edwards dubbed \"one of the most stunningly crafted shows on TV.\"* \u2014 K.P.\n\nStarring: Jeon Yu-na, Kim Min-ha, Youn Yuh-jung, Soji Arai, Jin Ha, Lee Min-ho, Kwon Eun-seong, Jung Eun-chae, and Yoshio Maki\n\nHow to watch: Pachinko is now streaming on Apple TV+.\n\n2. The Studio\n\nIke Barinholtz, Kathryn Hahn, Chase Sui Wonders, and Seth Rogen in \"The Studio.\" Credit: Apple TV+\n\nSeth Rogen and a jaw-dropping cast of big stars give Hollywood the takedown it so richly deserves with The Studio.\n\nThe battle of art versus commerce takes center stage as Rogen plays a newly minted studio exec, who has to make an endless series of wild decisions. If you ever wonder how the blockbuster sausage gets made, the first episode of this stellar comedy series gives you a juicy and revolting taste.\n\nThe writing on this satirical series is so sharp that Rogen practically bleeds as he plays the fool across an array of comical conflicts. And he's bolstered by a supporting cast that is blisteringly funny, spitting barbs, allusions, and one-liners with a dizzying intensity.* \u2014 K.P.\n\nStarring: Seth Rogen, Catherine O\u2019Hara, Kathryn Hahn, Ike Barinholtz, Chase Sui Wonders, and Bryan Cranston\n\nHow to watch: The Studio debuts on Apple TV+ March 26.\n\n1. Severance\n\nWelcome to the team. Credit: Apple TV+\n\nIt's not only the best show on Apple TV+, it's one of our favourite shows of all time. Dan Erickson's \"anti-capitalist fable\" Severance centres around the enigmatic Lumon Industries, a company that offers employees the option of \"severing\" their work self from their regular lives. Primarily directed by Ben Stiller, Severance sees impeccable performances from Adam Scott, Britt Lower, Patricia Arquette, John Turturro, Zach Cherry, Tramell Tillman, Christopher Walken, and more, with the cast tasked with playing both their \"Innies\" and \"Outies\" \u2014 and all the loaded nuance that comes with it.\n\nExactly what Lumon does and how the severance program began are just two of the mysteries within Severance, a show that explores fascinating questions of consent, exploitation, alienation, and humanity within a highly stylistic production. What's not in question? Over two sublime seasons, Severance doesn't miss. \u2014 S.C.\n\nStarring: Adam Scott, Britt Lower, Patricia Arquette, John Turturro, Zach Cherry, Tramell Tillman, Christopher Walken, Jen Tullock, Dichen Lachman, Michael Chernus, and Sarah Bock\n\nHow to watch: Severance is now streaming on Apple TV+.",

            "content": "Having launched in 2019, Apple TV+ is one of the youngest streaming services available today. Over the years, the Apple-owned platform has grown into a powerhouse of original TV shows, like Ted Lasso and Severance, as well as movies like Killers of the Flower Moon. While it may not release new content at the same pace as something like Netflix, Apple TV+ is only a fraction of the price and comes bundled with just about every new Apple device purchase, making it easier than ever to check out its growing library. Below, we'll break down what Apple TV+ is as a service, how much it costs, and how to sign up for a free trial.\n\n7 Days Free Apple TV+ Free Trial 26 See it at Apple\n\nApple TV+ offers a 7-day free trial for all new subscribers. Simply head over to the Apple TV+ homepage or app and you'll be greeted with a button that says \"Accept Free Trial.\" New iPhones, iPads, Apple TVs, and Mac computers also come bundled with a 3-month Apple TV+ trial, which requires manual activation through the Apple TV app on the device. In both cases, once your trial ends, your subscription will automatically renew at the standard monthly rate of $9.99/month.\n\nWhat Is Apple TV+? Everything You Need to Know\n\nPlay\n\nApple TV+ is an award-winning streaming service featuring Apple Originals \u2014 exclusive series, movies, documentaries, and more, with new content added every month. While it was a bit barebones when it launched in 2019, Apple TV+ has grown its library to over 180 series, with breakout hits like Ted Lasso, Severance, and Silo, as well as over 80 original films, including Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon. Apple TV+ was also the first streaming service to receive an Academy Award for its original film CODA, which released in 2022.\n\nWhile Apple TV+ may not boast a massive library like Netflix, it's long maintained a \"quality over quantity\" approach when it comes to its original programming with something that will surely appeal to just about anyone, regardless of age.\n\nHow Much Is Apple TV+?\n\nApple TV+ is one of the least-expensive streaming services at $9.99/month.

The lowest-tier Apple One plan gives you access to four subscriptions: Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and a 50GB iCloud+ plan, all for $19.95/month.

Speaking to Travis and Jason Kelce on their New Heights podcast, he said \u201cthe plan is definitely not\u201d to make fans wait that long.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe series stars Adam Scott, Britt Lower, Tramell Tillman, Zach Cherry, Jen Tullock, Michael Chernus, Dichen Lachman, John Turturro, Christopher Walken and Patricia Arquette. Sarah Bock and \u00d3lafur Darri \u00d3lafsson joined as series regulars for season two, which also saw guest spots from the likes of Bob Balaban, Sarah Sherman, Alia Shawkat and Sandra Bernhard, while Keanu Reeves made a surprise cameo as the voice of the Lumon building in an animated video.\n\nSeverance follows Mark Scout (Scott), who leads a team at Lumon Industries, whose employees have undergone a severance procedure that surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. This experiment in \u201cwork-life balance\u201d is called into question as Mark finds himself at the center of a mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work and of himself.\n\nThe second season of the corporate workplace thriller answered several lingering questions, including getting viewers closer to understanding what exactly Lumon\u2019s severed employees are sorting on the Macrodata Refinement team.\n\nIn addition to introducing several new characters from Dylan G.\u2019s (Cherry) wife Gretchen, played by Merritt Weaver, to Gwendoline Christie\u2019s head of Mammalian\u2019s Nurturing aka the Goat Department at Lumon, the show filled in several different backstories for characters. Turns out Lumon played a major role in not only Harmony Cobel\u2019s (Arquette) early childhood and career, but also in the inception of the romance between Mark Scout (Adam Scott) and Gemma (Lachman).\n\nSeverance, which is produced by Fifth Season, is written, created written and executive produced by Dan Erickson. Exec producers also include Stiller, Scott, Arquette, John Lesher, Jackie Cohn, Mark Friedman, Beau Willimon, Jordan Tappis, Sam Donovan, Caroline Baron, Richard Schwartz and Nicholas Weinstock.\n\nStiller directed five episodes of season two (and six in season one), while Uta Bresiewitz, Sam Donovan and Jessica Lee Gagn\u00e9 also helmed episodes in its sophomore season.\n\n\u201cMaking Severance has been one of the most creatively exciting experiences I\u2019ve ever been a part of,\u201d said Ben Stiller. \u201cWhile I have no memory of this, I\u2019m told making season three will be equally enjoyable, though any recollection of these future events will be forever and irrevocably wiped from my memory as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more excited to get back to work with Ben, Dan, the incredible cast and crew, Apple and the whole Severance team,\u201d added Adam Scott. \u201cOh, hey also \u2013 not a huge deal \u2013 but if you see my innie, please don\u2019t mention any of this to him.

Without getting into the weeds of that discussion, I would say that my attitude toward DEI, broadly understood, actually does fit neatly into the First Amendment\u2019s view of religion \u2013 that the state should pass no law establishing it, nor prohibit the free exercise thereof.\n\nMany companies have recently scaled back their DEI programs. Others have chosen to keep them. I\u2019m content to let companies make their own decisions about who they want to hire and on what basis. My concern as a consumer is if the company is serving my wants or needs at the end of the day. If it is, I\u2019ll exchange with them. And if not, then I won\u2019t. I didn\u2019t make any effort to avoid shopping at Target when they were big into DEI, and I\u2019m not even slightly tempted to boycott them now that they are scaling back their DEI programs. I shop at Target because they sell lots of things that fit my lifestyle, wants, and budget. I think there\u2019s something deeply psychologically unhealthy about the desire to make the place I shop for oatmeal and paper towels into a fundamental part of my personal identity.\n\nRecently, the shareholders of Apple overwhelmingly voted to maintain the company\u2019s DEI program. The news story linked above adds the following observation:\n\nThe proposal targeting Apple\u2019s DEI policies was backed by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, which had also put forward the proposal at Costco. It argued that the existence of Apple\u2019s diversity and inclusion programs exposed the firm to \u201clitigation, reputational and financial risks\u201d, pointing to the wider corporate retreat and noting that recent lawsuits have made it easier for workers to sue over discrimination.\n\nTo loosely quote President James Dale from the movie Mars Attacks!, two out of three ain\u2019t bad. That is, it\u2019s fine if maintaining the DEI program exposes Apple to financial or reputational risks. As a private company, taking on those risks is Apple\u2019s choice to make \u2013 or more precisely, a choice to be made by Apple executives and shareholders. If you\u2019re an Apple shareholder and those risks worry you, you can sell your shares. If you\u2019re not a shareholder but just fundamentally object to any company that chooses to use these practices, then you can simply not buy anything Apple sells. If you\u2019re neither an Apple customer nor a shareholder, then it\u2019s just none of your business how Apple manages these decisions.\n\nThe risk of litigation should not be a factor here. The test of how Apple manages its internal affairs should be how well they are satisfying the needs of consumers on the marketplace. If Apple\u2019s hiring practices or internal governance makes them less effective at producing things consumers want, then Apple and their shareholders will pay the price for that in the marketplace. And that\u2019s great! Or maybe Apple\u2019s practices will work out for them, and they\u2019ll continue to produce lots of stuff consumers want to buy, and reap huge success. Also great! But the answer to that question should emerge from a process of capitalist acts among consenting adults, rather than because someone in Washington decided they should be able to make these decisions on Apple\u2019s behalf.",

            "content": "The pace of iOS 18.4 betas is stepping up, with the fourth public beta available this week, which means the next release version of the iPhone software could soon be upon us. These successive releases tend to be more stable, especially for incremental updates like this that bring bug fixes as well as tweaks to Apple Intelligence -- and more new emojis.\n\nBut before you start that download, I'm here to remind you of the \"beta\" part of \"public beta.\" Prerelease software is unfinished and even though a public beta means Apple is confident enough to seed it on several thousand iPhones, the goal is to see how the update fares before it's deployed on millions of iPhones. Although the iOS 18.4 developer beta has been pretty stable, one never knows what bugs could slip through.\n\nFor more on what iOS 18 brings to the iPhone, make sure you check out everything Apple announced at its September \"Glowtime\" event and how Apple Intelligence affects the way we use Apple devices.\n\nA positive word about installing the iOS 18.4 public beta\n\nThe public beta is more stable than the developer betas, which Apple has steadily released since the beginning of June, and are intended for ... developers.\n\nBut \"more stable\" isn't the same as \"rock solid.\" Apple is still adding and changing features in the iOS 18.4 betas before the anticipated release of iOS 18.4 in April.\n\nIf you decide to install the iOS 18.4 public beta, I recommend doing it on a separate iPhone that isn't used as your main personal phone. iOS 18.4 will work with models as old as the iPhone SE (second generation) and iPhone XR, so reach into the back of your tech drawer and put that forgotten iPhone into service.\n\nAlso, as always, make sure you have good backups of your data.\n\nBugs are part of the iOS 18.4 public beta\n\nNow, let's discuss why upgrading to the iOS public beta might be a bad idea.\n\nSoftware bugs at the development stage are to be expected -- in fact, that's kinda the point. Now is the time for bugs to skitter into the light so developers can catch them and Apple can fix them before the final release. Opening the public beta to more testers helps flush out odd interactions with a much larger pool of iPhones and third-party apps.\n\nBugs can vary across the spectrum. You could face connectivity issues with Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, or end up with third-party applications crashing from time to time. Features that work perfectly on iOS 18 might not be up to par on iOS 18.4, even if they aren't necessarily tied to new iOS 18.4 features. And runaway background processes could keep the system running hotter than normal, decreasing not just how long the phone operates on a battery charge, but potentially stressing the battery's lifespan. To be fair, I've never dealt with any show-stopping, brick-your-phone bugs in a beta -- usually, they're a series of annoyances that can grate on you after a while. But all of this is perfectly normal in developer and public betas.\n\nBut if you don't want to deal with bugs and other issues that could make your phone more difficult to use, you probably don't want the iOS 18.4 public beta on your primary iPhone.\n\nYour battery life may worsen\n\nDid you recently buy a recommended portable charger for your iPhone? Expect to make more use of it while running beta software. Energy efficiency is usually the last thing Apple's developers optimize, because the priority at this point is to make sure features work and bugs are stamped out.\n\nAn iOS update also triggers a host of internal indexing, which consumes a lot of energy for a few hours or days after installation. The Photos app, for example, updates its database of recognized people, scans images for new recognizable objects or scenes for search purposes and looks for duplicates.\n\nBetas can be tough on batteries. CNET\n\nPerformance may take a hit\n\nPartially because of the reindexing of gigabytes of data on your phone, the iOS 18.4 public beta will almost certainly not deliver the performance you might be expecting. Processor-intensive apps and games also need to be tuned to work with the new iOS, so stutters and glitches are normal.\n\nGame Mode is a new feature for iOS (it first appeared in MacOS Sonoma) that redirects resources to improve frame rates and Bluetooth latency, so the most demanding games might perform better than under iOS 17 or iOS 18. However, Game Mode works at a low level and could be interrupted by beta components.\n\nGame Mode can improve performance in demanding games but beta software could interrupt such low-level processes. Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nNot all new iOS 18 features are there yet\n\nWe already know many of the razzle-dazzle Apple Intelligence features won't be available right away, even though iOS 18.3 gave us a few more to play with. Such is the life cycle of development: Some features get put on the back burner so others can be completed.\n\nI know it's tough to be patient when future features are just a download away. But I also don't want you to be burned (as I have in the past).\n\nFor more about iOS 18, see how the new Passwords app works across all your devices.",

            "content": "The European Union has outlined exactly how Apple needs to improve the interoperability of iOS, and the guidance reveals which features could be available to other smartwatches, headphones, and speakers.\n\nThe specifications adopted by the European Commission on Tuesday explain exactly how Apple needs to open iPhone and iPad operating systems to comply with the bloc\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA) law, and involves two sets of different measures. One is focused on improving the application process for developers who request interoperability with Apple\u2019s ecosystem. The other is more exciting for iPhone and iPad users, as it specifically outlines nine iOS-exclusive connectivity features that Apple needs to make available for other platforms to use \u2014 the vast majority of which need to be opened up \u201cby the end of 2025 at the latest,\u201d according to the EU ruling.\n\nOne of the standouts is opening access to iOS notifications, which will finally allow third-party smartwatches to display and interact with them in a manner currently only available on Apple Watch devices. A feature that allows apps to run in the background without interruption will also enable third-party devices to more reliably collect information like news and weather updates from connected iPhones.\n\nFeatures like SharePlay and audio-switching capabilities that allow Apple headphones to automatically jump between different devices (switching from playing music on an iPad to receiving an incoming call on iPhones, for example) must be made available on third-party earphones and headsets, sparing iPhone users from needing to buy AirPods. Apple also needs to let devices use the same high-bandwidth iPhone connections currently only available on Apple hardware, which could improve connectivity on third-party VR headsets.\n\nOther platforms will also be able to send and receive data via AirDrop and AirPlay when connected with an Apple device, and iOS will need to support alternative services to both AirDrop and AirPlay. Additional improvements expected for third-party devices include making them easier for iPhone users to set up without downloading a companion app, automatically connecting to Wi-Fi networks via iPhones, and easily receiving contactless payment credentials via NFC transfer.\n\nThese requirements are legally binding and must be applied for Apple to meet its DMA obligations. Apple risks facing a non-compliance investigation that could eventually result in hefty fines of up to ten percent of Apple\u2019s annual turnover if the EU finds Apple violating DMA rules by not implementing the guidance by its deadlines.\n\nApple has the opportunity to fight the decisions, subject to judicial review. Such opposition seems likely, given Apple said in a statement to The Verge that the EU\u2019s requirements are \u201cbad for our products and for our European users.\u201d The EU seems confident that its ruling will force the company to open up its walled iOS garden for other platform developers, however.",

            "content": "Apple can afford the loss \u2014 the company's Services division brought in $26.3 billion overall for Apple for the three months ending in January.\n\nApple TV+, Apple's streaming service that scored 72 Emmy Award nominations and nine Golden Globe nominations last year, is reportedly costing the company billions of dollars.\n\nAccording to a report from The Information on Thursday, Apple has spent more than $5 billion annually creating high-quality prestige TV shows like the World War II miniseries \"Masters of the Air\" and the hit science fiction show \"Severance.\" The Information reported that despite Apple obtaining 45 million Apple TV+ subscribers, the company has lost more than $1 billion per year on the streaming service.\n\nThe news aligns with previous reports. Bloomberg noted last year that Apple spent more than $20 billion on original content from 2019 to 2024, but only attracted 0.2% of U.S. TV viewership overall.\n\nApple's 45 million subscribers lag behind the number racked up by competitors. Industry leader Netflix has over 300 million subscribers while Disney+ has nearly 125 million.\n\nRelated: Amazon Prime Video Doesn't Want to Be Just a Default Prime Perk. Here's How the Streaming Service Became a Major Player.\n\nApple also charges less for Apple TV+ compared to rivals. An ad-free subscription to Apple TV+ costs $9.99 per month compared to Netflix's lowest ad-free tier of $17.99 per month and Disney+'s lowest ad-free category of $15.99 per month. Apple tucks in Apple TV+ into other purchases, bundling three free months of Apple TV+ with the purchase of any Apple device and offering a free subscription to the streaming service with $5.99 per month Apple Music Student Plans.\n\nThough a $1 billion loss may seem significant, it barely makes a dent in Apple's overall revenue. Apple TV+ falls under the company's Services division, which also houses Apple Music, Apple Fitness, Apple News+, Apple Arcade, Apple Books, and iCloud. The company's most recent earnings for the quarter ending in January show that Apple brought in $124.3 billion in revenue overall, with $26.3 billion coming from Services. For the full year of 2024, Services yielded $96 billion in revenue.\n\nSince launching in November 2019, Apple shows have set themselves apart for their top-notch production and star-studded casts. For example, \"The Morning Show\" featured Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, and \"Oprah's Book Club\" starred Oprah Winfrey as the host.\n\nThe approach has resulted in critical acclaim, with the show \"Ted Lasso\" earning 11 Emmy Awards overall and the movie \"Coda\" being the first from a streaming service to take home an Oscar for best picture in 2022. Apple has established an extensive library of content, building over 80 original movies and 120 original shows from the ground up, including comedy shows like \"Mythic Quest\" and action-packed movies like \"Wolfs.\"\n\nRelated: This Streaming Service Beat Netflix as the No. 1 One Market Leader in the U.S.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook said in a post-earnings call in January that the streaming service had earned more than 2,500 award nominations and 538 wins since it began.\n\nApple is the most valuable company in the world at the time of writing, with a market cap of over $3.2 trillion.",

Maybe I\u2019d throw a party?\n\nWith a filling of apples and mixed berries, Costco\u2019s new apple berry pie is essentially the iconic apple pie dressed up for spring. It also features a delicious and beautiful lattice crust, which I\u2019m a total sucker for. For just $15.99, it was coming with me.\n\nMeghan Overdeep\n\nCostco rarely misses on a pie crust, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had nailed it once again. The crust is sweet and soft and somehow both crumbly and doughy. As far as the flavor of the filling goes, it reminds me a lot of strawberry rhubarb, another springtime staple. Raspberries and strawberries lend tartness to the apple and give it a vibrant red hue. There aren't too many seeds in it either, which can sometimes be the case with berry pies. Overall, it\u2019s sweet, but not too sweet.\n\nCostco fans are singing the new pie\u2019s praises over on Reddit. One user gave it an eight out of 10, writing: \u201cDefinitely worth trying, especially if you warm it up and pair it with the Kirkland vanilla ice cream. Can\u2019t go wrong for pie lovers\u201d\n\nMy husband, who isn\u2019t the biggest fan of fruit pies, liked the crust so much that he has been pulling it off to snack on when I\u2019m not looking. I really enjoyed it, but I\u2019ve never met a fruit pie that didn\u2019t have me seeing stars. Given its size, however, I\u2019m unlikely to purchase it again without having somewhere to bring it. Or heck, maybe I will throw that party.\n\nCostco\u2019s new apple berry pie has been available in stores for the past couple of weeks.

To boost its already formidable productivity chops, Apple also treated the iPad Air to a new, more affordably priced Magic Keyboard with a dedicated function row.\n\nExcept for the new Apple chip, there\u2019s absolutely no difference between the M3-equipped iPad Air and the previous iteration. Its Retina display, camera hardware, connectivity features, and physical measures are the same, as are the $599 starting price, memory capacity options, and available colors, so I couldn't tell the two apart. Plus, older iPad Air releases, going back to the fourth generation from 2020, are compatible with the new Magic Keyboard that arrived alongside the 2025 model.\n\nApple iPad Air 11-inch with M3 Chip Now 8% Off $599 $549 at Amazon $599 $557 at Walmart$600 at Target Key Specs Chip Apple M3 with 8-core CPU, 9-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine Display 11-inch Liquid Retina Camera 12MP rear camera, 12MP Landscape front-facing camera with Center Stage Memory Up to 1TB storage, 8GB of RAM Connectivity Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C, optional 5G Other Landscape stereo speakers\n\nApple iPad Air 13-inch with M3 chip Now 6% Off $799 $749 at Amazon$747 at Walmart$800 at Target Key Specs Chip Apple M3 with 8-core CPU, 9-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine Display 13-inch Liquid Retina Camera 12MP rear camera, 12MP Landscape front-facing camera with Center Stage Memory Up to 1TB storage, 8GB of RAM Connectivity Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C, optional 5G Audio Landscape stereo speakers\n\nI\u2019ve been testing the latest iPad with an 11-inch screen for a week and can confirm that if you have last year\u2019s version with M2 silicon, there\u2019s no reason to upgrade. However, owners of older-generation iPad Air and lower-end models, and everyone else on the market for a new tablet with a three-digit upgrade budget, should have the newcomer at the top of their list of options. Here\u2019s why:\n\nThe M3 Chip\n\nAs the only difference between the previous iPad Air generation and the sequel, the Apple M3 chip is the main reason to consider upgrading. The silicon brings welcome bumps in graphics and processing power, especially over the M1 chip powering the 2022 iPad Air that\u2019s two generations behind. The M3 chip is also an integral component for AI-powered experiences\u2014and it's vastly more proficient, too.\n\nExcellent Everyday Performance\n\nStefan Vazharov\n\nSwitching to the new iPad Air from the outgoing version, I didn\u2019t notice a palpable change in everyday speed and multitasking capabilities. Opening, interacting with, and switching between a double-digit amount of open apps was predictably quick and seamless. Apple Intelligence interactions like summarizing large swaths of text, streamlining my meeting notes, and creating Genmoji and fun visuals via Image Playground, to name a few, were just as smooth when I experienced them.\n\nNext-Level Gameplay\n\nStefan Vazharov\n\nGaming is where the new iPad Air has an edge over its predecessors, thanks to support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing. Previously available only on the range-topping iPad Pro with the M4 chip, the functionality brought more immersive visuals when I ran Resident Evil 4 during my testing.\n\nHaving the opportunity to run AAA gaming titles with immersive visuals on the iPad Air is one of my favorite things about the product and why I'd choose it over any similarly priced non-Apple competitor. Avid gamers who own an iPad Air with M2 silicon should take note of this feature in the M3 version.\n\nThe battery life of the new iPad Air has remained unchanged from its predecessor\u2019s. I could get through a moderately busy workday using the slate as my primary computing device, so long as I didn\u2019t max out its screen brightness in the process. Charging the device was fast and easy via its USB-C connector and bundled charging adapter.\n\nThe New Magic Keyboard\n\nStefan Vazharov\n\nImpressively, the of the iPad Air is both cheaper and more convenient than before. Its row of shortcut keys made a major difference during my testing, saving me time in effort swiping to access the control center or adjusting volume via the the dedicated buttons aboard the slate. The larger trackpad, on the other hand, made multitasking gestures and all other interactions more seamless.\n\nStrangely, this updated Magic Keyboard lacks backlighting, unlike its predecessor. I wish the functionality carried over from the latter, but the new accessory\u2019s function buttons row and lower price sufficiently compensate for its omission.\n\nStefan Vazharov\n\nLike the product it replaces, the new iPad Air supports the and its advanced gesture controls. The 2022 M1 version lacks such functionality, so anyone who uses the device to work on graphic design and digital art projects should consider making the switch.\n\nWrap Up\n\nThe M3 chip made the iPad Air even more futureproof, and I\u2019d recommend it over any rival in its price range. Unless you are willing to spend $1,000 (and up) on a Pro model. Similarly priced Android rivals might offer fancier screens with a higher refresh rate, but their performance is no match for the Apple offering.\n\nReceiving the Apple M3 chip makes the iPad Air, especially with a 13-inch display and in tandem with a Magic Keyboard and an Apple Pencil Pro, a formidable touchscreen alternative to the just-replaced MacBook Air with the same silicon. Its higher-level versatility is worth it, even if its battery life isn\u2019t quite a match for its laptop relative.\n\nThe 11-inch iteration I put through its paces makes a solid laptop replacement if you prioritize portability. However, those who switch from a bigger-screen laptop might find the smaller Magic Keyboard to be a little cramped.\n\nSpending $599 will get you an 11-inch iPad Air with 128 GB of storage in blue, purple, starlight, or space gray. The 13-inch iteration costs $200 extra, and you can spec both with up to 1 TB of memory. Adding 5G connectivity is $150 more for every memory option. The must-have new Magic Keyboard and the Apple Pencil Pro cost $269 and $129, respectively.",

            "content": "\n\nThe 16e is the first iPhone to feature the Apple-designed C1 modem.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nAT&T and Verizon Speedtest\u00ae users experienced better median download speeds on the iPhone 16e than iPhone 16. However, the opposite was true for T-Mobile users.\n\nVerizon Speedtest users with the iPhone 16e and the iPhone 16 experienced median download speeds that lagged behind that of both AT&T and T-Mobile.\n\n\n\niPhone 16e Speedtest users on Verizon\u2019s network and AT&T\u2019s network saw higher upload speed performance than those using the iPhone 16. However, T-Mobile users experienced the opposite and had slightly higher upload speeds on the iPhone 16 compared to the iPhone 16e.\n\nApple\u2019s new iPhone 16e made its commercial debut in late February with much fanfare because it\u2019s the first device to include the Apple-designed C1 modem. Historically, Apple relied upon Qualcomm to provide most of its iPhone modems so its decision to use the C1 modem in the iPhone 16e is considered a significant move.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s early in the adoption curve for the iPhone 16e, we analyzed the performance of the new device from March 1st through March 12th, and compared it to the performance of iPhone 16, which has a similar design and the same 6.1\u201d screen. Both devices run on the same Apple-designed A18 SoC. However, it\u2019s important to note that unlike the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16e does not support mmWave spectrum. This is the first iPhone available in the U.S. without mmWave support but we expect future iterations of the C1 modem will include it.\n\niPhone 16 offers higher top-end performance than the iPhone 16e\n\niPhone 16e Offers Better Worst-Case Speeds, but iPhone 16 Has a Higher Top-End Performance\n\nSpeedtest Intelligence\u00ae | 1-12 March, 2025\n\n\n\nWhen we compare Speedtest Intelligence\u00ae data from the top 90th percentile (those with the highest performance experience) of iPhone 16e and iPhone 16 users from all three of the top U.S. operators, we see the iPhone 16 performing better in download speeds. However, at the opposite end, with the 10th percentile of users (those who experience the lowest performance) we see the iPhone 16e performing better than the iPhone 16.\n\niPhone 16e outperforms on download speeds for AT&T and Verizon, but not T-Mobile\n\nSpeedtest data shows the iPhone16e recorded faster median download speeds than the iPhone 16 on both AT&T and Verizon\u2019s networks, but was markedly slower on T-Mobile\u2019s network.\n\niPhone 16e users on T-Mobile\u2019s network experienced median download speeds of 264.71 Mbps, which is at least 47% faster than iPhone 16e users on Verizon\u2019s network that experienced median download speeds of 140.77 Mbps. The download speed performance for iPhone 16e users on AT&T\u2019s network was 226.90 Mbps, closer to that of T-Mobile users.\n\nHowever, when comparing median download speeds for T-Mobile users with the iPhone 16e (264.71 Mbps) to T-Mobile users with the iPhone 16 device (357.47 Mbps), the iPhone 16 outperformed the iPhone 16e by at least 24%.\n\nThe iPhone 16e\u2019s underperformance in median download speed compared to the iPhone 16 on T-Mobile\u2019s network is most likely due to the fact that T-Mobile is the only US carrier to have a nationwide commercialized 5G standalone network (SA) and one of the few operators globally to deploy significant spectrum depth and advanced features like carrier aggregation (CA) on the new 5G architecture.\n\nThe C1 modem\u2019s more limited capabilities on 5G SA networks compared to the Qualcomm modem in the iPhone 16 may be a key factor contributing to the larger performance gap between device models observed on T-Mobile\u2019s network in early testing.\n\nVerizon\u2019s download performance lags on both devices\n\nWhile much has been made of the lack of mmWave support on the iPhone 16e, which will have some impact on performance, particularly for users that are in range of these higher bands, both Verizon Speedtest users with the iPhone 16e and the iPhone 16 experienced median download speeds that lagged behind that of both AT&T and T-Mobile.\n\niPhone 16e Outperforms iPhone 16 on AT&T & Verizon Despite Lacking mmWave, but Trails on T-Mobile's 5G SA\n\nSpeedtest Intelligence\u00ae | 1-12 March, 2025\n\n\n\niPhone 16e beats the 16 among those in the 10th percentile\n\nWhen we examine Speedtest Intelligence\u00ae data for the bottom 10th percentile (those with the lowest overall download speeds) of iPhone 16e vs. iPhone 16 users, we see that iPhone 16e users experienced better download speeds compared to iPhone 16 users across all three mobile providers.\n\nFor example, T-Mobile iPhone 16e users in the bottom 10th percentile are experiencing speeds of 57.34 Mbps compared to T-Mobile iPhone 16 users that are experiencing speeds of just 27.27 Mbps.\n\nThe Worst Outcomes on iPhone 16e Are Significantly Better Than on iPhone 16\n\nSpeedtest Intelligence\u00ae | 1-12 March, 2025\n\n\n\nAt the other end of the scale at the 90th percentile (those with the fastest overall download speeds), we saw the reverse with the iPhone 16 outpacing the iPhone 16e for each mobile provider. For example, T-Mobile iPhone 16 users in the 90th percentile experienced blazing fast median download speeds of 889.83 Mbps compared to T-Mobile iPhone 16e users that are experiencing median download speeds of 627.01 Mbps.\n\niPhone 16 Outperforms iPhone 16e in Peak Performance Scenarios\n\nSpeedtest Intelligence\u00ae | 1-12 March, 2025\n\n\n\nPerformance at the lowest 10th percentile often provides a more accurate reflection of overall quality of experience (QoE) than the fastest 90th percentile, which can be skewed by deployments in mmWave-covered locations and is subject to declining marginal returns.\n\niPhone 16e is higher in upload speeds\n\nInterestingly, in upload speeds, we saw iPhone 16e users on Verizon and AT&T experiencing higher upload speed performance than those using the iPhone 16. T-Mobile users, however, experienced just slightly higher upload speeds on the iPhone 16e compared to the iPhone 16. The gap was the biggest with AT&T iPhone 16e customers, who experienced median upload speeds of 14.63 Mbps, which is at least a 38% increase over AT&T iPhone 16 users who experienced median upload speeds of 8.60 Mbps.\n\niPhone 16e Leads iPhone 16 on Upload Speed across AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon\n\nSpeedtest Intelligence\u00ae | 1-12 March, 2025\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s departure from Qualcomm\n\nApple has historically sourced its iPhone modems from Qualcomm but in 2019 the company purchased Intel\u2019s modem business with the goal of designing its own in-house modems.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 16e with the C1 modem supports all the low and mid-band 5G spectrum but, as mentioned above, it doesn\u2019t support mmWave spectrum. It also supports Wi-Fi 6 with 2\u00d72 MIMO and Bluetooth 5.3, but lacks Wi-Fi 7 support unlike the rest of the iPhone 16 series of devices.\n\nApple claims that the C1 is more power-efficient than any modem ever used in an iPhone and said that the 16e has a new internal design, which allows it to give the device a bigger battery. In its 16e specifications Apple claims that the 16e has a battery life of up to 26 hours with video playback and up to 21 hours with streaming video playback. This compares to the Apple 16 which Apple claims has a battery life of up to 22 hours with video playback and up to 18 hours with streaming video playback.\n\nSome of the performance differences that Speedtest data picked up between the iPhone 16e and the iPhone 16 may also be attributed to the fact that the C1 modem doesn\u2019t have all the same capabilities that are featured in Qualcomm\u2019s modems.\n\nAccording to a Qualcomm comparison of the C1 and its mid-tier and premium modems, Qualcomm\u2019s mid-tier modems support 4CA downlink carrier aggregation and its top of the line x80 and x85 modems support 6CA downlink carrier aggregation compared to the C1 which supports just 3x downlink carrier aggregation. Qualcomm\u2019s mid-tier, x80 and x85 modems also support uplink carrier aggregation and uplink MIMO and the Apple C1 does not.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the performance of the iPhone 16e as adoption of the device increases around the world and we plan to publish a more comprehensive comparison across the entire iPhone 16 portfolio of devices. While we have not analyzed the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s performance here because it is in the premium device category, we do see it leading over the iPhone 16e in most performance metrics.\n\nOokla analysts Mark Giles, Luke Kehoe and Kerry Baker contributed to this piece.\n\nTo find out more about Speedtest Intelligence\u00ae data and insights, please contact us here.",

It also follows Apple's December 2024 white paper on how the then proposed remedies invite abuse by rival firms.\n\n\"[These measures concern] nine iOS connectivity features, predominantly used for connected devices such as smartwatches, headphones or TVs,\" says the EC in its full announcement. \"The measures will grant device manufacturers and app developers improved access to iPhone features that interact with such devices (e.g. displaying notifications on smartwatches), faster data transfers (e.g. peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connections, and near-field communication) and easier device set-up (e.g. pairing).\"\n\n\"As a result, connected devices of all brands will work better on iPhones,\" continues the EC. \"Device manufacturers will have new opportunities to bring innovative products to the market, improving the user experience for consumers based in Europe. \"\n\nAs it has done all along, Apple insists that it already complies with the DMA. It also notes that it is the sole company being required to give away its intellectual property for free.\n\nFor example, Spotify is the dominant music streaming service in the EU, and it's not close. There are no requirements for Spotify to give anything away, nor are Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft being forced to further open their consoles to rivals.\n\nConsequently, Apple says that the EC's new interpretation of the DMA requires Apple to develop technology not just for itself, but for rivals. And, share it with all that ask for it. The law specifically covers what are described as connected devices. It's clear about headphones, but the law also covers smartwatches.\n\nAll headphone manufacturers, for instance, must be given the same access to all iPhone technology as AirPods do.\n\nThe EC wants to prevent situations such as the one where the forthcoming Pebble smartwatch will have limited access to Apple technology such as health and fitness features.\n\nIn its December 2024 white paper, Apple noted that Facebook owner Meta had already made 15 requests (and counting) for potentially far-reaching access to Apple's technology stack. If granted as sought, would reduce the protections around personal data that our users have come to expect from their devices.\n\nApple now says that it already has 500 engineers working on fulfilling EC requirements.\n\nWhat users will have to deal with, isn't quite clear\n\nApple argues that it has already created a quarter of a million APIs for developers to access its technologies, and that it has done so while preserving users' privacy. Under the new laws, rival firms can request that Apple open up specific access for them, and Apple says this is already raising security issues.\n\nFor example, staying with the wireless headphones example above. Apple delivers notifications to the AirPods encrypted, which is then decrypted and provided to the user.\n\nIn the case of the DMA requirements, should a third-party vendor want to be able to pass notifications unencrypted, it would then request that ability from Apple. A three-way conversation would begin, between Apple, the EC, and the developer in question. Apple says that this will be an incredibly long process, with an end result of a lack of transparency for the risks to the user.\n\nIn this example, the user would get that pairing notification, but not be made fully cognizant of the risks. What they would not get is clarity on the fact that the notifications aren't encrypted at all.\n\nApple has also said that critical security updates would still be provided rapidly, with the company delivering before it consults with the EU. In other matters, though, like with Bluetooth errata, it would have to consult with the EC first before implementation to assess interoperability concerns.\n\nThe DMA isn't working to help innovation, but hurts it instead\n\nApple says that these additional laws damage Europe's own goals of encouraging innovation through competition.\n\n\"Today's decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple's ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don't have to play by the same rules,\" said Apple in a statement to AppleInsider. \"It's bad for our products and for our European users.\"\n\n\"We will continue to work with the European Commission to help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users,\" continues Apple.\n\nAccording to Apple, the new laws mean changing its software development process and necessarily delaying updates until they can also work for rivals. And, it will dramatically increase engineering requirements, and therefore expenses.\n\nApple can ask the EC for permission to delay supporting rivals. It's not clear how that process would work, or who at the Commission would make such decisions.\n\nHaving to ask this permission also means that the EC is effectively controlling and micromanaging Apple's software development process for the iPhone.\n\nAll of which means that Apple is likely to continue blocking or delaying the introduction of new features for iPhone users in the EU. It previously delayed the launch of Apple Intelligence in the region.\n\nAt the time, EU's competition head Margrethe Vestager called it a \"stunning, open declaration that they know 100% that this is another way of disabling competition.\"\n\nApple doesn't see it that way, of course. As far as Apple is concerned, not releasing the entire set of Apple Intelligence in the EU is a way to guarantee compliance with the DMA. And, under the new requirements, it's a way to prevent handing over Apple intellectual property to rival AI firms.\n\nAnd the same applies to iPhone Mirroring. Except, there's no sign that the feature in question is coming to the EU simply because Apple sees it as a security risk and it doesn't want third parties to have access to the feature's core engineering.\n\nThe EC's new laws were initiated by Vestager during her ten-year tenure as competition commissioner. She has since been replaced, but the Commission appears to be continuing her plan.",

She is a member of the Cleftomaniacs, an a cappella group, an ESL tutor, and hopes to encourage peace-minded advocacy on campus. Contact her at ehjaber@wm.edu.\n\nWelcome to our Eva\u2019s Apple of the week. I\u2019m going to get a bit existential for a second here, so stay with me. In a philosophy class I\u2019m taking this semester, I recently learned about virtue ethics. The TL;DR is that we should perceive wrongness and rightness based on what course of action a virtuous figure would take if they were in the same situation.\n\nNow, I understand that my column is a escapist medium for many of my readers, and I realize you may be upset by the fact that I am tainting your favorite part of your bimonthly reading routine with talk about classes. Grow up. I am giving you context for the punchline.\n\nOkie, back to virtue ethics. You, dear reader, are lucky because you have a whole swath of virtuous candidates for whom you can ask \u201cwhat would ____ do?\u201d I bet you can think of just about a bajillion people who are better than you are. Now, and let\u2019s practice our empathy for a moment, imagine a world in which you are me, the virtuous figure that others look to for guidance. Imagine you run a very prestigious satire advice column with a loyal base of fans who only act ethically on two Wednesdays a month when they have you basically spelling out for them everything they have to do to be more like you. This is my reality, my unfortunate reality. I am a pillar of virtue in a sea of misdeeds. I am to our campus, nay, our world, what \u201cLove is Blind Habibi\u201d is to Netflix.\n\nSo, you can imagine how uncomfortable I was in my philosophy class when we were asked to discuss virtue ethics. I didn\u2019t know how to speak up. I felt unseen and alone, because no one else knows what it\u2019s like to be their own moral standard, to have no one better than oneself to look up to. Here I am, dismounting from my well-deserved high horse, to exemplify imperfection and vulnerability. Together, we stand on our common ground: everyone, at some time or another, has had difficulties with participating in class.\n\nThus, I present you with our question of the week:\n\nHow do I feel more confident with speaking up in class discussions?\n\nThis question boils down to one important theme: confidence. I have it. You lack it. Let\u2019s get to work.\n\nIn class, confidence levels exhibited by the student body exist on a continuum. The spectrum ranges from no confidence to way too much, and we all fall somewhere in between. On the 1-10 scale of confidence, I seek to maintain an ideal seven and a half. We seven and a halves exude just enough confidence to seem self-assured while having enough of a growth mindset to recognize the value in learning from others, listening to new perspectives and admitting when we are wrong. In the spirit of being on theme, I have seven and a half pieces of advice for you to achieve the ideal level of confidence and become a perfect participant in class.\n\n1) People like to say that comparison is the thief of joy. It\u2019s not. Jealousy is a compass, and you can harness it to achieve maximum coolness. If you are jealous of someone, that means they have something you want. Getting clarity about your ambitions will allow you to imitate those you envy until you are more fulfilled and, thus, more confident. In order to continue setting goals, you must have an infinite supply of jealousy to guide you. The solution: ceaseless comparison. Boom. Next suggestion.\n\n2) Dress for the part! Find the swaggiest person you can think of, pretend every class is Halloween, and make every costume them. It\u2019s a little weird that you\u2019re cosplaying me, but I don\u2019t hate it.\n\n3) Surround yourself with worthy and interesting friends to help encourage you to be your best self in class. Not sure how to determine who matches this description? Here\u2019s an easy test: ask them if they read \u201cEva\u2019s Apple.\u201d If the answer is no, cut them out. Drop them. Not worth it.\n\n4) Raise your hand in class and wave it around to get the professor\u2019s attention. If that doesn\u2019t work, shout \u201cme, me, me, pick me!\u201d People love that.\n\n5) Make up your own secret language and compile it into a comprehensive dictionary. Take it to your professor during office hours and cry until they agree to learn it. In class, only participate in discussions using your secret language. Then, no one else will be able to interpret what you\u2019re saying and you\u2019ll feel very smart.\n\n6) Yell everything. You\u2019ll sound passionate.\n\n7) Whisper everything. You\u2019ll sound mysterious.\n\n7.5) I\u2019m not really sure how to give half a piece of advice, but I\u2019ll give it my best shot (observe this charming example of an appropriate confidence deficit). This is my most valuable advice in the entire article, and I\u2019ve halved it by removing every consonant: \u201ceiee i oue. ou eeie i ai, a ou oe ae aue! e oe ou o o ae ou oie ea, e oe ooae ou i e aiiai i ouie, ouu ioue!\u201d Hope this helps!\n\nAlrighty. If you find yourself asking \u201cWhat would Eva do?\u201d at any point this week, send that situation to The Flat Hat so we can practice some virtue ethics with certainty. And ask it with confidence, please, now that I\u2019ve told you exactly how to do so.",

Apple provides updates to accessories like this in the background with no release notes or any way to push the update manually.\n\nTuesday's firmware update brings the version to 2A146, up from the previous 2A143.

            "content": "Apple Maps is great for navigation, but I especially love using the app to browse new areas, find a great coffee shop, and plan outings and adventures. For those use cases, iOS 18 brought a key change to search in Apple Maps that somehow has been missing for years: you can now search the specific area you\u2019re viewing on the map. And that\u2019s been a huge answered wish for me.\n\nMy longstanding Apple Maps problem\n\nHere\u2019s a key thread from Apple\u2019s support community back in 2020:\n\nI know I am going to be in a certain location at some time in the future. I enter that address in Maps and it is located. I now want to search for, say, used bookstores near that location. How do I do it?\n\nScenarios like this were very common for me too, pre-iOS 18.\n\nI would open Apple Maps and start browsing an area on the map.\n\nThis would happen when planning a vacation, trying to find a new place for coffee, or scoping out shops and restaurants in a different neighborhood.\n\nBefore iOS 18, I\u2019d be viewing a given area in Apple Maps, then type a search query and hit the \u2018Search Nearby\u2019 suggestion that appeared.\n\nWas it my fault for thinking \u2018Nearby\u2019 meant \u2018near the area I\u2018m currently looking at\u2019?\n\nApparently it was. Because Maps would then search for results near where I was presently located. In the process, it zoomed all the way back to my current location and showed suggestions far from where I\u2019d intended.\n\nAs that original support thread put it:\n\nThis is SUCH a basic feature, I have got to believe it exists in Maps and I am just an idiot for not figuring out how to do it\n\nWhat\u2019s the real solution? It didn\u2019t exist before, but it\u2019s here now in iOS 18.\n\nNew search option added to Maps in iOS 18\n\nAmong a variety of other improvements in iOS 18, Apple Maps gained a fix for this problem.\n\nNow, when you\u2019re browsing an area in Apple Maps and type a search, you\u2019ll see a new option: \u2018Near area on your map.\u2019\n\nSo for example, if I\u2019m browsing a neighborhood and type \u2018Starbucks,\u2019 I\u2019ll see a variety of nearby Starbucks locations, but also two suggested searches:\n\nStarbucks: Search Nearby\n\nStarbucks: Near area on your map\n\nThe former works like it always has, but the latter does what I\u2019ve always hoped for.\n\nYou can tap \u2018Near area on your map\u2019 to get results based on the map you\u2019re currently viewing.\n\nSimilarly, if you have already have a search entered, then pan around to a different area of the map, you can now hit a \u2018Search here\u2019 button that appears.\n\nThese new options make browsing for places anywhere in the world just as easy as browsing places that are near you.\n\nAnd though it took a while to add the feature, Apple Maps is so much better for its arrival.\n\nDo you ever use Apple Maps\u2019 new iOS 18 search feature? Why or why not? Let us know in the comments.\n\nBest iPhone accessories",

            "content": "ZDNET's key takeaways Apple's MacBook Air M4 is available now, starting at $999 for the 13-inch, and $1,199 for the 15-inch.\n\nThe M4 Air supports up to two external monitors with the lid open, and scales up to 32GB of unified memory.\n\nThere are still only two USB-C ports on the left side, and I wish there were a nano-texture display option. View now at Apple View now at Bhphotovideo View now at Best Buy more buying choices\n\nBefore Apple announced the MacBook Air M4 in early 2025, rumors abounded on what new features the ultraportable would come with.\n\nPartly because it was the last of Apple's core line of devices to get the M4 chip, and partly because, well, last year's MacBook Air M3 was (and still is) one of the best laptops we've tested -- a future-proofed \"AI computer for the masses\" that could be seen as a successful culmination of Apple's design.\n\nAlso: Why the new $349 iPad is sneakily Apple's best hardware deal right now\n\nAt no point can the Apple machine stop producing, however, so with the MacBook Air M4, it was apparent it would be an incremental upgrade, refining what made last year's version great while offering a little bit more for less cost to the consumer.\n\nThe MacBook Air M4, for example, starts at $999 for the 13-inch configuration with 16GB of memory -- $100 less than last year's M3. At the same time, the hardware expands on both the low and high end, with the lowest-tier configuration of the M4 equipped with a 10-core CPU and 8-core GPU, in contrast to the 8-core M3 chip from last year.\n\nAlso: I finally replaced my M1 MacBook Pro with a base model M4 - and the upgrades were worth it\n\nOn the other hand, the high-end configuration offers 32GB of unified memory, which was previously capped out at 24GB on last year's M3. This combination of improvements for base components and a lower starting cost is strategic positioning on Apple's part to incentivize the new devices and stay competitive in an increasingly crowded market.\n\nKyle Kucharski/ZDNET\n\nThe MacBook Air M4 is a fantastic device, but it's also a natural continuation of the product line, which some might see as a \"boring\" update. Depending on who you ask, that could be a good or a not-so-good thing. You can't fix what isn't broken, but I think there is some room here for a few more bold design choices.\n\nOne of the most obvious is the MacBook Air M4's new colorway, Sky Blue, which is a very subtle blue; a very cautious decision when I was expecting something a little closer to Microsoft's Surface Laptop. All that being said, there are certainly some features on the M4 MacBook Air that set this year's ultraportable apart. Let's break them down.\n\nTriple-screen threat\n\nOne of the most anticipated and sought-after features of the MacBook Air M4 is its ability to support two external monitors while the lid is open. This alone opens up new possibilities for work, productivity, and creative tasks and makes the MacBook Air more competitive with three working displays.\n\nAlso: The best Apple deals ahead of Amazon's Spring Sale: iPhones, Apple Watches, iPads, and more\n\nThe laptop's own display still looks great, as well. Apple's Liquid Retina technology provides crisp, well-defined text, smooth, vibrant video, and support for 1 billion colors. Maxing out at 500 nits of brightness, the display on the Air M4 doesn't get as bright as the MacBook Pro, but it's still bright enough for the majority of use cases.\n\nI am a little surprised there isn't an option to upgrade the M4 Air with the nano-textured glass we saw on the M4 MacBook Pro, however. Maybe we're a bit spoiled now, but the glare is noticeable enough for me to wonder why, of all the possible things you can upgrade this laptop with, that isn't one of them.\n\nThe other thing about the display I don't love is the notch for the camera, which results in a chunk of otherwise valuable screen real estate blacked out where the lens is located. If you keep the toolbar toggled on, it's something you can get used to, but with apps in full-screen it's definitely noticeable.\n\nProductivity powerhouse\n\nWhile on the topic of productivity, the MacBook Air M4 excels at more than just multiple displays. For one thing, videoconferencing on the Air is a joy. The webcam's hardware got an upgrade, from the 1080p FaceTime camera from last year to a 12MP camera on the M4 Air with Apple's new Center Stage feature.\n\nAlso: I installed Linux on an 8-inch mini laptop - and it's my new favorite way of computing\n\nWe first saw Center Stage on the MacBook Pro and iMac last fall, and its addition to the Air is one of the many features that bring the ultraportable a little closer to its older Pro sibling. If you're unfamiliar with it, Center Stage keeps you focused and centered in the frame no matter how you're positioned, handling the visual logistics of the call with minimal input from the user.\n\nKyle Kucharski/ZDNET\n\nTo me, it seems less like a standalone feature in its own right and more like the inevitable future of webcam technology. This is how webcams should work, and Apple's innovation here presents a polished experience that is equally enjoyable for work or personal calls on FaceTime.\n\nThe combination of top-tier hardware, a seamless and well-integrated product, and quality-of-life features just makes the video call experience overall better on a Mac.\n\nAlso: I spent $4K on my Mac Studio 3 years ago - should I upgrade to the 2025 model?\n\nI use a Windows device as my daily driver, and although I've used Macs for years in the past, I forgot how effortlessly the MacBook Air can handle multitasking through a combination of the Launchpad, split screen, and talking directly to Siri. Additionally, improvements to how windows are tiled are satisfying for those of us who like our desktops arranged in a particular way.\n\nReliable, all-day battery\n\nThe MacBook Air is still a battery-efficient device, and although Apple's Silicon line of processors set the standard for battery performance in ultraportable laptops, the rest of the market has had some time to catch up.\n\nThat doesn't mean the MacBook Air has fallen behind, but it does have some competitors now. During my testing of the M4, I got over 14 hours of battery life with the device running a 4K video at half brightness, which is about where I expected it to be and about the same as last year's MacBook Air M3.\n\nBy contrast, Microsoft's Surface Laptop got over 15 hours during the same test, and Asus' Zenbook A14 came in closer to 20. The latter, of course, doesn't match the power on board the MacBook Air M4, but it is lighter, thinner, and packs a gorgeous display. That alone puts it in competition territory.\n\nKyle Kucharski/ZDNET\n\nYes, the MacBook Pro M4 will last longer as well, but the Air is thinner and lighter and much less variable: the difference in battery drain is minimal depending on what tasks you're putting it through (barring persistent, intense workloads).\n\nAlso: I've tried nearly every browser out there and these are my top 6 (none are Chrome)\n\nThe bottom line is that for users who commute into the office a few times a week, you can reliably count on the MacBook Air M4 to last the whole day if you forget your charger, even if you're taking a few video calls.\n\nBenchmarking\n\nPutting all that hardware to the test, the MacBook Air M4 performed very well in our benchmarking, coming in very close to both the MacBook Pro M4 and MacBook Pro M3. As these devices leave their predecessors from just a few years ago in the dust, they get a little bit closer to each other.\n\n\n\nCinebench 24 MC Geekbench 6.2.2 SC Geekbench 6.2.2 MC Apple MacBook Air M4 888 3,587 14,972 Apple MacBook Pro M4 1,000 3,823 14,849 Apple MacBook Pro M3 906 3,072 11,623 Apple MacBook Pro with M1 Pro 828 2,211 12,482\n\nSo what about the things I wish Apple did differently? Well, many of my gripes about the MacBook Air M4 are nothing new. For one, there are still only two USB-C ports, both of which are on the left-hand side of the device. If this felt limiting for you before, not much has changed.\n\nAlso: M3 MacBook Air review: Apple's AI computer for the masses has arrived\n\nSecond, Apple's devices remain some of the most locked-down when it comes to repairability, keeping consumers strictly bound to Apple's repair and service model by barring the use of salvaged components. The company has made strides toward a greener business model when it comes to production, but a loosening of the strict control over parts replacement would go even further.\n\nZDNET's buying advice\n\nThe MacBook Air M4 is still one of the most complete packages you can ask for when it comes to creativity, productivity, and everyday use. The M4 Air's sleek and lightweight form factor set the standard for ultraportables, and not much has changed with its design since, for better or for worse.\n\nIf you have an iPhone and enjoy Apple's ecosystem of products, the MacBook Air is a solid choice as a main driver. If you already have a Mac that's more than a few years old, the MacBook Air M4 will feel like a significant upgrade. If you have an M2 Pro or M3, the leap will feel less noticeable. If you're coming from an older Windows device, well, you'll wonder how you ever took calls on your 720p webcam at all.\n\nConsidering all of this, the MacBook Air M4 is a modest upgrade from its predecessor but pushes the line forward overall. In fact, with burgeoning Apple Intelligence features, the same camera technology as the MacBook Pro M4, upgraded hardware, and a lower starting price, the MacBook Air seems like the most logical choice for a new Apple laptop in 2025.",

No additional hardware is needed, so merchants can accept payments from wherever they do business.\u201d\n\nAccording to the release, the solution is available on a range of different payment platforms throughout Europe, including Adyen, myPOS, Revolut, Viva, Stripe, SumUp, Worldline, Nexi and PlanetPay. Tap to Pay on iPhone works with contactless credit and debit cards from American Express, Discover, Mastercard and Visa.\n\nThe announcement comes weeks after Visa revealed that Tap to Phone adoption has surged by 200% year over year around the world. In the U.S., U.K. and Brazil, rates have jumped to a combined 234% growth rate.\n\n\u201cTap to Phone is a tech equalizer for businesses.

At its core, the thin, lightweight device proves perfect for living room reading, watching and browsing. Add the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil, and you can get some serious work done. It\u2019s fast, powerful and remarkably capable.\n\nI never previously owned my own personal iPad. I\u2019ve used Windows PCs and Macs since 2002, switching to the Mac full-time in 2012. Between my Mac mini and Vision Pro, I haven\u2019t felt the need for an iPad in my life.\n\nNonetheless, for this M3 iPad Air review, I went all-in, using the tablet with a Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil for as much of my work as I could to see if I was missing out. Here\u2019s what I discovered.\n\nThis post contains affiliate links.

Pair with the Magic Keyboard for a laptop-style keyboard and trackpad. Works with Apple Pencil (USB-C) and Apple Pencil Pro. Pros: Powerful, desktop-class M3 chip\n\nPowerful, desktop-class M3 chip Lightweight, all-screen design\n\nLightweight, all-screen design Optional keyboard and Apple Pencil accessories Cons: Does not have Face ID Buy from Amazon Buy from Best Buy\n\nThe most casual user would be happy with the entry-level 11th-generation iPad. Someone who wants an incredible OLED display or commits to using their iPad for their everyday professional creative work would probably opt for the iPad Pro.\n\nThe iPad Air is for the hobbyist. The person who wants a casual living room tablet, but one that can double as a pseudo-laptop when they need it, and one they can take notes on or doodle with \u2014 without spending a fortune.\n\nTable of contents: M3 iPad Air review\n\nWhat I ordered\n\nI ordered the entry-level iPad Air, with both its accessories. For $947 ($1,018.04 after taxes, in Ohio) it comes with:\n\n11-inch LED display\n\n128GB storage\n\nM3 chip with an 8-core CPU, 9-core GPU and 16-core Neural Engine\n\n8GB RAM\n\n20W USB-C power adapter\n\nApple Pencil (USB-C)\n\nMagic Keyboard\n\nThat\u2019s within spitting distance of the cost of the new MacBook Air. The MacBook Air has more versatile and powerful software with macOS, but the iPad has transformable hardware. It\u2019s not just a laptop, it\u2019s a handheld tablet and a sketchbook.\n\nIf you plan on using any pro apps, like Final Cut Pro or Logic Pro for iPad, I recommend upgrading storage to 256GB for an extra $100.\n\nDesign\n\nThe iPad has been locked into a particular design in order to stay compatible with its two most popular accessories, the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard. It has to have flat sides to be able to magnetically attach the Apple Pencil Pro; it has to stay the same two sizes to fit in the Magic Keyboard.\n\nThankfully, it\u2019s a very pleasant design that doesn\u2019t cause many complaints. It\u2019s a thin and light tablet that\u2019s easy to hold in the hand. Put it in a big bulky case and it\u2019s still easy to hold, because the iPad is typically a two-handed device anyway.\n\nThe iPad Air still uses Touch ID built into the power button instead of Face ID. A reasonable excuse: Face ID components cost much more than Touch ID parts, and facial-recognition tech never appeared in a brand-new device costing only $599 \u2014 at least until Apple unveiled the iPhone 16e just a week prior.\n\nTouch ID is pretty convenient, since you can train yourself to turn it on with the power button, but it\u2019s not as seamless as Face ID. With the Magic Keyboard, it\u2019s a real pain point \u2014 the Touch ID button is far out of the way from your hands.\n\nI ordered the iPad in purple. (Ten points if you were able to tell before I mentioned that explicitly.) It\u2019s irritating that Apple seemingly thinks only the entry-level iPad is allowed to come in vibrant colors, while the mid-level iPad has to look like a poorly dyed Easter egg and the high-end iPad is only purchased by goths. The purple iPad looks like a silver iPad that Waluigi threw in with his laundry.\n\nMagic Keyboard\n\nAn iPad is more than a tablet \u2014 add the Magic Keyboard and it becomes a sort of laptop. The iPadOS software feels like a totally different world to macOS, but with the traditional keyboard and trackpad, it becomes uncannily familiar.\n\nThe new Magic Keyboard adds a row of function keys and a slightly larger trackpad. The prior Magic Keyboard positioned the iPad much farther forward, likely to keep the weight balanced; the new model pushes the iPad back to make room.\n\nAll the most recent iPads have floated around one pound. Relative to its size, it\u2019s perfect. But with the Magic Keyboard, the weight triples. It feels really dense. Although it\u2019s about the same weight as a 13-inch MacBook Air, it feels heavier \u2014 because when you carry it around, all that weight is in the back half. The center of gravity is right around the function row.\n\nThe trackpad feels a little cramped if you\u2019re used to the desktop Magic Trackpad, as I am. It\u2019s enough for mousing around the interface, but it feels small when you scroll up or down through a timeline or a big webpage.\n\nMagic Keyboard cases\n\nThe oddness of this accessory makes it hard to buy a proper iPad case. If you always keep it in the Magic Keyboard, it\u2019ll always be protected against very minor drops. If you never use the Magic Keyboard, you can encase your iPad in one of those bulky plastic monstrosities.\n\nBut the Magic Keyboard is supposed to be used spontaneously; you can freely take it off or put it back on. When you have the iPad alone, though, it won\u2019t have any sort of protection. I was surprised to find out that it is possible to get a case that covers most of the iPad, although it leaves one of the long edges exposed. It also has to be very thin to fit inside the Magic Keyboard when it\u2019s closed.\n\nBut something is better than nothing, and hopefully these products are updated to work with the latest models.\n\nApple Pencil with USB-C\n\nAll iPads that Apple currently sells are compatible with the Apple Pencil USB-C and the Apple Pencil Pro. You can pick either one. Apple still sells older Apple Pencils for people with older iPads, which is where things get messy.\n\nThe USB-C Apple Pencil skips pressure sensitivity, rotation, haptic feedback and the squeeze gestures. It also must be plugged in to charge \u2014 although it still attaches magnetically for convenience.\n\nThe sort of graphic design work I do for Cult of Mac doesn\u2019t require hand-drawing things with a tablet, so I was somewhat out of practice, but had fun creating a few odd sketches.\n\nThe slide-out cap on the end that reveals the USB-C port is so fun to fidget and play with. There\u2019s a slight magnetic snap when you open and close it, with a super satisfying pop sound. While it\u2019s an objective advantage that the Apple Pencil Pro charges by attaching to the iPad and thus doesn\u2019t need a USB-C port, the sliding cover is definitely something I would miss.\n\nYou can find some utility in the Apple Pencil without any intention of creating artwork. You can use it as a precision cursor for using web apps if you want to use the iPad handheld, without a mouse or trackpad. I picked it up whenever my hands felt clammy or sweaty to avoid smudging the screen.\n\nYou can also use its handwriting recognition anywhere you can input text. Although in practice, attempting this inside complex web apps like WordPress or Google Docs ranges from frustrating at best to the seventh circle of hell at worst. Poorly designed web apps that are built on hundreds of megabytes of complex JavaScript refuse to play nicely with pen input.\n\nM3 iPad Air review: Multitasking on iPadOS\n\nI was excited to enter the long-standing debate of iPad multitasking.\n\nYou can treat the iPad like a big iPhone, where you only have one app on screen at a time.\n\nSplit View puts two apps side-by-side. To enter Split View, you can drag an icon up from the Dock onto the left or right half of the screen, tap the \u22ef at the top of the screen, or combine two apps from the multitasking view.\n\nat the top of the screen, or combine two apps from the multitasking view. Stage Manager lets you freely arrange windows on the screen. It\u2019s not quite as open-ended as macOS \u2014 you can only have four on-screen at once, and you arrange them in groups that you can switch between. You can also use Stage Manager on an external display.\n\nSplit View vs. Stage Manager\n\nI decided pretty quickly that on the 11-inch iPad display, I prefer Split View to Stage Manager. Split View doesn\u2019t leave any empty space; the apps entirely fill the screen.\n\nHowever, Split View seems to aggressively kill apps in the background. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I switched back to the Safari tab in WordPress where I am writing this review, had to wait for it to reload, and cross my fingers that it didn\u2019t lose the last thing I wrote. A bunch of apps also refuse to play nice with Split View. Whenever I encounter one (like Amazon) I instantly uninstall the app and use it in Safari instead.\n\nStage Manager lets you juggle between more apps at once, but I don\u2019t think the 11-inch screen is big enough (nor is the user interface dense enough) for four overlapping windows to be useful. Surprisingly, though, you can get the best of both worlds: Split View on the iPad screen, with Stage Manager on an external display.\n\nEvery blogger with an iPad thinks they know how to fix iPad multitasking. Now that I\u2019ve owned an iPad for almost a week, I have an unsolicited solution, too. With iPadOS 19, Apple should modernize size classes and force apps to be freely resizable. Resizing windows between a few fixed sizes, with some apps not being resizable at all, feels very weird. With that in place, Split View should allow for more different layouts. You should be able to have three, four or five apps in different splits.\n\nM3 iPad Air productivity review\n\nAs a writer, podcaster, video producer and graphic designer, I juggle loads of apps every single week. I try to live in the most Apple-friendly workflow of Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro and MarsEdit for a majority of my work.\n\nThanks to Tailscale, which creates a virtual network between all your devices, I was able to easily access the contents of my Mac\u2019s hard drive right from the Files app. I can copy any the files I need onto my iPad, and save them directly to my Mac.\n\nWriting is also simple enough. While I can\u2019t use MarsEdit, I can write in WordPress through the web app.\n\nPixelmator Pro isn\u2019t available on the iPad, only Pixelmator. It offers most of the same features, but hasn\u2019t been redesigned in a while to take full advantage of the iPad\u2019s display.\n\nPodcast editing in Logic Pro\n\nDuring testing for this review, I couldn\u2019t record The CultCast using the M3 iPad Air, because on iPadOS only one app can use your microphone at once. However, I was able to edit an episode after recording using Logic Pro for iPad. I encountered a few setup pains getting my project template to open and importing the audio tracks, and the interface looks (understandably) very different. I wasn\u2019t as fast as on my Mac, but I figured it out by the end.\n\nA few features I typically use were either missing or too buried for me to figure out: the Normalize Audio function, track grouping, and renaming chapter markers. Because of chapter markers, I still had to finish the work on my Mac.\n\nBut it was fun editing with a pen on my couch instead of with a keyboard in my office.\n\nVideo editing in Final Cut Pro\n\nApple doesn\u2019t officially let you open a Final Cut Pro library on your iPad if it was created first on a Mac, only the other way around. I thought this was a dead end \u2014 until I discovered Transfer Toolbox, a small tool that lets you convert an existing Mac-formatted project to an iPad-ready project. It took several tries, but eventually I could open a full video timeline. When I tried replacing a few missing titles and poke around, it started crashing. Constantly. So this may have mixed results.\n\nFinal Cut Pro for iPad is better suited for creation using Final Cut Camera. I didn\u2019t have multiple human actors to film at 10:30 on a Saturday night, but I did have multiple computers. I set up a chess match between an iBook G3 and a Pentium-based DOS PC, filming each side with an iPhone using Final Cut Camera. Afterward, I could edit footage of the match on the iPad, swapping between each camera, adding effects and making a truly polished video.\n\n(The chess game ended in an anticlimactic tie.)\n\nMiscellaneous: M3 iPad Air review\n\nThe speed is incredible. It has an M3 chip, which is only weird or surprising to those who follow Apple closely and know that the M4 is the current generation. Nobody\u2019s work on iPadOS is impaired on an M3 instead of an M4.\n\nThe battery life was pretty average. I was spoiled reviewing this simultaneously with the M4 MacBook Air, which I can\u2019t possibly imagine running to zero in a single day. The MacBook Air has room for a battery that\u2019s almost twice as big, so that shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise. While the iPad Air has twice as much battery as my iPhone, I suppose I was expecting more.\n\nThe rear camera is fine. I think it\u2019s hilarious that Apple removed the ultrawide camera from the M4 iPad Pro and no one cared. You only really needs the front-facing camera. Which is also fine.\n\nThe speakers can fill a room surprisingly well, so long as it\u2019s an otherwise quiet room. I put the iPad a few feet away from me in the kitchen, and it sounded loud and clear until my stovetop fan overpowered it.\n\nConclusion: M3 iPad Air review\n\nThe M3 iPad is a remarkable device. It\u2019s a fantastic tablet. It\u2019s because it\u2019s so great and powerful as a casual tablet that we want to push it even further.\n\nAdding the Magic Keyboard is truly transformative. While I can\u2019t do all my work on an iPad, I think a lot of people would be surprised how well it could serve them. So much work is done on the web, where all you need is a keyboard and precise pointing device.\n\nFor a lot of people, not needing a proper computer is a relief and a weight off the shoulders \u2014 the iPad\u2019s relative simplicity is the whole point.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nPrice\n\nThe M3 iPad Air starts at $599 for the 11-inch model with 128GB of storage. Adding storage boosts the price (256GB for $699, 512GB for $899, 1TB for $1,099.) Bumping up to the 13-inch model adds $200 to the base price.\n\nBuy from: Amazon",

            "content": "Apple released is preparing to release iOS 18.4 in April, and that update will likely bring more emoji and a new Food section to Apple News. But when Apple released iOS 18.1 in October, it brought writing tools that can proofread, rewrite and alter written messages and comments to Apple Intelligence compatible iPhones.\n\nRead more: Everything You Need to Know About iOS 18.2.1\n\nWith these new tools, you can ask AI to rewrite a business email to sound more professional or friendly, or you can have AI proofread what you've written. These tools can be used anywhere you would type a message, like Messages, Mail and third-party apps like Instagram.\n\nHere's how to use AI to help make your messages pop. Just know that these tools are only available on the iPhone 16 lineup and the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, and you have to request access to Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, you won't be able to use these tools at this time.\n\nWhat to know about Writing Tools in Apple Intelligence\n\nAll Apple Intelligence-enabled devices get a new menu in their keyboard called Writing Tools. You can find this menu by highlighting your text and tapping Writing Tools in the floating menu over your text. You can also access Writing Tools by tapping the Apple Intelligence logo -- the pink and blue atom symbol -- in the menu over your keyboard.\n\nOnce you've opened Writing Tools, you'll see options to Proofread or Rewrite your text.\n\nTapping Proofread will check your text for grammatical errors. If it doesn't detect any errors it will give you the message \"No recommended changes.\"\n\nTapping Rewrite will adjust your message by changing words or describing things in more detail. After tapping Rewrite, you can tap Original to see what your original text was, or you can tap Rewrite again and Apple Intelligence will try again. However, I found that after tapping Rewrite four times on a particular text it didn't change the text at all. The number of times you can tap Rewrite before you stop getting changes is likely dependent on how long your text is, though.\n\nThere are also options to give your text a Friendly, Professional or Concise tone. Tapping Friendly, for example, will make your text read more informal and like chatting with a friend, and tapping Professional will make your text safe for work.\n\nDepending on the content of your text, you might get a message that reads, \"Writing Tools aren't designed to work with this type of content.\" I got this message when using curse words, and it seems to be meant to deter you from going further. However, you can tap Continue in the top right corner of the menu and Apple Intelligence will revise your message anyway. So if you type, \"That's bullshit,\" and ask Apple Intelligence to make it sound more professional, it might say, \"That assertion is inaccurate,\" which is now part of my corporate vocabulary.\n\nYou're right Apple Intelligence. It is. Apple/Screenshot by CNET\n\nIf you like what Apple Intelligence created, tap Done in the top right corner of the menu and the changes will stay. If you don't like what Apple Intelligence made you can tap Revert in the top left corner of the menu and you'll be taken back to the Writing Tools menu. You can also tap Original to check what your original text was.\n\nQuickly edit longer text with Apple Intelligence\n\nYou don't have to go through the Writing Tools menu to proofread or revise a longer text. Instead, highlight the entire text you want to edit and the options Proofread and Rewrite will appear in the menu over your keyboard.\n\nThese buttons work the same way as they do in the Writing Tools menu. If you're happy with your message, tap Done to replace your message with the rewritten version. But if you prefer your original message, tap Revert to go remove all changes.\n\nDon't forget, you should always reread your text if you use any of these tools. Because this is AI, your revised message might have errors or it might not make sense depending on the context.\n\nFor more on iOS 18, here's what you need to know about iOS 18.3.2, iOS 18.3.1 and iOS 18.3.

            "content": "iOS 19 will reportedly introduce a big redesign, alongside overhauled companion updates like macOS 16 and iPadOS 19. Per Mark Gurman, Apple executives have three goals in mind for the updates, and they sound lofty but spot-on.\n\nExecutives at Apple have a clear vision for OS overhauls\n\nIn his Power On newsletter over the weekend, Mark Gurman shared some new tidbits about the expected iOS 19 redesign.\n\nSome of the more noteworthy details came in a paragraph talking about Apple\u2019s goals for the new updates.\n\nExecutives say the goal is to make the operating systems simpler to use, faster to navigate and easier to learn. The software should also set the stage for new hardware designs, including foldable devices and touch-screen Macs. And it will have to adapt to an era dominated by artificial intelligence assistants, rather than people continually dipping in and out of applications.\n\nBased on this excerpt, it seems that Apple\u2019s leaders have three explicit goals. iOS 19 and its other updates must be:\n\nSimpler to use Faster to navigate Easier to learn\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that the latter details\u2014being ready for new hardware designs and an AI era\u2014are based on what executives have shared too. But the writing doesn\u2019t make clear whether these are just Gurman\u2019s assumptions or actual stated goals.\n\nEither way, let\u2019s focus in on the three items that Gurman does explicitly identify.\n\niOS 19\u2019s not-so-easy goals: \u2018simpler to use, faster to navigate, easier to learn\u2019\n\nAll of Apple\u2019s iOS 19 redesign goals, on the surface, seem incredibly straightforward and intuitive.\n\nIn reality, they will no doubt be incredibly hard to achieve.\n\nWhen I think of \u201csimpler to use\u201d and \u201cfaster to navigate,\u201d I\u2019m reminded of the iOS 19 clues I wrote about last week.\n\nSpecifically, Apple\u2019s trend away from tab bar navigation and toward single-page scrolling interfaces.\n\nScrolling doesn\u2019t require much of a learning curve. Many of the world\u2019s most popular apps\u2014TikTok and Instagram, for example\u2014are designed around this simple mechanic.\n\nBut \u201csimpler\u201d in theory doesn\u2019t always mean simpler in practice.\n\nTake last year\u2019s iOS 18 Photos redesign, for example. The app used to have a tab bar for navigation, then \u201csimplified\u201d into a single-page design. There are benefits to this approach, but it also introduced a lot of confusion for users.\n\nAdditionally, iOS 18 introduced a ton of new customization options to make your iPhone more personal than ever. But customization doesn\u2019t usually equal \u201ceasier to learn.\u201d\n\nThe average reader of this site will probably have no problem customizing their Photos app, Control Center, or Lock Screen.\n\nBut I suspect a large portion of Apple\u2019s user base just stick with default layouts for everything. That\u2019s the \u201ceasiest\u201d method.\n\nAll this to say, it won\u2019t be easy for Apple to achieve its goals, but they absolutely sound like the right direction for the company.\n\niOS 19 redesign: Solving the complexity problem\n\nIncreased power inevitably brings with it greater complexity.\n\niOS 18 can do far more than the earliest versions of iPhone software. But that increased functionality makes it harder for new users to get started. It has also led to discontinuity among Apple\u2019s various platforms and apps.\n\nWhile iPhone, iPad, and Mac share a lot of similar DNA, they also have their quirks. Similarly, app design at Apple has splintered over the years as certain apps retained older iOS conventions while others got more modern updates.\n\nAn overhaul that makes everything truly simpler, faster, and easier would go a long way toward addressing these issues. Following a huge year of feature updates, iOS 19 could be the reset that Apple\u2019s software needs.\n\nIt seems that Apple has the right idea in store for iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and macOS 16. But what will its execution look like? For that, we\u2019ll have to wait until June\u2019s WWDC unveiling and the first developer beta\u2019s.\n\nWhat do you think of Apple\u2019s reported goals for iOS 19\u2019s redesign?

This achievement apparently took a \u201cherculean effort\u201d on the part of Apple engineers. \u201c(It) is more than just an attempt to juice sales with something distinct from the rest of the lineup,\u201d Gurman wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s really a new beginning for the iPhone.\u201d\n\nSEE: Update Your iPhone Now to Fix Safari Security Flaw\n\nEuropean directive\u2019s impact on charging option\n\nApple apparently considered making the iPhone 17 Air the first \u201ccompletely port-free iPhone,\u201d the insider added. This would mean that all charging would have to be done wirelessly and data syncing would have to be done through iCloud, similar to the Apple Watch. Nevertheless, Cupertino ultimately decided against it, largely due to concerns about how European regulators might react.\n\nThe European \u201cCommon Charging\u201d Directive 2022/2380 mandates that most gadgets sold in the region charge via USB-C in a bid to reduce e-waste and address market fragmentation. This came into force in December, prompting Apple to end sales of the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and third-generation iPhone SE in all E.U. member states, which all still contained the Lightning charging port.\n\nThe Directive played a large part in the company\u2019s decision to add USB-C ports to the iPhone 15 series in 2023 and all newer devices. Europe accounts for more than a quarter of Apple\u2019s total revenue, so the loss of its market would cost the company dearly.\n\nSEE: Big Apple OS Makeover: Here\u2019s What to Expect & When\n\niPhone 17 Air\u2019s camera, screen size, and launch\n\nAccording to other leaks, the iPhone 17 Air\u2019s camera design reportedly resembles that of the Google Pixel. The single rear camera lens is mounted on a raised circular island that extends lengthwise across the entire back of the handset and will have 48 MP resolution. For comparison, the iPhone 16e features a 48 MP camera and is priced at $599, so the higher price of the new model likely reflects upgrades in other areas.\n\nLeakers have also claimed the iPhone 17 Air\u2019s screen will be 6.7-inch with a resolution of 2796 x 1290 pixels, and storage options will start at 128 GB. Gurman added that Apple didn\u2019t go with a 6.9-inch screen \u201cover fears that a thin device with a giant screen would be susceptible to bending.\u201d\n\nApple is expected to confirm details in September, which is the month when the company traditionally unveils its latest iPhone lineup.",

            "content": "Apple announces updates to its smartphone lineup every autumn, but the company often has a hard time keeping the details under wraps. Ahead of the official unveiling of the iPhone 17, we've already heard quite a few hints about what may be in store. Here's what we know and what we're expecting.\n\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\n\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. It's a little early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut.\n\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\n\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple shakes up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE.\n\nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 \u2014 likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\n\nWhat will iOS 19 be like?\n\nJon Prosser at Front Page Tech dropped a video in January that points to how a redesigned Camera app might point to more drastic changes to come for the operating system in the upcoming iPhone line. Earlier in March, Bloomberg also backed the assertion that an iOS overhaul is in the works. There hasn't been a notable overhaul of iOS for several generations, and it could be exciting to see Apple pushing the envelope on software again.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\nAnd while we don't have any formal leaks about this, it seems all-but guaranteed that Apple is going to continue pushing its Apple Intelligence suite. We're still waiting on some promised updates to Siri that are meant to take advantage of AI tools, so ideally those will be fully finished and integrated by the time the 17 series arrives.\n\nThe company typically shares more details about its upcoming plans for software during its Worldwide Developers Conference. WWDC 2025 will most likely be happening in early June, so expect to hear more about the operating system this summer.\n\nUpdate, March 17 2025, 2PM ET: Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.",

            "content": "Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) smartphone shipments in China dropped by 21% in January, a significant hit that underscores the growing challenges in the world's largest consumer market. According to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, the foreign-branded phone segment, including Apple's iPhone, shrank to 4.4 million units from 5.5 million units a year earlier. Total phone sales in China were also down by 14.3%, signaling that the Chinese tech market might be cooling off, with demand for foreign brands taking a notable hit. Apple, being the largest foreign player, is particularly vulnerable to these shifts in consumer behavior.\n\nIn response to the slowdown, Chinese officials are doubling down on economic recovery efforts. The government has rolled out an 81 billion yuan ($11.2 billion) program to stimulate consumer demand, focusing on sectors like auto and appliance sales. The People's Bank of China is also exploring new financial tools to ramp up low-cost funding, aiming to fuel consumption across critical areas. This push is part of a broader strategy to stabilize the economy as tariffs from the U.S. continue to complicate export growth. While China's retail sales rose by 4% and industrial production saw a 5.9% jump in early 2025, the real test will be whether these efforts can revive broader consumer confidence and spending.\n\nDespite these measures, the real estate sector remains a thorn in China's recovery story, with a 9.8% drop in investment over the first two months of the year. Real estate prices have slowed their decline, but a full rebound looks uncertain. China's economic recovery is still very much in play, but with external pressures mounting and internal demand lagging, the situation remains fluid. Investors will want to stay alert, keeping a close eye on China's economic performance to see if these recovery efforts can translate into sustained growth.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "In January, the United Kingdom\u2019s Home Office\u2014equivalent to the United States\u2019s Department of Homeland Security\u2014secretly demanded that Apple provide, upon request, backdoor access to any account on iCloud (Apple\u2019s file-storage service) on the planet. U.K. law forbids Apple from disclosing the order\u2019s existence, but the news leaked in February. Earlier this month, the BBC reported that the company has filed a secret appeal with the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, the modern-day Star Chamber that oversees the U.K.\u2019s sweeping surveillance apparatus. A restricted hearing supposedly occurred on March 14.\n\nThe American response to the U.K.\u2019s behavior has, refreshingly, transcended party lines. Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat, and Representative Andy Biggs, a Republican, jointly condemned \u201cwhat is effectively a foreign cyberattack waged through political means.\u201d Two other Democratic lawmakers warned that Britain is \u201cundermin[ing] U.S. law, public policy, and information security.\u201d Tulsi Gabbard, the Trump administration\u2019s director of national intelligence, called the U.K.\u2019s move an \u201cegregious violation of Americans\u2019 privacy and civil liberties.\u201d President Trump himself compared the secret order with \u201csomething you hear about with China,\u201d adding that the U.K. \u201ccan\u2019t do this.\u201d\n\nFinally, a reason to check your emails. Sign up for our free newsletter today.\n\nNonetheless, Apple faces an uphill battle. It must argue that the U.K. violated the Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, widely known as the Snoopers\u2019 Charter, which authorizes the British government to intercept communications, engage in bulk data collection, and compel telecom and software companies to give access to users\u2019 data. While it appeals, Apple has pulled the service being attacked, Advanced Data Protection (ADP), from the U.K. Whether the Home Office will accept this partial retreat, or insist that the tech giant dismantle the feature globally, remains to be seen.\n\nIn the United States, Apple iPhone users can still use ADP, thereby protecting certain data stored in iCloud\u2014including photos, files, and notes\u2014with end-to-end encryption that even the government cannot break. In the United Kingdom, however, Apple has now removed this option, under government pressure. There is a real risk it could be forced to do the same here. U.S. policymakers must act to prevent that outcome.\n\nAt the heart of the issue is encryption technology. End-to-end encryption ensures that only users with the correct password (or cryptographic key, to be precise) can access their data. For messaging apps like Signal or WhatsApp, this means messages can be read only by the sender and recipient. For iCloud backups, it means only the user\u2014not even Apple\u2014can see the stored content in its unscrambled form.\n\nIf, as the U.K. demands, Apple built a backdoor, iCloud would, by definition, no longer be end-to-end encrypted. And as any cybersecurity expert will confirm, there is no such thing as a backdoor that only the government can use. Once created, it is only a matter of time before a backdoor gets exploited\u2014whether by hackers, foreign adversaries, or rogue insiders.\n\nThe United States has not always defended strong encryption, but recent events have raised Americans\u2019 awareness of what\u2019s on the line. When wokeness was ascendant, some conservatives came to view data privacy as a bulwark against an increasingly progressive administrative state and even the possibility of a social-credit system. Meantime, Republicans and Democrats alike have grown frustrated with the FBI\u2019s persistent failure to curb abuses of its surveillance powers. More recently, Salt Typhoon\u2014the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s operation to infiltrate America\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure\u2014has driven home, even to national security hawks, that a backdoor for good guys is also a backdoor for bad ones.\n\nThe U.K. has taken a different path. For years, it has tried to reduce the encryption debate to a matter of child safety alone. State-funded campaigns cast encryption as useful only to predators\u2014and not, say, political dissidents. In one proposed advertisement, apparently shelved, an adult and child, each typing on a smartphone, were to sit in public in a glass box that slowly grows opaque.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act of 2023 empowers Ofcom, the U.K.\u2019s telecom regulator, to require platforms to deploy specific technologies in the name of public safety. This opens the way for the government to scan all private messages for illegal content. The government has yet to impose such a requirement\u2014but its attack on Apple shows where things are headed.\n\nChild protection is an important goal, obviously, but the U.K. refuses to reckon with the cost of creating a digital panopticon. Nor is it being candid about what it can already do. With time, money, and a warrant, state actors can break into most smartphones. What the U.K. officials really want is the capacity to peer into every smartphone easily and at will.\n\nThe stakes are high. If the U.K. succeeds in compelling Apple to sabotage its own security, autocratic regimes\u2014as well as other putatively liberal ones\u2014will take note and follow suit.\n\nThe U.S. must respond. A good start would be to revisit the terms of the U.S.-U.K. CLOUD Act agreement, which allows Britain to obtain data from U.S. tech firms without American oversight. Though the agreement bars the U.K. from targeting U.S. persons or collecting data in bulk, these guardrails now appear inadequate. It turns out we cannot trust the Brits to respect cybersecurity on our shores.\n\nIf the U.K. wants to devalue its own rights, that is its choice. But we should defend ours. When we broke from Great Britain, we wisely chose to write our liberties down. As the U.K.\u2019s unwritten constitution fades, our courts still uphold the First and Fourth Amendments.\n\nThe Supreme Court has affirmed every American\u2019s right to be free from state inquiry into his library\u2019s contents. Our papers have moved to the cloud, and His Majesty\u2019s government wants a look. Americans know how to react to such royal intrusions.\n\nPhoto by Peter Nicholls/Getty Images",

As of that update, Siri is accompanied by a rainbow of hues around the border of your iPhone screen when active.\n\nIt sounds like a silly thing to prioritize, but Siri's new look isn't just a cosmetic makeover. As part of Apple Intelligence features such as notification summaries, Genmoji and the Clean Up tool in Photos, Siri gets new features too.\n\nBut if you're not seeing this colorful change, you may still need some assistance getting it to trigger. If you recently upgraded to iOS 18.3 and aren't sure how to get Siri's new glow, here's how to get it to activate.\n\nIt's possible you may need a new phone to get it to work properly. More than likely, you'll just need to do a quick software update.\n\nThe new design of Siri is a glowing border that distorts everything briefly. Screenshots by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nWatch this: Apple Redesigns Siri With AI and Glowing Borders 03:18\n\nYour iPhone might not be able to run Apple Intelligence\n\nThe latest system update is for everyone with an iPhone XS or later, but that doesn't mean everyone gets Apple Intelligence. In fact, because much of the AI computation is done on device, only a handful of models can currently run the new technologies:\n\niPhone 15 Pro\n\niPhone 15 Pro Max\n\niPhone 16\n\niPhone 16 Plus\n\niPhone 16E\n\niPhone 16 Pro\n\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nApple Intelligence will also run on Macs and iPads with M-series processors, as well as the latest iPad Mini (which is powered by the A17 Pro chip).\n\nIf you have any of those models, you'll see the shimmering new look when you invoke Siri. On the Mac, the Siri search field gets the same effect instead of the entire screen edges. If you have a different model, you'll see the same Siri orb.\n\nSiri under iOS 18 looks the same as it did in iOS 17 for many people. Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nYou may need to reenable Apple Intelligence\n\nAfter the first Apple Intelligence features arrived in iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1 and MacOS Sequoia 15.1, they weren't automatically turned on. You had to sign up and wait for a few hours or days to get access.\n\nThe latest updates (iOS 18.3.2, iPadOS 18.3 and MacOS Sequoia 15.3) now enable Apple Intelligence automatically, even though it's still considered a beta feature. If you never signed up for the waitlist, or this is your first jump to iOS 18 from iOS 17, for example, Apple Intelligence should be on and the new Siri interface should appear.\n\nHowever, if at some point you had Apple Intelligence on your device but you turned it off, the latest updates don't flip the switch to re-enable it. Go to Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri and make sure the Apple Intelligence toggle is turned on.\n\nRead more: Now Anyone Can Try the Next Apple Intelligence Features in iOS 18.4 Public Beta. How to Download It\n\nCheck your Siri language settings\n\nCurrently Apple Intelligence is not available worldwide and uses only English language models. In Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri, make sure Language is set to one of the following:\n\nEnglish (Australia)\n\nEnglish (Canada)\n\nEnglish (Ireland)\n\nEnglish (New Zealand)\n\nEnglish (South Africa)\n\nEnglish (United Kingdom)\n\nEnglish (United States)\n\nAs of iOS 18.3, the new Siri features are supported only in the selected languages. Screenshots by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nAdditionally, if you switched the Language setting to something else -- talking to Siri in another language can be more fun than Duolingo -- selecting one of the English variants above does not automatically re-enable the new Siri. But there's an easy fix: In Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri, turn Apple Intelligence off and back on again. Then restart the iPhone. That re-downloads the necessary language model.\n\nSupport for other languages is coming later this year. A footnote on Apple's Apple Intelligence page clarifies: \"Additional features and languages will be available in April, with more languages and platforms coming over the course of the year. Languages supported in 2025 include Chinese, English (India, Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese.\"\n\nFor more on what's new related to the latest system update, here's the right way to back up your iPhone before you install iOS 18.3 and eight settings you want to change first in iOS 18.3.

            "content": "According to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple is potentially working on a third generation Studio Display, codenamed J527. This would be a version ahead of the already rumored second generation Studio Display, which is codenamed J427 \u2013 but feature advantages of the third generation display are unknown. It\u2019s also plausible that this isn\u2019t a third-generation monitor at all. Let\u2019s discuss.\n\nLast month, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman reported that Apple begun development on a new external display, codenamed J427, for release in 2026. This would be a Studio Display successor, rather than a new Pro Display.\n\nHowever, Apple is also working on an additional monitor, codenamed J527, per Bloomberg:\n\nNow, here\u2019s one twist. I\u2019m told Apple is working on a second new monitor code-named J527. At this point, it seems unlikely that the device would be a subsequent generation, given the amount of time between updates and that we\u2019re still a bit away from the J427.\n\nGurman suggests that J427 and J527 might end up not being distinct products, and instead Apple is just prototyping with multiple options for a second generation Studio Display. This would make a fair bit of sense, given the fact that it\u2019s been over 3 years since the first generation Studio Display debuted, and there\u2019s still over a year before the rumored second generation model will launch.\n\nAdditionally, Gurman speculates that J527 could end up being a \u201csecond model with a different screen size or set of specifications,\u201d and mentions the fact that Apple\u2019s Pro Display XDR is nearing 6 years old.\n\nAll in all, it isn\u2019t necessarily clear what this J527 rumor means. Could it be a third generation Studio Display? Studio Display Pro? Pro Display XDR 2? Who knows. The \u201c27\u201d number in the codename would heavily suggest that this will have a 27\u2033 display size, at least.\n\nMy favorite Apple accessories on Amazon:\n\nFollow Michael: X/Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram",

I didn't like driving cars without the assistance, convenience and aesthetics of Apple CarPlay. But then I bought my 2025 Genesis GV60 last October and everything changed.\n\nWhen I bought the GV60, it hadn't yet received the over-the-air software update to accommodate wireless CarPlay. It sounds ridiculous, but I was having a fit \u2014 the thought of cords cluttering my new car's interior was killing the vibe. To maintain the clean, calm atmosphere of the GV60, I decided not to use Apple CarPlay and give the native infotainment system a chance instead. This Apple geek hasn't looked back since. Sure, CarPlay is still good, but I don't miss it. Here's why.\n\nCloud-connected services keep the maps up to date\n\nIn the old days, when a car offered navigational services, map updates were only available via DVD or SD card. And you had to pay extra for the antiquated tech, too. Even if you bothered to purchase the updates, the data was quickly outdated and Apple Maps, Google Maps or Waze were your necessary alternatives. Now that Genesis\u2019 native system uses cloud-connected services, the maps are continuously updated, just like with Apple and Google. The routes are intelligently calculated with assistance from live road and traffic data. They're also competitive with Apple Maps/Google Maps and offer the same functionality and features. However, the native navigation system is integrated into both the digital gauge cluster and the head-up display, making following directions even easier.",

Indeed, the iPhone SE, Vision Pro and the HomePod were all originally launched at WWDC giving even those with a casual interest in tech a reason to pay attention.\n\nHere\u2019s everything we know about the WWDC 2025 so far.\n\nWhen is WWDC 2025?\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\nIt would be extremely surprising if WWDC weren\u2019t scheduled for June. Though the event has been held at various times in the year since its inaugural one in 1983, since 2007 it\u2019s been June every time, and Apple doesn\u2019t like to mix things up too much. Numbered iPhones have similarly only been announced in September for the last decade, with only one small pandemic-shaped blip in 2020.\n\nWhen in June? Looking at the past decade\u2019s worth of dates, they tend to be in the first two weeks. So while we won\u2019t know for sure until Apple officially announces it, you should pencil in June 2 to June 6 and June 9 to June 13 as probable dates.\n\nWWDC 2025: What software are we expecting?\n\n(Image credit: Front Page Tech / YouTube)\n\nThe most interesting software developments concern iOS 19, which Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman has described as \u201cone of the most dramatic software overhauls in the company\u2019s history.\u201d The redesign is said to be inspired by Vision Pro with its rounded icons, and even the camera app is reportedly getting a makeover inspired by the headset.\n\nWhether we\u2019ll see anything of the new-look Siri, however, is up for debate. While it was demoed at last year\u2019s WWDC, it has since been officially postponed, and although Apple is still aiming for iOS 19, it may slip even further. Given the controversy and backlash surrounding its delay, it would perhaps be more surprising if Apple mentioned it much at all.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

Later, in a separate piece, he added: \u201cApple is unlikely to unveil groundbreaking new AI features at this coming WWDC. Instead, it will likely lay out plans for bringing current capabilities to more apps.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just about iPhone software, of course, and we could also see improvements to the respective operating systems of Apple Watches, iPads, Apple TV, Vision Pro and Macs. For the latter, with macOS 16, we\u2019re expecting a design overhaul to bring it more in line with iOS which, as outlined above, may look more like Vision Pro.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of Vision Pro, Gurman says that visionOS 3.0 will be a \u201cpretty feature-packed release\u201d, so perhaps that will feature heavily too, as version 2.4 will be out the door well before June.\n\nWWDC 2025: Is any hardware expected this year?\n\n(Image credit: Yanko Design)\n\nUnfortunately, while in the past Apple has used WWDC to introduce whole new product lines including Vision Pro and HomePod as well as smaller product refreshes, new hardware isn\u2019t guaranteed. And to date, we haven\u2019t heard any talk of new hardware announcements.\n\nThat\u2019s not exactly surprising, given the busy start to 2025 Apple has had, with the iPhone 16e, M4 MacBook Air, M3 iPad Air and A16 iPad all launching in the first three months.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Apple would once have debuted its rumored smart home hub at this year\u2019s event, but with the delays to Siri 2.0 pushing it back, we may well have a hardware-free WWDC this year.",

Apple has surpassed 2.2 billion active devices as of February 2024, so odds are you own at least one. And if Apple made laptop stands, they would look like Rain Design\u2019s.\n\nApple devices are known for their elegant simplicity, and Rain Design just gets it. All of its stands disappear behind the device that they\u2019re meant to support and don\u2019t drown your workplace in visual clutter. Most of its products hover between $25 and $65 (excluding the $319 iGo monitor stand) and have iOS-esque finishes\u2014silver, gold, space gray, black, midnight blue, and starlight (that champagne hue)\u2014and most are designed with a cable outlet.\n\nApple carries Twelve South stands, but I prefer Rain Design\u2019s. They slightly less expensive, with a wider variety of styles and colors. And they\u2019re sturdy, so they'll still be holding strong even after you\u2019ve replaced your MacBook with its shinier successor.\n\nStability You Can Rely On\n\nThe mStand is my favorite of the bunch. It\u2019s rock-solid, forged from a solid aluminum plate, and designed with a wide base (7.5 x 10 inches) that makes it one of the most stable stands I\u2019ve tested. I very much appreciate the slot underneath to tuck my external keyboard and mouse when not in use. If you collaborate in-person often, the mStand360 model adds a swivel base. Rain Design makes mStand variations for iPhones and iPads, too.\n\nPhotograph: Rain Design\n\nIf you prefer a little more flexibility, the iLevel2 ($65) lets you dial the height from 5.4 to 7.9 inches with a simple front slider. The mTower ($50) is a vertical stand that enables you to stow your Macbook upright, freeing up valuable desk space\u2014ideal if you use an external monitor. And if you\u2019re someone who intended to work at your desk but somehow ended up on the couch after lunch, the iLap ($45)\u2014with its detachable front cushion\u2014is one of the few lap desks that are just as stable for desk work. (The iRest does the same for tablets; all three cushions are removable to fold down and pack.)\n\nReady for Action\n\nThe mBar Pro+ is the best portable stand. The 5.5-inch elevation feels just right for comfortable viewing and typing. When I'm not toting this to a coffee shop, it stays stationed on my already cluttered desk, ready for when I need a second screen.\n\nIf you have a tablet, mBar Pro+, which works with most MacBooks, is also compatible with the 9.7-inch iPad, 10.5-inch, and 12.5-inch iPad Pro in horizontal mode. It folds down to just 9.5 x 6 inches and weighs less than a pound; it's compact enough to throw into any tote bag, including my Lululemon Boxy Mini Tote. Plus, it comes with a svelte pouch, like all of the company's portable products. If you prefer lower laptop stands, the foldable mBar pro ($55) and the mBar fixed stand ($25) both raise your MacBook by three inches.\n\nRain Design isn\u2019t out here trying to reinvent the wheel with flashy features. The company has taken the fundamentals and made them better, offering an assortment of stands that\u2014at the very least\u2014don't buckle under pressure. Essentially, Rain Design delivers what we all desire: unwavering stability, genuine thoughtfulness, and durability that'll outlive your Apple device.",

Alongside a radical iPhone 17 Pro camera bump alteration, speculation is that Apple will be bringing out hardware referred to as the iPhone 17 Air or iPhone 17 Slim.\n\nIn Sunday's newsletter for Bloomberg, Mark Gurman writes about the model's details, including how it won't look that different from a standard model when viewed from the front. It will have a 6.6-inch display with slim borders and ProMotion, as well as the Dynamic Island at the top.\n\nThe 6.6-inch claim is about the same as others about the screen, with the size ranging from 6.55 inches to 6.7 inches, depending on the rumor source.\n\nThe side will even have things like the Camera Control button, but there won't be that much space for it. The depth reduction is said to be about 2 millimeters, making it about a fifth thinner than the current-gen iPhone 16 range.\n\nMaking a smaller smartphone required Apple to go back to the drawing board to avoid making too many compromises. That resulted in engineering changes to the display, battery, and even silicon elements, to make it fit.\n\nNot full-bore\n\nWhile it tried to avoid them, Apple still had to make some choices that marginally reduced the iPhone 17 Air's capabilities. This includes switching to a single 48-megapixel camera on the back, similar to the iPhone 16e.\n\nThough the iPhone range hasn't had a physical SIM card slot for a while in the United States, the new design will also lose the component in other markets. This was previously reportedon, but reaffirmed by Gurman in his report.\n\nThough the drawbacks of the redesign are a problem for the slimmest on-the-way model, it also brings with it some benefits. For example, Gurman believes that the model will use the C1 modem, Apple's in-house design that will save power, but loses out on mmWave 5G support.\n\nThe new model will also apparently represent a sea change for Apple, and some technologies made for the Air will apparently be incorporated into future releases, like the long-rumored iPhone Fold.",

            "content": "I spent nearly a decade with iPhones until I switched to the Google Pixel 6a in 2022, and have not looked back. Android sucked me in. But I was curious about how the Apple experience has changed since I left, so I decided to go back to iOS with the iPhone 16e.\n\nApple's latest is the exact iPhone I wanted three years ago, leaps and bounds ahead of the iPhone SE it replaces. It\u2019s not a 'budget' phone, but it\u2019s far from being a flagship, too.\n\nAmong its rivals, it holds up exceptionally well in benchmarks, but has significant tradeoffs compared to some phones that are half its price.\n\nHaving been out of Camp Apple for so long, I\u2019ve seen what it\u2019s like on the other side \u2013 and coming back, I\u2019m both impressed and puzzled with the hands-on experience.\n\n(Image credit: Zachariah Kelly / TechRadar)\n\nThere is an assured certainty and comfort when the manufacturer has complete control over an ecosystem \u2013 ie, having hardware, software, cloud and content management (via apps like Home and Music) talk to each other seamlessly. And when this comes from Cupertino, it's more about the experience rather than the performance of the device.\n\nIt\u2019s also why the Google Pixel range remains my most recommended Android family of devices, and that's despite Samsung offering better tech on all fronts and at all price points \u2013 Google\u2019s range feels more like Apple. The Pixels feel more mastered and uniform: again, because it's about the experience rather than the performance.\n\nThe iPhone 16e makes the experience more accessible than the standard range, offering shaved-off specs at a lower (but still considerable) price.\n\nSo turning to the iPhone 16e, knowing how comfortable I\u2019ve gotten with the Android ecosystem, I\u2019m left asking if this is enough. Many of the spec choices are baffling, but others are still ones that I wish more Android manufacturers would learn from.\n\nAn Androider\u2019s take on the iPhone 16e\n\n(Image credit: Zachariah Kelly / TechRadar)\n\nI\u2019m impressed with how well Apple continues to make all this stuff simply work together \u2013 from FaceID biometrics to allowing purchases and app downloads, to the instantly recognizable and understandable Home, Lock and Control Center screens, they all make for an experience that\u2019s instantly operable.\n\nPerformance is in line with the base iPhone 16 (which I consider to be Apple\u2019s best handset in years) and far ahead of similarly positioned Android phones. It's great for a mixed use of gaming, social media, messaging and note-writing.\n\nComing from Android, I'm also drawn to the simplicity. The cuteness of FaceTime, the ability to share contacts with a tap of an NFC sensor between iPhones, and the more user-friendly approach to home screen customization (focused on colors instead of palettes) give off a great feeling of coziness. It\u2019s cute, it works, and it\u2019s fun!\n\n(Image credit: Zachariah Kelly / TechRadar)\n\nWhat on Earth is up with this screen, though? 60Hz on such a pricey unit, and the same goes for the standard iPhone 16. This is grating as I don't like the scrolling and app-opening experience.\n\nThat makes the 16 and 16e seem like they perform worse than they do, and look less smooth than much cheaper Androids.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing stopping these phones from operating a 120Hz display like the Pro counterparts, apart from Apple\u2019s unwillingness to provide such screens. It breaks the seamlessness I referred to earlier.\n\nMoving on: something I\u2019ve been quite jealous of while using an Android phone has been Apple\u2019s Action Button. I love the idea of an extra button with customizable functionality, but I'm not sold on its usability. I wish it had more than just a 'hold to open' trigger, but rather more like the stand-by button that works with a single or a double press.\n\n(Image credit: Zachariah Kelly/TechRadar)\n\nI still appreciate the Action Button though. An extra physical control on Android handsets would enable so much flexibility, say to quickly open a messaging app, use Google Lens, or quickly pull up your favorite contact list.\n\nFinally, and this is a gripe specific to the iPhone 16e, but only offering a single camera at this price point feels like a huge step backwards for Apple. There are competing phones available at half the price of this handset that have two lenses, enabling more impressive zoom capabilities or greater detail up close.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong; the iPhone 16e can produce great photos, but a native zoom that maxes out at 2x is meager compared to what the Pixel 8a and Galaxy A56 are capable of \u2013 at a lower price point.\n\n'e' is for...\n\nWhen I first saw this phone's name, I assumed that the 'e' meant 'essential'. There's no official word from Apple on what it means, but I think I may have hit the mark.\n\nFirstly, it's price tag \u2013 while still expensive, it strips back some non-essentials from the premium range but includes the Apple A18 chip, an IP68 resistance rating, an extremely impressive 30-hour battery life, and even Apple-specific features like its advanced biometric FaceID sensor and Action Button. In other words, the 'essentials'.\n\n(Image credit: Zachariah Kelly / TechRadar)\n\nIt fits the sweetspot between the now grandfathered SE and the base model 16 \u2013 more expensive than the former but offering the essentials of the latter, probably filling a crucial marketshare goal. I can absolutely see it being a hit in markets like India, where Apple has only just managed to become one of the country\u2019s top five smartphone brands.\n\nParadoxically restrictive and freeing, the iPhone 16e is a comfortable phone. It\u2019s the right pick if you\u2019ve been holding out for an entry-level device to upgrade to in the Apple family, but it\u2019s not great value if you\u2019ve broken out of the Apple ecosystem.\n\n(Image credit: Zachariah Kelly / TechRadar)\n\nAt this end of the phone market, Apple has the competitive edge on raw benchmarking performance \u2013 but its rivals are far less expensive with cameras easily outpacing the single lens on the iPhone 16e.\n\nPerformance benchmarks be damned, the Samsung Galaxy A56 and Google Pixel 8a feel much more general purpose and suitable for day-to-day use, with more impressive cameras to boot. Not to mention the larger screens on both.\n\nIt\u2019s an awkward spot for Apple to place such a great phone \u2013 it\u2019s more powerful, but it\u2019s not as practical as cheaper rivals. That said, it will be a brilliant handset to pick up on sale, otherwise its standard price is perhaps a little too high.",

Jason Sudeikis is set to return as the titular soccer coach, though no other cast has yet been officially confirmed, and Apple TV+ programming head Matt Cherniss said, \u201cEveryone at Apple is thrilled to be continuing our collaboration with Jason and the brilliant creative minds behind this show.\u201d Many wondered if the season 3 finale would be the last we saw of the show, so this comes as welcome news.\n\nLandman to Return for Season 2\n\nExactly two months after its season 1 finale, Landman has been renewed for a second season on Paramount+. It\u2019s no surprise that the show has been picked up for a second season after it landed Billy Bob Thornton a Golden Globe nomination and both its premiere and finale ranked among the streamer\u2019s most watched. The show, created by Yellowstone\u2019s Taylor Sheridan and inspired by the Boomtown podcast, is set in West Texas, focusing on the competition in the oil rig industry.\n\nMax Says Conan O\u2019Brien Must Go Again\n\nHot off of his successful gig hosting the Oscars, Conan O\u2019Brien has secured a third season of his travelogue series Conan O\u2019Brien Must Go from Max ahead of the show\u2019s currently undated season 2 premiere in May. The first season saw O\u2019Brien travel to Norway, Argentina, Thailand, and Ireland, meeting locals and immersing himself \u2014 frequently in awkward fashion \u2014 in their culture.\n\nPrime Video Drops Its Cruel Intentions\n\nAfter just one season, Prime Video has pulled the plug on its drama Cruel Intentions, based on the 1999 film of the same title, which itself was based on the frequently adapted 1782 French novel Les Liaisons dangereuses (Dangerous Liaisons). The story centered on two college-aged step-siblings whose ruthless pursuit of social power leads them to engage in rather unsavory activities, particularly with a high-profile classmate.\n\n#\n\nThe

            "content": "ZDNET\n\nThe smartwatch market just experienced its first-ever decline, according to a recent report by Counterpoint. The report says 7% fewer smartwatches were shipped in 2024 than in 2023, and Apple's dwindling popularity might be to blame.\n\nAlso: The Apple Watch Series 10 is on sale for its lowest price ever at every major retailer\n\nAccording to Counterpoint, tighter competition and weaker upgrade cycles fueled a 19% decline in Apple Watch's shipment rate during that period.\n\n\"Apple Watch witnessed a decline in momentum on its 10th anniversary, despite the launch of the S10 series. The biggest driver of the decline was North America, where the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases,\" Senior Research Analyst Anshika Jain said in the Counterpoint report.\n\nAlso: Apple Watch Series 10 vs. Apple Watch Series 9: Should you upgrade to the latest model?\n\nThere are several reasons why Apple's smart wearable has seemingly lost its appeal over the past year. From a blood oxygen sensing feature that couldn't escape patent disputes, to growing competition in the wearables space, the tech behemoth is fighting several forces that could keep its shipments lower.\n\n1. The blood oxygen sensor that never was\n\nApple lost a patent case last year with the medical company Masimo over its blood oxygen sensor. This caused Apple to remove the feature on its watches, frustrating customers. Several Redditors on the r/AppleWatch thread said they'd consider buying a new Apple Watch once this feature has been reinstated.\n\nAlso: Have an old smartwatch or ring? Samsung will give you up to $250 off a new Galaxy Ring for it\n\nIn the meantime, other smartwatches and smart rings are implementing blood oxygen sensors into their wearables, like Huawei's D2 smartwatch. The Chinese brand saw a 35% increase in shipments year over year, according to Counterpoint's report.\n\n2. It's a notification machine\n\nA few weeks ago, I spoke with a friend at a tech event who was wearing an Apple Watch and a Whoop on his wrist. Why, I asked, was he wearing both? The Whoop, he explained, was great at tracking activity and recovery and monitoring his health, while the Apple Watch functioned simply as a notification machine.\n\nAlso: Apple secretly launched 12 new accessories last week (and they're full of whimsy)\n\nNow, one of Apple Watch's purposes is to track your health. However, the brand has developed several features beyond health tracking that allow the watch to function more as a mini smartphone and less as a health monitor. You can answer calls on the watch, send texts, set timers and reminders, and navigate maps. You don't need one of Apple's newest watches to perform these tasks. In fact, generations-old Apple Watches can do such things -- and the devices tend to have longer life cycles than smartphones. This longevity may delay customers' purchase of the newest generation.\n\n3. Brands are developing impressive competing products\n\nSleep tracking is big business, and the Apple Watch lags behind some industry standards. Unlike Whoop and Garmin smartwatches, or smart rings like Oura, Galaxy Ring, or Ultrahuman, the Apple Watch doesn't offer users sleep, readiness, or activity scores, even though it's collecting vitals data around the clock. Its sleep features, like Sleep Apnea Detection, are useful for those who want to learn whether they snore, but what about everyday use?\n\nApple comes close to developing a functionality that encourages constant use through the Vitals App on the Apple Watch. It displays information like your time spent asleep, respiratory rate, wrist temperature, and blood oxygen, and ranks them based on high, typical, or low ranges. Users can see this across a daily, weekly, or monthly timeline. However, Apple needs to develop more extensive sleep-tracking features that encourage everyday check-ins to paint an expansive picture and incentivize healthy habits. Access to those kinds of features explains why scoring mechanisms are so useful.\n\nAlso: I replaced my Windows laptop with an M4 MacBook Air - here's how the first 24 hours went\n\nThe tech giant could take notes from Whoop, Oura, or Garmin to deliver software that effectively displays a user's sleep health, and provides them behavioral insights into, say, whether they're a morning person or night owl, how they historically handle stress, or gamify sleep scores to encourage better, consistent rest. These personalized insights and summaries that contextualize user data would create a more tailored experience and boost regular use.",

Sure, you get a ton of features in return, but that requires you to wait a long period and pay an additional sum to experience the company\u2019s latest and greatest earbuds, so why not enjoy the current latest and greatest, the AirPods Pro 2, at a substantially lower price that is made possible thanks to the latest discount on Amazon.\n\nAvailable for $169.99 a pair, these ship with Apple\u2019s custom H2, which delivers significantly better Active Noise Cancellation and offers better reliability, range, and audio quality. Even with the design unchanged from the first-generation AirPods Pro, Apple managed to improve the successor in every way. The charging case now features a USB-C port instead of Lightning, making it even more convenient as you do not have to carry around an additional cable just to top up an accessory.\n\nAssuming that the standard silicone eartips do not deliver a perfect fit, the AirPods Pro 2 packaging includes three pairs of different-sized tips to ensure compatibility. As for battery life, with Active Noise Cancellation enabled, the AirPods Pro 2 can deliver a runtime of up to 6 hours, with a 30-hour endurance coming from the USB-C charging case. However, despite the $169.99 price tag, these cannot fit in everyone\u2019s budget, and for those who cannot part away with more than $100, you can grab the AirPods 4 without Active Noise Cancellation for just $99.99.\n\nThe versions that ship with Active Noise Cancellation are currently retailing for $148.99, but with just $21 extra, you can obtain a significantly superior version of Apple\u2019s wireless earbuds, but it is nice to know that apart from the AirPods Pro 2, there are several options available for buyers.\n\nGet the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation from Amazon - $148.99 (17 percent off)\n\nGet the AirPods 4 without Active Noise Cancellation from Amazon - $99.99 (22 percent off)",

In 1952, while attending Santa Ana Junior College, he played in the Junior College World Series.\n\n\u201cGladys was a very hard working and loving mom, as Jim was a traveling salesman and she raised three kids in a home full of love and laughter,\u201d her family said.\n\nGladys\u2019 family moved from California to New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and Colorado before moving back to the Golden State in 1976.\n\nShe spent most of her time making sure her kids made it to baseball, basketball, and cheer practice and to games, her family said.\n\nChurch, family life\n\nShe attended Church of the Valley with her children, Greg and Cindy, and began volunteering after she retired from Ben Hinkle Realty.\n\nAt church, Gladys answered phones, worked in the Crisis Ministry, helped to distribute food to the needy, managed the bulletin crew, worked with ushers and was part of the greeting ministry.\n\nHer husband, Jim, 69, died on Oct. 1, 2002.\n\nGlady and Jim are survived by children, Jim Jr., Greg and Cindy; her grandchildren Matt, Sara, Jerry, Hallie and Breanna; and six great-grandchildren\n\nChurch of the Valley is located at 20700 Standing Rock Ave. in Apple Valley.\n\nDaily Press reporter Rene Ray De La Cruz may be reached at RDeLaCruz@VVDailyPress.com.

Apple should have known that the features would not be ready in time and should not have promised them if they were not likely to be available, he said.\n\nHe said the fruity cargo cult is in \"disarray if not crisis\" after its much-hyped AI features for the iPhone have failed to materialise.\n\nThis is a bloke who usually finds a way to defend the fruity cargo-cult even when it serves up steaming piles of mediocrity, so when he starts using words like \"bullshit,\" you know something is properly wrong.\n\nThe mess started last June when Apple unveiled its so-called \"Apple Intelligence,\" which was supposed to revolutionise Siri and bring AI-powered magic to the iPhone.\n\nPredictably, the company delivered a lot of hot air and a couple of gimmicks, like an app that generates AI images. The real meat of the update\u2014giving Siri the ability actually to be useful\u2014was promised for this year. But Apple quietly admitted it wouldn\u2019t happen anytime soon. Instead, the long-overdue updates have been pushed into the vague abyss of \"the coming year,\" which could mean 2026 if we\u2019re lucky.\n\nApple, of course, tried to spin this as progress, boasting about how Siri is now more \"conversational\" and how it has integrated ChatGPT\u2014because nothing screams innovation like bolting on an external AI system that everyone else already has. In reality, it\u2019s yet another example of Apple selling a dream it knows it can\u2019t deliver, and Gruber is calling it out.\n\nHe pointed out that Steve Jobs wouldn\u2019t have tolerated this level of incompetence, and he\u2019s right. The late Apple founder made Elon [Roman Salute] Musk look benign and notorious for terrorising his staff into getting things done.\n\nCurrent CEO Tim Cook, on the other hand, seems more content to let things slide while counting the billions rolling in from increasingly lacklustre hardware updates.\n\nGruber fears that if Cook hasn\u2019t already had an emergency meeting to \"rectify this Siri and Apple Intelligence debacle,\" then Apple\u2019s days of being taken seriously might be over. According to him, the rot of \"mediocrity, excuses, and bullshit\" has already set in, and once that happens, there\u2019s no turning back.\n\nFor years, Apple has coasted on reputation and brand loyalty while doing the bare minimum. Now, even its most loyal defenders are starting to realise that the emperor has no clothes and they are paying for it.\n\nIf the Fruity Cargo Cult doesn\u2019t get its act together soon, the only thing left will be the marketing department frantically trying to convince the world that delay-ridden, half-baked features are a revolutionary breakthrough. Although we would argue that has been the status quo for the last decade.",

Google\u2019s Pixel Buds have offered live translation functionality for several years now, and it currently lets users translate between 40 languages. In addition to this conversation mode for live translation, the Pixel Buds also have a transcribe mode that continuously translates spoken language in your ear while displaying a transcript on your phone.\n\nThis news also comes after the outlet reported that Apple would deliver a major software overhaul across iPhones, iPads, and Macs.

            "content": "Apple will challenge a UK government demand to access encrypted customer data at a high court hearing in London on Friday.\n\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.\n\nThe appeal will be considered by the investigatory powers tribunal, which investigates claims the domestic intelligence services have acted unlawfully.\n\nWhat is the UK government asking Apple to do? The Home Office has issued a \u201ctechnical capability notice\u201d under the Investigatory Powers Act, which requires companies to assist law enforcement in providing evidence. The notice focuses on Apple\u2019s Advanced Data Protection service, which encrypts personal data uploaded and stored remotely in Apple\u2019s cloud servers. The Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more. The government wants Apple to provide the UK with the ability to access the content via a backdoor into the service.\n\nWhy is Apple objecting? Apple emphasises privacy as one of its \u201ccore values\u201d. In a submission to parliament last year it said the IPA gave the government the \u201cauthority to issue secret orders requiring providers to break encryption by inserting backdoors into their software products\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more. Apple removed the ADP tool, its strongest data protection product, from the UK last month. ADP deploys end-to-end encryption, which means only the account holder can decrypt the files. The iMessage and FaceTime services remain end-to-end encrypted. Apple said: \u201cAs we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.\u201d Two human rights groups, Liberty and Privacy International, have also said they will challenge the TCN. They pointed to reports that the TCN is a blanket request applying to any Apple user worldwide. This would create \u201ca back door to billions of people\u2019s personal data, including personal messages and documents, that could be accessed by hackers and oppressive governments,\u201d the groups say.\n\nCould Apple win the challenge? Apple is helped by the fact that the government\u2019s power to request the data must be compatible with protecting human rights, according to Dr Daniella Lock, a law lecturer at King\u2019s College London. Requesting a general backdoor to access encrypted data could be deemed disproportionate, she says, adding there could also be questions raised about safeguarding of the data by security agencies. The Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more. Lock adds that Apple\u2019s chances are hindered by the fact that hearings are held in secret, where the UK government is able to put its case behind closed doors \u2013 hindering the ability of Apple\u2019s lawyers to challenge the government\u2019s case. Courts tend to uphold levels of secrecy when national security is at stake, says Lock. \u201cApple\u2019s case is hindered by the secrecy surrounding the hearings,\u201d she adds. \u201cThe majority of the case looks set to take place behind closed doors. To the extent that the hearings are held in secret, Apple\u2019s lawyers will be severely limited in being able to challenge the UK government\u2019s evidence.\u201d The record for appeals when national security is concerned does not bode well for Apple. \u201cThe investigatory powers tribunal has also had a tendency to find in favour of the UK government, where it claims surveillance powers are necessary in the interests of national security,\u201d says Lock. A media campaign led by Computer Weekly, and supported by the Guardian, has said the hearing should be held in open court since the case is a matter of public interest and the appeal has already been leaked.\n\nDoes the US government support Apple? The US has made clear its unease with the UK government request. President Donald Trump said he confronted Keir Starmer over the move and compared it with Chinese government surveillance.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe told them you can\u2019t do this,\u201d Trump said in an interview with the Spectator magazine. \u201cWe actually told [Starmer] \u2026 that\u2019s incredible. That\u2019s something, you know, that you hear about with China.\u201d",

            "content": "I repeatedly told you during the iPhone 16 rumors season that I wanted two things from the model I\u2019d get and two things along. These were the phone\u2019s rumored signature features: Camera Control and Apple Intelligence.\n\nSix months and two iPhone 16 purchases later, I\u2019m disappointed that both signature features are massive flops. In hindsight, there\u2019s no point upgrading to any iPhone 16 model just for these two features alone. I say that as someone who used the iPhone 16 Plus for about two months, and is now on the iPhone 16 Pro Max.\n\nThe iPhone 16 is still a good piece of hardware and will stand the test of time. Whether you buy the cheapest iPhone 16e flavor or the most expensive iPhone 16 Pro Max, you\u2019re still getting a great device that could serve you for several years. But I\u2019m just sad to find that neither Camera Control nor Apple Intelligence are what I expected.\n\nThe only good things about Camera Control\n\nI didn\u2019t need to buy two iPhone 16 models to figure out the Camera Control button would not be as exciting in real life as it was in my mind.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nI\u2019ve been a longtime iPhone user who has always held the handset in my left hand. The iPhone 16 Plus showed me that the Camera Control button was unreachable. I needed to operate the device with two hands, so this defeated the purpose of getting to the camera app quickly.\n\nHowever, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is slightly thicker, so the Camera Control button is a lot easier to press with my ring or little fingers. Taking photos is still difficult, and forget about using the button to navigate the camera menus.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro\u2019s Camera Control button. Image source: Christian de Looper for BGR\n\nI will say that I\u2019ve been using the Camera Control button a lot more on the iPhone 16 Pro Max than on the Plus. I probably took close to a thousand photos on my recent marathon running trip, and I invoked the camera with the Camera Control button most of the time.\n\nBut I almost always tapped the screen to take a photo or used the Volume rockers.\n\nTherefore, the best thing about Camera Control is its fast access to the camera app. You can start the camera from any screen much faster than before, and that\u2019s a win.\n\nThen again, I could always employ the Action button for that. Just pair it with the Camera app so I can start the camera and take photos with my thumb.\n\nThe Camera Control also has Visual Intelligence attached to it, but before I tell you how bad Apple Intelligence is, I\u2019ll also say that Apple will bring Visual Intelligence support to the Action button on the iPhone 15 Pros. Camera Control button isn\u2019t required.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing good about Apple Intelligence\n\nApple Intelligence is an even bigger letdown than Camera Control, considering what just happened. Apple had to come out and say that the key feature of Apple Intelligence, the smarter Siri that will have access to all your on-device data and control apps, isn\u2019t coming this year, as we were told initially.\n\nWithout that Siri, Apple Intelligence has nothing interesting left. Even the built-in ChatGPT support isn\u2019t that exciting. I\u2019m a longtime ChatGPT user who\u2019d rather go for the iOS app rather than Siri to get to ChatGPT.\n\nRemember that Apple Intelligence features were not even available when the iPhone 16 phones launched. We had to wait a few weeks for the first ones to arrive. I\u2019m an iPhone user in Europe, so I got Apple Intelligence only a few weeks ago via the latest iOS 18 beta.\n\niOS 18.1 Apple Intelligence on iPhone 15 Pro: The all-new Siri design. Image source: Jos\u00e9 Adorno for BGR\n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting Apple Intelligence so soon, and my excitement quickly vanished when I realized there was absolutely nothing I wanted to use it for. Even Visual Intelligence isn\u2019t what I need, as it relies on ChatGPT or Google to get the job done. The smarter Siri wasn\u2019t here, and everything else was useless for this iPhone 16 user at this point in time.\n\nChatGPT covers a big part of my AI needs, and even there I still don\u2019t have access to all the recent novelties OpenAI launched in the past few months. That is, I use AI on the iPhone 16 all the time. I just do it via third-party standalone AI apps, where ChatGPT is my go-to AI tool.\n\nStill, when Apple Intelligence rolled out in Europe, I thought we were on the verge of getting the first beta of that smart Siri assistant. That was still exciting. Now that Apple had to practically admit that Siri is vaporware, Apple Intelligence has lost its appeal entirely. I might as well turn it off on my iPhone and pretend I still can\u2019t access it.",

Essentially, competing browsers were just a different wrapper around the same code.\n\nApple responded by allowing third-party browsers to use their own web engines, and also by offering users a choice of default web browser when setting up their phones.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened its own investigation and provisionally reached the same conclusion late last year.\n\nHowever, it also said that when Apple developed new features for its own browser engine, WebKit, it must make those available to other developers.\n\nApple responds to UK competition watchdog\n\nApple responded by stating that it couldn\u2019t afford to give away new web browsing features to other developers, as that would hamper its ability to innovate. Reuters reports on the iPhone maker\u2019s submission to the CMA.\n\nApple said it would \u201cnot be appropriate\u201d to mandate that access to future WebKit or that iOS features in use by Safari be provided free of charge, adding that developing features is a time and resource-intensive process. \u201cApple cannot recoup a reasonable amount of those expenses \u2026 to do so would have a chilling impact on Apple\u2019s incentives to innovate and would lead to free-riding and underinvestment on the part of third parties.\u201d\n\n9to5Mac\u2019s Take\n\nApple\u2019s claim that it can\u2019t afford to innovate under these conditions is, of course, silly. But the company does otherwise have a good point. Apple originally forced developers to use WebKit, the company arguing this was to keep the platform safe while competition regulators suggested it was so that competing browsers couldn\u2019t out-perform Safari.\n\nHaving now allowed developers to create their own browsing engines, opening up full competition for the first time, Apple is now being told that it must share its own browser improvements with its competitors.\n\nThe UK\u2019s CMA seemingly wants to have it both ways \u2013 genuine competition between browsers, but with Apple not allowed to win.\n\nPhoto by Joan Gamell on Unsplash",

Google\u2019s Android mobile ecosystem is also complicit in impeding competition, according to the CMA report, albeit to a lesser extent.\n\nThe issues flagged by the investigation include Apple requiring all browsers on iOS to run on its WebKit browser engine, giving Safari preferential access to features compared to competing WebKit-based browsers, limitations placed on in-app browsing, and having Safari pre-installed and prominently displayed as the default browser on iPhones. While users can change the default iPhone web browsing app, investigators say that Safari\u2019s designation as the pre-installed default on iPhones reduces user awareness of alternative apps.\n\nInvestigators found similar concerns regarding Chrome being pre-installed as the default web browser on the vast majority of Android devices. However, the report notes that both Apple and Google have taken steps to make it easier for users to switch to alternative browsers since the investigation announced its provisional findings in November, which have \u201caddressed some, but not all, of the concerns relating to choice architecture.\u201d\n\nThe investigation also found that revenue sharing arrangements that see Google paying Apple a significant share of search revenue in exchange for being the default search engine on iPhones was \u201csignificantly reducing their financial incentives to compete.\u201d\n\n\u201cApple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users,\u201d Apple spokesperson Julien Trosdorf told The Verge. \u201cWe have concerns with this report and believe the remedies it discusses would undermine privacy, security, and the overall user experience. We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA to best address their concerns.\u201d\n\nGoogle has yet to respond to our request for comment on the CMA\u2019s report.\n\nThe CMA has put forward potential remedies aimed at improving competition within the UK\u2019s mobile browser market, which include forcing Apple to allow developers to use alternative browser engines on iOS, requiring Apple and Google to offer a browser choice screen during device setup, and prohibiting the Chrome revenue sharing arrangements between the two companies. These suggestions are currently unenforceable, however, that could change in the coming months.\n\nIn January, the CMA launched separate investigations into Apple and Google\u2019s mobile ecosystems to decide whether to designate them as having strategic market status (SMS) under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act (DMCC). Much like the Digital Markets Act (DMA) law introduced by the European Union, the DMCC allows UK regulators to make select companies with \u201csubstantial and entrenched market power\u201d meet stricter antitrust requirements.\n\nSMS companies can be imposed with \u201cconduct requirements\u201d intended to address anticompetitive behavior, and risk fines of up to 10 percent of their annual turnover for violating DMCC rules. If Apple or Google are designated with SMS, the mobile browser investigation is encouraging the CMA to \u201cconsider imposing appropriate interventions,\u201d similar to the suggestions it outlined. The SMS investigations into Google and Apple are currently ongoing and expected to conclude later this year.\n\n\u201cFollowing our in-depth investigation, we have concluded that competition between different mobile browsers is not working well, and this is holding back innovation in the UK,\u201d said Margot Daly, Chair of the CMA\u2019s independent inquiry group. \u201cI welcome the CMA\u2019s prompt action to open strategic market status investigations into both Apple and Google\u2019s mobile ecosystems. The extensive analysis we\u2019ve set out today will help that work as it progresses.\u201d\n\nUpdate, March 13th: Added statement from Apple.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- For years, investors have talked of Apple Inc. as a potential port of safety in times of market turmoil. That hasn\u2019t been borne out this time around.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe iPhone maker has tumbled in recent sessions, extending its year-to-date underperformance amid a growing number of risks that are overshadowing its traditional high-quality characteristics.\n\nWhile Apple offers steady earnings growth and sits on a mountain of cash, headwinds form a daunting list for would-be bulls: it is heavily exposed to tariff uncertainty and China, its artificial intelligence offerings have repeatedly fizzled, and its lucrative partnership with Google parent Alphabet Inc. is potentially at risk. It trades at a premium to megacap tech peers despite slower revenue growth, suggesting that the haven case is harder to make for Apple.\n\n\u201cPeople like to park in Apple, but right now the stock is expensive, and not only is growth slow, but the catalysts for growth are absent,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like AI is doing much for it, the environment is very uncertain, and it is very at risk with tariffs and China. While it isn\u2019t as controversial as Tesla, it seems like it is just treading water, and it has been a while since we\u2019ve seen anything truly innovative from it.\u201d\n\nShares have dropped 13% this year, and are coming off their biggest three-day decline since November 2022, a selloff that took the stock to its lowest close since September. The Nasdaq 100 Index is down 6.7% in 2025, and Apple is responsible for nearly a fifth of that decline, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The CBOE Apple VIX, which tracks a market estimate of future volatility for the stock, has risen 56% off a February low.\n\nRecent volatility reflects rising geopolitical risk, especially with respect to tariffs. President Donald Trump recently doubled levies against China to 20%, a potentially significant development for Apple, which counts the country as both as a key manufacturing hub and a major market; it got about 17% of its fiscal 2024 revenue from the greater China region, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst Anurag Rana calculates that Apple faces a 100-150 basis point dent on operating margin and a 1-2% hit on sales growth if the surcharge carries on the full fiscal year.",

Like what you see? You can subscribe here.\n\nThe big story\n\nThe general consensus was that U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a successful meeting in Washington last month. What went wrong \u2014 and why is Apple caught in the middle?\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nTo get everyone up to speed \u2014 trade talks seem to be breaking down between the two countries ahead of the April 2 deadline when Trump's reciprocal tariffs on India are set to go into effect.\n\nTrump has long criticized India for its high tariffs, among the highest in Asia. Analysis from Barclays shows that the weighted average of India's tariffs on all imports is 11.5%. Another key concern for Washington is the widening U.S.-India trade deficit.\n\nLast week, India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal went to Washington to present further concessions, including slashing tariffs on key U.S. imports in the hopes that, in exchange, India would be granted an exemption from Washington's reciprocal tariffs. However, Trump's trade team doesn't seem to be budging, per sources close to New Delhi. That's raising alarm bells.\n\nThe technology industry stands to lose \u2014 particularly Apple which manufactures roughly 15% of its iPhones in India, according to Bank of America analyst estimates.\n\nFinished smartphones entering India currently face a 16%-20% tariff, whereas tariffs on Indian phones sold into the U.S. are at 0%, according to Barclays.\n\n\"If the Indian exports of smartphones, which have picked up recently \u2014 were to face similar tariffs in the U.S., it could deal an early life-cycle blow to the [Indian] electronics industry, reversing the entire China+1 narrative,\" according to Venugopal Garre, Bernstein's head of India research.\n\nGarre believes that the additional cost of tariffs will make Indian electronics, including the iPhones manufactured in the country, less competitive compared to devices manufactured in other countries.\n\nRejuvenating India's manufacturing sector\n\nBank of America analysts also believe that proposed tariffs on India will likely drive iPhones prices up.\n\nThis matters. Apple has been the poster child of India's manufacturing revitalization, seen by many as a case study for how a foreign company can win in the country. Goyal referenced Apple's success when pitching U.S. semiconductor companies to expand into India.\n\nNvidia is currently working with India's Reliance Industries on AI research, while AMD and Micron have pledged to expand in India. Apple CEO Tim Cook, who has cultivated a strong relationship with Modi, went to the country for the opening of four retail stores in 2023.\n\nIndia has played an important role in helping Apple diversify its supply chain and become less dependent on China. In addition to iPhones, it has begun manufacturing other products in the emerging market, including iPads and AirPods.\n\n\"45% of Apple's total revenue is built in China, but they want to get that down to the 30% level,\" said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, to CNBC over the phone. However, experts said higher tariffs could challenge Apple's expansion and reduce the company's overall return on investment in India.\n\n\"My guess is that Apple would want to send a message to New Delhi to motivate them to negotiate and push for an equal tariff structure,\" said Patrick Moorhead, a senior technology executive and co-founder of TheSixFiveMedia.\n\nCNBC reached out to Apple for comment and has not heard back.\n\nMoorhead has been studying Apple's supply chain and believes it does have the ability to shift some manufacturing between its Asian manufacturing locations across India, China and Vietnam, should it need to do so.\n\nAt this point, the only country that is more insulated from tariffs would be Vietnam, which is likely due to the low trade imbalance between the U.S. and Vietnam, Moorhead told CNBC over the phone.\n\nMinimizing impact of tariffs\n\nThere are other options.\n\nWhen looking at potential strategies technology companies can use to limit the impact of China tariffs, analysts at Morgan Stanley write that one alternative is to ship \"U.S.-bound near finished goods from China to a 3rd party country before declaring the goods finalized.\"\n\nThe same could apply to India.\n\nIf the trade war picks up speed, technology companies may also be incentivized to not just explore diversifying their supply chain into one to two additional countries, but three or four, to ensure they can pivot as needed. It's certainly a big undertaking. Setting up shop in a new country can take three to five years. As supply chain experts shared with CNBC, it takes time to set up a new plant, build relationships with local suppliers and hire the right talent, all while getting the required clearances from the local government.\n\nHowever, with tariffs increasingly becoming an economic weapon of choice, multinationals like Apple may have to use their pile of cash to spread out their manufacturing footprint even more than they have already. China+1 may need to be changed to China+3.\n\nThat could mean that Apple produces fewer phones in India than previously estimated.\n\nSupply chain flexibility, while expensive, could be the key to weathering the tariff storm for Apple. What that does to India's ambitions of being the go-to destination for companies looking to move away from China is another matter altogether.\n\nNeed to know\n\nInflation in India drops more than expected in February. The country's consumer price index came in at 3.61% on an annual basis, the country's Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation said Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 3.98% for the period. This is first time since last summer that inflation has come in below the Reserve Bank of India's target of 4% and marks the lowest monthly print since July 2024.\n\nBenefits of listing on India's National Stock Exchange. Entrepreneurs or startup founders should seize India's advantages and list on India's National Stock Exchange, the bourse's CEO Ashish Kumar Chauhan said at CNBC's CONVERGE LIVE event in Singapore on Wednesday. India is in a place where there's \"a lot of brains, a lot of enterprise and very little capital is required,\" he said, and pointed out that the Indian market had the largest number of listings in the world in 2024.\n\nIndusInd Bank urges calm after spotting accounting discrepancy. The lender informed Indian exchanges on March 10 that it had discovered during an internal review issues regarding positions on derivatives trading. As a result of the lapse, the bank estimates that its net worth will take a 2.5% hit. However, IndusInd reassured investors it is still well capitalized, causing shares to rebound on Wednesday after plunging Tuesday.\n\nWhat happened in the markets?\n\nIndian stocks continued their gains this week.\n\nAs of 11.15 a.m. local time on March 13, the benchmark Nifty 50 index had risen 0.21% while the broader Sensex index was 0.15% higher.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield edged down slightly to 6.708%.\n\nOn CNBC TV this week, Pramod Gubbi, founder of Marcellus Investment Managers, thinks the Indian government's tax cuts in its recent Union Budget are not \"meaningful enough to move the needle\" on Indian consumption stocks. That's partly because the country experienced \"a good three years of strong consumption growth\" after the pandemic, fueled by bank loans to retail firms and consumers, which led to leveraged spending Gubbi said. Hence, consumers are saving more to pay off that debt and pulling back on expenditures.\n\nMeanwhile, Maersk North America President Charles van der Steene tells CNBC's Lori Ann LaRocco that \"tariffs will never disrupt the supply chain.\" While trade barriers may affect one aspect of the global supply chain, there will be other countries stepping in to make up for that disruption. India, in particular, will retain its importance within the global supply chain because the South Asian nation provides companies with production capacity as firms diversify away from China because of Trump tariffs.\n\nWhat's happening next week?\n\nIndia releases data on its wholesale price index for February on Monday, and market watchers will hope it comes in cooler than expected, like the month's consumer price index. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve concludes its meeting on Wednesday, during which it is expected to hold interest rates steady.\n\nMarch 14: India balance of trade for February, U.S. University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Survey for March, U.K. gross domestic product for January\n\nMarch 17: India wholesale price index for February, China industrial production and retail sales for January to February, U.S. retail sales for February\n\nMarch 19: U.S. interest rate decision, Euro zone consumer price index for February\n\nMarch 20: China one- and five-year loan prime rate decision, U.K. interest rate decision",

But with forecasts already pointing to the most significant overhaul to the iPhone software in a dozen years, you can understand why people are eager to figure out what Apple has planned.\n\nJust what exactly is coming to your iPhone via iOS 19? We've combed over the latest iOS 19 rumors to highlight the biggest expected changes that are in the works. This isn't a complete list, as details about iOS 19 should continue to trickle out between now and the official preview of the software update. But as of right now, here's what you can expect from iOS 19.\n\nAn interface overhaul\n\n(Image credit: Front Page Tech / YouTube)\n\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman has led the way on most of what we know about iOS 19 at this point, and he's claiming that big changes are on the way for how the operating system looks and runs. Along with similar updates to iPad and Mac software coming this year, iOS 19 \"will fundamentally change the look of the operating systems and make Apple\u2019s various software platforms more consistent, according to people familiar with the effort,\" Gurman said.\n\nSo what does that mean in practical terms? The answer appears to be new looks for the styles Apple uses for iOS icons, menus, apps, windows and system buttons. The nature of those changes remains a mystery, but it sounds like the focus is going to be on making your phone easier to navigate, thanks to the new look.\n\nBased on reports, iOS 19 could be taking its cues from visionOS, the software that powers Apple's Vision Pro headset. And as Gurman noted, those changes are also coming to iPads and Macs to deliver a more unified experience across Apple's different hardware offerings.\n\nRecent iOS updates have introduced significant new features, but left the basic look of the software the same, save for some tweaks here and there. You'd have to go back to 2013's iOS 7 release to find the last time Apple overhauled the interface of its operating system, with that update introducing flatter icons, new animations and other visual changes.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

A button lets you toggle between still images and video capture, which you tap to bring options such as shooting modes and other settings.\n\nRumors of a Vision Pro-inspired Camera app redesign have sprung up before \u2014 ahead of last year's iOS 18 launch, to be specific. That could indicate this is a project Apple's been working on for a while.\n\nA Siri revamp\n\n(Image credit: Apple)\n\nNo, you're right \u2014 this was supposed to happen in iOS 18, or at least that's what Apple was promising at last year's WWDC, when Apple Intelligence received its initial preview. And to be fair, Apple has made some changes to Siri \u2014 you can correct yourself when speaking to the assistant, interrupt Siri to ask another question and even ask follow-ups without confusing the assistant.\n\nBut bigger features like Siri have more control over apps and being better able to understand the context of your on-screen content are still missing. It was thought they were going to appear in iOS 18.4, but Apple recently announced a delay, possibly into 2026, which could have some Siri capabilities not reaching your iPhone until iOS 20.\n\nWhat's reportedly on tap is a plan to develop a Siri LLM that merges the different versions of Siri currently operating on your phone. According to a Bloomberg report from last year, of the two versions of Siri on board your phone, one handles the well-established commands like setting timers, sending texts and answering general knowledge questions. The other takes on more complex tasks that are part of Apple Intelligence.\n\n9to5Mac suggests that iOS 19 could unite those different forms of Siri into one, which would mean faster response times and, ideally, a more conversational relationship between you and your phone's assistant.\n\nApple might also be looking to replace the ChatGPT integration it added with Apple Intelligence in iOS 18.2 with a chatbot of its own. That's consistent with Apple's stated privacy aims, which include keeping as many AI tasks on device as possible.\n\nThe time frame for any Siri improvements is somewhat up in the air, as you can imagine. This could be one of those situations where promised improvements don't appear in the initial iOS release in the fall, rolling out as a subsequent update later on \u2014 hence the suggestion that some Siri upgrades may not arrive until next year.\n\nOther Apple Intelligence changes (or none at all)\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide / Shutterstock)\n\nGiven how new Apple Intelligence is and how eager Apple is to make AI part of the sales pitch for its iPhones, you'd imagine that iOS 19 would bring additional capabilities to Apple Intelligence-compatible phones. But things might not be so straightforward.\n\nIn a report on the setbacks Apple was encountering on the AI front, Bloomberg's Gurman wrote that delays may have a ripple effect on iOS 19 features. \"Everything I\u2019ve heard suggests that iOS 19 will not include any significant consumer-facing changes to Apple Intelligence,\" he wrote.\n\nIf that seems an odd development \u2014 Apple Intelligence has been a big part of the iOS 18 story, so it'd be shocking for Apple not to build on those AI features in some way \u2014 that's not the only rumblings about some planned features being sidelined. Last year, a report claimed that Apple would be postponing a number of planned iOS 19 features, though once again that could mean they show up later on in the process as iOS 19 updates.\n\niOS 19 iPhone support\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nThere's some good news if you've got an older iPhone that can still run iOS 18. A French news site reports that the same devices supporting Apple's current iOS will also be able to upgrade to iOS 19.\n\nSpecifically, that would extend iOS 19 support back to the iPhone XR and iPhone XS/XS Max. Those phones, plus every model released since the fall of 2018, would be covered.\n\nThat's not to say those older phones will support every feature. Even iOS 18 requires certain chipsets for some capabilities to work. And as before, you'll likely need an iPhone with an A17 Pro chip or later to run Apple Intelligence features \u2014 whatever those might wind up being in iOS 19.",

            "content": "Key Takeaways Apple shares remained under pressure on Wednesday, bucking a broader rally for tech stocks, amid concerns about the delayed rollout of Siri AI features and the impact of tariffs.\n\nThe stock has staged a decisive breakdown below a symmetrical triangle and the closely watched 200-day moving average this week on above-average volume.\n\nThe stock is poised to breach the major support level of $219 on Wednesday. If selling continues, investors should monitor key support areas around $207 and $197.\n\nIf the stock rallies, investors should watch key overhead areas at $237 and $247.\n\nApple (AAPL) shares remained under pressure on Wednesday, bucking a broader rally for tech stocks.\n\nShares in the iPhone maker have come under heavy selling pressure this week following news that the company is delaying the rollout of several AI features to Siri, which analysts argue could dent iPhone sales. The threat of looming tariffs also continues to weigh on sentiment amid growing concerns that import duties imposed by the Trump administration could eat into the company\u2019s gross margins, given it manufactures the majority of its devices in China.\n\nApple shares, which experienced their biggest one-day drop in two-and-a-half years on Monday, have fallen 17% since hitting a record high in December. The stock was down 2.2% at $216 in late trading Wednesday.\n\nBelow, we take a closer look at Apple\u2019s chart and use technical analysis to identify major price levels worth watching out for.\n\nSymmetrical Triangle Breakdown\n\nAfter setting a record high in late December, Apple shares consolidated within a symmetrical triangle before staging a decisive breakdown below the pattern and closely watched 200-day moving average this week.\n\nImportantly, above-average volume has accompanied the move lower, indicating selling conviction by larger market participants.\n\nWhile the relative strength index (RSI) confirms bearish price momentum with a reading below 50, the indicator sits near oversold territory, a region that has for several years provided attractive tactical trading opportunities in the stock.\n\nLet\u2019s locate major support levels to watch amid the possibility for further selling and also identify several key overhead areas to monitor if the stock resumes it longer-term uptrend.\n\nMajor Support Levels to Watch\n\nEntering Wednesday's session, the $219 level was an area where the stock was expected to find support from a trendline that connects a range of similar price points on the chart between June last year and January this year. The stock had fallen below this location in intraday trading on Tuesday, but it reclaimed the area by yesterday\u2019s close.\n\nSelling below this level could see the shares fall to around $207. This region may attract buying interest near last year\u2019s late June pullback low that formed within a broader uptrend that played out in the stock between April and July.\n\nA more significant drop could bring lower support at the $197 level into play, an area where investors may seek entry points near the prominent December 2023 peak and August 2024 trough. This location on the chart also roughly aligns with a measured move price target, which calculates the depth of the symmetrical triangle and deducts that amount from the pattern\u2019s breakdown area. For instance, deducting $36 from $235 projects a downside target of $199.\n\nKey Overhead Areas to Monitor\n\nThe first overhead area to monitor sits around $237. A retest of this level finds a confluence of resistance from the symmetrical triangle\u2019s lower trendline and two key peaks that formed on the chart in October and July last year.\n\nFinally, buying above this region could see Apple shares climb to the $247 area, a location on the chart where they may run into selling pressure near the symmetrical triangle\u2019s top trendline, which also closely corresponds with last month\u2019s peak and a mid-December retracement low.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

This new pledge builds on Apple\u2019s long history of investing in American innovation and advanced high-skilled manufacturing, and will support a wide range of initiatives that focus on artificial intelligence, silicon engineering, and skills development for students and workers across the country.\n\nArizona is one of nine states where Apple specified plans to invest the more than $500 billion in new U.S. funding over the next four years. The company plans to hire 20,000 more employees as it increases investment in advanced technologies.\n\n\u201cWe are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we\u2019re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country\u2019s future,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO. \u201cFrom doubling our Advanced Manufacturing Fund, to building advanced technology in Texas, we\u2019re thrilled to expand our support for American manufacturing. And we\u2019ll keep working with people and companies across this country to help write an extraordinary new chapter in the history of American innovation.\u201d\n\nMORE NEWS: Phoenix bucket list: 25 things you must do\n\nINDUSTRY INSIGHTS: Want more news like this? Get our free newsletter here\n\nAs part of this package of U.S. investments, Apple and partners will open a new advanced manufacturing facility in Houston to produce servers that support Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that helps users write, express themselves, and get things done. Apple will also double its U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund, create an academy in Michigan to train the next generation of U.S. manufacturers, and grow its research and development investments in the U.S. to support cutting-edge fields like silicon engineering.\n\nThe $500 billion commitment includes Apple\u2019s work with thousands of suppliers across all 50 states, direct employment, Apple Intelligence infrastructure and data centers, corporate facilities, and Apple TV+ productions in 20 states. Apple remains one of the largest U.S. taxpayers, having paid more than $75 billion in U.S. taxes over the past five years, including $19 billion in 2024 alone.\n\nToday, Apple supports more than 2.9 million jobs across the country through direct employment, work with U.S.-based suppliers and manufacturers, and developer jobs in the thriving iOS app economy.\n\nOpening a New Manufacturing Facility in Houston\n\nAs part of its new U.S. investments, Apple will work with manufacturing partners to begin production of servers in Houston later this year. A 250,000-square-foot server manufacturing facility, slated to open in 2026, will create thousands of jobs.\n\nPreviously manufactured outside the U.S., the servers that will soon be assembled in Houston play a key role in powering Apple Intelligence, and are the foundation of Private Cloud Compute, which combines powerful AI processing with the most advanced security architecture ever deployed at scale for AI cloud computing. The servers bring together years of R&D by Apple engineers, and deliver the industry-leading security and performance of Apple silicon to the data center.\n\nTeams at Apple designed the servers to be incredibly energy efficient, reducing the energy demands of Apple data centers \u2014 which already run on 100 percent renewable energy. As Apple brings Apple Intelligence to customers across the U.S., it also plans to continue expanding data center capacity in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona, and Nevada.\n\nApple boosts advanced manufacturing in Arizona\n\nAs part of this new investment, Apple is doubling its U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund, which was created in 2017 to support world-class innovation and high-skilled manufacturing jobs across America. The growing commitment will increase the fund from $5 billion to $10 billion, focused on promoting advanced manufacturing and skills development throughout the country.\n\nThe fund\u2019s expansion includes a multibillion-dollar commitment from Apple to produce advanced silicon in TSMC\u2019s Fab 21 facility in Arizona. Apple is the largest customer at this state-of-the-art facility, which employs more than 2,000 workers to manufacture the chips in the United States. Mass production of Apple chips began last month.\n\nSilicon used by Apple is designed to bring Apple users incredible features, performance, and power efficiency across their devices. Apple\u2019s suppliers already manufacture silicon in 24 factories across 12 states, including Arizona, Colorado, Oregon, and Utah. The company\u2019s investments in the sector help create thousands of high-paying jobs across the country at U.S. companies like Broadcom, Texas Instruments, Skyworks, and Qorvo.\n\nTo date, Apple\u2019s U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund has supported projects in 13 states \u2014 including Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Indiana \u2014 that have helped build local businesses, train workers, and create a wide range of innovative manufacturing processes and materials for Apple products.\n\nGrowing R&D Investments Across the U.S.\n\nApple continues to expand its R&D across the U.S. In the past five years, Apple has nearly doubled its U.S.-based advanced R&D spend, and it will continue to accelerate its growth.\n\nRecently, Apple announced the newest addition to its iPhone lineup, iPhone 16e. iPhone 16e delivers fast, smooth performance and breakthrough battery life, thanks to the industry-leading efficiency of the A18 chip and the new Apple C1 \u2014 the first cellular modem designed by Apple, and the most power-efficient modem ever on an iPhone. Apple C1 adds a new chapter to the story of Apple silicon and is the result of years of R&D investment, bringing together the work of thousands of engineers. Apple C1 is the start of a long-term strategy that will allow Apple to innovate and optimize the modem system for additional Apple products.\n\nIn the next four years, Apple plans to hire around 20,000 people, including new jobs in Arizona, of which the vast majority will be focused on R&D, silicon engineering, software development, and AI and machine learning. The expanded commitment includes significant investment in Apple\u2019s R&D hubs across the country. This includes growing teams across the U.S. focused on areas including custom silicon, hardware engineering, software development, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.\n\nSupporting American Businesses with a New Manufacturing Academy in Detroit\n\nTo help companies transition to advanced manufacturing, Apple will open the Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit. Apple engineers, along with experts from top universities such as Michigan State, will consult with small- and medium-sized businesses on implementing AI and smart manufacturing techniques. The academy will also offer free in-person and online courses, with a skills development curriculum that teaches workers vital skills like project management and manufacturing process optimization. The courses will help drive productivity, efficiency, and quality in companies\u2019 supply chains.\n\nApple has long been committed to investing in education and skills development for American workers and students. That includes ongoing and expanding grant programs for organizations like 4-H, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and FIRST, which work closely with Apple in communities across the country to create free programming that helps young people learn vital skills like coding.\n\nApple\u2019s support for the next generation of innovators also includes efforts like the company\u2019s New Silicon Initiative, which prepares students for careers in hardware engineering and silicon chip design. Last year, this program expanded to students at Georgia Tech, and it now reaches students at eight schools across the country. Apple is continuing to expand the initiative, including a new collaboration with UCLA\u2019s Center for Education of Microchip Designers (CEMiD) beginning this year.",

            "content": "If you tried to break up with Apple Intelligence, it's not getting the message. Apple's latest iOS 18.3.2 update patches a security issue -- that's good -- but in the process enables Apple Intelligence automatically, even if you'd previously turned it off. The same applies to iPad OS 18.3.2 and MacOS Sequoia 15.3.2.\n\nI won't hold it against you if you want to pass on Apple's AI tech for now. It is, after all, still technically in beta -- which is no doubt why it's annoying that Apple Intelligence is getting turned back on. Message summaries can be dodgy, generated images are unpredictable and the promised leap in Siri's capabilities has been officially pushed back.\n\nTurning off Apple Intelligence is easy, though, whether you're disabling the whole thing or selectively switching off individual features.\n\nSee also: Did a well-meaning friend send you a message about Apple Intelligence possibly reading your private information? It's not -- I explain what's actually going on.\n\nWhy turn off Apple Intelligence in the first place?\n\nSince the first Apple Intelligence features rolled out in iOS 18.1, some people have chosen to opt out of the new technology. Tools such as Image Playground, Genmoji and message summaries can use up to 7GB of your device's internal storage -- a sizable chunk, especially if you tend to run against the upper limit of its free space.\n\nEven if storage is not an issue, you just may not be interested in Apple's set of AI features. According to a new survey by SellCell, 73% of Apple users think AI adds little to no value to the experience. In a separate survey, CNET found that 25% of smartphone owners aren't interested at all.\n\nOr, honestly, you may not want to deal with features that are creating inaccurate summaries or that can be replicated without Apple Intelligence.\n\nThe trainer killed someone? Screenshot by Nelson Aguilar/CNET\n\nThe good news is that it's easy to turn off Apple Intelligence entirely. Or if you'd prefer to pick and choose, you can selectively disable some of the features. Doing so also lets you reclaim the storage it's using.\n\nIs Apple Intelligence really ready to be on by default?\n\nI'm not an AI crank -- I appreciate features such as notification summaries and the Clean Up tool in the Photos app. And yet, Apple Intelligence is also a work in progress, an evolving set of features that Apple is heavily hyping while gradually developing. I wouldn't hold it against you if you wanted to not be distracted or feel like you're doing Apple's testing for them (that's what the developer and public betas are for).\n\nRemember that Apple Intelligence works only on the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16, iPhone 16E, iPhone 16 Pro or M-series Macs and iPads (plus the newest iPad mini).\n\nHere's what you need to know about disabling it.\n\nWatch this: Does Apple Think We're Stupid? Apple Intelligence Ads Say Yes 06:15\n\nHow to see the amount of storage Apple Intelligence is using\n\nIf you're concerned about the storage requirements of Apple Intelligence, you can find out how much the system is using by going to Settings > General > iPhone (or iPad) Storage > iOS (or iPadOS).\n\nSee how much space Apple Intelligence is using in Settings. Screenshots by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nNote that even after turning off Apple Intelligence, that storage still shows up in the iOS Storage list. However, I was able to confirm that if the phone's storage fills up and the system needs that now-inactive space, iOS reclaims what it needs.\n\nOnce I filled my iPhone's storage, the inactive Apple Intelligence data was purged to accommodate the added files, dropping from 5.89GB to 2.87GB. Screenshots by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nHow to turn off Apple Intelligence entirely (iPhone, iPad and Mac)\n\nOpen Settings (iPhone or iPad) or System Settings (Mac) and choose Apple Intelligence & Siri. Then turn off the Apple Intelligence option. Confirm your choice in the dialog that appears by tapping Turn Off Apple Intelligence.\n\nTurn off Apple Intelligence entirely with one switch. Screenshots by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nHere's what you lose:\n\n(Curiously, the Clean Up tool in Photos sticks around even when Apple Intelligence is turned off, perhaps because the first time you use it the app downloads resources for it and holds onto them.)\n\nHow to turn off individual Apple Intelligence features\n\nMaybe you're finding some Apple Intelligence features helpful while others are annoying (or just highly amusing). You can turn off specific features in the settings for apps to which they apply.\n\nFor example, to disable text summaries in Messages notifications, go to Settings > Apps > Messages and switch off the Summarize Messages option.\n\nTurn off Messages summaries while still using other Apple Intelligence features. Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nSome features are not as app-specific. Writing Tools, which use Apple Intelligence to proof or rewrite text, appear as an option when you select text, regardless of the app. To turn that off, you need to disable Apple Intelligence system-wide.\n\nAlso note that nearly every app includes an Apple Intelligence & Siri option in Settings, with a Learn from this App option (turned on by default). That applies just to whether Apple Intelligence and Siri can monitor how you use it to make suggestions; it doesn't affect any particular Apple Intelligence features.\n\nHow to turn off Apple Intelligence features in Screen Time settings\n\nAnother option for restricting what Apple Intelligence can do is buried in the Screen Time settings. Screen Time is designed to control which apps and features can run on another device, such as the iPhone used by a child in your household. But it's also helpful for tracking how much time you're spending on the device and, in this case, turning off some components of Apple Intelligence.\n\nOpen the Settings app and go to Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions. Turn on the Content & Privacy Restrictions option if it's not already enabled. If this is the first time you're flipping this switch, don't worry -- everything is allowed by default. Tap Intelligence & Siri. Tap on the following three features and decide whether to allow or don't allow their use: Image Creation (such as Image Playground and Genmoji), Writing Tools and the ChatGPT Extension (which uses ChatGPT to process requests that are beyond the built-in Apple Intelligence capabilities).\n\nTurn off selected Apple Intelligence features in the Screen Time settings.

            "content": "Apple's newest AirPods are all on sale today, which means you can score great savings regardless of the budget you're aiming for. Starting with the highest end model, the second generation Apple AirPods Pro wireless noise-canceling earbuds is $169.99 shipped (normally $240). The next step down, the Apple AirPods 4 with ANC (active noise cancelation) is down to $148.99 (normally $179). Finally, the value-packed AirPods 4 without ANC drops to $99.99 (normally $129). iPhone users, these are without a doubt the best earbuds to pair with your smartphone.\n\nThe AirPods Pro is the best-sounding \"truly wireless\" earbuds for iPhone users thanks to its passively isolating in-ear design combined with excellent active noise cancelation, low-distortion driver and amp, and the Apple H2 chip. It also has useful features like Adaptive Transparency Mode, which lets you better hear your surroundings without removing your earbuds, and Conversation Mode, which automatically enhances the voices of people you're talking to. The second generation AirPods Pro replaces the Lightning port with a more universal USB Type-C port so you don't have to mix and match cables, and also includes a MagSafe charging case as standard.\n\nThe Apple AirPods 4 was released on September, 2024 in two variants: both models are mostly identical with the exception of the noise canceling functionality on the more expensive one. The AirPods 4 features several updates over the AirPods 3 which brings it in-line with modern day standards. These improvements include the newer Apple H2 chip (vs H1), Bluetooth 5.3 support (vs Bluetooth 5.0), better IP54 resistance rating which now protects against dust intrustion (vs IPX4), USB Type-C (vs Lightning), and replacement of the skin detect sensor with a more reliable optical in-ear sensor.\n\nShould you get the AirPods Pro over AirPods 4 with ANC?\n\nThe AirPods Pro is a superior earbud, which is why it retails for $70 more than the AirPods 4 ANC. Both feature active noise cancelation, but the AirPods Pro produces better sound quality and more effective noise canceling because of its design. The AirPods 4 ANC is an open-ear style earbud with non-adjustable tips. They're designed to sit right outside of the ear which \u2013 while comfortable \u2013 means you get plenty of sound leakage and ambient noise intrusion.\n\nOn the other hand, the AirPods Pro is an in-ear style of earbud that sits right inside your ear canal, sealing the passage and passively isolating it from the ambient air. Adjustable tips are included to accomodate different sized ears and ensure you get that proper sealing fit, which is very important to squeeze out the best performance. At this price, the only compelling reason to still go for the AirPods 4 ANC is if you don't like the intrusive nature of in-ear style earbuds in general.\n\nWhy Should You Trust IGN's Deals Team?

Filmed in Mexico City during the sold-out second-year finale of the band\u2019s M72 World Tour, Metallica features full performances of three longtime staples from the band\u2019s stadium-filling live shows \u2014 \u201cWhiplash,\u201d \u201cOne,\u201d and \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d \u2014 and was captured exclusively in Apple Immersive Video. This remarkable storytelling format is only possible on Apple Vision Pro, with ultra-high-resolution 180-degree video and Spatial Audio to give viewers unprecedented access to James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo \u2014 from vantage points as close up as the famed Snake Pit, to wide-angle views of the band\u2019s energetic performance in the round.\n\nCustomers can book an Apple Vision Pro demo at their local Apple Store to experience the magic of spatial computing, and enjoy an extended preview of Metallica beginning this Friday. Users can also enjoy the band\u2019s performance with a new EP, M72 World Tour: Mexico City, available in Spatial Audio on Apple Music this Friday.\n\n\u201cGame changing is putting it lightly,\u201d said Lars Ulrich of Metallica. \u201cSeeing our concert like that, along with the energy of the Mexico City fans \u2014 it\u2019s very immersive, and it\u2019s super fun. We\u2019ve always been interested in pushing the boundaries, and Metallica on Apple Vision Pro is exactly that.\u201d\n\n\u201cApple Immersive Video transforms the way people experience storytelling, and we\u2019re thrilled to collaborate with Metallica on a concert unlike any before it,\u201d said Tor Myhren, Apple\u2019s vice president of Marketing Communications. \u201cWith Metallica on Apple Vision Pro, you feel like you\u2019re right there: front row, backstage, and even on stage with one of the biggest bands of all time.\u201d\n\nTo capture the band\u2019s full performance from multiple perspectives, and the energy of over 65,000 passionate Metallica fans, Apple built a custom stage layout featuring 14 Apple Immersive Video cameras using a mix of stabilized cameras, cable-suspended cameras, and remote-controlled camera dolly systems that moved around the stage.\n\nMetallica drummer Lars Ulrich spoke with Apple Music\u2019s Zane Lowe about the Apple Immersive concert experience, the band\u2019s enduring commitment to their fans, and the next leg of the band\u2019s M72 World Tour at SXSW 2025 this afternoon. \u201cI\u2019ve been a music fan my whole life, and I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this,\u201d said Lowe. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the best seat in the house \u2014 it\u2019s like you\u2019re in the only seat on stage.\u201d Their full conversation will be available on the SXSW YouTube channel.\n\nMore Episodes and Films Available in Apple Immersive Video\n\nUsers can enjoy more Apple Immersive Video only on Apple Vision Pro, including new episodes of the Adventure and Boundless series.

            "content": "i've been devoted to the MacBook Air since 2012, when I bought my first one with money I saved up from a summer job before my first semester of college. (You can read more about that journey here.) As someone always working on the go, I've always been drawn to how lightweight it is. When Apple revamped it back in 2022 with a new design, bigger and brighter display, MagSafe support, and a 1080p webcam, I was thrilled\u2014this was my dream MacBook come to life.\n\nBut as I said in last year's review, the 13-inch MacBook Air has reached its peak in terms of design. Apple continues to release the same model while mainly focusing on the internals\u2014and the same logic applies to this latest version. The standout features are the M4 chip (the entry-level chip of the lineup) and double the base memory (also available on its predecessor). Apple did throw in an updated 12-megapixel webcam and a new blue color option, but aside from that, the chassis remains the same.\n\nTypically, when a next-generation model lacks any major additions, Apple keeps the price the same as previous versions. This time, however, the price sees a welcome reduction to $999\u2014$100 less than its predecessors. It's what the MacBook Air cost before the launch of the M2 model (Apple did sell the M2-powered MacBook Air for $999 once the M3 Air came out, but the M4 replaces both models). So, that means the highest configuration will cost $2,199.\n\nAlthough there are still a few additional things I had on my wish list for this next-gen version (a nano-texture glass option being one of them), the MacBook Air with M4 continues to live up to its reputation as a reliable, lightweight machine and the best MacBook for most people. The fact that it's as affordable as it used to be is the cherry on top.\n\nPhotograph: Brenda Stolyar\n\nSubtle Alterations\n\nAs with previous generations, the 13-inch MacBook Air has a square chassis, a big and bright 13.6-inch LCD panel (complete with a 60-Hz refresh rate), a four-speaker sound system, and a three-mic array. Coming in at 2.7 pounds, it also remains super lightweight and comfortable to commute with. You'll also get the same port selection, which includes two USB 4/Thunderbolt ports, a MagSafe charging port, and a 3.5-mm headphone jack.\n\nI fully understand that an extensive port selection is usually reserved for the MacBook Pro, but I truly wanted Apple to add at least one extra USB-C port here\u2014especially since you can connect the MacBook Air to up to two external monitors (we'll get to that later). Instead, you'll have to use a chunky USB-C hub, which is just another accessory you'll have to buy (if you don't already have one) and carry around.",

            "content": "A year ago, we called the M3 version of the MacBook Air \"just about as good as laptops get.\"\n\nThe \"as good as laptops get\" part was about the qualitative experience of using the laptop, which was (and is) good-enough-to-great at just about everything a general-purpose laptop needs to be able to do. The \"just about\" part was mainly about the cost because to be happy with it long-term, it was a good idea for just about everybody to spend an extra $200 upgrading it from 8GB to 16GB of RAM. Apple also kept the M2 version of the Air in the lineup to hit its $999 entry-level price point; the M3 cost $100 extra.\n\nApple fixed the RAM problem last fall when it increased the minimum amount of RAM across the entire Mac lineup from 8GB to 16GB without increasing prices. Though Apple probably did it to help enable additional Apple Intelligence features down the line, nearly anything you do with your Mac will eventually benefit from extra memory, whether you're trying to use Photoshop or Logic Pro or even if you're just opening more than a couple of dozen browser tabs at once.\n\nThe new M4 Air also starts with 16GB of RAM. And Apple is launching it at $999 ($1,199 for the 15-inch), ditching the M2 and M3 versions of the Air. It's hard not to be impressed with a laptop that addresses our two biggest substantive complaints about the previous version.\n\nThe laptop is still expensive, insofar as it is still a $1,000 laptop. But Apple is selling a laptop for $999 that would have cost you $1,399 a year ago. In a time of constantly rising prices, that's a pretty rare thing.\n\nThe MacBook Air, again\n\nThe Air's keyboard and trackpad are comfortable and functional. Credit: Andrew Cunningham\n\nThis is the third iteration of the MacBook Air's M2-era refresh. Apple originally introduced the design in the middle of 2022, and it was joined by a similar 15-inch iteration in the summer of 2023. For owners of Intel or M1 Airs or any other laptop, here's a brief recap: Apple got rid of the Air's tapered design for this one, in favor of a laptop that's still thin but has a uniform thickness throughout (0.44 inches for the 13-inch Air, 0.45 inches for the 15-inch model).",

            "content": "2025\n\nWill somebody please tell me if the new Apple MacBook Air M4\u2019s \u201cSky Blue\u201d color is blue or just a cold shade of gray? I have tipped over the edge of delirium staring at Apple\u2019s latest laptop refresh in different lights, hoping to determine its actual hue. Compared to the all-business MacBook Pro, the Air should be the fun one, shouldn\u2019t it? Apple is pushing its best bang-for-buck MacBook yet, and still, the company can\u2019t let go of certain design decisions, even when we\u2019re all begging Apple for something novel or\u2014hell\u2014anything as simple as a truly blue MacBook.\n\nMacBook Air M4 The 2025 version of the MacBook Air now starts at its most attractive price point for the best performance yet. Just don't expect something so different than previous versions. See at Amazon Pros Sizable performance uplift from M2 and even from M3\n\nSizable performance uplift from M2 and even from M3 Solid display and sound on 13-inch model\n\nSolid display and sound on 13-inch model Starting $1,000 price point is a solid grab for the average user Cons A cold silver color is not \"sky blue\"\n\nA cold silver color is not \"sky blue\" Lid is prone to getting marked even during normal use\n\nLid is prone to getting marked even during normal use The notch is still there, despite our pleas\n\nTaking on a new MacBook Air for review is like slipping into a warm pair of my favorite pajamas. There\u2019s a sense of comfort in the familiar. If all you want is a solid MacBook with good performance at its lowest starting price yet, this is it. At base, the MacBook Air M4 costs $1,000 (the 15-inch model starts at $1,200), which is the price Apple set for the older M2 MacBook Air in 2024. You no longer have to worry about only netting 8 GB of RAM for the stock MacBook, either. Apple has since changed the standard; now, all models sport 16 GB.\n\nSee MacBook Air M4 at Amazon\n\nYou can expect moderate gains in performance over the 2024 Air, which may be enough for some to make it worth the upgrade from an earlier M-series or Intel MacBook. Apple has made it clear that these latest Mac products are aimed at user who own the company\u2019s older laptop designs. For users on the fence, there\u2019s at least one new capability that previous models didn\u2019t have. The MacBook Air M4 is finally able to connect to two external monitors with the lid open for a full three-screen experience.\n\nOtherwise, you still have a choice of 13-inch or 15-inch designs. You have the same webcam cutout notch hanging like a wedge from the laptop\u2019s upper bezel. It\u2019s the same chassis as we\u2019ve had the past three years. What I wouldn\u2019t give to see Apple stick a single blaring pink or green iPhone 16 color on its cheapest laptop.\n\nFor basic to advanced productivity tasks on a light and thin laptops, the M4 MacBook Pro does the job with gusto. When the base MacBook Pro 14 M4 starts at $1,600, a 13-inch MacBook Air feels all the more like a solid buy. The Apple M-series still reigns supreme in benchmarks, cementing the MacBook as the quality all-rounder the lineup has been since the launch of the M1. If Apple had only lost the notch and given us a few fun color options this would be my forever MacBook. Instead, I\u2019ll just keep staring at the cover until I\u2019m blue in the face.\n\nApple MacBook Air M4 Review: Performance\n\nThere is a sizable gulf in performance between the M3 MacBook Air and the updated M4 version, though not as big as the M1 to M2. This time last year, I said the M3 MacBook Air was close in capabilities to the M3 MacBook Pro despite the price difference. The M4 MacBook Pro has a slight lead over the latest thin and light Apple laptop, though only by single-digit percentage points. Either way, this latest MacBook seems like a tempting upgrade for those sitting on an M1 MacBook. In our tests, there were some serious gains over M2 and M3.\n\nIn Geekbench 6, the MacBook Air M4 hit 3,720 in single-core and 14,891 in multi-core settings, Which is close to 600 points and 2,800 more than the MacBook Air M3. It scored 30 points over the M3 MacBook Air in Cinebench 2024\u2019s single-core CPU rendering benchmark and 100 points more in multi-core settings. The same CPU on the MacBook Air was\u2014at max\u2014five points shy of the MacBook Pro 14 in these same tests. If you compare M4 to M2, some of our tests with these same benchmarks showed serious leaps in capabilities.\n\nThe 10-core GPU was also a better performer than in the past. In Geekbench 6 Metal benchmarks, the M4 did just under 10% better than the M3. As for our Blender rendering benchmark, where we ask the Mac to render a scene of a BMW, the Macbook Air M4 was 53 seconds faster than the MacBook Air with M3, finishing at 3 minutes and 1 second while relying on the CPU. The latest MacBook Air was more than 3 minutes faster than M2 rendering on the GPU.\n\nIn our Handbrake tests, where we get the Mac to transcode a 4K movie into 1080p, the M4 Macbook Air finished the task close to 1 minute and 20 seconds faster than the M3, ending the test at just over 2 minutes and 7 seconds. Simply put, the M4 MacBook Air is plenty strong for most average productivity and some more intensive rendering or graphics tasks. It won\u2019t be the performer of an M4 Pro or M4 Max on a Mac mini or MacBook Pro, but it packs enough power in its light frame that the tradeoff is worth it.\n\nIt\u2019s a solid performer in synthetic and non-synthetic benchmarks, but we were keen to see how well it handles gaming. Apple has continued to promote its latest Mac products as performers in gaming, but mileage may vary. In Resident Evil 4, at the highest resolution of 2560 by 1664, I could get between 50 and 60 FPS, a stable framerate, with the default mid-to-high settings with MetalFX upscaling set to performance. Fiddling with these settings could experience drops as low as 30 FPS, but the game is playable and looks fine in these circumstances. It\u2019s about what I could get in performance on the MacBook Pro 14 with M4.\n\nThe jump from Intel to M1 CPUs was a huge leap. Then, when Apple went from M1 on MacBook Air to M2, some tests showed the newer chip could complete tasks in half the time. The performance delta has closed since then. M3 and M4 are closer in capabilities than M1 and M2, but if you had waited to jump from earlier Apple silicon to the latest, this has been the best performance gains from the past few generations of Apple laptops.\n\nSee MacBook Air M4 at Amazon\n\nApple MacBook Air M4 Review: Build Quality\n\nThe latest MacBook Air colorway is not \u201cSky Blue,\u201d as Apple intended. The tech giant says this sheen offers a \u201cmetallic light blue\u201d color that\u2019s supposed to show a different color in different light. In the dark, it has a grainy exterior that seems more silver than blue. If you compare it to a cloudless sky on a bright, sunny day, at most, it\u2019s a cool gray color with a bare hint of blue. I went around my office and found everything with a sky blue hue, including last year\u2019s Microsoft Surface Pro. That Windows tablet laptop is certainly blue. This latest Macbook is certainly not.\n\nThe MacBook Air M4 still uses the same shell as the M2 MacBook Air. The last big color addition was the \u201cMidnight\u201d blue-ish black, which still has a problem picking up fingerprints. Compared to the Starlight on my M3 MacBook Air 13, the sky blue also tended to pick up scuffs just from being in my backpack. The Midnight black is anodized to the laptop shell, meaning it should protect better against scuffs, scratches, or fingerprints (though it didn\u2019t help much with the latter, in our experience). This latest MacBook finish isn\u2019t anodized, and I struggled to buff out any of the blemishes that appeared on the lid.\n\nDecide for yourself. Take a look at the pictures below, and tell me if you catch more than a hint of blue.\n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s the same old, relatively thin, and light frame we\u2019ve seen before. The 13-inch model is .44 inches thick from stem to stern, and it weighs 2.7 pounds. No, it\u2019s not technically the least weighty laptop around. I\u2019ve held devices like the Asus Zenbook A14 and wondered if there were any actual components inside.\n\nThe variant sent to me for review was the MacBook Air M4 for $1,200 with a 10-core GPU, compared to the base model, which contains an 8-core GPU. Whether you opt for the cheaper version, you can still access two Thunderbolt 4 USB ports, a headphone jack, and the MagSafe charging port. It\u2019s disappointing we didn\u2019t get Thunderbolt 5 on the new MacBook Air, which now remains a Pro-only feature and one you only get if you spend even more money over the base model.\n\nMacBook Air M4 Review: Display and Sound\n\nThere\u2019s the usual Liquid Retina IPS LCD and the love-it-or-hate-it Magic Keyboard. It\u2019s still what we\u2019ve come to expect, including that damn notch. At the very least, it\u2019s bright enough for dim or bright lights. The only issue you\u2019ll run into compared to more expensive MacBooks is the reflections on the MacBook Air, which can get a little much in certain lights. It\u2019s not the worst, but it\u2019s not the best either.\n\nThe big landmark update for MacBook Air M4 is the ability to use three displays at once. That includes two external monitors up to 5K resolution and the MacBook Air\u2019s display. The M3 model forced you to keep the lid closed for the dual-screen experience. This works, but of course, you\u2019ll be using up all your precious ports unless you have a port dock nearby.\n\nI\u2019m always surprised by the audio quality of the MacBook Air, especially considering the lack of speaker grating compared to the MacBook Pro. The 13-inch version includes a 4-speaker setup, while the 15-inch rounds up to 6 speakers. The sound quality is loud and clear enough for a night lounging with a partner in bed, and it\u2019s light enough to frisbee across the room (hopefully onto a pile of cushions) when you\u2019re done with Netflix and want to move onto the \u201cchill.\u201d\n\nApple MacBook Air M4 Review: Verdict\n\nHello, Mr. (Not So) Blue Sky\n\nAs much as I might complain about the MacBook Air\u2019s misleading shell color, this latest MacBook Air promises to be the best starting place for those looking to get into Apple\u2019s laptop ecosystem or upgrade from an age-old system. The $1,000 version comes with an 8-core GPU, and while I can\u2019t speak to the performance on that version, the CPU capabilities are already very good for most daily productivity tasks; it seems a good choice for most potential users.\n\nIf I had the choice of buying a MacBook Air M4 or MacBook Pro with the base M4 chip, I would opt for the $1,200 model without much waffling. Of course, Apple\u2019s upselling model means that if you want the 1 TB SSD on the 10 GB GPU model, you need to spend close to $1,400. That\u2019s still $400 less than the specs of the MacBook Pro. You miss out on the mini-LED display, better resolution, speaker cutouts, and extra ports. However, if you\u2019re simply looking for a MacBook for basic productivity, 2025\u2019s rendition of the Air at its lower price point is the better choice for the average consumer.\n\nApple\u2019s problem is it keeps trying to lure any lingering Intel users to the latest Apple silicon by posting numbers over and over while hoping those old-school Mac users will care. We\u2019re a tech site, and of course, we like to see numbers go up. But not everybody cares nearly as much. The last time Apple updated the MacBook Air shell was in 2022. It was fine then, but now it feels typified. When I run from event to event, trying laptops with anodized \u201cceraluminum\u201d finishes or shells that help each PC feel unique, Apple seems stuck in time.\n\nSee MacBook Air M4 at Amazon",

I took it for a quick spin.\n\nApple sent me the 15-inch variant of the new MacBook Air in the new \"sky blue\" color, with an M4 chip, 16GB of memory, and 1TB of storage space. I haven't yet spent enough time with it to tell you whether it's a good purchase, but I can say one thing: The sky blue color will only shine in a certain light.\n\nSo, so subtle.\n\nPulling the new Air out of its box, I thought there must've been a mistake, as the thing seemed gray to my eyes. Only after a direct comparison with my 16-inch, silver MacBook Pro was I able to determine that the device Apple sent me indeed has a blue hue to it.\n\nLighter, slimmer, and slightly more colorful than a silver, 16-inch MacBook Pro. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\n\nIn its marketing materials, Apple did say that the Air \"creates a dynamic gradient when light reflects off of its surface,\" and it does, but you do need that light to see it. In other words, don't expect people to notice your new fancy Air unless it's basking in sunlight. Oh, and if you wondered, the MagSafe charge cable you get with it is color-matched.\n\nEnough about the color (the new Air is also available in midnight, starlight, and silver). The new Air, as I expected, was incredibly sleek and light next to my massive MacBook Pro. With a 15-inch LED display and at 2.7 pounds of weight, it's definitely not a small laptop, but I feel it still deserves the \"Air\" moniker, if only barely.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

It looks and weighs the same as the last one, but it has the new, faster M4 chip, it starts with more RAM (16GB), it has a much-needed, upgraded 12-megapixel FaceTime camera, and it starts at $999 (down from $1,099) That's for the 13-inch variant, though; the 15-incher that I've tested starts at $1,199.\n\nYou get a matching MagSafe charge cable in the box. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\n\nThat's actually quite a lot of improvements, and while I didn't have time to truly put the new M4 chip to the test, the new Air seems to be a no brainer if you're looking for a sleek, portable Apple laptop.\n\nSure, the display doesn't get as bright as the one on my Pro, but having them both side by side right now, both on maximum brightness, I'm not really noticing that much of a difference. The fact that the Air's display only supports 60Hz refresh rate while the Pro goes up to 120Hz is noticeable when things are moving on screen.\n\nNo USB-C ports on the right side; you only get a 3.5mm headphone jack there. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\n\nAnd yes, the Air could definitely use more ports. It only has the MagSafe port (if you wondered, the charinge cable you get with it is color-matched), two Thunderbolt 4 ports, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. This could be of particular importance if you plan to use the new Air with two external monitors, which you now can -- those two Thunderbolt ports probably won't cut it for all your needs.\n\nStay tuned for a more thorough assessment of whether the new Air is worth your money. For now, though, it appears to be a winner.",

            "content": "Back in 2020, I wrote a column for this magazine titled, \u201cThe Question: Lists of One.\u201d I was astonished at the lack of imagination from the general public in regard to the freedoms of GA. All anyone ever asked me (and continues to this day) is, \u201cWho do we have to tell we\u2019re coming?\u201d\n\nLast week, I made a flight that surprised even me, as far as the amount of trust, freedom, and length of leash. Demian Neufeld, a close friend and pilot, asked me if I wanted to do a formation flight down the Hudson River. He was finishing up his complex rating in a Cessna 182 RG and he and his CFI, Leslie Cruz, flew up to my home field of Sullivan County (KMSV) in Swan Lake, New York, where we both took fuel and planned our adventure. The plan was for Demian, a professional photographer, to shoot my aircraft with a long lens from the Cessna\u2019s right seat while Leslie was PIC. We discussed frequencies\u2014there were many. We would use 122.75 to talk discreetly between our aircraft, and 123.05 is the self-announcing CTAF frequency for the Hudson River SFRA. Newark (KEWR) and LaGuardia (KLGA) towers would be used to request the East River transition.\n\nThis Article First Appeared in FLYING Magazine If you're not already a subscriber, what are you waiting for?

I have only really exercised extended slow flight on the Fisk Arrival into Oshkosh, Wisconsin, four years ago. Otherwise, my Bonanza does not enjoy sub-100 kias flight unless we are about to land or have just taken off. She likes to go. The flying I did this summer in Montana was extremely helpful. I was forced to slow down to make the short grass strips that do not reward an extra 10 knots on final. Departing KMSV, I announced our departure then let Leslie handle the radios moving forward\u2014every transmission beginning with \u201cFlight of two\u2026\u201d\n\nFlying at 3,500 msl southbound toward the Tappan Zee Bridge, we practiced formation flying. Leslie instructed me to hold different speeds as we looked for a sweet spot the two aircraft could share. At first I thought I would use my Garmin GFC500 that allows for IAS holds. It took me about five seconds to remember my plane does not have autothrottles and that, if I use the airspeed function to hold 100 kias, that means not holding 3,500 feet. If you use altitude hold instead, then you\u2019re not going to remain at 100 knots.\n\nIt\u2019s like the old contractor adage: You can have it done well, fast, or cheap\u2014pick two.\n\nI remembered from Oshkosh that the ole girl held the required 90 kias with about 10 degrees of flaps and a low power setting. On this day, 16 inches of manifold pressure and 8.5 gph put me at 100 kias. When I threw in a bit of flaps, I could hold 90 kias.\n\nLeslie and I were in sync as we approached the bridge. Descending below the Bravo airspace and joining the Hudson River Corridor at 1,000 msl, Demian gave me instructions so as to position myself for the perfect shot. Turn 10 degrees left. Speed up 5 knots. Descend 100 feet. As we flew south along the west bank of the Hudson, I listened as Leslie announced our flight of two past the mandatory reporting sites: George Washington Bridge, USS Intrepid, Clock Tower, Statue of Liberty, and Verrazano Bridge. As we passed Lady Liberty, I was struck by the level of freedom at play here\u2014yes, I\u2019m aware how overtly metaphoric this example is. Just go with it. We were flying personal aircraft in the busiest airspace on earth without even speaking to a controller. People constantly moan about regulation, but in the world of GA, conventional wisdom rules the day. It\u2019s what I would describe as a responsible free-for-all.\n\nOnce we passed the Verrazano, we switched to Newark tower to request the transition up the East River. This is a route I had never tried as it requires a Class B transition and communication with LaGuardia tower, whom we were quickly switched over to. Leslie handled the radios like the pro she is, and LaGuardia approved our flight of two, only asking me to turn my transponder to standby. That was a first. Took me a second just to figure out how to do it. Our aircraft were so close I imagine they were avoiding the constant traffic warnings they would surely receive on their monitors.\n\nWe flew directly over Governors Island, then the Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Williamsburg bridges. I could see my apartment off the right wing. We requested a left turn over Central Park and it was approved. Leslie and I banked in unison, flying right over the reservoir. I could see Sheep Meadow and Strawberry Fields, places I had visited my entire life. I can remember multiple occasions laying on a blanket in Central Park as a teen, watching aircraft fly overhead, wondering what it looked like from up there. I was awed by the level of freedom and latitude we were given. In return, they expect you only to be proficient. We did not let them down.\n\nDeparting from my wingmates, I turned my transponder back on and flew north up the Hudson. Passing the Freedom Tower (One World Trade Center), I was a few hundred feet below and close enough to throw a baseball at it. I thought of the Twin Towers and how some bad actors had exploited the freedoms we enjoy in this great country\u2014flight instruction for everyone, ease of commercial air travel, etc. But here I was, witnessing the spirit of general aviation undeterred, a resolute refusal to smother this beautiful privilege, with only a few more regulations in place to protect the masses.\n\nI love New York.",

Before that, users with iPhones that support Apple Intelligence were prompted to activate it when setting up their phone, a process that involved having to download software.\n\nIn February, Apple said that it plans to add those AI capabilities to another platform \u2014 its mixed-reality headset, Vision Pro \u2014 in April.

            "content": "This year\u2019s iPad Air was a surprise to me. Apple launched the last Air less than a year ago, and that was a very good device that could already support Apple Intelligence \u2014 and most of Apple\u2019s recent gadget upgrades have been about supporting Apple Intelligence. I figured Apple might launch a better Magic Keyboard for the Air (which it did), and that maybe we\u2019d see some big new software ideas at WWDC this year. But a whole new model? Didn\u2019t see that coming.\n\nIn fairness, there\u2019s really only one new thing about the new model: it runs on an M3 chip instead of last year\u2019s M2. So maybe instead of a whole new iPad Air, this is more like a mid-cycle refresh. Apple\u2019s chip production changes, and so its devices change too. The new one, just like the old one, starts at $599 for the 11-inch model and $799 for the 13-inch screen. It comes in the same very pale colors. You get it.\n\nI\u2019ve had a 13-inch M2 Air for many months and an 11-inch M3 Air on my desk for the last several days. The story is the same as ever: it\u2019s an excellent tablet, and I wish Apple would use iPadOS to make it a more versatile one. But we don\u2019t need to litigate the reason for tablets to exist \u2014 you want to know if this is the tablet you should buy.\n\nTo that end, I have six thoughts that have come up in my testing that I think add up to something like an answer.\n\nThere\u2019s no meaningful performance upgrade here. The M3 chip inside the new Air benchmarks at about 12\u201315 percent above the M2 in last year\u2019s model. That\u2019s actually a decent-sized bump, though it\u2019s not the 2x jump Apple promises over the M1 from 2022. (I don\u2019t have one of those handy, unfortunately, so I can\u2019t test that number.) In practice, though, I don\u2019t notice the difference. At all. Apps open at the same speed, games look and play the same, even apps like Procreate and Logic are equally responsive.\n\nNone of that is a problem with the M3, really, just a statement about how good the M2 already was. In general, I\u2019d say the M3 seems closer to the M2 in performance than the M4 iPad Pro, which is still a half-beat faster on just about everything.\n\nGraphics performance can be tricky to test on an iPad since there aren\u2019t that many games designed to push the limits of the device. if I play Call of Duty: Mobile and crank everything to Max settings, I think I notice a slight difference in the details, particularly in shadows. But it\u2019s subtle at best and possibly just a placebo.\n\nBut the keyboard is way better. Adding a row of function keys \u2014 for controlling volume and playback, opening the app switcher, and quickly locking the device \u2014 immediately makes the Air a more credible laptop replacement. (Until now, the Air\u2019s was the only keyboard dock that didn\u2019t have the function keys, which was just weird.) Apple says passthrough charging with the new Magic Keyboard charges the iPad as fast as plugging the tablet in directly, which makes it a really useful dock. It\u2019s way too expensive an accessory, starting at $269, but it\u2019s a very good one. The Pro keyboard is still the best one, though: it\u2019s made of aluminum, has backlit keys and more feedback in the trackpad, and just feels nicer to tap on.\n\nAnother nice thing: the new keyboard is backwards compatible, so if you have an M2 Air it\u2019ll work just fine with the new keyboard. In fact, if you can find one on sale, 2024 Air plus 2025 Magic Keyboard might be the Air combo I recommend most.\n\nAccessory support is one of the best things about the new Air. Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto, The Verge\n\nThis thing really, really should support Face ID. Touch ID always made more sense to me on phones, which you typically hold the same way all the time, than on a tablet where notions of \u201cbottom\u201d and \u201ctop\u201d are ever-changing. On the Face ID iPad Pro, you hardly ever need the power button; just tap the screen, and it wakes up and unlocks. On this Air, like other Touch ID iPads, it\u2019s just annoying to sweep your thumb around the edges looking for the power button, where the sensor is.\n\nIn terms of day-to-day \u201cdesign is how you use it\u201d features, Face ID is the Pro upgrade I most want to see come to the Air.\n\nSize matters. It might seem silly to say that a 13-inch iPad is very different from an 11-inch iPad, but those two inches of screen size really do change everything. When I use a 13-inch iPad, which is mostly what I\u2019ve been testing recently, I hardly ever pick it up; it\u2019s a desk-bound, keyboard-attached thing. An 11-inch model, on the other hand, is so much easier to hold in two hands (or even in one) that I find myself carrying it around a lot more.\n\nIf you want a larger model, I\u2019d encourage you to consider the 13-inch Pro instead. If you\u2019re thinking about the iPad as a productivity machine rather than a portable consumption tool, you\u2019ll really benefit from the Pro\u2019s better Magic Keyboard, its 120Hz screen, and its performance improvements. If you want something that is essentially your main computer, the iPad Pro is the way to go if you can afford it. But if the versatility of the small screen appeals to you, the 11-inch Air is a really nice option. You sacrifice some space, obviously, and the keyboard attachment is a bit more cramped, but I recommend the smaller models to people for the wieldability alone. I\u2019m convinced that practically every iPad user is best-served by either the plain ol\u2019 iPad or the 11-inch Air.\n\nApple Intelligence is the open question here. I haven\u2019t been able to try the new base-model iPad yet, but I suspect that its story is fairly straightforward: the A16 Bionic chip is a nice upgrade, and it\u2019ll be great for watching movies, browsing the web, and the other things everybody does on their iPad.\n\nI can\u2019t think of one reason Apple Intelligence would cause you to buy one device over another\n\nBut there are a couple of things the base model can\u2019t do, like Stage Manager (not a problem) and the Pencil Pro (maybe a problem!). It\u2019s also the only current iPad that doesn\u2019t support Apple Intelligence. Right now, that does not matter one tiny bit. Seriously: I can\u2019t think of one reason Apple Intelligence would cause you to buy one device over another in the near future. But if you\u2019re bullish on the future of AI and you think Apple Intelligence is likely to be good before you\u2019re looking to upgrade your iPad again, you might want the Air. I have no idea how to handicap the likelihood that AI gets good before your iPad dies \u2014 though it\u2019s not a great sign that Apple just once again delayed the Siri improvements that might actually make Apple Intelligence compelling. Either way, that\u2019s the biggest and most consequential difference between the devices right now.",

This is certainly not true of their phones or their newer computers, but there was a time before 2016 when Apple built some impressively high quality, robust laptops that use standard parts, have removable batteries, and, thanks to Apple dropping support for these older machines in their latest operating systems, can also be found for sale for next to nothing. In a way that\u2019s similar to buying a luxury car that\u2019s only a few years old and letting someone else eat the bulk of the depreciation, a high quality laptop from this era is only one Linux install away from being a usable and relatively powerful machine at an excellent bargain.\n\nThe History Lesson\n\nTo be fair to my teenage self though, Apple used to use less-mainstream PowerPC processors which meant there was very little software cross-compatibility with x86 PCs. It was also an era before broadband meant that most people could move their work into cloud and the browser, allowing them to be more agnostic about their operating system. Using an Apple when I was a teenager was therefore a much different experience than it is today. My first Apple was from this PowerPC era though; my ThinkPad T43 broke mid-way through college and a friend of mine gave me an old PowerBook G4 that had stopped working for her. Rather than have no computer at all, I swallowed my pride and was able to get the laptop working well enough to finish college with it. Part of the reason this repair was even possible was thanks to a major hacker-friendly aspect of Apple computers: they run Unix. (Note for commenters: technically Apple\u2019s OS is Unix-like but they have carried a UNIX certification since 2007.)\n\nI had used Unix somewhat in Solaris-based labs in college but, as I mentioned in a piece about installing Gentoo on one of my MacBooks, I was also getting pretty deep into the Linux world at the time as well. Linux was also designed to be Unix-like, so most of the basic commands and tools available for it have nearly one-to-one analogs in Unix. The PowerBook\u2019s main problem, along with a battery that needed a warranty replacement, was a corrupted filesystem and disk drive that I was able to repair using my new Linux knowledge. This realization marked a major turning point for me which helped tear down most of my biases against Apple computers.\n\nOver the next few years or so I grew quite fond of the PowerBook, partially because I liked its 12\u2033, netbook-like form factor and also because the operating system never seemed to crash. As a Linux user, my system crashes were mostly self-inflicted, but they did happen. As a former Windows user as well, the fact that it wouldn\u2019t randomly bluescreen itself through no fault of my own was quite a revelation. Apple was a few years into their Intel years at this point as well, and seeing how easily these computers did things my PowerBook could never do, including running Windows, I saved up enough money to buy my first MacBook Pro, a mid-2009 model which I still use to this day. Since then I\u2019ve acquired four other Apple laptops, most of which run Linux or a patched version of macOS that lets older, unsupported machines run modern versions of Apple\u2019s operating system.\n\nSo if you\u2019ve slogged through my coming-of-age story and are still curious about picking up an old Mac for whatever reason\u2014a friend or family member has one gathering dust, you\u2019re tired of looking at the bland styling of older ThinkPads while simultaneously growing frustrated with the declining quality of their newer ones, or just want to go against the grain a bit and do something different\u2014I\u2019ll try and help by sharing some tips and guidelines I\u2019ve picked up through the years.\n\nWhat to Avoid\n\nStarting with broad categories of older Apple laptops to avoid, the first major red flag are any with the butterfly keyboard that Apple put on various laptops from 2015 to 2019 which were so bad that a number of lawsuits were filed against them. Apple eventually relented and instituted a replacement program for them, but it\u2019s since expired and can cost hundreds of dollars to fix otherwise. The second red flag are models with the T2 security chips. It\u2019s not a complete dealbreaker but does add a lot of hassle if the end goal is a working Linux machine.\n\nAdditionally, pay close attention to any laptops with discrete graphics cards. Some older MacBooks have Nvidia graphics, which is almost always going to provide a below-average experience for a Linux user especially for Apple laptops of this vintage. Others have AMD graphics which do have better Linux support, but there were severe problems with the 15\u2033 and 17\u2033 Mac around the 2011 models. Discrete graphics is not something to avoid completely like laptops with butterfly keyboards, but it\u2019s worth investigating the specific model year for problems if a graphics card is included. A final note is to be aware of \u201cStaingate\u201d which is a problem which impacted some Retina displays between 2012 and 2015. This of course is not an exhaustive list, but covers the major difficult-to-solve problems for this era of Apple laptop.\n\nWhat to Look For\n\nAs for what specific computers are the best from this era for a bit of refurbishment and use, in my opinion the best mix of performance, hackability, and Linux-ability will be from the 2009-2012 Unibody era. These machines come in all sizes and are surprisingly upgradable, with standard SODIMM slots for RAM, 2.5\u2033 laptop drives, an optical drive (which can be changed out for a second hard drive), easily replaceable batteries if you can unscrew the back cover, and plenty of ports. Some older models from this era have Core 2 Duo processors and should be avoided if you have the choice, but there are plenty of others from this era with much more powerful Core i5 or Core i7 processors.\n\nAfter 2012, though, Apple started making some less-desirable changes for those looking to maintain their computers long-term, like switching to a proprietary M.2-like port for their storage and adding in soldered or otherwise non-upgradable RAM, but these machines can still be worthwhile as many had Core i7 processors and at least 8 GB of RAM and can still run Linux and even modern macOS versions quite capably. The batteries can still be replaced without too much hassle as well.\n\nOf course, a major problem with these computers is that they all have processors that have the Intel Management Engine coprocessor installed, so they\u2019re not the most privacy-oriented machines in existence even if Linux is the chosen operating system. It\u2019s worth noting, though, that some MacBooks from before the unibody era can run the open-source bootloader Libreboot but the tradeoff, as with any system capable of running Libreboot, is that they\u2019re a bit limited in performance even compared to the computers from just a few years later.\n\nOut of the five laptops I own, four are from the pre-butterfly era including my two favorites. Topping the list is a mid-2012 13\u2033 MacBook Pro with Intel graphics that\u2019s a beast of a Debian machine thanks to upgrades to a solid state drive and to 16 GB of RAM. It also has one of the best-feeling laptop keyboards I\u2019ve ever used to write with, and is also the computer I used to experiment with Gentoo.\n\nSecond place goes to a 2015 11\u2033 MacBook Air which is a netbook-style Apple that I like for its exceptional portability even though it\u2019s not as upgradable as I might otherwise like. It will have 4 GB of RAM forever, but this is not much of a problem for Debian. I also still have my 2009 MacBook Pro as well, which runs macOS Sonoma thanks to OpenCore Legacy Patcher. This computer\u2019s major weakness is that it has an Nvidia graphics card so it isn\u2019t as good of a Linux machine as the others, and occasionally locks up when running Debian for this reason. But it also has been upgraded with an SSD and 8 GB of RAM so Sonoma still runs pretty well on it despite its age. Sequoia, on the other hand, dropped support for dual-core machines so I\u2019m not sure what I will do with it after Sonoma is no longer supported.\n\nMy newest Apple laptop is an M1 MacBook Air, which I was excited about when it launched because I\u2019m a huge fan of ARM-based personal computers for more reasons than one. Although the M1 does have essentially no user-repairability unless you want to go to extremes, I have some hope that this will last me as long as my MacBook Pros have thanks to a complete lack of moving parts and also because of Asahi Linux, a version of Fedora which is built for Apple silicon. Whenever Apple stops providing security patches for this machine, I plan to switch it over to this specialized Linux distribution.\n\nWhy Bother?\n\nBut why spend all this effort keeping these old machines running at all? If repairability is a major concern, laptops from companies like System76 or Framework are arguably a much better option. Not to mention that, at least according to the best Internet commenters out there, Apple computers aren\u2019t supposed to be fixable, repairable, or upgradable at all. They\u2019re supposed to slowly die as upgrades force them to be less useful.\n\nWhile this is certainly true for their phones and their more modern machines to some extent, part of the reason I keep these older machines running is to go against the grain and do something different, like a classic car enthusiast who picks a 70s era Volkswagen to drive to and from the office every day instead of a modern Lexus. It\u2019s also because at times I still feel a bit like that teenager I was. While I might be a little wiser now from some life experiences, I believe some amount of teenage rebellion can be put to use stubbornly refusing to buy the latest products year after year from a trillion-dollar company which has become synonymous with planned obsolescence. Take that, Apple!",

            "content": "Content warning: contains First World problems.\n\nAs my phone contract came to an end last month, I found myself faced with a familiar dilemma: to upgrade, or to stick with my current device. Normally I'd stick \u2013 the pressure to switch phones every couple of years has never sat right with me; surely a device that cost just shy of a grand needn't become e-waste in just twenty-four months. But this time my fingers were pleading, nay, begging for change. They'd simply had enough of trying to stretch their way around my iPhone 14 Pro. They yearned for the comfort of smaller iPhones of yore \u2013 the 5S, the SE, the 13 mini.\n\nI've been whinging on here about phones getting bigger for a while now. As somebody who is digitally challenged (by which I mean I have small digits), I've always preferred a phone that fits comfortably in one hand, rather than requiring three. The 14 Pro was an experiment to see whether I could adjust to this brave new world of 'phablets', and it wasn't for me. But to my horror and dismay, my contract ended just days after Apple killed off the last small phone in its line up. Apple might make some of the best camera phones, but I wish they weren't the size of cameras.\n\nThe iPhone 16e is yet another big phone (Image credit: Apple)\n\nInstead of launching an iPhone SE 4 and continuing the tradition of providing a smaller budget model, Apple dashed my hopes by replacing the iPhone SE 3 with the new iPhone 16e. It's a phone that's just as large as the standard iPhones from the 12 onwards at 6.1-inches, just with fewer features; no multi-lens camera setup, no MagSafe, not even a particularly affordable price. I genuinely don't understand the iPhone 16e.\n\nAnd so, to get something close to the phone I actually wanted, instead of upgrading I was going to have to downgrade. While for the first time ever Apple now sells no small phones, it just so happened that the official Apple refurbished store had 2021's iPhone 13 mini in stock (these come and go, and will likely disappear for good come September) for a substantially reduced price. So I went ahead and bought the phone I used to have before upgrading to my current model.\n\nThe first generation iPhone SE (left) will always be my favourite (Image credit: Apple)\n\nAlas, dear reader, the happy ending you are hoping for was not to be. Nostalgia alone does not a good phone make. While the form factor of the 13 mini remains a delight, from a performance perspective, the four year-old phone showed its age far more than I had hoped. The main issue is battery \u2013 Apple ships even refurbished models with the latest software, and iOS 18 was built for newer phones. I'd read reports of iOS 18 borking the battery of the 13 mini, and I found it to have much less stamina than the 13 mini I used with iOS 15 in 2021.\n\nAnd there are a few minor quality of life issues too \u2013 the lack of USB-C, notch instead of Dynamic Island, slightly stuttering animations, 60hz display. In short, the 13 mini just felt older and tireder than I expected, to the point that after a few days I returned it to Apple.\n\nGet the Creative Bloq Newsletter Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.

I must either settle for carrying a brick in my pocket, or using an old device that compromises on performance and will likely stop receiving security updates in the coming years. Sure, larger screens are better for consuming media, but what about those of us who prefer not to use our phone as a brain-rotting content machine? Don't I already have my iPad for that? I suppose there's only one thing for it. It's back to the dumbphone I go.",

            "content": "It feels like it was just yesterday that Apple launched the M2-powered iPad Air. In fact, it's been 10 months, but that's still far too soon for a new version in my book. Yet here we are, with a new iPad Air\u2014this time with an M3 chip. The tablet delivers a minor boost in performance compared to its predecessor, but it does come with features like ray tracing, mesh shading, and dynamic caching to power graphics-intensive tasks. This is a first for the iPad Air, making it the most affordable way into these advanced capabilities for those who need it\u2014like creative professionals or gamers\u2014who don't want to splurge on the iPad Pro.\n\nBut that's it as far as new features go for the seventh-generation iPad Air. Apple used the same chassis, so you'll have a choice between the 11-inch and 13-inch display sizes. While it's a perfectly fine tablet in terms of usability, Apple failed to address the major critiques from last year's model: its density, battery life, and lack of an OLED (or even mini LED) panel. All of these are factors that would've helped justify a next-generation iPad Air so soon.\n\nReuse and Recycle\n\nIn my review of the M2-powered iPad Air (8/10, WIRED Recommends), I described the design as stale compared to the redesigned iPad Pro (6/10 WIRED Review). Now, seeing Apple recycle the same chassis as last year's model, my feelings haven't changed. It's comical that the iPad Air is still a few grams heavier and almost a full milimeter thicker than the iPad Pro. The tablet feels lightweight and slim regardless, but it's not as impressively thin as its more expensive counterpart\u2014especially when you add accessories to it. And, while Apple didn't take away color options this time (we lost the pink last year and the green before that), it didn't add any, either. You'll have a choice between blue, purple, starlight, and space gray.\n\nPhotograph: Brenda Stolyar\n\nYou also have a choice between an 11-inch display or a 13-inch display. Apple sent me the latter, which I prefer since the extra screen real estate makes it that much more comfortable to use as a secondary display and to watch TV. It's slightly brighter than the smaller model, with 2,732 x 2,048 resolution (264 ppi) and hits 600 nits of peak brightness in Standard Dynamic Range. It gets plenty bright for the most part, but you'll have to increase it to full brightness in direct sunlight. I had to do this while watching an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians in front of my bedroom window. Otherwise, I typically keep it at a little under 50 percent brightness.\n\nAs with last year's tablet, I continue to question why Apple didn't nix the LCD panel and replace it with mini LED (as seen on the iPad Pro from 2021 and 2022), at least on the larger model. This feels like a no-brainer for multiple reasons in addition to the fact that it would allow for an even brighter screen).\n\nFor starters, it goes hand in hand with the M3 chip's graphics architecture. This iPad will attract a lot more creatives who are in the market for a powerful tablet (and a large screen). To fully leverage the processor, it's intended to be used with apps like Adobe Photoshop or Final Cut Pro\u2014where editing content requires a certain attention to color accuracy.",

Consider this commercial which the company was running incessantly last fall:\n\nIn case you missed the fine print in the commercial, it reads:\n\nApple Intelligence coming fall 2024 with Siri and device language set to U.S. English. Some features and languages will be coming over the next year.\n\n\u201cNext year\u201d is doing a lot of work, now that the specific feature detailed in this commercial \u2014 Siri\u2019s ability to glean information from sources like your calendar \u2014 is officially delayed. Here is the statement Apple gave to John Gruber at Daring Fireball:\n\nSiri helps our users find what they need and get things done quickly, and in just the past six months, we\u2019ve made Siri more conversational, introduced new features like type to Siri and product knowledge, and added an integration with ChatGPT. We\u2019ve also been working on a more personalized Siri, giving it more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps. It\u2019s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.\n\nIt was a pretty big surprise, even at the time, that Apple, a company renowned for its secrecy, was so heavily advertising features that did not yet exist; I also, in full disclosure, thought it was all an excellent idea. From my post-WWDC Update:\n\nThe key part here is the \u201cunderstanding personal context\u201d bit: Apple Intelligence will know more about you than any other AI, because your phone knows more about you than any other device (and knows what you are looking at whenever you invoke Apple Intelligence); this, by extension, explains why the infrastructure and privacy parts are so important. What this means is that Apple Intelligence is by-and-large focused on specific use cases where that knowledge is useful; that means the problem space that Apple Intelligence is trying to solve is constrained and grounded \u2014 both figuratively and literally \u2014 in areas where it is much less likely that the AI screws up. In other words, Apple is addressing a space that is very useful, that only they can address, and which also happens to be \u201csafe\u201d in terms of reputation risk. Honestly, it almost seems unfair \u2014 or, to put it another way, it speaks to what a massive advantage there is for a trusted platform. Apple gets to solve real problems in meaningful ways with low risk, and that\u2019s exactly what they are doing. Contrast this to what OpenAI is trying to accomplish with its GPT models, or Google with Gemini, or Anthropic with Claude: those large language models are trying to incorporate all of the available public knowledge to know everything; it\u2019s a dramatically larger and more difficult problem space, which is why they get stuff wrong. There is also a lot of stuff that they don\u2019t know because that information is locked away \u2014 like all of the information on an iPhone. That\u2019s not to say these models aren\u2019t useful: they are far more capable and knowledgable than what Apple is trying to build for anything that does not rely on personal context; they are also all trying to achieve the same things.\n\nSo is Apple more incompetent than these companies, or was my evaluation of the problem space incorrect? Much of the commentary this week assumes point one, but as Simon Willison notes, you shouldn\u2019t discount point two:\n\nI have a hunch that this delay might relate to security. These new Apple Intelligence features involve Siri responding to requests to access information in applications and then performing actions on the user\u2019s behalf. This is the worst possible combination for prompt injection attacks! Any time an LLM-based system has access to private data, tools it can call, and exposure to potentially malicious instructions (like emails and text messages from untrusted strangers) there\u2019s a significant risk that an attacker might subvert those tools and use them to damage or exfiltrating a user\u2019s data.\n\nWillison links to a previous piece of his on the risk of prompt injections; to summarize the problem, if your on-device LLM is parsing your emails, what happens if one of those emails contains malicious text perfectly tuned to make your on-device AI do something you don\u2019t want it to? We intuitively get why code injections are bad news; LLMs expand the attack surface to text generally; Apple Intelligence, by being deeply interwoven into the system, expands the attack surface to your entire device, and all of that precious content it has unique access to.\n\nNeedless to say, I regret not raising this point last June, but I\u2019m sure my regret pales in comparison to Apple executives and whoever had to go on YouTube to pull that commercial over the weekend.\n\nApple\u2019s Great Week\n\nApple has had the best of weeks when it comes to AI. Consider their new hardware announcements, particularly the Mac Studio and its available M3 Ultra; from the company\u2019s press release:\n\nApple today announced M3 Ultra, the highest-performing chip it has ever created, offering the most powerful CPU and GPU in a Mac, double the Neural Engine cores, and the most unified memory ever in a personal computer. M3 Ultra also features Thunderbolt 5 with more than 2x the bandwidth per port for faster connectivity and robust expansion. M3 Ultra is built using Apple\u2019s innovative UltraFusion packaging architecture, which links two M3 Max dies over 10,000 high-speed connections that offer low latency and high bandwidth. This allows the system to treat the combined dies as a single, unified chip for massive performance while maintaining Apple\u2019s industry-leading power efficiency. UltraFusion brings together a total of 184 billion transistors to take the industry-leading capabilities of the new Mac Studio to new heights. \u201cM3 Ultra is the pinnacle of our scalable system-on-a-chip architecture, aimed specifically at users who run the most heavily threaded and bandwidth-intensive applications,\u201d said Johny Srouji, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. \u201cThanks to its 32-core CPU, massive GPU, support for the most unified memory ever in a personal computer, Thunderbolt 5 connectivity, and industry-leading power efficiency, there\u2019s no other chip like M3 Ultra.\u201d\n\nThat Apple released a new Ultra chip wasn\u2019t a shock, given there was an M1 Ultra and M2 Ultra; almost everything about this specific announcement, however, was a surprise.\n\nStart with the naming. Apple chip names have two components: M_ refers to the core type, and the suffix to the configuration of those cores. Therefore, to use the M1 series of chips as an example:\n\nPerf Cores Efficiency Cores GPU Cores Max RAM Bandwidth M1 4 4 8 16GB 70 GB/s M1 Pro 8 4 16 32GB 200 GB/s M1 Max 8 2 32 64GB 400 GB/s M1 Ultra 16 4 64 128GB 800 GB/s\n\nThe \u201cM1\u201d cores in question were the \u201cFirestorm\u201d high-performance core, \u201cIcestorm\u201d energy-efficient core, and a not-publicly-named GPU core; all three of these cores debuted first on the A14 Bionic chip, which shipped in the iPhone 12.\n\nThe suffix, meanwhile, referred to some combination of increased core count (both CPU and GPU), as well as an increased number of memory controllers and associated bandwidth (and, in the case of the M1 series, faster RAM). The Ultra, notably, was simply two Max chips fused together; that\u2019s why all of the numbers simply double.\n\nThe M2 was broadly similar to the M1, at least in terms of the relative performance of the different suffixes. The M2 Ultra, for example, simply doubled up the M2 Max. The M3 Ultra, however, is unique when it comes to max RAM:\n\nPerf Cores Efficiency Cores GPU Cores Controllers Max RAM Bandwidth M3 4 4 10 8 32GB 100 GB/S M3 Pro 6 6 18 12 48GB 150 GB/s M3 Max 12 4 40 32 128GB 400 GB/s M3 Ultra 24 8 80 64 512GB 800 GB/s\n\nI can\u2019t completely vouch for every number on this table (which was sourced from Wikipedia), as Apple hasn\u2019t yet released the full technical details of the M3 Ultra, and it\u2019s not yet available for testing. What seems likely, however, is that instead of simply doubling up the M3 Max, Apple also reworked the memory controllers to address double the memory. That also explains why the M3 Ultra came out so much later than the rest of the family \u2014 indeed, the Mac Studio base chip is actually the M4 Max.\n\nThe wait was worth it, however: what makes Apple\u2019s chip architecture unique is that that RAM is shared by the CPU and GPU, and not in the carve-out way like integrated graphics of old; rather, every part of the chip \u2014 including the Neural Processing Units, which I didn\u2019t include on these tables \u2014 has full access to (almost1) all of the memory all of the time.\n\nWhat that means in practical terms is that Apple just shipped the best consumer-grade AI computer ever. A Mac Studio with an M3 Ultra chip and 512GB RAM can run a 4-bit quantized version of DeepSeek R1 \u2014 a state-of-the-art open-source reasoning model \u2014 right on your desktop. It\u2019s not perfect \u2014 quantization reduces precision, and the memory bandwidth is a bottleneck that limits performance \u2014 but this is something you simply can\u2019t do with a standalone Nvidia chip, pro or consumer. The former can, of course, be interconnected, giving you superior performance, but that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars all-in; the only real alternative for home use would be a server CPU and gobs of RAM, but that\u2019s even slower, and you have to put it together yourself.\n\nApple didn\u2019t, of course, explicitly design the M3 Ultra for R1; the architectural decisions undergirding this chip were surely made years ago. In fact, if you want to include the critical decision to pursue a unified memory architecture, then your timeline has to extend back to the late 2000s, whenever the key architectural decisions were made for Apple\u2019s first A4 chip, which debuted in the original iPad in 2010.\n\nRegardless, the fact of the matter is that you can make a strong case that Apple is the best consumer hardware company in AI, and this week affirmed that reality.\n\nApple Intelligence vs. Apple Silicon\n\nIt\u2019s probably a coincidence that the delay in Apple Intelligence and the release of the M3 Ultra happened in the same week, but it\u2019s worth comparing and contrasting why one looks foolish and one looks wise.\n\nApple Silicon\n\nStart with the latter: Tony Fadell told me the origin story of Apple Silicon in a 2022 Stratechery Interview; the context of the following quote was his effusive praise for Samsung, which made the chips for the iPod and the first several models of the iPhone:\n\nSamsung was an incredible partner. Even though they got sued, they were an incredible partner, they had to exist for the iPod to be as successful and for the iPhone to even exist. That happened. During that time, obviously Samsung was rising up in terms of its smartphones and Android and all that stuff, and that\u2019s where things fell apart. At the same time, there was the strategic thing going on with Intel versus ARM in the iPad, and then ultimately iPhone where there\u2019s that fractious showdown that I had with various people at Apple, including Steve, which was Steve wanted to go Intel for the iPad and ultimately the iPhone because that\u2019s the way we went with the Mac and that was successful. And I was saying, \u201cNo, no, no, no! Absolutely not!\u201d And I was screaming about it and that\u2019s when Steve was, well after Intel lost the challenge, that\u2019s when Steve was like, \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to go do our own ARM.\u201d And that\u2019s where we bought P.A. Semi. So there was the Samsung thing happening, the Intel thing happening, and then it\u2019s like we need to be the master of our own destiny. We can\u2019t just have Samsung supplying our processors because they\u2019re going to end up in their products. Intel can\u2019t deliver low power embedded the way we would need it and have the culture of quick turns, they were much more standard product and non custom products and then we also have this, \u201cWe got to have our own strategy to best everyone\u201d. So all of those things came together to make what happened happen to then ultimately say we need somebody like TSMC to build more and more of our chips. I just want to say, never any of these things are independently decisions, they were all these things tied together for that to pop out of the oven, so to speak.\n\nThis is such a humbling story for me as a strategy analyst; I\u2019d like to spin up this marvelous narrative about Apple\u2019s foresight with Apple Silicon, but like so many things in business, it turns out the best consumer AI chips were born out of pragmatic realities like Intel not being competitive in mobile, and Samsung becoming a smartphone competitor.\n\nUltimately, though, the effort is characterized by four critical qualities:\n\nTime: Apple has been working on Apple Silicon for 17 years.\n\nMotivation: Apple was motivated to build Apple Silicon because having competitive and differentiated mobile chips was deemed essential to their business.\n\nDifferentiation: Apple\u2019s differentiation has always been rooted in the integration of hardware and software, and controlling their own chips let them do exactly that, wringing out unprecedented efficiency in particular.\n\nIteration: The M3 Ultra isn\u2019t Apple\u2019s first chip; it\u2019s not even the first M chip; heck, it\u2019s not even the first M3! It\u2019s the result of 17 years of iteration and experimentation.\n\nApple Intelligence\n\nNotice how these qualities differ when it comes to Apple Intelligence:\n\nTime: The number one phrase that has been used to characterize Apple\u2019s response to the ChatGPT moment in November 2022 is flat-footed, and that matches what I have heard anecdotally. That, by extension, means that Apple has been working on Apple Intelligence for at most 28 months, and that is almost certainly generous, given that the company likely took a good amount of time to figure out what its approach would be. That not nothing \u2014 xAI went from company formation to Grok 3 in 19 months \u2014 but it\u2019s certainly not 17 years!\n\nMotivation: If you look at Apple\u2019s earnings calls in the wake of ChatGPT, February 2023, May 2023, and August 2023, all contain some variation of \u201cAI and machine learning have been integrated into our products for years, and we\u2019ll continue to be thoughtful about how we implement them\u201d; finally in November 2023 CEO Tim Cook said the company was working on something new:\n\nIn terms of generative AI, we have \u2014 obviously, we have work going on. I\u2019m not going to get into details about what it is, because, as you know, we don\u2019t \u2014 we really don\u2019t do that. But you can bet that we\u2019re investing, we\u2019re investing quite a bit, we\u2019re going to do it responsibly and it will \u2014 you will see product advancements over time that where the \u2014 those technologies are at the heart of them.\n\nFirst, this obviously has bearing on the \u201ctime\u201d point above; secondly, one certainly gets the sense that Apple, after tons of industry hype and incessant questions from analysts, very much representing the concerns of shareholders, felt like they had no choice but to be doing something with generative AI. In other words \u2014 and yes, this is very much driving with the rearview mirror \u2014 Apple didn\u2019t seem to be working on generative AI because they felt it was essential to their product vision, but rather because they had to keep up with what everyone else was doing.\n\nDifferentiation: This is the most alluring part of the Apple Intelligence vision, which I myself hyped up from the beginning: Apple\u2019s exclusive access to its users\u2019 private information. What is interesting to consider, however, beyond the security implications, is the difference between \u201cexclusivity\u201d and \u201cintegration\u201d.\n\nConsider your address book: the iOS SDK included the Contacts API, which gave any app on the system full access to your contacts without requiring explicit user permission. This was essential to the early success of services like WhatsApp, which cleverly bootstrapped your network by using phone numbers as unique IDs; this meant that pre-existing username-based networks like Skype and AIM were actually at a disadvantage on iOS. iMessage did the same thing when it launched in 2011, and then Apple started requiring user permission to access your contacts in 2012.\n\nEven this amount of access, however, paled in comparison to the Mac, where developers could access information from anywhere on the system. iOS, on the other hand, put apps in sandboxes, cut off from other apps and system information outside of APIs like the Contacts API, all of which have become more and more restricted over time. Apple made these decisions for very good reasons, to be clear: iOS is a much safer and secure environment than macOS; increased restrictions generally mean increased privacy, albeit at the cost of decreased competition.\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth pointing out that exclusive access to data is downstream of a policy choice to exclude third parties; this is distinct from the sort of hardware and software integration that Apple can exclusively deliver in the pursuit of superior performance. This distinction is subtle, to be sure, but I think it\u2019s notable that Apple Silicon\u2019s differentiation was in the service of building a competitive moat, while Apple Intelligence\u2019s differentiation was about maintaining one.\n\nIteration: From one perspective, Apple Intelligence is the opposite of an evolved system: Apple put together an entire suite of generative AI capabilities, and aimed to launch them all in iOS 18. Some of these, like text manipulation and message summaries, were straightforward and made it out the door without a problem; others, particularly the reimagined Siri and its integration with 3rd party apps and your personal data, are now delayed. It appears Apple tried to do too much all at once.\n\nThe Incumbent Advantage\n\nAt the same time, it\u2019s not as if Siri is new; the voice assistant launched in 2011, alongside iMessage. In fact, though, Siri has always tried to do too much too soon; I wrote last week about the differences between Siri and Alexa, and how Amazon was wise to focus their product development on the basics \u2014 speed and accuracy \u2014 while making Alexa \u201cdumber\u201d than Siri tried to be, particularly in its insistence on precise wording instead of attempting to figure out what you meant.\n\nTo that end, this speaks to how Apple could have been more conservative in its generative AI approach (and, I fear, Amazon too, given my skepticism of Alexa+): simply make a Siri that works. The fact of the matter is that Siri has always struggled with delivering on its promised functionality, but a lot of its shortcomings could have been solved by generative AI. Apple, however, promised much more than this at last year\u2019s WWDC: Siri wasn\u2019t simply going to work better, it was actually going to understand and integrate your personal data and 3rd-party apps in a way that had never been done before.\n\nAgain, I applauded this at the time, so this is very much Monday-morning quarterbacking. I increasingly suspect, however, we are seeing a symptom of big-company disease that I hadn\u2019t previously considered: while one failure state in the face of new technology is moving too slowly, the opposite failure state is assuming you can do too much too quickly, when simply delivering the basics would be more than good enough.\n\nConsider home automation: the big three players in the space are Siri and Alexa and Google Assistant. What makes these companies important is not simply that they have devices you can put in your home and talk to, but also that there is an entire ecosystem of products which work with them. Given that, consider two possible products in the space:\n\nOpenAI releases a ChatGPT speaker that you can talk to and interact with; it works brilliantly and controls, well, it doesn\u2019t control anything, because the ecosystem hasn\u2019t adopted it. OpenAI would need to work diligently to build out partnerships with everyone from curtain makers to smart light to locks and more; that\u2019s hard enough in its own right, and even more difficult when you consider that many of these objects are only installed once and updated rarely.\n\nApple or Amazon or Google update their voice assistants with basic LLMs. Now, instead of needing to use precise language, you can just say whatever you want, and the assistant can figure it out, along with all of the other LLM niceties like asking about random factoids.\n\nIn this scenario the Apple/Amazon/Google assistants are superior, even if their underlying LLMs are worse, or less capable than OpenAI\u2019s offering, because what the companies are selling is not a standalone product but an ecosystem. That\u2019s the benefit of being a big incumbent company: you have other advantages you can draw on beyond your product chops.\n\nWhat is striking about new Siri \u2014 and, I worry, Alexa+ \u2014 is the extent to which they are focused on being compelling products in their own right. It\u2019s very clever for Siri to remember who I had coffee with; it\u2019s very useful \u2014 and probably much more doable \u2014 to reliably turn my lights on and off. Apple (and I suspect Amazon) should have absolutely nailed the latter before promising to deliver the former.\n\nIf you want to be generous to Apple you could make the case that this was what they were trying to deliver with the Siri Intents expansion: developers could already expose parts of their apps to Siri for things like music playback, and new Siri was to build on that framework to enhance its knowledge about a user\u2019s context to provide useful answers. This, though, put Apple firmly in control of the interaction layer, diminishing and commoditizing apps; that\u2019s what an Aggregator does, but what if Apple went in a different direction?\n\nAn AI Platform\n\nWhile my clearest delineation of the difference between Aggregators and Platforms is probably in A Framework for Regulating Competition on the Internet, perhaps the most romantic was in Tech\u2019s Two Philosophies:\n\nThere is certainly an argument to be made that these two philosophies arise out of their historical context; it is no accident that Apple and Microsoft, the two \u201cbicycle of the mind\u201d companies, were founded only a year apart, and for decades had broadly similar business models: sure, Microsoft licensed software, while Apple sold software-differentiated hardware, but both were and are at their core personal computer companies and, by extension, platforms. Google and Facebook, on the other hand, are products of the Internet, and the Internet leads not to platforms but to Aggregators. While platforms need 3rd parties to make them useful and build their moat through the creation of ecosystems, Aggregators attract end users by virtue of their inherent usefulness and, over time, leave suppliers no choice but to follow the Aggregators\u2019 dictates if they wish to reach end users. The business model follows from these fundamental differences: a platform provider has no room for ads, because the primary function of a platform is to provide a stage for the applications that users actually need to shine. Aggregators, on the other hand, particularly Google and Facebook, deal in information, and ads are simply another type of information. Moreover, because the critical point of differentiation for Aggregators is the number of users on their platform, advertising is the only possible business model; there is no more important feature when it comes to widespread adoption than being \u201cfree.\u201d Still, that doesn\u2019t make the two philosophies any less real: Google and Facebook have always been predicated on doing things for the user, just as Microsoft and Apple have been built on enabling users and developers to make things completely unforeseen.\n\nI said this was romantic, but the reality of Apple\u2019s relationship with developers, particularly over the last few years as the growth of the iPhone has slowed, has been considerably more antagonistic. Apple gives lip service to the role developers played in making the iPhone a compelling platform \u2014 and in collectively forming a moat for iOS and Android \u2014 but its actions suggest that Apple views developers as a commodity: necessary in aggregate, but mostly a pain in the ass individually.\n\nThis is all very unfortunate, because Apple \u2014 in conjunction with its developers \u2014 is being presented with an incredible opportunity by AI, and it\u2019s one that takes them back to their roots: to be a platform.\n\nStart with the hardware: while the M3 Ultra is the biggest beast on the block, all of Apple\u2019s M chips are highly capable, particularly if you have plenty of RAM. I happen to have an M2 MacBook Pro with 96GB of memory (I maxed out for this specific use case), which lets me run Mixtral 8x22B, an open-source model from Mistral with 141 billion parameters, at 4-bit quantization; I asked it a few questions:\n\nYou don\u2019t need to actually try and read the screen-clipping; the output is pretty good, albeit not nearly as detailed and compelling as what you might expect from a frontier model. What\u2019s amazing is that it exists at all: that answer was produced on my computer with my M2 chip, not in the cloud on an Nvidia datacenter GPU. I didn\u2019t need to pay a subscription, or worry about rate limits. It\u2019s my model on my device.\n\nWhat\u2019s arguably even more impressive is seeing models run on your iPhone:\n\nThis is a much smaller model, and correspondingly less capable, but the fact it is running locally on a phone is amazing!\n\nApple is doing the same thing with the models that undergird Apple Intelligence \u2014 some models run on your device, and others on Apple\u2019s Private Cloud Compute \u2014 but those models aren\u2019t directly accessible by developers; Apple only exposes writing tools, image playground, and Genmoji. And, of course, they ask for your app\u2019s data for Siri, so they can be the AI Aggregator. If a developer wants to do something unique, they need to bring their own model, which is not only very large, but hard to optimize for a specific device.\n\nWhat Apple should do instead is make its models \u2014 both local and in Private Cloud Compute \u2014 fully accessible to developers to make whatever they want. Don\u2019t limit them to cutesy-yet-annoying frameworks like Genmoji or sanitized-yet-buggy image generators, and don\u2019t assume that the only entity that can create something compelling using developer data is the developer of Siri; instead return to the romanticism of platforms: enabling users and developers to make things completely unforeseen. This is something only Apple could do, and, frankly, it\u2019s something the entire AI industry needs.\n\nWhen the M1 chip was released I wrote an Article called Apple\u2019s Shifting Differentiation. It explained that while Apple had always been about the integration of hardware and software, the company\u2019s locus of differentiation had shifted over time:\n\nWhen OS X first came out, Apple\u2019s differentiation was software: Apple hardware was stuck on PowerPC chips, woefully behind Intel\u2019s best offerings, but developers in particular were lured by OS X\u2019s beautiful UI and Unix underpinnings.\n\nWhen Apple moved to Intel chips, its hardware was just as fast as Windows hardware, allowing its software differentiation to truly shine.\n\nOver time, as more and more applications moved to the web, the software differences came to matter less and less; that\u2019s why the M1 chip was important for the Mac\u2019s future.\n\nApple has the opportunity with AI to press its hardware advantage: because Apple controls the entire device, they can guarantee to developers the presence of particular models at a particular level of performance, backed by Private Cloud Compute; this, by extension, would encourage developers to experiment and build new kinds of applications that only run on Apple devices.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t necessarily preclude finally getting new Siri to work; the opportunity Apple is pursuing continues to make sense. At the same time, the implication of the company\u2019s differentiation shifting to hardware is that the most important job for Apple\u2019s software is to get out of the way; to use Apple\u2019s history as analogy, Siri is the PowerPC of Apple\u2019s AI efforts, but this is a self-imposed shortcoming. Apple is uniquely positioned to not do everything itself; instead of seeing developers as the enemy, Apple should deputize them and equip them in a way no one else in technology can.\n\nI wrote a follow-up to this Article in this Daily Update.",

            "content": "On Friday, Apple officially delayed the release of its promised iOS 18 Siri features. Those features, including personal context, on-screen awareness, and in-app actions, will now release \u201cin the coming year.\u201d We had already received hints that these features would be delayed, but now we know for sure. This leaves the question, what went wrong?\n\nApple\u2019s statement never gave a clear answer. The company said said that it\u2019s going to take longer than it thought, but never cited any specific reasons for the delays. However, some insights from Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman give us some potential answers for what went wrong.\n\nPoor Siri infrastructure\n\nWhile developing new Siri features for iOS 18, Apple didn\u2019t have the time to create one unified backend for handling all Siri requests. As a result, theres two systems, one for legacy commands, and one for more advanced ones. That complicates development, per Bloomberg:\n\nThe current iOS 18 version of Siri essentially has two brains: one that operates the legacy Siri commands, like timers and making calls, and another that handles more advanced queries. The latter capability will be able to tap user data and already is used to not get confused when people change their request mid-command. In order to get Apple Intelligence out the door as part of iOS 18, the company didn\u2019t have time to meld the two systems together. That means the software doesn\u2019t work as smoothly as it could.\n\nApple plans to release a unified system for iOS 19, but obviously that doesn\u2019t do anything for the iOS 18 features that it promised. Given Apple\u2019s usage of \u201cin the coming year\u201d rather than \u201cin the coming months\u201d, this likely means that the company wants to wait on the new Siri backend in iOS 19 to release these more advanced features.\n\nInternal problems\n\nAdditionally, Bloomberg reports that development for these new features hasn\u2019t necessarily gone smoothly, as one could assume. The report describes Apple engineers as \u201cracing to fix a rash of bugs\u201d, and states that engineers believe the features won\u2019t be ready until next year at the earliest, likely iOS 19.3 or later.\n\nApple software executive Craig Federighi also voiced concerns over the features, in their current form, not aligning with how Apple had marketed them to work:\n\nIn the lead-up to the latest delay, software chief Craig Federighi and other executives voiced strong concerns internally that the features didn\u2019t work properly \u2014 or as advertised \u2014 in their personal testing, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters.\n\nLastly, some Apple employees question whether or not the AI teams need better leadership, and that the company will continue to fall behind without a change in leadership:\n\nApple employees are questioning whether Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook or the company\u2019s board needs to take action to change the leadership of the AI group. They believe that, short of major changes, Apple will continue to fall behind.\n\nOverall, Apple is facing a heap of technical challenges headed into this, and the company likely would\u2019ve been better off not rushing into the AI craze. I\u2019m sure the allegedly poor leadership isn\u2019t helping the teams as well.\n\nMy favorite Apple accessories on Amazon:\n\nFollow Michael: X/Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram",

According to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman in today\u2019s Power On newsletter, Apple has postponed the device because it at least partially \u201crelies on the delayed Siri capabilities.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been rumored for months now that Apple was planning to release a device early this year that would serve as a smart home hub with a display, similar to devices that its main smart home competitors, Amazon and Google, have both offered for years. The device is expected to be the first Apple smart home hub with support for Apple Intelligence. It\u2019s also rumored to run on tvOS and support native Apple apps like Calendar, Notes, and, according to recent rumors, compatibility with Apple\u2019s Messages app.\n\nApple said last week that its upgraded smart assistant is taking \u201clonger than we thought,\u201d and will be released in the \u201ccoming year,\u201d hinting that it may not be an iOS 18 feature as originally promised.

The iPhone 17 Pro Max is said to be 8.725mm thick, up from the 8.25mm of its predecessor.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max could be thicker because of an expected camera redesign. Apple's rumored to take a page from Google with a large rectangular camera module spanning the length of the phone. Or the extra room could be to accommodate a larger battery.\n\nThe leaker suggests it's the latter, which is interesting since it's the first time we've heard about a possible battery upgrade for the iPhone 17 Pro Max.\n\nGranted, the iPhone 16 Pro Max's 4685 mAh battery is already nothing to sneeze at, averaging an impressive 17 hours and 35 minutes in our battery tests.\n\nBut there's always room for improvement. A bigger battery on the iPhone 17 Pro Max could land it a spot on our best phone battery life list, eking out a victory over competitors like the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro, which lasted nearly 19 hours in our tests, or the OnePLus 12R, which lasted 18 hours and 8 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from depth, the iPhone 17 Pro Max's frame seems virtually identical to the iPhone 16 Pro Max \u2014 and, most importantly, the iPhone 17 Air.\n\n\"The length, width, screen size, and bezel (same iPhone 16 Pro Max) of the iPhone 17 Air and iPhone 17 Pro Max are the same,\" IceUniverse wrote.\n\nThe trade-offs of a thinner iPhone\n\nMeanwhile, the iPhone 17 Air will be just 5.5mm thick, they said, undercutting Apple's thinnest handset to date, the iPhone 6, by 1.4mm. iPhones are already slim enough to fit in the skinniest of pockets, but the iPhone 17 Air could break hardware boundaries.\n\nOf course, that thinner profile comes with its own trade-offs. Chief of which is the cameras, or lack thereof. Apple's rumored to downgrade to just a single camera lens instead of the expected two on its flagships. The iPhone 17 Air is tipped to have only a 48MP rear lens, no ultrawide and certainly no telephote camera that remains a Pro iPhone exclusive.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis thin frame will reportedly support a 6.6-inch OLED display, a tad smaller than the iPhone 16 Plus\u2019 6.7-inch panel. There are also concerns that the slimmer design could mean the iPhone 17 Air gets stuck with a smaller battery capacity. Even if it shared the iPhone 17 series' more efficient A19 chipset, we wonder if the iPhone 17 Air would be able to last as long as the Plus model it's said to replace.\n\nWe'll know more in September when Apple's expected to launch its next series of iPhones.",

However, Apple is also considering making a version that doesn't involve you pointing an iPhone camera at things in the first place.\n\nAccording to Mark Gurman in Sunday's newsletter for Bloomberg, Apple is \"actively developing\" a product that can combine AirPods with cameras.\n\nThe idea is to have the cameras being able to provide data on the surrounding environment that can be used in AI features. For example, a query asking where the user is located may use local sign scans as a way to determine an approximate location, or a user could be told which way a shop is based on storefront imagery.\n\nGurman doesn't go into detail, but does state that the earbuds are being worked on by the company.\n\nBetter than smart glasses\n\nThe development of cameras in AirPods may sound like an unusual way of doing things, but it is a concept that has surfaced in rumors multiple times. Aside from being brought up in late January by Gurman, they also appeared in claims from December and October, with a potential arrival anticipated to be between two and three years away.\n\nThe cameras may not necessarily be full color version, but could instead use infrared sensors for depth mapping. Such a system could be used more for navigational purposes, and potentially use less power than the full video versions.\n\nWhile some may consider adding the cameras to smart glasses, such as the repeatedly rumored Apple Glass, adding cameras to AirPods could be a better move overall. For a start, the viewing angle could be a lot more broad than the typically front-facing camera seen in existing smart glasses.\n\nFor the design of smart glasses, weight is a major factor. By adding hardware and batteries, you're adding more weight to a typically lightweight item, which can gradually become more uncomfortable to wear for long periods.\n\nThere's already one Apple audio product that adds an extra feature as a minor tangent. The Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 include a blood monitoring sensor in each earbud, which feeds back data to an iPhone, in a form that could feasibly take a lot of weight thanks to its use of an earhook.\n\nThere's also the possibility of users being able to enjoy smart glasses-like features, without necessarily needing to wear glasses of any form. Or at least not needing to switch their traditional glasses frames if they are regular spectacle wearers.\n\nNot everyone particularly likes the idea of wearing glasses at all, hence the existence of contact lenses as an alternative. The term \"glasshole\" springs to mind here.\n\nBy including most of the functionality, barring visual elements, smart earbuds that can \"see\" the environment and provide audio feedback could be a viable alternative to smart glasses.\n\nIf Apple can capitalize on the idea and make it work enough to impress the public, it could be onto a winner.",

The promised Siri upgrades will be powered by Apple Intelligence, so you will need an iPhone 15 Pro or newer.\n\n\"We've also been working on a more personalized Siri, giving it more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps,\" said Apple, in a statement shared with Daring Fireball's John Gruber. \"It's going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.\"\n\nGurman said Apple was initially aiming to launch the more personalized Siri as part of iOS 18.4, which is already in beta and lacks any of the promised features. He then said that the features were delayed until iOS 18.5 in May, but Apple's statement suggests the features will take even longer to arrive. The more personalized Siri will likely launch at some point between iOS 19 in September 2025 and iOS 19.4 in March 2026.\n\nWhenever they launch, the Siri upgrades will include understanding of a user's personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls. For example, during its WWDC 2024 keynote, Apple showed an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info from the Mail and Messages apps.\n\nWith these new Siri capabilities rumored to be at the core of Apple's smart home hub, it would make sense if the company has pushed back its internal timeframe for launching the device. It's not ideal to launch one without the other. This is not an official delay, given that Apple never publicly announced plans to release a home hub, but it is clear that Apple has missed its internal targets for the more personalized Siri and this related project.\n\nGurman previously said the home hub would be \"Apple's most significant release of the year,\" as it represents the company's \"first step toward a bigger role in the smart home.\" He said the device will be like a \"smaller and cheaper iPad\" that lets users \"control appliances, conduct FaceTime chats, and handle other tasks.\"\n\nThe device is expected to be similar to a HomePod with a screen, with rumored features including a 6-inch or 7-inch display, an A18 chip, and Apple Intelligence support. Gurman said it can be attached to a tabletop base with a speaker, or mounted on a wall.\n\nSo, when will Apple's home hub launch? \"In the coming year\" probably applies here, too.",

            "content": "Simon Willison, one of the more authoritative independent voices in the LLM space right now, published a good theory on what may have happened with Apple\u2019s delay of Apple Intelligence\u2019s Siri personalization features:\n\nI have a hunch that this delay might relate to security. These new Apple Intelligence features involve Siri responding to requests to access information in applications and then perform actions on the user\u2019s behalf. This is the worst possible combination for prompt injection attacks! Any time an LLM-based system has access to private data, tools it can call and potentially malicious instructions (like emails and text messages from untrusted strangers) there\u2019s a risk that an attacker might subvert those tools and use them to damage or exfiltration a user\u2019s data.\n\nWillison has been writing about prompt injection attacks since 2023. We know that Mail\u2019s AI summaries were (at least initially?) sort of susceptible to prompt injections (using hidden HTML elements), as were Writing Tools during the beta period. It\u2019s scary to imagine what would happen with a well-crafted prompt injection when the attack\u2019s surface area becomes the entire assistant directly plugged into your favorite apps with your data. But then again, one has to wonder why these features were demoed at all at Apple\u2019s biggest software event last year and if those previews \u2013 absent a real, in-person event \u2013 were actually animated prototypes.\n\nOn this note, I disagree with Jason Snell\u2019s idea that previewing Apple Intelligence last year was a good move no matter what. Are we sure that \u201cnobody is looking\u201d at Apple\u2019s position in the AI space right now and that Siri isn\u2019t continuing down its path of damaging Apple\u2019s software reputation, like MobileMe did? As a reminder, the iPhone 16 lineup was advertised as \u201cbuilt for Apple Intelligence\u201d in commercials, interviews, and Apple\u2019s website.\n\nIf the company\u2019s executives are so certain that the 2024 marketing blitz worked, why are they pulling Apple Intelligence ads from YouTube when \u201cnobody is looking\u201d?\n\nOn another security note: knowing Apple\u2019s penchant for user permission prompts (Shortcuts and macOS are the worst offenders), I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the company tried to mitigate Siri\u2019s potential hallucinations and/or the risk of prompt injections with permission dialogs everywhere, and later realized the experience was terrible. Remember: Apple announced an App Intents-driven system with assistant schemas that included actions for your web browser, file manager, camera, and more. Getting any of those actions wrong (think: worse than not picking your mom up at the airport, but actually deleting some of your documents) could have pretty disastrous consequences.\n\nRegardless of what happened, here\u2019s the kicker: according to Mark Gurman, \u201csome within Apple\u2019s AI division\u201d believe that the delayed Apple Intelligence features may be scrapped altogether and replaced by a new system rebuilt from scratch. From his story, pay close attention to this paragraph:\n\nThere are also concerns internally that fixing Siri will require having more powerful AI models run on Apple\u2019s devices. That could strain the hardware, meaning Apple either has to reduce its set of features or make the models run more slowly on current or older devices. It would also require upping the hardware capabilities of future products to make the features run at full strength.\n\nInference costs may have gone down over the past 12 months and context windows may have gotten bigger, but I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s only so much you can do locally with 8 GB of RAM when you have to draw on the user\u2019s personal context across (potentially) dozens of different apps, and then have conversations with the user about those results. It\u2019ll be interesting to watch what Apple does here within the next 1-2 years: more RAM for the same price on iPhones, even more tasks handed off to Private Cloud Compute, or a combination of both?\n\nWe\u2019ll see how this will play out at WWDC 2025 and beyond. I continue to think that Apple and Google have the most exciting takes on AI in terms of applying the technology to user\u2019s phones and apps they use everyday. The only difference is that one company\u2019s announcements were theoretical, and the other\u2019s are shipping today. It seems clear now that Apple got caught off guard by LLMs while they were going down the Vision Pro path, and I\u2019ll be curious to see how their marketing strategy will play out in the coming months.",

            "content": "Apple has been working to harden the XNU kernel that powers its various operating systems, including iOS and macOS, with a feature called \"exclaves.\"\n\nThe term appears to have first surfaced in a libc file in Apple's open source software collection in 2023, and subsequently within iOS 17, released in September of that year, as later noted by Howard Oakley on his Eclectic Light Co blog.\n\nExclaves, Oakley observed last June, are believed to implement \"domains isolated from the kernel that protect key functions in macOS even when the kernel becomes compromised. This in turn suggests that Apple is in the process of refactoring the kernel into a central microkernel with protected exclaves.\"\n\nCurrent Apple chips have a Secure Enclave, a dedicated secure subsystem integrated into the device's system-on-chip (SoC). It's separate from the application processor kernel as a defense against compromise. It's used for operations that need strong security like the processing of encryption keys.\n\nAn enclave is defined as an area within a territorial boundary. So an exclave is an area outside of a boundary with ties to the main territory.\n\nThe XNU kernel, as Apple's documentation explains, is \"a hybrid kernel combining the Mach kernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University with components from FreeBSD and a C++ API for writing drivers called IOKit.\"\n\nIt is hybrid in the sense that it combines the Mach microkernel with the BSD monolithic kernel.\n\nEach architectural approach has different disadvantages. Microkernel designs face the challenge of dealing with the overhead of inter-process communication (IPC) between user-space servers and the kernel. Monolithic designs operate in a shared address space, so security compromises are potentially more damaging \u2013 once defenses have been bypassed, there's no further barrier to sensitive data.\n\nAccording to a security researcher who has explored Apple's kernel fiddling under the name Random Augustine, Apple's development of exclaves represents a major shift in its security architecture. Essentially, Apple is trying to realize the security advantages of a microkernel without tossing the monolithic aspects of XNU.\n\nBased on the references to exclaves in the XNU source for Apple's Arm-compatible M4 chips and the A18 processors used in iPhone 16, our source argues that exclaves form the basis of a significant redesign of XNU's security model.\n\n\"In iOS 18, exclaves refer to specific resources that are separated from the main iOS kernel (XNU) and cannot be accessed by it, even if the kernel is compromised,\" the researcher explained in a document shared with The Register.\n\n\"These resources are predefined when the OS is built, are identified by name or id, have different types, are initialized at boot time, and are organized into unique domains.\"\n\nThese resources include:\n\nShared memory buffers that can be accessed by both the kernel and the exclave, with the option to make them read-only or read-write to XNU.\n\nAudio buffers and sensors that are used for securing features like the camera and microphone access indicators.\n\nConclaves that group multiple resources into their own secure domains.\n\nServices that offer executable code within the exclave space when called upon by threads in XNU.\n\nThese resources are protected from XNU via enclave-specific page-types via the Secure Page Table Monitor, a hardware security functionality introduced with the arrival of the A15 chip and iOS 17. This makes Apple's operating systems more secure by compartmentalizing sensitive services, such that the compromise of one doesn't process access to the entire kernel address space.\n\nApple has enabled the execution of exclave services via a new Secure Kernel (SK). The researcher Random Augustine has observed that while the SK image file contains a version string for \"cL4,\" a possible reference to the L4-embedded used with the original SepOS (Secure Enclave Processor OS) cL4 kernel, the IPC structures used by XNU to communicate with SK look more like seL4, a high-assurance microkernel.\n\nIt's adding defense in depth and isolating more parts of the OS from each other\n\nGernot Heiser, a computer science professor at UNSW Sydney and the founding chairman of the seL4 Foundation, via Bluesky has suggested that Apple's SK is probably not an seL4 adaptation, which would be a GPL violation, but rather is a fresh implementation.\n\nThe obvious reason Apple would undertake this work is to improve security generally, which benefits the super-corp and its customers. The less obvious reason is that AI workloads running on-device and communicating with Apple's Private Cloud Compute infrastructure potentially expand the attack surface, so it makes sense to mitigate the blast radius of attacks by adopting microkernel architecture.\n\n\"This isn't aimed at a particular vulnerability \u2013 it's adding defense in depth and isolating more parts of the OS from each other,\" Random Augustine opined.\n\n\"So an attacker will need to find an extra vulnerability to attack things held in exclaves or to escape an exclave. Exclaves will likely be much harder to escape because they are running in a microkernel environment. Some of the code and libraries over there are also written in Swift which should increase memory safety.\"\n\nOur source reports inquiring to an Apple engineer about why the iGiant hasn't been talking up this technology. The reason is, we're told, that Apple hasn't yet finished the project and likely doesn't yet have the confidence to make security claims.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment. \u00ae",

Sign up\n\nStarting with the Apple II and Macintosh, Apple redefined personal computing and then came to dominate how it functioned. In 2001, when desk and laptop computing became saturated with competitors, Apple extended computing into devices with the iPod. The iPod and the notion of device-driven computing set the stage for the iPhone which was introduced in 2007.\n\nSince then, Apple, and the world, have never been the same. By 2023, iPhone sales reached $200 billion, accounting for over 52% of Apple's total revenue of $383 billion, reflecting the company's ability to redefine markets and then dominate them.\n\nIn terms of importance, sales of the iPhone extend well beyond the mobile device market. Now, there are an estimated 1.4 billion iPhone users in the world.\n\nWhile they have driven Apple's earnings, they have also done something else. They have knitted 1.4 billion users to the Apple ecosystem so tightly that the bond is almost unshakable. Apple has capitalized on the bond with an array of services that now represent the fastest-growing revenue segment of the company.\n\nRevenues associated with the App Store, iTunes Store, AppleCare, iCloud, licensing, music, television and credit cards have grown at approximately 18% annually and now represent $85 billion in sales. Services sales are almost as large as Apple's Mac, iPad and wearables businesses combined.\n\nBut it's not just the top line that matters. Stock prices are driven by earnings. And services have dramatically higher margins. For 2023, the gross margin on services was 71%, almost double the gross margin for products, which was approximately 38%.\n\nAnother key factor for Apple's success is its ability to grow revenues with a brand that increases customer loyalty and supports premium pricing. Anyone who has bought an iPhone knows how expensive they are.\n\nBut it's not just premium pricing. Over time, Apple has been able to make more profit from each sale it makes. In 2014, Apple's gross margin was 38.6%. In 2023, it was 44.3%. Improvement in the gross margin has propelled Apple's net income, which has grown, on average, 10.5% annually since 2014 and stood at $97 billion in 2023.\n\nWhile net income has grown at 10% annually, the earnings per share between 2014 and 2023 has grown at an average annual rate of 16%. Earnings per share have accelerated faster than net income because Apple aggressively buys back its stock , reducing its share count from 23.5 billion shares in 2014 to 15.5 billion shares in 2023.\n\nIn 2023 alone, Apple repurchased $76.6 billion of its own shares, with about $74 billion remaining under its current buyback program auguring for continued share repurchases.\n\nOverall, Apple's phenomenal nearly 170,000% increase in share price since its initial public offering (IPO) is the result of its relentless innovation, strategic expansion into services, well-earned premium pricing, and consistent revenue growth.\n\nAs Apple continues to innovate and explore new technologies, its growth story remains compelling and the story about Apple's return to shareholders has not yet been fully told.\n\nNote: This content first appeared in Louis Navellier's latest book, The Sacred Truths of Investing: Finding Growth Stocks that Will Make You Rich , which was published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

In the past two decades, shares have generated a total return of greater than 18,000%, boosted by the introduction of popular hardware devices and services.\n\nIf you had been fortunate enough to make just a $5,500 investment in the business in March 2005, you'd be sitting on a seven-figure sum today. The bulls hope the future can offer a similar reward.\n\nCould Apple be a millionaire-maker stock?\n\nIncredible competitive position\n\nThere's no valid argument that points to Apple not being a fantastic business. It all starts with the brand and its position in the market, which is recognized for high-quality, innovative, and easy-to-use offerings. Apple is also a premium brand, supported by in-demand hardware devices that see solid global demand.\n\nThe company possesses pricing power, although it might not be as obvious as it has been in previous years. For its newest iPhone models, Apple charges four-figure sums. And there probably wouldn't be too much consumer pushback if the prices rose slightly more.\n\nHardware is crucial to Apple's story. However, software and services are becoming increasingly important. In the fiscal 2025 first quarter, 21.2% of sales came from this source, a proportion that has increased over time. And this segment produces a stellar 75% gross margin, much better than hardware.\n\nServices are also critical to Apple's competitive position in a different way. They help create the company's powerful ecosystem, which is the invaluable combination of products and services that keep customers locked in. The legendary Warren Buffett demonstrated this favorable position by arguing that if you offered someone $10,000 with the condition that they could never use an iPhone again, that person would probably decline.\n\nApple is one of the most financially sound companies on Earth. It generated a jaw-dropping $36.3 billion in net income in Q1. This profitability results in sizable free cash flow.\n\nManagement returns a lot of this to shareholders. In the last three months, Apple paid $3.9 billion in dividends and repurchased $23.6 billion worth of its outstanding shares.\n\nWeak return prospects\n\nThere's no shortage of reasons to like this business. Apple has become such a dominant force for a reason, and investors should at least keep the company on their watchlists. It's also a nice vote of confidence that Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway still owns 300 million shares.\n\nBut I don't believe this stock is a millionaire maker. The current valuation is a major headwind. As of this writing, shares trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37.8. In the past 10 years, the P/E multiple has averaged 22.9, so the setup right now isn't attractive by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nPaying that valuation makes sense if Apple can produce strong growth. However, this likely won't be the case. According to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, the company's revenue and earnings per share are projected to increase at compound annual rates of 6.6% and 10.6%, respectively, between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2027. That's nothing to write home about.\n\nWith an annual sales base approaching $400 billion, it's difficult to move the needle. Plus, consumers aren't rushing to upgrade to the newest devices like they have in the past.\n\nNot only do I believe Apple isn't a millionaire-maker stock, I'm not confident it can outperform the broader S&P 500 in the years ahead, either. The best thing investors can do is wait until there's a much more compelling buying opportunity.",

            "content": "The biggest Apple news of the week was the announcement of a sky blue MacBook Air and an M3-powered iPad Air; however, in the deals world, it was all about the Apple Watch Series 10. That\u2019s because, right now, Apple\u2019s flagship smartwatch is on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy in its 42mm base configuration with Wi-Fi starting at $299 ($100 off), its lowest price to date. You can also grab it in the larger 46mm variant at Amazon and Best Buy for $329 (also $100 off).\n\nApple\u2019s latest mainline watch is a pretty minor update of the Series 9, though that\u2019s not to say the iterative changes aren\u2019t welcome. The bigger, wide-angle OLED display makes text more visible from just about every angle, and at a mere 9.7mm thick, it\u2019s noticeably thinner than the Apple Watch Ultra. The latest Series is also outfitted with a larger charging coil inside, which translates into significantly faster charging. In fact, the Series 10 can go from zero to 80 percent in just 30 minutes, which makes its 18-hour battery far less of a concern.\n\nThat said, the more significant updates arguably come in the form of FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection and support for watchOS 11. The former leverages the watch\u2019s accelerometer while you sleep to detect minor wrist movements linked with breathing disturbances, which Apple can use to alert you of either moderate or severe sleep apnea. Support for the latest version of watchOS, meanwhile, means you\u2019ll be able to make use of several training-focused fitness features, smarter widgets, and \u2014 my personal favorite \u2014 the ability to pause your Activity Rings. After all, recovery days are essential, too.\n\nMore deals and discounts of note\n\nVerge Deals Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we\u2019ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "Jason Hiner/ZDNET\n\nIt's never a good sign when I start writing an article about a new product announcement and my biggest concern is whether I'll be able to complete the article with my credit card intact.\n\nMy daily driver is a well-equipped Mac Studio, but it's getting a few years old now, and I've noticed it running out of steam for some of my complex 3D models and occasionally when doing video production.\n\nAlso: The new iPad Air with M3 is here - with an updated Magic Keyboard to match\n\nI chose not to buy the tiny-but-mighty M4 Mac Mini, despite how adorable it is, because it lacks a front SD card slot, which I use constantly. But as of today, Apple is introducing a new Mac Studio, and this thing has heft in all the right places.\n\nSo there's a real question about whether or not I can keep my credit card safe and sound, give myself a few months for the news to sit in and to save up, or whether sometime in the next hour or two, I'm going to find myself in a bit of debt, once again, to Apple's overlords.\n\nWhat's a Mac Studio?\n\nPut simply, the Mac Studio is the desktop Mac that pros have always wanted. While many people connect their laptops to big monitors when docked, some folks crave machines with gobs of memory, an almost unlimited pile of ports, and hefty power.\n\nFor years, the choices were a little challenging to navigate.\n\nThe iMac often had the right amount of power and ports, but you had to deal with Apple's screen, which never seemed big enough. If you chose to add a second screen, you still had that big beast taking up space.\n\nFor about a year, I had my then fairly long-in-the-tooth maxed-out iMac sitting face down on a shelf next to my desk so I could use monitors I preferred.\n\nAlso: Apple's new MacBook Air M4 is a multiscreen lover's dream, and it's only $999\n\nThe Mac Pro was simply ludicrous. After about a decade of a practical tower design, Apple introduced a machine that resembled a trash can. It didn't tolerate much in the way of add-ons, and it was very expensive. Then Apple introduced a redesigned Intel-based Mac Pro, and it was a study in wildly expensive compromise.\n\nIn 2023, Apple used the same form factor, but introduced a barely expandable Mac Pro based on the M2. It was, essentially, a bigger Mac Studio.\n\nThe other desktop Mac option in the years before the Mac Studio was (and still is) the Mac Mini. I've bought at least ten of these machines because they have excellent price/performance, a good selection of ports, and you can use them in a wide range of applications without them taking up too much space.\n\nBut then, in 2022, Apple introduced the Mac Studio. It was the same shape as the pre-M4 Mac Minis, but had the ability to run the fastest processors, mondo-gobs of RAM, and lordy-lordy, did it have ports. It even had (it still makes me weep with happiness) an SD card slot on the front of the machine.\n\nIt was glorious.\n\nSo, in 2022, I spent $3,799 and bought myself an M1 Max-based Mac Studio with 64GB and 4TB internal storage. Adding three years of AppleCare+ brought the grand total to $3,968.\n\nFor the past six months, though, it hasn't been enough. I've been waiting. And now, it's here.\n\nApple\n\nThe new 2025 Mac Studio\n\nAt WWDC in 2023, Apple did introduce an M2-based Mac Studio, but there wasn't a big enough jump in power to justify spending the price. At that time, I hadn't started hitting walls on my M1, and by the time I did, Apple was shipping M3 and M4 devices -- but not a Mac Studio based on either chipset.\n\nThat brings us to today. Apple is shipping two variants of the new Mac Studio, one based on the M4 Max and one based on the new M3 Ultra. And yeah, there's an M3 that's newer than the M4. Someone in Apple's product marketing needs a good scolding for that.\n\nBeyond the processors, there are other spec jumps in the new Mac Studio, but it looks and feels just like the M1 and M2 generations. So let's talk about those two processors.\n\nAlso: Meet the M3 Ultra: Apple's most powerful chip yet offers big leaps in performance\n\nHere's the key point: Apple's Ultra series chips are essentially two complete chips in a single package. The M3 Ultra is fundamentally two M3 Max chips grafted together.\n\nThat means you need to think about processes and tasks to get your head around which is for you.\n\nApple is only providing benchmarks in comparison to the M1 Max I have in my Mac Studio. According to them, the new one is 3.5 times faster. But a key point is that, all other things being equal, the M4 Max will be faster than the M3 Max.\n\nThat means that processes that run well on one chip will be faster in the M4 Max version of the Mac Studio. But grafting the two older-generation chips together means that the combined processor can address double the RAM, and for certain parallelizable tasks (including AI), the doubled processor will massively speed up workloads.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that just adding that chip will add $2,000 to the price of the machine. It's a big leap for a fairly special-purpose configuration. I'll come back to price in a minute.\n\nLet's just finish up with the one other spec that makes this interesting: Thunderbolt 5.\n\nThe new Mac Studio has Thunderbolt 5. The 2022 and 2023 models had Thunderbolt 4. Assuming you have devices that can handle it, Thunderbolt 5 is about three times faster than Thunderbolt 4.\n\nSo you get four Thunderbolt 5 ports (which also support USB-C), two USB-A ports, an HDMI port, two front-facing USB-C ports, and that front-facing SD card slot.\n\nOh, yeah, and it supports Apple Intelligence. Yay?\n\nApple\n\nLet's talk pricing\n\nThe base-model M4 Max Mac Studio starts at $1,999. That gets you a 14-core CPU, 32-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine (AI processor). It also gets you 36GB RAM, a paltry 512GB SSD storage, and all those ports.\n\nBy contrast, the machine based on the M3 Ultra starts at $3,999, but you get a 28-core CPU, 60-core GPU, and 32-core Neural Engine (AI processor). It also gets you 96GB RAM, 1TB SSD storage, and all those ports.\n\nIf you want to upgrade the M4 Mac Studio with more memory, you have to spend $300 first to upgrade the M4 Max chip to a 16-core CPU and 40-core GPU. Then you can buy expensive memory and storage.\n\nTo match the configuration I bought back in 2022, my price would now be $3,899. The extra hundred bucks over my spend back in 2022 is because what's now a $300 jump in chip price for a few more cores was a $200 jump back then.\n\nAlso: M3 MacBook Air vs. M2 MacBook Air: Which Apple laptop should you buy?\n\nWhat's a bit daunting to me is that the machine I'd buy now wouldn't be spec'd with a mere 64GB RAM. That's part of what I'm bumping into. If I wanted to move from 64GB to 128GB RAM (the max that the M4 Max supports), my price would be $4,699.\n\nYou can see why I'm going to try to hold out a little longer and save my pennies.\n\nBut then we get to the Ultra model. This bad boy increases the max out for RAM and SSD. Instead of maxing at 128GB RAM, it can go all the way to 512GB. And instead of maxing out with an 8GB SSD, it can go all the way to 16GB.\n\nAre you sitting down? Because if you want to max out your RAM all the way, you first have to upgrade that M3 Ultra from 28 CPU cores to 32 CPU cores and from 60 GPU cores to 80 GPU cores. Those cores don't come cheap. That's a $1,200 upgrade on top of the $2,000 the M3 Ultra costs on top of the base Mac Studio.\n\nBottom line, if you want the top-of-the-line Mac Studio with all the fixin's, you're looking at a bill of $14,099. That's still a lot less than Mac Pro pricing, and it will definitely get you a powerhouse. But it's way, way out of my reach. Fortunately, I don't need that much power. If you do, you know who you are.\n\nFor now, my credit card is safe\n\nReaders regularly tell me that they find it helpful when I share my reasoning for buying or not buying something. Obviously, everyone's needs are different, and I am a bit of an edge case with my gear purchases. But the thinking process I use can be incorporated by almost everyone.\n\nSo here's my thinking.\n\n$5,000-ish is a lot of money. I finished the project that was straining my current Mac Studio, and nothing I'm doing right now is causing it difficulty. Preorders start today, and shipments and store availability will begin next week, on March 12.\n\nTypically, when I've ordered Macs from Apple, they arrive within a week or two. So I'm going to wait until I'm working on (or about to work on) another project that will strain my device. Knowing there's a suitable machine available reduces some of the stress, and as soon as I know I'll be needing more horsepower, I'll pony up the bucks.\n\nAre you considering upgrading to the new Mac Studio, or does your current setup still meet your needs?\n\nDo the M4 Max and M3 Ultra options make sense to you, or is Apple's chip naming convention just confusing? How important are features like Thunderbolt 5 and expanded RAM to your workflow?\n\nAnd when it comes to pricing, do you think Apple is offering good value for the power, or is it pushing the limits of what professionals will pay?

The work has been unsuccessful, according to people involved in the efforts, and they now believe the features won\u2019t be released until next year at the earliest.\n\nIn the lead-up to the latest delay, software chief Craig Federighi and other executives voiced strong concerns internally that the features didn\u2019t work properly \u2014 or as advertised \u2014 in their personal testing, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nSome within Apple\u2019s AI division believe that work on the features could be scrapped altogether, and that Apple may have to rebuild the functions from scratch. The capabilities would then be delayed until a next-generation Siri that Apple hopes to begin rolling out in 2026.\n\nThe company first demonstrated the features during its Worldwide Developers Conference last June, part of an unveiling of the Apple Intelligence AI platform. At the same annual event this year, Apple isn\u2019t planning to show off any big AI breakthroughs. Instead, it will focus on integrating Apple Intelligence into more of its apps.\n\nThe delays \u2014 especially of announced features \u2014 are embarrassing for Apple and add more evidence to the idea that the company is struggling in artificial intelligence. They also threaten to set back work on future improvements.\n\nApple had been planning to make Siri more ChatGPT-like and conversational next year. But now only the initial underpinnings for that upgrade are expected to be ready by 2026, during the iOS 19 release cycle. The actual interface that users experience likely won\u2019t arrive until iOS 20 in 2027, the people said.",

One of the virtual drummers is named \"aidan\", who apparently cannot find the CAPS key on his virtual MacBook. In Aidan's \"Portland Kit\" we find styles named with Portland, OR-specific titles, like \"Powell's World\" and \"Burnside.\" Okay, whatever. But one of the styles is named \"Jackpot.\" Now one might know that I've owned a studio in Portland named \"Jackpot!\" since 1997. And I've recorded many well-known \"indie rock\" records there. It also appears our virtual \"Drummer\" Aiden plays \"indie rock beats.\"\n\nI'm totally pissed off. I've spent my life serving the musicians of the Northwest and beyond with an affordable studio and great results. If a mega-huge corporation like APPLE Inc. wishes to create virtual drum beats for people to use, they can start thinking about making up their own names or licensing names that they think may give them a cachet. If my studio was named \"Abbey Road\" I can guarantee you that APPLE would never try and steal that name for their own products. Once again, I'm pissed. APPLE is using a name that they think sounds \"cool\" with no regard to what it may imply.\n\nI dropped my lawyer a line. It looks like no matter what, it would just cost me money to get them to cease and desist. It's certainly doubtful they would ever make reparations on this. It's bad enough that the tech sector has opened the gateway to hell and has destroyed independent labels, record stores and the like. Now they're happy to steal the \"idea\" of your hard work and your identity and sell it to the world. Your whole life can be sold off like some \"cool\" commodity. Great. Wonderful.\n\nFuck you, APPLE.",

However, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities published a note on Wednesday with more details on a foldable iPhone design that he had previously heard about.\n\nKuo, known for his Apple predictions and supply-chain sourcing, described the mysterious project as a \"top-tier iPhone\" with a \"crease-free inner display\" and an expected retail price of over $2000. The device could begin mass production in the last quarter of 2026, Kuo said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch a price tag would make it more expensive than any of its predecessors and many MacBook models, but Kuo said the iPhone's \"must-have\" status would attract a strong demand for a premium device if the quality is up to par. The iPhone 16 Pro Max is currently the priciest smartphone Apple offers starting at $1199.\n\n\"A phone with such a high price point affords Apple a true higher-end luxury offering to balance out the push on lower-priced alternatives like the iPhone 16e,\" Dipanjan Chatterjee, a Forrester analyst, told Business Insider.\n\nApple is currently facing fierce competition in the smartphone market as Chinese competitors offer lower-cost phones and high-end models with novel form factors.\n\nHuawei's tri-fold smartphone, the Mate XT. CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Apple could always change course and not release such a device. It's not unusual for Apple to put significant resources behind big projects and ultimately scrap them. The tech industry buzzed with talks of an Apple Car for years until the tech giant reportedly scrapped the project.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I definitely believe it's under development. I'm less sure it'll ever see the light of day,\" Morningstar analyst William Kerwin told BI of the foldable iPhone.\n\nKuo said the foldable iPhone would bring back Touch ID to potentially replace Face ID, but this time the button would be on the side of the device. It'd have a \"book-style design\" and a 7.8-inch inner display, he added. Apple is also pursuing a \"crease-free\" display, according to Kuo \u2014 something other phone makers like Samsung are also chasing.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nWhile both Bloomberg and The Information have reported that Apple is planning foldable screen devices, Kuo's predicted timeline should be taken with a grain of salt. A Kuo note in 2023 said that foldable iPads would hit shelves in 2024, for example, which has yet to materialize.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA bet like a foldable iPhone, in an area where competitors like Samsung and Huawei have already ventured, is a \"significant gamble\" that could result in a device with low demand, similar to the $3500 Vision Pro, said Jacob Bourne, an analyst at BI sister company EMARKETER.\n\n\"Apple's better bet might be to focus on other emerging technologies rather than chasing a form factor that may not maintain its appeal long-term,\" Bourne told BI.\n\nRumors of smart glasses, AI-powered home devices, and robotics swirled around Apple in 2024. Apple was late to the artificial intelligence race last year with Apple Intelligence launching months, or years, after competitors' similar software.\n\nCEO Tim Cook told investors that he felt \"optimistic\" about Apple's product pipeline during its fiscal first-quarter 2025 earnings call.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked about the future of the iPhone's form factor and where Apple sees opportunities to innovate, Cook didn't go into detail but hinted that there's more to come.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of innovation left on the smartphone,\" Cook said.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

Noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported Wednesday that the company plans to launch a foldable iPhone at the end of 2026 or early 2027.\n\nAccording to Kuo, the book-style device could be priced between $2,000 and $2,500. It's expected to feature a 7.8-inch crease-free inner display and a 5.5-inch outer display, which aligns with other rumors.\n\nDespite the steep price tag, Kuo believes Apple's dedicated fanbase will generate strong replacement demand, with projected shipments of 3 million to 5 million units initially and up to 20 million for the second generation.\n\nRead more: iPhone 'Flip': The Apple Foldable May Still Be Coming as Competition Grows\n\nThe report comes as Apple remains the only major smartphone manufacturer without a foldable device. The company has reportedly been working on one for years but has faced challenges with the phone's hinge and the durability of the display screen.\n\nCould foldables take off?\n\nFoldable phones still make up only a small segment of the market but are projected to experience significant growth in the next few years, especially if Apple enters the space.\n\nBloomberg reported in December that Apple is developing a large foldable iPad that could expand to the size of two iPad Pros. The largest current size iPad is 13 inches, but to make playing games and viewing shows and movies better, the screen on the rumored model would open wider and fold when not in use, making it easier to carry.\n\nAccording to market research firm IDC, total global sales of foldable phones reached 19.3 million units in 2024, up 6.3% from 2023 levels, Samsung led the way, followed closely by Huawei, Motorola and Honor. Foldables are typically priced high around $1200. Of course, the foldable numbers make for a stark contrast compared with the 1.4 billion total smartphones shipped in 2024.\n\nRamon Llamas, a research director at IDC, told CNET it's uncertain if an Apple foldable would find a sizable audience.\n\n\"A lot will depend on the use case and the price point,\" he said. \"But what would be interesting is that such a device would practically eliminate the need to own an iPhone and an iPad.\"",

Many victims have tracked the stolen loot overseas, nearly 7,000 miles away to Shenzhen, China, known as Asia's Silicon Valley.\n\nBailey and Justin contacted the Action News Investigative Team after their phones were swiped at two different Center City Philadelphia bars in a matter of weeks.\n\n\"I was just walking around having some drinks, and next thing I know it was out of pocket,\" said Bailey.\n\n\"I put it on the bar because I use Apple Pay to pay for things,\" said Justin. \"So as I put it down, I turned around and talked to my friend for a couple minutes. I turned back around and just wasn't there.\"\n\nBailey said he couldn't track his phone because he forgot his Apple ID.\n\nBut Justin said, like a few other friends who had their devices stolen, his Find My app revealed it was on the move across the world.\n\n\"Next day, I tracked it. It was in Staten Island, and then two days later it was in some place in China,\" he said.\n\nThat place is Shenzhen, which has become a booming electronics market.\n\nAmerican researcher and hacker Andrew Haung said think of this city as a farmers market but for electronics.\n\nHaung, who goes by \"Bunny\" has a PhD from MIT and became internationally known after he hacked the Xbox gaming console. He also wrote a book about reverse engineering and the need to identify security weaknesses in hardware and software systems.\n\nHe's worked off and on in Shenzhen for years.\n\n\"It ends up being a magnet for both legitimate and less legitimate trade,\" he said.\n\nHe said stolen iPhones are being shipped in bulk to Shenzhen, broken down into parts, and then sold at markets where consumers can get damaged phones fixed. Cameras, screens, cases, batteries, and other parts are sold for profit.\n\nCriminal gangs are targeting events like festivals and bars, stealing phones in bulk and shipping to Shenzhen, where there's a lax approach to enforcing laws around stolen goods.\n\nSometimes, phones are unlocked and reset to factory settings to be sold, or entire new handsets are built with the parts, but Haung said that can be difficult.\n\n\"Apple made it really inconvenient to sell a stolen iPhone,\" he said. \"It's like you can really only sell for scrap parts these days.\"\n\nJustin and Bailey both had to buy new iPhones. They both said they'd be more aware of protecting them going forward.\n\n\"Don't keep your phone in your back pocket,\" said Bailey.\n\n\"Is that how they snagged it?\" asked Action News investigator Chad Pradelli.\n\n\"Yeah, that's how they got mine at least,\" said Bailey.\n\nApple is now also taking steps to deter criminal enterprises from selling the phones on the black market. It recently created an activation lock feature that links the phone parts to the owner's Apple ID. It works when the Find My App is turned on by restricting the calibration of that part and alerts buyers that the parts are stolen.",

It\u2019s also an interesting color as well, as its semi-reflective aluminum unibody does pick up the color from where it\u2019s placed too.\n\nIn the brighter surroundings here, that color really sings, but you could see this becoming more silver in nature in darker settings when held up.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

This could just be my own bias with blue being my favorite color, but there\u2019s something special about it.\n\nWhat else is new?\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nThere are some additional niceties going on here \u2014 all fueled by that M4 chip. To start with, the M4 Air is up to 2x faster than the M1 in Adobe Photoshop editing.\n\nAnd for those looking towards a laptop sporting Intel Core Ultra 7 200 series, the Cupertino crew is also boasting 60% faster web browsing and 2x faster performance in more demanding tasks.\n\nOn top of that, Apple is touting an 18-hour battery life, which we\u2019ll put to the test when we review these new systems. But put simply, this could be the combo breaker of premium quality, top performance and value for money that pops it at the top of our recommendations (even more so with that blue).",

In its press release, Apple said this makes its refreshed MacBook Air up to two times faster than the M1 model from 2020 and up to 23 times faster than its bygone Intel-based models, making a clear appeal to longtime upgrade holdouts.\n\nThe new MacBook Air has the same 18-hour battery life as the M3 model and a virtually identical design, save for the addition of a new 12MP Center Stage webcam and support for up to two 6K external displays with its lid open. Besides the new sky blue colorway, it still comes in midnight, starlight, and silver, but no longer space gray.\n\nIts price is really the big story here. By selling the 13-inch M4 MacBook Air at $999 to start, Apple is matching the last selling price of the M2 model from 2022 and beating the final MSRP of 2024's M3 model by $100. (Both older MacBook Airs are no longer available in the Apple Store following the M4 announcement, for what it's worth.)\n\nAt a time when a lot of tech is getting more expensive, not less, a $999 price tag for a brand-new MacBook Air is both a pleasant surprise and extremely competitive.",

            "content": "Ryan Haines / Android Authority\n\nI might not be old enough to remember my parents pulling out a paper map in the car when we got lost, but I\u2019m old enough to remember when Apple Maps was the punchline of the navigational world. I remember it sending tourists to the middle of Australia in search of a national park and putting a trench in the middle of the Brooklyn Bridge, and thinking that it must be the worst map ever created. That was several years ago, though, and I\u2019ve heard plenty of good things about Apple\u2019s updates since then, so I figured I\u2019d give it another chance.\n\nWith one eye on a family vacation and another on a wedding, I let Apple take the wheel to see how it stacks up against Google Maps. I decided I would use it to guide me to a campsite I\u2019ve been to every year since I can remember (a trip where I\u2019d know if I was being steered wrong) and then follow it up with a less familiar drive across Pennsylvania, where I\u2019d have to trust Apple\u2019s choices. Let\u2019s see how it went.\n\nA map for this, a map for that\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nWhen you open Apple and Google Maps, you can tell they feel as different as iOS and Android. Apple\u2019s platform only exists within its own ecosystem, so, of course, it feels tailor-made for use on an iPhone. It follows many of the same design cues as Safari, putting the search bar across the bottom edge and listing your favorite locations and recent searches for easy access. Above that, the default map shows the neighborhoods around you, a few well-rated restaurants, and convenient things like points of interest and grocery stores. Tap on one of those locations, and you\u2019ll get a menu of Yelp reviews, pictures (also from Yelp), and a Good to Know section that lets you know if there\u2019s takeout available, whether or not a place is good for kids, and more.\n\nInterestingly, Apple Maps prefers neighborhood names to street names, showing me places like Fells Point, Butcher\u2019s Hill, and Little Italy rather than the roads I\u2019d have to walk to get there. You can also tap on the folded map icon in the corner to open up alternative views like Driving, Transit, and Satellite, but I mostly left mine on the Explore menu as it felt slightly less cluttered.\n\nOn the other hand, Google Maps feels more like a navigation app that can run on just about any device short of a Google TV \u2014 because it can. That\u2019s why it\u2019s been my go-to for years \u2014 I know it\u2019ll function on whatever phone I\u2019m reviewing at a given moment. With that, though, Google Maps feels much more like a Google product (hopefully one it won\u2019t kill), featuring a few local points of interest and mixing in locations that have paid for advertising. You can quickly tell the difference, too, as they show up with square icons rather than pins, and they have small highlight blurbs where most locations have nothing.\n\nGoogle Maps Apple Maps\n\nGoogle Maps is also far less interested in neighborhood names. On my side of Baltimore, it only highlights Fells Point, Canton, and Highlandtown while skipping the smaller sections I mentioned above. However, it lists more street names, making it easier to pick where to turn if you\u2019re not actively navigating. I\u2019ll also give Google a slight edge for its map detailing options, as you can fine-tune your view for car traffic and cycling lanes and even check on a color-coded air quality map. You can stack your Google Maps details, too, whereas Apple will only show you road traffic or transit options \u2014 not both.\n\nWhich navigation app do you use most? 6970 votes Apple Maps 13 % Google Maps 77 % Waze 10 %\n\nThe search for, well, anything\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nApple Maps and Google Maps remain opposites once you decide to look for a specific location, too. Google Maps sets a few frequent addresses across the top, like Home and Work, but primarily relies on your recent locations or waits for you to type out a place before it gives a suggestion. For example, I knew I\u2019d have to get gas before setting off for my family camping trip, so I opened Google Maps and had to open the search bar to type \u201cgas near me\u201d before I got a result. Granted, the results aren\u2019t bad \u2014 they also listed out the price of a gallon of regular gas \u2014 but it takes an extra second to input your search.\n\nApple will help you find gas, Google will tell you what it costs.\n\nOn the other hand, it seems that Apple Maps would rather search for you. Sure, when you open the app, it\u2019ll show frequent locations and recent searches across the bottom \u2014 much like Google Maps \u2014 but when you go to search for something, Apple gives you a set of quick Find Nearby buttons for lunch, gas, coffee shops, and even parking without having to type a single letter. The interface reminds me a lot of my recent outing with Safari, which means there are probably a few things Google could borrow if it wanted to. If you\u2019re looking for gas, though, Apple Maps doesn\u2019t currently offer updated prices.\n\nI\u2019m also somewhat disappointed by Apple\u2019s set of City Guides, which pops up below the Find Nearby menu. It seems like Apple only spent time on major cities, offering guides to Washington DC, Philadelphia, and New York City near me while skipping smaller cities like Baltimore or Richmond, Virginia. On the one hand, I get that more people are likely to head to a major city, but I\u2019d also point out that there are tons of guides to those locations, while it can be harder to find guidance to a smaller (but in my opinion, better) city \u2014 a city like, say, Pittsburgh, where I was headed to celebrate the wedding of friends from college.\n\nGoogle Maps Apple Maps\n\nI\u2019ve been to Pittsburgh once or twice, but certainly not enough times to be familiar with the Steel City\u2019s offerings. So, I typed in the address for my hotel and then swiped around a little bit to find out what might be nearby. Unfortunately for Google, Apple Maps was far more helpful at finding me a hot bite. Although Google might excel at showing the different buildings throughout Pittsburgh\u2019s Strip District, Apple\u2019s platform showed me more of what was in those buildings, skipping things like apartment rental companies and focusing more on local restaurants and bars. Google Maps showed me one restaurant in The Terminal, a building that stretches from 16th Street to 21st, while Apple Maps gave me four restaurants, a brewery, and two golf simulators in the same structure. By the way, if you actually want to see the streets around you, both apps offer ways to look around.\n\nAll roads lead to somewhere\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nAnd yet, as different as Apple Maps and Google Maps are when you\u2019re looking around, they\u2019re just about identical once you need directions. I typed in the state park where I was headed to meet my family, and both Apple Maps and Google Maps came back with the same suggested route \u2014 at least within a mile or two of each other and about a minute apart on my estimated arrival time. The only difference between the two was that Google let me choose my destination within the park while Apple Maps defaulted to the park office (which makes sense as I immediately had to register my car upon arrival).\n\nSo, with my route pretty much planned out, I hopped in the car and pressed start. Unsurprisingly, Apple Maps and Google Maps behave just about the same once you get on the road. Both list your upcoming turn prominently at the top, with the finer points like your arrival time, remaining mileage, and remaining time across the bottom. Google\u2019s approach is a bit more colorful, though, with your remaining time shown in green, orange, or red, depending on whether or not it\u2019s delayed from the original estimate.\n\nGoogle Maps Apple Maps\n\nGoogle Maps also makes it much easier to control your music \u2014 even if it eats into the map just a bit. When playing something over Spotify, it appears in a small bar above your arrival time and remaining miles, offering quick controls to pause your song or skip to the next track. On the other hand, Apple restricts its playback to the Dynamic Island, meaning that you have to tap on a much smaller button when you want to change your music \u2014 not exactly safe while driving on a multi-lane highway.\n\nOutside of music controls, though, I might prefer Apple\u2019s interface for one crucial reason \u2014 it\u2019s far more helpful when switching lanes and finding exits. Yes, Google Maps will tell you which lane to be in and how many lanes are part of the exit, but Apple Maps shows you a three-dimensional version of the roads and exits in front of you so you can match the directions with your eyes rather than quickly trying to count lanes at the last second. It wasn\u2019t the most useful when taking an exit in a small town in upstate New York, but the visualization made navigating Pittsburgh\u2019s confusing set of bridges, tunnels, and one-way streets much more manageable.\n\nGoogle will tell you where to get off the highway, but Apple will show you what the exit looks like.\n\nAnd somehow, that\u2019s about it regarding the significant differences between Apple Maps and Google Maps \u2014 at least when it comes to a long trip in the car. Otherwise, both will let you know when there\u2019s a speed trap coming, both will let you know if there\u2019s a slowdown ahead, and both will happily tell you to continue straight for more than 100 miles when needed \u2014 which is enough to bring a tear to anyone\u2019s eye.\n\nSo, I guess I owe Apple Maps a bit of an apology. It\u2019s come a long way in the last few years and hasn\u2019t tried to kill me with an invisible cliff or a misplaced park once. And yet, it won\u2019t replace Google Maps in my life since I review Android phones for a living, and Apple doesn\u2019t seem interested in navigating outside of its walled garden.\n\nYou might like",

            "content": "As the entry-level chip in the M4 family of Apple silicon (which includes the M4 Pro and M4 Max), the M4 packs a 10-core CPU and a GPU with up to 10 cores. Apple claims this CPU's performance is up to twice as fast as the M1 version from 2020. All models start with 16 GB of RAM with the option to upgrade to 32 GB. (Apple doubled the memory on base models in October on its predecessor as well.) Storage starts at 256 GB, and you can upgrade to 2 terabytes for an additional cost.\n\nThe M4 is mighty enough to support two external displays, like the M3 version, but you no longer have to keep the laptop's lid closed to do so. The previous version of MacBook Air could only push so many pixels at once, and you would have to keep the computer shut to use multiple screens; if you opened it and woke the screen, one of the external displays would go dark. Now, you'll technically have three screens at your disposal if you count the one on the MacBook Air.\n\nWith the M4, you'll have access to Apple Intelligence as well. Available with macOS 15.1 and newer, it includes a suite of artificial intelligence features like Smart Replies in Messages, Mail Summaries, Clean Up in Apple Photos, Writing Tools, Genmoji, Image Playground, and more.\n\nThe cost of the MacBook Air has also been reduced to the price it originally sold for before Apple increased it with the launch of the M2 model. The base 13-inch MacBook Air now starts at $999, and the 15-inch version, on the other hand, starts at $1,199. That's $100 less than its predecessor.\n\nStudio Stunner\n\nAmong Apple's lineup of desktops, the Mac Studio has always been an ideal desktop for creative professionals who need more power than what's offered in the iMac and Mac Mini, but don't want to drop an exuberant amount of money on a Mac Pro. The latest Mac Studio has been updated with new chipsets, offering an extra boost of power, along with a few internal upgrades.\n\nYou'll now have the choice between an M4 Max and an all-new M3 Ultra chip. The M4 Max packs an up to 16-core CPU and an up to 40-core GPU. Apple claims it's up to 3.5 times faster than the Mac Studio with M1 Max and a little over six times faster than the 27-inch iMac with an Intel chip. The higher-speed chip also unlocks some additional graphics capabilities like ray tracing, mesh shading, and dynamic caching for graphics-intensive tasks. It comes with 36 GB of unified memory with support for up to 128 GB.\n\nThe front of the 2025 Mac Studio. Courtesy of Apple And the back. Ports! Courtesy of Apple\n\nThe new M3 Ultra, on the other hand, is now the most powerful in the M-series lineup. Composed of two M3 Max chips, its CPU can host up to 32 cores (with 24 performance cores), and its GPU can be configured up to 80 cores. Apple claims this chip design is up to 2.5 times faster than the M1 Ultra. As with the M4 Max, it also offers mesh shading, dynamic caching, and ray tracing for graphics pros. You'll get 96 GB of unified memory with the option to upgrade to 512 GB, while SSD storage can be increased to a whopping 16 TB.\n\nApple kept the same chassis this time around. The front is home to two USB-C ports and an SD card slot, while the back has four Thunderbolt ports, an HDMI port, two USB-A ports, a 10-gigabit Ethernet port, a headphone jack, and a power outlet, along with a built-in speaker. The only change is that Apple upgraded the USB-C to Thunderbolt 5 for faster data transfer speeds.\n\nThe Mac Studio will start at $1,999 for the base model with the M4 Max. The base model with the M3 Ultra starts at $3,999.",

Instead, the latest top-end Mac Studio features the long-awaited M3 Ultra.\n\nSimilar to the M1 and M2 Ultra, the new M3 Ultra is essentially two M3 Max processors that have been stitched together using TSMC's advanced packaging tech \u2014 or as Apple prefers to call it, \"UltraFusion\" \u2014 into a single logical chip with 184 billion transistors in total.\n\nCompared to its predecessor, the M3 Ultra offers a substantial upgrade. The processor can now be configured with up to 32 cores (24 performance and eight efficiency) versus the M2 Ultra's 24 (16 performance, eight efficiency).\n\nAccording to Apple this translates to a 50 percent performance uplift over the M2 Ultra and an 80 percent increase over the original M1 Ultra powered Mac Studio.\n\nThe GPU has also been upgraded from a max of 76 cores to 80 this generation. That might not sound like much of an upgrade compared to the M3 Ultra's CPU count jump, but, as you might recall from Apple's \"Scary Fast\" event all the way back in October 2023, most of the graphics improvements are actually under the hood, within the graphics cores rather than from upping the number of cores.\n\nApple has previously claimed the M3 GPU cores are about 80 percent faster than the M2's, thanks in part to the hardware-accelerated mesh shading and ray tracing. Add in the extra cores on the M3 Ultra and Apple says the GPU is roughly twice as fast in graphics workloads compared to the previous generation.\n\nThe GPU is complemented by a 32-core Neural Engine to accelerate all those Apple Intelligence features that are now turned on by default in macOS.\n\nSpeaking of AI, Apple is keen to tout the M3 Ultra's memory capacity which can be specced up to 512 GB, providing adequate space for \"LLMs with over 600 billion parameters.\"\n\nThis might seem like a weird flex, but Apple's Mac Studio has become quite popular among AI researchers and enthusiasts as it's one of the cheapest platforms for running high-parameter-count large language models, aka LLMs.\n\nAnd with 800 GB/s of memory bandwidth running something like DeepSeek R1 at home is totally feasible, at 4-bit precision at least. With 671 billion parameters, it'll eat up a little over 400GB of your memory, but because it uses a mixture of experts architecture, only 37 billion parameters are active at any given point. This means generation rates, potentially as high as 20 to 30 tokens a second, should be achievable by our estimation.\n\nWith that said, a Mac Studio capable of running such a model won't be cheap. Upgrading to 512GB will cost you an extra $5,500 over the standard M3 Ultra-toting Mac Studio, bringing the total to $9,499 before you even upgrade the storage. Fully maxed out, an M3 Ultra Mac Studio with 16TB of SSD storage, will run you a cool $14,099.\n\nWhile Apple's top-specced Mac Studio gets the M3 Ultra, the base model comes equipped with the same M4 Max that's powered its MacBook Pros since last fall. That chip can be equipped with up to 16 CPU cores (12 performance, four efficiency), a 40-core GPU, and up to 128GB of unified memory. Additionally, storage is capped at a max of 8TB, though given the rather sizable premium Apple charges for storage, and the fact this thing will be sitting on a desk most of the time, we suggest investing in external USB4 or Thunderbolt storage, instead.\n\nThe M4 arrives on the MacBook Air\n\nAlongside the Mac Studio, the venerable MacBook Air is also getting an Apple Silicon refresh. The passively cooled notebook is now available with an M4 processor and twice the starting memory while coming in $100 cheaper than the previous gen at $999.\n\nAs we discussed last year, the M4 offers a couple of notable advantages over its predecessors, but in the case of the MacBook Air, one of the most obvious is support for multiple monitors.\n\nUnlike the M4 MacBook Pro launched last fall, the base model 13-inch Air comes equipped with a slightly cut-down version of the chip. Instead of the 10 CPU and 10 GPU core version that comes standard on the Pro, the base model Air's GPU features two fewer cores.\n\nWhile the base SoC may have been cut down in terms of compute, its memory has been doubled to 16GB over the M3 Air's 8GB, though the minuscule 256GB SSD remains. Stepping up to a 10-core GPU and 512GB of storage will push the price to $1,199.\n\nThe 15-inch model, meanwhile, starts at $1,199 and comes standard with the 10-core GPU, 10-core GPU-equipped M4, and 16GB of RAM, but just 256GB of storage.\n\nWhile Apple may have slashed the starting prices for the M4 Air, just like any other Mac, once you start upgrading the memory or storage \u2014 remember they're soldered down \u2014 they can get pretty expensive in a hurry. (There's a reason why we used to call it the Cupertino idiot-tax operation.)\n\nA maxed-out 15-inch Air with 32GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage will set you back $2,400, at which point you're well into MacBook Pro territory.\n\nBoth the refreshed MacBook Airs and Mac Studios are available for preorder now and will hit store shelves on March 12. \u00ae",

She is a member of the Cleftomaniacs, an a cappella group, an ESL tutor, and hopes to encourage peace-minded advocacy on campus. Contact her at ehjaber@wm.edu.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own.\n\nI am going to begin with a quick anecdote. This winter break, after a series of unfortunate events that included a 100-meter dash through the Istanbul airport, I unexpectedly found myself in Dubai. Some weary travelers would have been upset that their flight pattern was disrupted. Many would have certainly preferred sleeping in a warm bed over watching \u201cDespicable Me 4\u201d in the sky. Not me. You see, dear reader, as I took off toward an unintended destination, I celebrated. I got ready to stay up an extra seven hours and texted my mom that I was about to visit the birthplace of \u201cLove is Blind: Habibi.\u201d I can only imagine that, at that moment, she had never felt more pride.\n\nFor those of you who have lived a sad existence and aren\u2019t familiar with \u201cLove is Blind: Habibi,\u201d it is the version of the Netflix reality TV dating show \u201cLove is Blind,\u201d wherein people get engaged without ever seeing each other, that takes place in the Arab world. It is the single greatest thing ever created by humankind. Sliced bread pales in comparison. In fact, I firmly believe that I have achieved a level of moral, intellectual and argumentative dominance over my readership simply by having spent three hours in an airport that is only a one hour and 18 minute walk away from where they filmed the weddings for \u201cLove is Blind: Habibi\u201d.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Well, this seemingly-tangential story serves many rhetorical purposes. First, it gives my article this week a bit of anecdotal charm. Second, it lets me mention my mom in the piece, and neither of my siblings have ever mentioned her in a publication, which thus makes me the favorite (???). And, lastly, this is my ethos. I have just established a level of credibility that is beyond comprehension. This gripping story is my ticket to legitimacy. Legitimacy for what, you ask? For the question this week, which is as follows:\n\n\u201cHow to fully get over last semester\u2019s situationship?\u201d\n\nNow, if there is one thing I share with my predecessor, Adam, it is a respect for grammatical conventions. I bet you as a reader would love to see me just tear this person apart for how little this phrase even grammatically resembles a question. Tough luck. I am an empath. I read this broken sentence structure, and I see a broken heart. Never fear, though; I am here to fix it.\n\nYou may have difficulty trusting me with such sensitive subject matter, because you don\u2019t have any insight into what my life is like. Is Eva taken? Is she single? Is she ready to mingle? For all you know, I could very well be writing with the naive positionality of having spent the past seven years in my dream relationship (dating a real life character from Twilight, preferably named Jacob, maybe also a werewolf; the specificity is actually quite random and is for the sake of the argument). I could just as easily have written this question myself and been using this column as a coping mechanism. Whether or not I have had personal experience with situationships, though, is actually irrelevant. What truly matters is my wealth of knowledge about the \u201cLove is Blind\u201d universe, which is basically an environment that forces the development of ten simultaneous situationships at any given time. So, without further ado, I present to you multiple very strong solutions to help get over last semester\u2019s situationship.\n\n1) Remember your worth. Behind this satirical facade of mine, there lies an individual who genuinely cares about your wellbeing. You mean more than what you meant to them. If they cannot see your value, they are not and never were the one for you. Sidebar: this is high-key poetic. Get me on one of those Flat Hat instagram quote slides stat.\n\n2) Revenge. Last semester is still pretty recent. I bet you\u2019re going through it, and that\u2019s unfair. You may be familiar with the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. We are not dealing with grief here; we are dealing with vengeance. My proposed five stages of vengeance are a bit more specific and a bit more verb-y than noun-y. Step one: herd seven Canada geese into your quasi-ex\u2019s dorm room. Step two: label these geese one through eight and skip number six. Step three: tip off their roommates that goose number six is very much real and is the craziest of them all. Step four: wait for chaos to ensue as your quasi-ex (and their poor roommates, who got unintentionally involved by associating themselves with someone lame) frantically search for imaginary goose number six. Step five: wear a custom shirt around campus labeled \u201cGoose Number Six\u201d and, when confronted, snidely remark to your quasi-ex \u201cI bet it drove you crazy that you couldn\u2019t catch this one.\u201d It is baller and foolproof. You\u2019re welcome.\n\n3) Watch \u201cLove is Blind: Habibi\u201d. It will help you understand that many people have dealt with frustrating situationships, and that they made it out alright. It will restore your faith in love as you watch the lucky few find joy and companionship. Most importantly, it will bring you one step closer to being exactly like me. Enough said.\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with one more suggestion. As an unbiased, objective opinions writer, I only have your best interest in mind. Although humility is my greatest quality, and it pains me to be so forward, I know this is the best advice I could give you. I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t do everything possible to help you find happiness. With this, I give you option four.\n\n4) Date me.\n\nOkie dokie. See you in two weeks \u2014 or earlier. Dinner and a movie (\u201cTwilight\u201d) would be just fine.",

            "content": "March 4, 2025\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nApple introduces iPad Air with powerful M3 chip and new Magic Keyboard\n\nCUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today introduced the faster, more powerful iPad Air with the M3 chip and built for Apple Intelligence. iPad Air with M3 brings Apple\u2019s advanced graphics architecture to iPad Air for the first time \u2014 taking its incredible combination of power-efficient performance and portability to a new level. iPad Air with M3 is nearly 2x faster compared to iPad Air with M1,1 and up to 3.5x faster than iPad Air with A14 Bionic.2 Users will feel the speed of M3 in everything they do, from creating engaging content faster than ever to playing demanding, graphics-intensive games. Available in two sizes and four gorgeous finishes that users love, the 11-inch iPad Air is super portable while on the go, and the 13-inch model provides an even larger display for more room to be creative and productive. Designed for iPad Air, the new Magic Keyboard enhances its versatility and delivers more capabilities at a lower price. With iPadOS 18, support for Apple Intelligence, advanced cameras, fast wireless 5G connectivity, and compatibility with Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Pencil (USB-C), the new iPad Air offers an unrivaled experience.\n\nWith the same starting price of just $599 for the 11-inch model and $799 for the 13-inch model, the new iPad Air is a fantastic value. And for education, the 11-inch iPad Air starts at just $549, and the 13-inch model starts at just $749. Customers can pre-order the new iPad Air with M3 and Magic Keyboard for iPad Air starting today, with availability beginning Wednesday, March 12.\n\n\u201ciPad Air is so popular because of its unmatched combination of powerful performance, portability, and support for advanced accessories, all at an affordable price,\u201d said Bob Borchers, Apple\u2019s vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. \u201cFor everyone from college students taking notes with Apple Pencil Pro, to travelers and content creators who need powerful productivity on the go, iPad Air with M3, Apple Intelligence, and the new Magic Keyboard take versatility and value to the next level.\u201d\n\nSupercharged Performance with M3\n\niPad Air with M3 empowers users to be productive and creative wherever they are, from aspiring creatives using demanding apps and working with large files, to travelers editing content on the go. The powerful M3 chip offers a number of improvements over M1 and previous-generation models. Featuring a more powerful 8-core CPU, M3 is up to 35 percent faster for multithreaded CPU workflows than iPad Air with M1. M3 features a 9-core GPU with up to 40 percent faster graphics performance over M1. M3 also brings Apple\u2019s advanced graphics architecture to iPad Air for the first time with support for dynamic caching, along with hardware-accelerated mesh shading and ray tracing. For graphics-intensive rendering workflows, iPad Air with M3 offers up to 4x faster performance than iPad Air with M1, enabling more accurate lighting, reflections, shadows, and extremely realistic gaming experiences.3\n\nThe faster Neural Engine in M3 means iPad Air users can enjoy even more AI capabilities in iPadOS. Compared to M1, the Neural Engine in M3 is up to 60 percent faster for AI-based workloads. Other improvements over iPad models with A-series chips include support for Apple Intelligence, the choice of 11- and 13-inch sizes, and support for advanced accessories, including the new Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil Pro.\n\niPad Air: Built for Apple Intelligence\n\niPad Air is built for Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that delivers helpful and relevant intelligence.4 In Photos, the Clean Up tool makes it easy to remove distracting elements in images, and natural language search allows users to search for just about any photo or video by simply describing what they are looking for. With Image Wand in the Notes app, users can make notes more visually engaging by turning rough sketches into delightful images, just by drawing a circle around the sketch with their Apple Pencil. Users can even circle empty space within a note, and Image Wand will gather context from the surrounding area to create a relevant image that complements the note and makes it more visual.\n\nApple Intelligence helps users explore creative new ways to express themselves visually with Image Playground, create the perfect emoji with Genmoji, and make their writing even more dynamic with Writing Tools. Users can now type to Siri, and Siri is more conversational with the ability to follow along if users stumble over their words. Siri can also maintain context from one request to the next, and with extensive product knowledge, Siri can answer thousands of questions about the features and settings of Apple products, so users can learn how to do things like take a screen recording.\n\nWith ChatGPT seamlessly integrated into Writing Tools and Siri, users can tap into ChatGPT\u2019s expertise without jumping between applications, so they can get things done faster and easier than ever before. In addition, users can access ChatGPT for free without creating an account, and privacy protections are built in \u2014 their IP addresses are obscured and OpenAI won\u2019t store requests. Users can choose whether to enable ChatGPT integration, and are in full control of when to use it and what information is shared with ChatGPT.\n\nDesigned to protect users\u2019 privacy at every step, Apple Intelligence uses on-device processing, meaning that many of the models that power it run entirely on device. For requests that require access to larger models, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of iPad into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence. When using Private Cloud Compute, users\u2019 data is never stored or shared with Apple; it is used only to fulfill their request.\n\nAll-New Magic Keyboard for iPad Air\n\nThe all-new Magic Keyboard for iPad Air expands what users can do at an even lower price. The larger built-in trackpad brings greater precision for detail-oriented tasks, and a new 14-key function row allows easy access to features like screen brightness and volume controls. The new Magic Keyboard attaches magnetically, and the Smart Connector immediately connects power and data without the need for Bluetooth; a machined aluminum hinge also includes a USB-C connector for charging. Now starting at just $269 for the 11-inch model and $319 for the 13-inch model, the new Magic Keyboard for iPad Air features the magical floating design customers love and comes in white.\n\niPad Updated with Double the Starting Storage and the A16 Chip\n\nApple today also updated iPad with double the starting storage and the A16 chip, bringing even more value to customers. The A16 chip provides a jump in performance for everyday tasks and experiences in iPadOS, while still providing all-day battery life. Compared to the previous generation, the updated iPad with A16 is nearly 30 percent faster.5 In fact, compared to iPad with A13 Bionic, users will see up to a 50 percent improvement in overall performance,5 and A16 makes the updated iPad up to 6x faster than the best-selling Android tablet.6\n\nPowerful and Intelligent Features with iPadOS 18\n\niPadOS 18 offers powerful features that enhance the iPad experience, making it more versatile and intelligent than ever:7\n\nDesigned for the unique capabilities of iPad, Calculator delivers an entirely new way to use Apple Pencil to solve expressions. With Math Notes, users are now able to write out mathematical expressions or type to see them instantly solved in handwriting like their own. They can also create and use variables, and add an equation to insert a graph. Users can access their Math Notes in the Notes app and use all of the math functionality in any of their other notes.\n\nIn Notes, handwritten notes become more fluid and flexible. Smart Script unleashes powerful new capabilities for users editing handwritten text, allowing them to easily add space or even paste typed text in their own handwriting. And as users write with Apple Pencil, their handwriting will be automatically refined in real time to be smoother, straighter, and more legible.\n\nWith new Audio Recording and Transcription, iPad can capture a lecture or conversation, and transcripts are synced with the audio, so users can search for an exact moment in the recording.\n\nUsers now have even more options to express themselves through the Home Screen. App icons and widgets can take on a new look with a dark or tinted effect, and users can make them appear larger to create the experience that\u2019s perfect for them. A redesigned Control Center provides easier access to many of the things users do every day, including the option to organize new controls from third-party apps.\n\nBetter for the Environment\n\nThe new iPad Air and updated iPad are designed with the environment in mind. As part of Apple 2030, the company\u2019s ambitious goal to be carbon neutral across its entire carbon footprint by the end of this decade, Apple is transitioning to renewable electricity for manufacturing, and investing in wind and solar projects around the world to address the electricity used to charge all Apple products, including the new iPad Air and iPad. Today, all Apple facilities run on 100 percent renewable electricity \u2014 including the data centers that power Apple Intelligence.\n\nTo achieve Apple 2030, the company is designing products with more recycled and renewable materials, which further drives down the carbon footprint. The new iPad Air and iPad each feature at least 30 percent recycled content overall, including 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure and 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. The batteries contain 100 percent recycled cobalt and \u2014 in a first for iPad \u2014 over 95 percent recycled lithium. The new iPad Air and iPad meet Apple\u2019s high standards for energy efficiency, and are free of mercury, brominated flame retardants, and PVC. The packaging is also entirely fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of removing plastic from its packaging by the end of this year.8\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nCustomers can pre-order the new iPad Air with M3 starting today, March 4, on apple.com/store, and in the Apple Store app in 29 countries and regions, including the U.S. It will begin arriving to customers, and will be in Apple Store locations and Apple Authorized Resellers, starting March 12.\n\nThe 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Air with M3 will be available in blue, purple, starlight, and space gray, with 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB configurations.\n\nThe 11-inch iPad Air starts at $599 (U.S.) for the Wi-Fi model, and $749 (U.S.) for the Wi-Fi + Cellular model.

We did see the base model drop to $500 once when Amazon matched a Costco member-only deal back in mid/late November, but today\u2019s offer is the best otherwise and the 512GB at $100 off is matching the lowest we have tracked.\n\nHere\u2019s how pricing breaks down across the M4 Mac mini lineup right now:\n\nAll three of the M4 models are now $10 and $20 under the previous mentions from last week, delivering the best prices of the year and a notable chance to upgrade to Apple\u2019s most affordable current-generation Mac.

Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\n\nThe new iPad Air (M3) is largely similar to the previous M2 version. The bigest change is internal: the new model has Apple\u2019s M3 chip, which should deliver slightly faster overall performance. The 11-inch iPad Air (M3) starts at $599 while the 13-inch iPad Air (M3) starts at $799. Both are available in four colors.\n\nThe brand also launched a new Apple Magic Keyboard to go with the iPad Air (M3) \u2014 the new models have larger trackpads and include a function row for keys like screen brightness, volume and media control. The 11-inch Magic Keyboard starts at $269 while the 13-inch Magic Keyboard starts at $319.\n\nAs always with a new product launch, the previous iPad Air (M2) looks to be discounted at multiple retailers \u2014 you can get both the 11-inch and 13-inch versions for $100 off at Best Buy.\n\nApple also quietly upgraded the base iPad, which it now calls the iPad (A16) rather than the iPad (10th Generation). The base model iPad (A16) starts at $349 and comes with a slightly larger screen, an updated chip and 128GB of storage (up from 64GB).\n\nWhy trust NBC Select?\n\nI am a reporter at NBC Select who covers technology including recent stories on smartwatches, cameras, Bluetooth speakers and more.

It applied a reasoned analysis for rejecting [Apple\u2019s] arguments.\u201d- CAFC opinion\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) today in a precedential decision upheld a mixed Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) ruling that found some claims of Gesture Technology\u2019s patent on camera sensing technology for handheld gaming and other devices to be unpatentable, but others not proven unpatentable. The inter partes review (IPR) was brought by Apple, Inc., which appealed the Board\u2019s partial finding of unpatentability.\n\nU.S. Patent No. 7,933,431 is titled \u201cCamera Based Sensing in Handheld, Mobile, Gaming, or Other Devices.\u201d The PTAB held claims 1\u201310, 12, and 14\u201331 unpatentable and claims 11 and 13 not shown to be unpatentable. Apple appealed and Gesture cross-appealed. Apple argued that the Board used the wrong legal standard for obviousness and ignored Apple\u2019s arguments, while Gesture argued in part that Apple had no standing to appeal due to estoppel arising from a previous IPR brought by Unified Patents against the same claims.\n\nThe CAFC opinion first referred to Acoustic Tech., Inc. v. Itron Networked Sols., Inc. as support for its determination that Gesture had forfeited its estoppel argument because it failed to raise a real party in interest/ privy argument before the Board in the earlier Unified Patents case. It did not, however, decide the question whether Apple actually was a real party in interest or privy of Unified Patents.\n\nTurning to Apple\u2019s appeal of the decision on claims 11 and 13, the court rejected Apple\u2019s arguments that the Board misapplied \u201cthe legal standard for obviousness by only looking to the explicit disclosures\u201d of the relevant prior art reference instead of the prior art \u201cin view of the knowledge of a person of ordinary skill in the art; and said the PTAB failed to \u201cengage in reasoned decision making in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u2018APA\u2019).\u201d\n\nThe CAFC said the Board in part relied on the petition\u2019s \u201clack of analysis\u201d about how the prior art \u201c(with or without the knowledge of a person of ordinary skill in the art) would apply to the claim construction that Apple had advocated for\u201d and also disagreed with Apple\u2019s argument that the Board violated the APA by ignoring much of Apple\u2019s evidence. The opinion explained that \u201cApple overstates what the Board ignored,\u201d and said \u201cit applied a reasoned analysis for rejecting [Apple\u2019s] arguments.\u201d The court conceded that \u201cthe Board did not expressly explain its thoughts on the relevance of low-cost communications,\u201d but said \u201cthere is no requirement that the Board expressly discuss each and every negative and positive piece of evidence lurking in the record to evaluate a cursory argument,\u201d citing Novartis AG v. Torrent Pharms. Ltd., 853 F.3d 1316, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2017); and Yeda Rsch. and Dev. Co. v. Mylan Pharms. Inc., 906 F.3d 1031, 1046 (Fed. Cir. 2018).\n\nWith respect to Gesture\u2019s cross-appeal that the Board\u2019s decision finding claims 1, 7, 12, and 14 were unpatentable was not supported by substantial evidence, however, the CAFC rejected Gesture\u2019s arguments and ultimately affirmed the finding of obviousness.",

Yes it does have the more powerful chip, but I think the standard M4 will be just fine for my daily work tasks and some Logic Pro action.

            "content": "While working on my iPhone 16e review (stay tuned to Macworld for that!) I came across something strange. Let me explain.\n\nI posted a grumpy article Monday citing the lack of MagSafe support as the single most annoying thing about Apple\u2019s new iPhone 16e. Having lived through and reviewed large segments of four consecutive iPhone generations with MagSafe support, I\u2019m not relishing the prospect of going back to wireless charging dependent on absolute accuracy in placement.\n\nBut then I took my iPhone 16e out of its case to get some photos with my old MagSafe charging puck for illustrative purposes (showing that it can charge from such accessories, but won\u2019t have that handy magnetic attachment) and I made a surprising discovery: the magnets inside the charger do attach to the iPhone 16e. It\u2019s a weak connection, but it\u2019s there.\n\nTo get it to work, you have to make sure first of all that your iPhone 16e isn\u2019t wearing a case (unless it\u2019s a MagSafe one). I tried it with one of Apple\u2019s silicone cases and the effect vanished. Then you need to place the phone on or around the charging sweet spot and you should hear a little snap (you can hear it in the video below). Raise the phone (gently!) and you should find that the puck stays attached.\n\nBut I don\u2019t recommend doing much else, because the connection is shaky and it frequently detaches if you move the 16e too quickly or twist it too much. You don\u2019t want to test out the iPhone\u2019s drop resistance, particularly when uncased, so be careful. I certainly wouldn\u2019t recommend using the iPhone 16e with a magnetic car mount or nightstand, because it will surely fall off at a critical moment. (And to be fair, nowhere does Apple claim that the 16e is compatible with such accessories.) But at the very least, it will be a confirmation that the charging cable is in the right spot resting on a desk or table.\n\nI\u2019ve contacted Apple to ask if this is expected behavior or just a strange bonus feature, and will post their response if and when I get one.\n\nOf course, there are limits to the usefulness of this discovery. Even if it appears to have a weak magnetic attraction to MagSafe accessories, the 16e still doesn\u2019t support the MagSafe charging standard, so you\u2019re not going to qualify for the higher maximum speeds. And the fact that you\u2019ll need to go caseless to get it to work is a real downer if, like me, you\u2019re a believer in protecting expensive devices.\n\nNevertheless, if you are one of those reckless no-casers, it might be a small comfort when you first notice the 16e pulling itself gently into the correct charging spot.",

I thought it looked pretty nice considering the fact that I got a pretty great deal on eBay for it.\n\nAs for what I usually use my Apple Watch for is primarily for text messages, checking the weather via CARROT Weather, and more recently, checking on package deliveries through the Deliveries app.\n\nWith all of that said, I drove from Des Moines, IA (my current home city), down to Kansas City, MO last Friday to see my cousin and go see musician Cody Fry perform with the Kansas City Symphony. I was expected to be back in Des Moines by early afternoon the following day, so this was just a quick jaunt to and from.\n\nOne thing that I noticed while making gas station purchases before I left both Des Moines and Kansas City was that I could not use my Apple Watch for Apple Pay since I was not wearing it. That might not be a big deal to some, but for me as someone who uses Apple Pay regularly from their Apple Watch, this was a major change for me.\n\nStill, I was clearly still able to use my iPhone 15 Plus to get all of my Apple Pay purchases done whether it was at a gas pump (thank you, Kwik Star and QuikTrip for having tap at the pump) or any other store I found myself at.\n\nAnother big part of this too was using the Wallet app from my iPhone to scan my concert ticket from said Wallet app instead of my Apple Watch. This was not too big of a change for me since I usually pull out my iPhone for concert and event tickets just in case.\n\nIf I had to say the most important part of not wearing my Apple Watch during this trip, it was that I was not getting a plethora of notifications on my wrist. This was especially important during the concert since I did not have to worry about turning on Theater Mode during the show since\u2026well\u2026the Apple Watch was simply not there.\n\nAll in all, while I do still love my Apple Watch, it is nice every now and then to not have it on and wear something a little old-fashioned every now and then.\n\nI\u2019d highly recommend wearing a regular wristwatch just to mix it up with your Apple Watch every so often. It can give you a break from the bombarding of notifications of the world for a moment and give you some inner peace.",

Quartz members get access to exclusive newsletters and more. Sign up here.\n\nWall Street\u2019s number crunchers are giving Apple\u2019s eye-popping $500 billion U.S. investment plan the digital equivalent of the \u201cthinking face\u201d emoji. Financial analysts have serious doubts about whether the tech giant can actually deliver on what would be its most ambitious spending spree ever \u2013 even as the announcement scored an immediate all-caps \u201cTHANK YOU TIM COOK AND APPLE!!!\u201d from President Donald Trump on Truth Social.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Apple\u2019s first headline-grabbing investment announcement. In January 2018, during Trump\u2019s first term, Apple announced a $350 billion contribution to the U.S. economy over five years. That included plans to create 20,000 jobs \u2014 the same job creation figure in last week\u2019s announcement. In April 2021, during the Biden administration, Apple announced an \u201cacceleration\u201d of its U.S. investments, with plans to spend more than $430 billion over five years.\n\nThe company\u2019s pattern of recycling key commitments while increasing the headline dollar figure raises questions about how much of these investments represent truly new economic activity \u2014 as opposed to just repackaging existing business plans.\n\nThe timing and scale of Apple\u2019s announcement appear strategically aligned with the political landscape. Trump himself acknowledged the connection between Apple\u2019s plan and his trade policies, telling governors that Apple had \u201cstopped two plants in Mexico\u201d to boost its U.S. presence. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be in the tariffs,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThis follows a pattern that began during Trump\u2019s first term, when Cook built goodwill with the president through personal meetings and successfully lobbied for tariff exemptions in 2019. The relationship appears to be continuing, with Cook attending Trump\u2019s inauguration and potentially shielding Apple from the full impact of new tariffs on Chinese imports that could significantly affect its business model. As Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives noted, \u201cCook continues to prove that he is 10% politician and 90% CEO.\u201d\n\nUBS analyst David Vogt was more blunt in his assessment, calling the $500 billion figure \u201ccompletely unrealistic mechanically\u201d in comments to Fortune. He questioned where the additional money would come from, noting that Apple only generates about $100 billion a year in free cash flow, with $90 billion already allocated to share buybacks. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear where the cash flow comes [from] to try to even remotely attempt this,\u201d Vogt said, adding that Apple\u2019s current $10 billion in annual capital expenditures represents just a fraction of the annual $125 billion the new investment would require.",

The phone is a kind of spiritual successor to the third-generation iPhone SE, keeping the ethos of offering a previous-generation body, but with a current-generation chip. And, if that was the whole story, this would be an easy review. At $429, the iPhone 16e would be an easy recommendation for those who want an iPhone that can last, at a low price.\n\nBut the iPhone 16e doesn\u2019t cost $429. Whether due to inflation, tariffs, or something else entirely, Apple has raised the price of its cheapest phone somewhat dramatically. At $599, the iPhone 16e is a bit pricey to be considered the \u201cbudget iPhone,\u201d bit still the cheapest new iPhone you can get. That\u2019s not to mention arguably the biggest change of all \u2014 a change that\u2019s completely invisible.

Of course, I\u2019d deal with a bigger camera module in favor of a better camera any day, but it\u2019s still kind of a sleek look. One interesting tidbit is that the antenna lines are a little larger on the iPhone 16e than on the iPhone 16. I assume that\u2019s necessary for the performance of Apple\u2019s self-designed modem, though that\u2019s purely speculation, and you would never know without putting the two phones side-by-side.\n\nThe front is the part that comes from the iPhone 14 series. The device marks the return of the notch, doing away with the Dynamic Island found on the rest of the iPhone 16s. I certainly prefer the Dynamic Island cutout, but I never cared that much about the notch on previous models. I still don\u2019t, and it\u2019s nice that you\u2019ll get Face ID and an edge-to-edge display.\n\nImage source: Christian de Looper for BGR\n\nBut the iPhone 16e does have other more modern design touches though. Notably, on the side, it has the Action Button that you can program to your preferences. The Action Button also serves more purposes than before on the iPhone 16e \u2014 allowing you to hold it down to trigger Apple Visual Intelligence. That\u2019s handy because the major missing design element is the Camera Control. You won\u2019t get that here.\n\nThere\u2019s one under-the-hood design change that I can\u2019t quite understand. Inexplicably, the device doesn\u2019t have MagSafe. That\u2019s right \u2014 the iPhone 16e won\u2019t support the ecosystem of chargers and accessories that Apple has spent the past few years building. I\u2019ve grown to love MagSafe, and I can\u2019t wait until Qi2 becomes more widespread and replicates the experience on Android devices. I have a MagSafe wallet, and MagSafe wireless chargers around my house \u2014 and I never thought I\u2019d have to go back to not using it in a new iPhone any time soon.\n\nTo be completely fair, many people upgrading to the iPhone 16e probably aren\u2019t coming from a phone that had MagSafe, so they may not know what they\u2019re missing, like I do. And, there will undoubtedly be plenty of MagSafe cases from third parties that add the magnets to the back of the phone. Unfortunately, Apple doesn\u2019t make those cases, though \u2014 you\u2019ll need to buy one from a third party.\n\nDespite the lack of MagSafe, generally speaking, I quite like the design of the iPhone 16e. I wish it came in more colors, but it still looks modern, and has helpful features like the Action Button.\n\niPhone 16e review: Display\n\nThe iPhone 16e has a 6.1-inch display, and it looks good. The display has a 2532 x 1170 resolution, which is the same as the iPhone 16. More importantly, it\u2019s an OLED display so you\u2019ll get the same true black levels, too. It doesn\u2019t have a high refresh rate, but that\u2019s to be expected.\n\nImage source: Christian de Looper for BGR\n\nThere is one thing that sets the screen apart from the standard iPhone 16. It has a slightly lower peak brightness, sitting in at 800 nits max brightness when viewing non-HDR content, and 1200 nits peak brightness when watching HDR content. The iPhone 16 can hit 2000 nits peak HDR brightness, and when you place the two phones side-by-side, you can tell the difference. In very bright outdoor environments, you might have some trouble seeing the screen well, but in every other situation, it\u2019s easily bright enough.\n\niPhone 16e review: Performance\n\nApple always packs high-end chips into its new low-priced phones, and the iPhone 16e is no exception to that rule. The device comes with Apple\u2019s A18 processor, which is the same chip as the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus \u2014 meaning that it\u2019ll perform as well as some of the best-performing phones you can get right now.\n\nThe end result? The device will easily handle everything you can throw at it in 2025, and for a number of years to come. It also means that the device can handle Apple Intelligence \u2014 which Apple has largely restricted to its best-performing phones.\n\nImage source: Christian de Looper for BGR\n\nThe support for Apple Intelligence may or may not matter to you, but Apple pushing it so hard at least means that it had to include a better-performing chip, which can\u2019t be a bad thing. That, in turn, means the phone will likely perform well for longer, and will likely get just as many software updates as the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus.\n\nThe iPhone 16e is the first iPhone to offer Apple\u2019s self-designed modem, called the Apple C1. The C1 should support all the bands and networks you need it to, except for the ultra-fast mmWave 5G connection that you can find in some public places like stadiums or downtown areas. If your phone usage is anything like mine, you likely won\u2019t miss mmWave much \u2014 though it\u2019s certainly possible you\u2019ll get slower speeds at a football game. In my testing of the C1, its performance seemed pretty much exactly on par with the iPhone 16, which is a pretty great outcome for Apple, in its first modem outing.\n\niPhone 16e review: Battery and charging\n\nApple is billing battery as one of the biggest benefits of the iPhone 16e over some other iPhone models. The company notes the phone as being able to play video for an impressive 26 hours, beating the standard iPhone 16 by four hours. That, of course, isn\u2019t really indicative of real-world use, but the general idea is that the battery in the iPhone 16e should be a little longer than that in the iPhone 16 \u2014 which is good news for those who need a little extra juice to get through the day. In a day of moderate use, I was able to get through the day with around 30% of the battery remaining, and I suspect most will have no problem reaching a full day of use.\n\nImage source: Christian de Looper for BGR\n\nThe iPhone 16e charges at speeds up to 25W through a wired connection, which is a little low \u2014 both compared to other iPhone models and to Android alternatives that hit over 100W at times. Thankfully, while it doesn\u2019t have MagSafe, it does still have Qi wireless charging, though at only 7.5W, or half of the wireless charging speed on offer by MagSafe.\n\nI\u2019m a fan of longer battery life, but it was disappointing to see the slower wireless charging speed \u2014 especially considering the fact that you don\u2019t actually have to include the magnets to support 15W wireless charging.\n\niPhone 16e review: Camera\n\nAnother big difference between the iPhone 16e and the standard iPhone 16 is the camera setup. The most obvious change is the lack of ultrawide camera, but the main 48-megapixel camera on the iPhone 16e also isn\u2019t the same as on the iPhone 16. It\u2019s a smaller sensor, and the result is that the sensor can\u2019t quite let in as much light, which in turn impacts low-light image capture. Additionally, images don\u2019t have quite as much depth to them.\n\nImage source: Christian de Looper for BGR\n\nThat said, the camera still isn\u2019t bad. Apple still leverages a sensor crop to deliver 2x lossless images (which is why Apple calls it a \u201c2-in-1 camera\u201d), though you can\u2019t replicate an ultrawide without an ultrawide sensor. And, without a dedicated telephoto camera, images start to look a little weird at around 4x or 5x, especially on larger screens like a laptop.\n\nIn well-lit environments, images still look bright and vibrant, with popping colors and good detail. Despite the smaller sensor, it still captures solid low-light images, too. It also supports the revamped Photographic Styles feature that launched with the rest of the iPhone 16 devices, which can help you tweak the tone of the camera to your preferences.\n\n2x zoom\n\n2x zoom\n\nNo zoom\n\n2x zoom\n\n5x zoom\n\n10x zoom\n\nNo zoom\n\nNo zoom\n\nThere are some advanced missing features though. You can\u2019t change the focus or depth of Portrait Mode photos after you capture them, presumably because with only one camera Apple has limited depth information to pull from. And, there\u2019s no macro mode. You\u2019ll have to be comfortable missing out on those features.\n\nAgain, though, despite that, the camera is reliable, and performs well in its price range.\n\niPhone 16e review: Software\n\nThere isn\u2019t a whole lot to say about the software experience on the iPhone 16e. It ships with iOS 18, and offers all the same Apple Intelligence features as other iPhone 16 devices, including visual intelligence. You\u2019ll get years of software updates, Siri, and all the other stuff you\u2019re used to on an iPhone.\n\nConclusions\n\nAt the beginning of this review, I called the iPhone 16e a kind of spiritual successor to the iPhone SE. Ultimately, however, that\u2019s a bit of an oversimplification. To be clear, the iPhone 16e is the new \u201cbudget iPhone\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s not as budget as the iPhone SE. That\u2019s a bummer, but it also leaves the door open for a fourth-generation iPhone SE, should Apple choose to release one.\n\nSome of the trade-offs you make for the cheaper iPhone make sense compared to the iPhone 16. It makes sense to lose a camera and the Camera Control. It makes sense to have a slightly older display. And, it makes sense to have a slightly older design with a notch. Other changes, like the lack of MagSafe, make no sense to me. Apple is all about that ecosystem \u2014 and not including MagSafe represents a jarring break in the ecosystem that limits the accessories people can actually use with their phones.\n\nBut, despite that, it\u2019s far from a bad phone. Actually, it\u2019s a great phone. This is the phone to buy if you want the cheapest phone that will last the longest amount of time. With an A18 chip, it\u2019ll support new versions of iOS for years to come, plus it still delivers on all the basics, like a solid camera and nice display.\n\nThe competition\n\nThe pricing of the iPhone 16e puts it in a bit of a weird spot compared to other iPhones. It\u2019s $200 cheaper than the iPhone 16, and for many, it\u2019s easily worth the trade-offs in features.\n\nBut the elephant in the room is the availability of used or refurbished iPhone 15 Pro models. Frankly, if you can find an iPhone 15 Pro for a similar price as the iPhone 16e, that\u2019s the way to go. You\u2019ll get a vastly superior camera system, similar performance, a better screen, and the same support for new iOS features like Apple Intelligence.\n\nThen there are the base iPhone 15 devices, which start at $699 for the iPhone 15. With the iPhone 15, you gain some things and you lose some things. You\u2019ll get a no-notch design, along with a dual camera system that supports modern camera features. You\u2019ll also get MagSafe. The iPhone 15 won\u2019t perform quite as well though, and it won\u2019t support Apple Intelligence, if that matters to you.\n\nTL;DR? If you can find an iPhone 15 Pro for a similar price, buy it instead. If you\u2019re deciding between the iPhone 16e and iPhone 15, you\u2019re deciding between better performance and Apple Intelligence support (iPhone 16e), and a dual camera system and more modern design (iPhone 15).\n\nShould I buy the iPhone 16e?\n\nYes, but only if you can\u2019t find a similarly-priced iPhone 15 Pro.",

            "content": "Apple has a slew of products available beyond iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The tech giant has slowly begun to introduce various iPhone accessories over the last decade, such as Apple Watch, and these have proven to be a major success. Another major accessory we've seen from Apple is none other than AirPods. The market for wireless earbuds slowly began to grow popular in 2015, but nothing shook up the market more than the launch of AirPods. With many different models and product lines available, you might not remember each generation that Apple has released. Below, we've compiled every generation of Apple AirPods, so buckle up and prepare for a journey through this iconic device.\n\nHow Many Apple AirPods Generations Have There Been?\n\nApple has released a total of seven different Apple AirPods generations. The first model was released in 2016, with the latest arriving in 2024. We've included every AirPods release ever on this list, with the standard AirPods, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max all included.\n\nWhich Apple AirPods model are you most likely to buy? Apple AirPods Pro (second generation) Apple AirPods (third generation) Apple AirPods (second generation) Apple AirPods Max None \u2013 I prefer a AirPods alternative Answer See Results\n\nEvery Apple AirPods Generation in Order of Release\n\nApple AirPods (1st Generation) - December 13, 2016\n\nThe Apple AirPods (1st Generation) were the pair that started it all. Despite bundling in wired Apple EarPods with all iPhone models, this marked Apple's first jump into the wireless earbud space. The AirPods were brilliantly easy to use thanks to the Apple W1 Chip, which granted users the ability to flip open the AirPods and seamlessly connect them to any Apple device.\n\nApple AirPods (2nd Generation) - March 20, 2019\n\nWhile Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) looked just like the original pair on the outside, numerous changes were made internally that paved the way for a significant upgrade. Apple first replaced the W1 chip with the H1, a chip that allowed for quicker connectivity overall. Additionally, while the battery life remained unchanged, Hey Siri functionality was added for users to quickly access Apple's AI assistant.\n\nApple AirPods Pro (1st Generation) - October 30, 2019\n\nThe AirPods Pro marked Apple's first foray into the premium wireless earbud market. Instead of an open-ear design, AirPods Pro has silicone tips that go inside your ear, which opened the door for both higher quality sound and Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). Apple offered two ANC modes on AirPods Pro: Active Noise Cancellation & Transparency Mode. The latter allows for voices to enter and mix with the sound while keeping all other noises cancelled out.\n\nApple AirPods Max - December 15, 2020\n\nIn 2020, Apple released the AirPods Max, a brand-new take on Apple AirPods. This model has a complete over-ear design, which looks much closer to the Sony WH-1000MX5 or Bose QuietComfort 45. AirPods Max still offers the best sound quality to date on any AirPods model, with a great balance and quality bass performance. Apple did release an updated version of the AirPods Max in 2024, but the only change was a USB-C port.\n\nApple Apple AirPods Max Wireless Over-Ear Headphones 0 Features: Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, Spatial Audio, Digital Crown for Volume Control, Bluetooth Headphones for iPhone See it at Amazon Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) - October 26, 2021 Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) was a major shakeup in design compared to the last generation. This time, the design was much closer to Apple AirPods Pro, with the case much more rectangular, and the AirPods themselves having shorter stems. This generation also improved the battery life in a big way, with over six hours of additional listening time on Apple AirPods (3rd Generation).\n\nApple AirPods (3rd Generation) 1 See it at Walmart Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) - September 23, 2022 Three years after the release of AirPods Pro, Apple released AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) in 2022. This upgrade replaced the lightning port on the charging case with USB-C, increased water and dust resistance, and more. Sound quality was also much improved with this model, especially in regards to Active Noise Cancellation performance. Recently, Apple even added support for a clinically-validated hearing test to AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) that can gauge ear health and showcase listening habits to users.\n\nApple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) with MagSafe Case (USB-C) 0 See it at Walmart Apple AirPods (4th Generation) - September 20, 2024 The most recent AirPods model, Apple AirPods (4th Generation) marked the first time that Apple offered multiple models for one AirPods gen. You can choose between either the standard model or a model equipped with Active Noise Cancellation. A new design was made specifically to fit in as many user's ears as possible, with a solid upgrade in sound quality offered as well.",

The M4 MacBook Air is also expected to expand its battery life to one or two hours more than the previous version.\n\nApple's M4 Silicon Chipset and the MacBook Air\n\nMany Apple fans have questioned why it missed one device as part of the showcase last October, with the company holding back on releasing the M4 upgrade expected of the MacBook Air. The good thing is that various rumors claimed that Apple is still working on this device, with the macOS 15.2's previous leak confirming that the company is targeting a 2025 release for this laptop.\n\nThe previous reports claimed that Apple is planning to unveil the two options for the MacBook Air with the M4 chipset, and this includes both the 13-inch and 15-inch versions of the device.\n\nAdditionally, it will come with an additional upgrade from Apple that will convince users to make the switch, with the M4 MacBook Air offering the capability to connect to up to two external displays and still use its built-in screen as a third.\n\nApart from this and several upgrades to its processing power, there are no more additional details as to what the M4 MacBook Air will offer users once it arrives.",

The latest victim to this phenomenon is the Apple Mail app, which got a major redesign in iOS 18. This update is also rolling out on iPads and MacBooks.\n\nThe new Apple Mail design separates emails into categories, like Primary, Transactions, Updates, and Promotions. It also gives contact photos to each sender, which aligns with the company\u2019s new branding features for businesses across the iOS ecosystem.\n\nWhile some users find the redesign visually unappealing and difficult to navigate, others find that they are more likely to miss important messages, which is understandably not ideal.\n\nAcross social media, beleaguered iOS users have described this update as \u201ccompletely unreliable,\u201d \u201cindecipherable,\u201d and \u201cso ugly.\u201d Some have gone as far as to wish the app\u2019s UX designers would \u201cpoop hedgehogs.\u201d\n\nThankfully, there is a way to turn off these updates without manifesting this unthinkable rectal pain into the world.\n\nFirst, open your Mail app on iOS 18.\n\nLocate the three-dot menu in the upper right corner of your screen.\n\nFrom there, select \u201cList View\u201d instead of \u201cCategories\u201d as your display.\n\nWhile this at least returns your inbox to whatever setup you had before, there\u2019s still a lot of visual clutter, since contact photos still appear in the app. This may be convenient when you\u2019re texting via Messages because you probably have contact photos for your friends and family. But in your mail inbox, it doesn\u2019t really help to see a little yellow shopping bag next to every single email from a retailer \u2014 especially since multiple tech blogs and newsletters I subscribe to get flagged with the same icon as H&M or Anthropologie, which are ostensibly a different kind of business.\n\nTo get rid of the contact photos on your iOS Mail app, follow these steps:\n\nOpen the Settings app on your iPhone.\n\nScroll to the bottom of the screen, where you will see a section called Apps.\n\nFrom the Apps menu, scroll until you find the Mail app (or just type Mail into the search bar to save yourself a solid five seconds \u2014 life is short).\n\nUnder the section labeled Message List, toggle off the option that reads Show Contact Photos.\n\nAt last, your Mail app is free from clutter \u2014 well, except for those promotional emails from H&M and Anthropologie that you don\u2019t really open anyway. Maybe it\u2019s time to unsubscribe from a bunch of mailing lists? You\u2019re on your own for that one.",

The first dataset was provided by an unnamed American agriculture company. It comprises 4,000 structured text entries detailing both external indicators (size and weight) and internal indicators (sweetness, crunchiness, juiciness, ripeness, and acidity) of apple quality.\n\nThe structured text data in the first dataset includes quantitative and categorical variables. The publisher performed preliminary preprocessing during data collection, including the imputation of missing values and the removal of outliers. Subsequent normality testing confirmed that all variables followed a normal distribution. Detailed descriptions of these indicators are presented in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 Indicator description in the structured text dataset. Full size table\n\nThe ripeness of apples is classified into three categories according to expert assessment: high-ripeness apples, medium-ripeness apples, and low-ripeness apples. This classification is widely used for tasks related to apple ripeness identification.\n\nThe second dataset consists of 650 images of apples at various stages of ripeness, captured in orchards against complex backgrounds. The ripeness of these apples is asassessed by experts based on a combination of internal and external indicators, as described in the first dataset. The number of apple samples labeled by ripeness category is shown in Table 2. The images vary in size and the size of the apples varies from image to image. And most images show apples on the tree that have not yet been harvested. Notably, some images capture multiple apple samples, leading to a higher number of samples than images.\n\nTable 2 Number of apple samples collected for each ripeness category. Full size table\n\nHyperparameter optimization-based regressor for predicting apple ripeness\n\nRegressor\n\nSupport vector regression\n\nSupport Vector Regression (SVR)32 is a robust machine learning technique specifically designed to tackle regression problems based on mathematical statistics. SVR operates by constructing a linear function that maps indicators \\(\\:x\\) to quality \\(\\:y\\), minimizing the discrepancy between predicted quality \\(\\:f\\left(x\\right)\\) and actual quality \\(\\:y\\). The linear function can be written as:\n\n$$\\:f\\left(x\\right)={w}^{T}x+b$$ (1)\n\nwhere \\(\\:w\\:\\text{i}\\text{s}\\:\\text{t}\\text{h}\\text{e}\\:\\text{w}\\text{e}\\text{i}\\text{g}\\text{h}\\text{t}\\:\\text{c}\\text{o}\\text{e}\\text{f}\\text{f}\\text{i}\\text{c}\\text{i}\\text{e}\\text{n}\\text{t},\\:x\\) is the input feature vector, and \\(\\:b\\) is the bias term. To mitigate the risk of overfitting, SVR adopts \\(\\:\\epsilon\\) insensitive loss function, which is defined as:\n\n$$\\:L\\left({y}_{i},f\\left({x}_{i}\\right)\\right)=max\\left(0,\\left|{y}_{i}-f\\left({x}_{i}\\right)\\right|-\\epsilon\\right)f$$ (2)\n\nwhen the forecast error is less than a specified threshold \\(\\:\\epsilon\\), the loss is zero. Any error exceeding this threshold \\(\\:\\epsilon\\) contributes to the loss.\n\nSVR then reduces the problem of finding the optimal \\(\\:w\\) and \\(\\:b\\) to solving the following optimization problems:\n\n$$\\:SVR\\left(\\theta\\:\\right)\\:=\\:\\underset{w,b,\\xi\\:,{\\xi\\:}^{*}}{min}\\:\\frac{1}{2}\\parallel\\:w{\\parallel\\:}^{2}+C\\sum\\:_{i=1}^{n}\\:\\left({\\xi\\:}_{i}+{\\xi\\:}_{i}^{*}\\right)$$ (3)\n\n$$\\:s.t.\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}{y}_{i}-{w}^{T}{x}_{i}-b\\le\\:\\epsilon+{\\xi\\:}_{i},\\\\\\:{w}^{T}{x}_{i}+b-{y}_{i}\\le\\:\\epsilon+{\\xi\\:}_{i}^{*},\\\\\\:{\\xi\\:}_{i},{\\xi\\:}_{i}^{*}\\ge\\:0,\\:i=\\text{1,2},\\dots\\:,n.\\end{array}\\right.$$ (4)\n\nwhere \\(\\:{\\xi\\:}_{i}\\) and \\(\\:{\\xi\\:}_{i}^{\\text{*}}\\) are slack variables that permit some data points to fall outside the \\(\\:\\epsilon\\) epsilon zone, providing a degree of tolerance in the predictions. The parameter \\(\\:C\\) is a regularization factor used to regulate the training error. By solving the corresponding optimization problem, SVR can be constructed to accurately predict apple ripeness.\n\nEnsemble algorithms\n\nEnsemble algorithms, such as AdaBoost21,22, RandomForest23,24, GBDT25,26, XGBoost27,28, CatBoost29,30, are generally less sensitive to hyperparameter settings.\n\nAdaBoost creates a strong learner by combining multiple weak regressor. AdaBoost adjusts the weights of samples based on the performance of previous regressor. The optimization formula is as follows:\n\n$$\\:AdaBoost\\left(w\\right)={\\sum\\:}_{i=1}^{N}{w}_{i}exp(-\\alpha\\:{y}_{i}f({x}_{i}\\left)\\right)$$ (5)\n\nwhere \\(\\:\\alpha\\:\\) represents the weight of the weak learner, \\(\\:{w}_{i}\\) denotes the weight of the weak learner.\n\nRandomForest constructs an ensemble of decision trees, each trained on random subsets of data and features. RandomForest aggregates predictions from multiple treescombines to improve accuracy and reduce variance.\n\n$$\\:RandomForest\\left(Tree\\right)=\\frac{1}{T}{\\sum\\:}_{t=1}^{T}{Tree}_{t}\\left(x\\right)$$ (6)\n\nwhere T denotes the number of trees, and \\(\\:{Tree}_{t}\\left(x\\right)\\) represents the prediction from the \\(\\:t\\)-th tree.\n\nGBDT builds trees sequentially where each tree aims to correct the residual errors of the previous trees using gradient descent. The optimization process in GBDT is analogous to that in CatBoost.\n\nXGBoost is an advanced ensemble method that builds decision trees sequentially. Each tree corrects the errors of the previous ones, using gradient boosting to optimize the model. The optimization process is as follows:\n\n$$\\:XGBoost\\left(w\\right)\\:=\\:\\underset{w}{min}{\\sum\\:}_{i=1}^{N}L({y}_{i},f\\left({x}_{i}\\right))+{\\sum\\:}_{k=1}^{K}(\\gamma\\:{T}_{k}+\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda\\:{\\sum\\:}_{j=1}^{J}\\parallel\\:{w}_{k}^{j}{\\parallel\\:}^{2})$$ (7)\n\nwhere \\(\\:{T}_{k}\\) represents the \\(\\:k\\)-th tree of XGBoost, \u03b3 penalizes the number of leaves in the tree, \u03bb is the L2 regularization parameter, and \\(\\:{w}_{k}^{j}\\) denotes the weight of each leaf \\(\\:j\\) in the \\(\\:k\\)-th tree.\n\nCatBoost handles categorical features efficiently using ordered boosting. It improves model performance by preventing overfitting and dealing with data directly. The optimization objective is described as:\n\n$$\\:CatBoost\\left(w\\right)=\\underset{w}{min}\\:{\\sum\\:}_{i=1}^{N}L({y}_{i},f\\left({x}_{i}\\right))+\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda\\:{\\sum\\:}_{k=1}^{K}({\\sum\\:}_{j=1}^{J}\\parallel\\:{w}_{k}^{j}{\\parallel\\:}^{2})$$ (8)\n\nwhere \\(\\:{w}_{j}\\) is the weight of each leaf \\(\\:j\\).\n\nEvolutionary algorithms for regressor optimization\n\nWhale optimization algorithm\n\nWhale optimization algorithm (WOA)14,15 is inspired by whale foraging behavior and is used to optimize parameters in complex machine learning models. The principle is shown in Fig. 2, and key steps include:\n\nInitialization Represent a population of model parameters. Each parameter is denoted as \\(\\:{x}_{i}\\), where \\(\\:i\\) is the \\(\\:i\\)-th individual whale. The population is denoted as:\n\n$$\\:X=\\left\\{{x}_{1},{x}_{2},\\dots\\:,{x}_{n}\\right\\}$$ (9)\n\nFitness evaluation Update whale positions based on three behaviors.\n\nEncircling prey:\n\n$$\\:X(t+1)={X}^{*}\\left(t\\right)-A\\cdot\\:D$$ (10)\n\nwhere \\(\\:{X}^{\\text{*}}\\left(t\\right)\\) is the current best solution, \\(\\:A\\) is the coefficient vector, and \\(\\:D\\) is the distance vsctor.\n\nBubble-Net Attacking Method:\n\n$$\\:X(t+1)={D}^{{\\prime\\:}}\\cdot\\:{e}^{bl}\\cdot\\:cos\\left(2\\pi\\:l\\right)+{X}^{\\text{*}}\\left(t\\right)$$ (11)\n\nwhere \\(\\:{D}^{{\\prime\\:}}\\) is the distance vector, and \\(\\:b\\) and \\(\\:l\\) are constant parameters.\n\nSearch for Pery:\n\n$$\\:X(t+1)={X}_{\\text{rand}}\\left(t\\right)-A\\cdot\\:D$$ (12)\n\nwhere \\(\\:{X}_{\\text{rand}}\\left(t\\right)\\) is the randomly selected whale position.\n\nParameter optimization Use updated parameters to train the model, recalculate fitness values, and select the optimal parameter combination for model improvement.\n\nFig. 2 The principle of whale optimization algorithm.

Full size image\n\nGrey Wolf optimizer\n\nGrey wolf optimizer (GWO)16,17 is a bio-inspired optimization algorithm designed based on the hunting behavior of grey wolves. As shown in Fig. 3, this algorithm mirrors the social hierarchy and cooperative hunting strategies observed in grey wolf packs. Within GWO, key entities include the alpha (\\(\\:\\alpha\\:\\)), beta (\\(\\:\\beta\\:\\)), and delta (\\(\\:\\delta\\:\\)) wolves, which represent the top three optimal solutions, as well as the remaining wolves that assist in updating the positions of individuals in the population.\n\nFig. 3 Leadership hierarchy of gray wolves in nature. Full size image\n\nThe updating of individual positions is based on simulating the hunting behavior of grey wolves, which is categorized into the following scenarios.\n\nTop Wolves Selection In this context, \\(\\:{X}_{\\alpha\\:}\\) represents the individual with the best fitness value, while \\(\\:{X}_{\\beta\\:}\\) and \\(\\:{X}_{\\delta\\:}\\) correspond to the second and third best individuals, respectively.\n\n$$\\:{X}_{\\alpha\\:},{X}_{\\beta\\:},{X}_{\\delta\\:}=Top3\\left(X\\right)$$ (13)\n\nOther Wolve Position Update\n\n$$\\:X(t+1)=\\frac{{X}_{\\alpha\\:}+{X}_{\\beta\\:}+{X}_{\\delta\\:}}{3}-A\\cdot\\:D$$ (14)\n\nwhere \\(\\:{X}_{\\alpha\\:}\\), \\(\\:{X}_{\\beta\\:}\\), and \\(\\:{X}_{\\delta\\:}\\) are the positions of the \\(\\:\\alpha\\:\\), \\(\\:\\beta\\:\\), and \\(\\:\\delta\\:\\) wolves, respectively. The vectors \\(\\:A\\) and \\(\\:D\\) represent the coefficient vector and distance vector r, respectively.\n\nSparrow search algorithm\n\nSparrow search algorithm (SSA)18,19 is a novel swarm intelligence optimization algorithm that mimics the foraging and vigilance behaviors of sparrows. As shown in Fig. 4, by initializing the population, defining a fitness function, and updating the positions of foragers and sentinels, SSA can effectively search for the optimal solution on a global scale. In this algorithm, producers focus on foraging food, while scroungers vigilance and protect against potential threats.\n\nFig. 4 Sparrow search algorithm. (a) Two kinds of units in sparrow society: producers and scroungers, (b) starving scroungers for foraging, and (c) aversion behavior and (d) straggler for aversion.

Empirical research indicates that integrating attention mechanisms with YOLO models yields considerable benefits across multiple applications. Specifically, in object detection tasks, this integration has been shown to improve performance by allowing the model to concentrate on key features. In the Enhanced-YOLOv8 + model, the backbone network first extracts deep features from the input apple images, which are resized at 640 \u00d7 640 pixels. Subsequently, the neck network integrates these extracted features, enabling the model to consolidate and utilize multi-scale feature information. This process enhances the effectiveness of the feature layers, resulting in three enriched feature layers. The final component, the head, is responsible for analyzing and interpreting each feature point on these layers to determine the object\u2019s specific location, confidence level, and class. The Enhanced-YOLOv8 + framework is shown in Fig. 5, the main ones are Detect Efficient Head (ECA) and Efficient Channel Attention (DEH), apart from the backbone.\n\nFig. 5 The framework of the enhanced-YOLOv8 + model. Full size image\n\nDetect efficient head\n\nIn this study, we introduce the Detect Efficient Head (DEH), a simplified version of the original, more complex detection head in YOLOv833. DEH is an advanced structure for object detection heads, designed to improve both the computational efficiency and detection accuracy of the model. In DEH, the tasks of classification and localization are processed through a shared network pathway, achieving efficient feature extraction and handling both classification and regression tasks. Additionally, efficient convolution operations are introduced, reducing computational cost and latency. Compared to original detection heads, DEH significantly enhances the model\u2019s computational efficiency and real-time performance while maintaining high detection accuracy. These modifications make it particularly suitable for resource-constrained applications. In our ablation study, DEH demonstrates excellent performance and robustness in the apple quality prediction task.\n\nEfficient channel attention\n\nThe Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)34 mechanism is an improved version of the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)35 attention mechanism, that specifically addresses the challenges associated with dimensionality reduction in channel attention. ECA enhances inter-channel interaction by directly applying a 1 \u00d7 1 convolution layer after global average pooling, which implies the dimensionality reduction step. Moreover, ECA employs an adaptive 1D convolution kernel, which improves the model\u2019s ability to capture information across different channels. This results in enhanced efficiency and performance, while limiting the growth in the number of parameters.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 6, ECA facilitates cross-channel information interaction through a one-dimensional convolution, where the size of the convolution kernel is adaptively adjusted by a function. This allows layers with a larger number of channels to engage in more extensive cross-channel interaction. The adaptive function is defined as:\n\n$$\\:k=\\left|\\frac{{log}_{2}\\left(c\\right)}{\\gamma\\:}+\\frac{b}{\\gamma\\:}\\right|,\\:b=2,\\:\\gamma\\:=1$$ (18)\n\nwhere \\(\\:\\text{c}\\) is the number of channels, \\(\\:{\\upgamma\\:}\\) is a scaling factor, and b is an offset. This formulation ensures that the kernel size \\(\\:k\\) adapts according to the number of channels, optimizing the model\u2019s ability to capture inter-channel dependencies in a computationally efficient manner.\n\nLost function\n\nCoefficient of determination for regression\n\nThis study employed the root mean square error (RMSE) as a key metric for model optimization. RMSE quantifies the average deviation between the predicted and actual values in the model. By assessing RMSE, the evaluation of how well the model captures the underlying patterns in the data can be conducted. A lower RMSE value indicates a better fit, suggesting that the model accounts for a larger portion of the variability observed in the dependent variable, as shown in Eq. 19:\n\n$$\\:RMSE=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\:_{i=1}^{n}\\:\\:{\\left({R}_{i}-{\\stackrel{\\prime }{R}}_{i}\\right)}^{2}}$$ (19)\n\nIntersection over union measurement for object detection\n\nExisting loss functions, including those based on Intersection over Union (IoU), have not fully addressed the issue of accurately predicting bounding boxes, which often results in slow model convergence and lower prediction accuracy. Additionally, traditional loss functions tend to overlook the imbalance between positive and negative samples, causing predictions with minimal overlap with the target box to disproportionately affect the loss value. To address these issues, the Enhanced IoU (EIoU) loss function is used in this study, which is expressed as:\n\n$$\\:{{L}_{EIoU}=L}_{IoU}+{L}_{dis}+{L}_{asp}=1-IoU+\\frac{{d}^{2}\\left({b}^{p},{b}^{gt}\\right)}{{\\left({w}^{c}\\right)}^{2}+{\\left({h}^{c}\\right)}^{2}}+\\frac{{d}^{2}\\left({w}^{p},{w}^{gt}\\right)}{{\\left({w}^{c}\\right)}^{2}}+\\frac{{d}^{2}\\left({h}^{p},{h}^{gt}\\right)}{{\\left({h}^{c}\\right)}^{2}}$$ (20)\n\nwhere \\(\\:{b}^{gt}\\) and \\(\\:{b}^{p}\\) represent the center coordinates of the ground truth box and the predicted box, respectively, \\(\\:{w}^{c}\\) and \\(\\:{h}^{c}\\) are the width and height of the smallest enclosing rectangle that covers both the predicted and ground truth boxes, \\(\\:d\\left({b}^{p},{b}^{gt}\\right)\\) denotes the Euclidean distance between these two center points. Similarly, \\(\\:{\\text{*}}^{p}\\) and \\(\\:{\\text{*}}^{gt}\\) denote the corresponding parameters (width and height) of the predicted and ground truth boxes. \\(\\:d\\left({w}^{p},{w}^{gt}\\right)\\) indicates the difference in width between the predicted and ground truth boxes, \\(\\:d\\left({h}^{p},{h}^{gt}\\right)\\) indicates the difference in height between the predicted and ground truth boxes.\n\nExperimental setup\n\nRegressor for predicting Apple ripeness\n\nTo evaluate the performance of the apple ripeness prediction model, we constructed a database containing 4,000 samples, which was then divided into a training set and a testing set in a 7:3 ratio. Specifically, 70% of the data was randomly selected for training the model, while the remaining 30% was used for testing, ensuring the model\u2019s generalization capability. Additionally, a five-fold cross-validation approach was employed as the objective function for model optimization.\n\nThis study employed several metrics, including root mean square error(RMSE), coefficient of determination(\\(\\:{\\text{R}}^{2}\\)), mean absolute error(MAE), and variance accounted for(VAF), to assess the model\u2019s performance in predicting apple ripeness. RMSE is measuring the average deviation between the predicted values and the actual values. R2 indicates the fraction of the overall variability in the dependent variable that is accounted for by the model. MAE is measuring the average absolute deviation between the predicted values and the actual values. VAF indicates the percentage of the total variance that is explained by the model.\n\n$$\\:{R}^{2}=1-\\frac{\\sum\\:_{i=1}^{n}\\:\\:{\\left({R}_{i}-{\\stackrel{{\\prime }}{\\text{R}}}_{i}\\right)}^{2}}{\\sum\\:_{i=1}^{n}\\:\\:{\\left({\\text{R}}_{i}-\\stackrel{{\\prime}}{\\text{R}}\\right)}^{2}}$$ (21)\n\n$$\\:MAE=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\:_{i=1}^{n}\\:\\left|{\\text{R}}_{i}-{\\stackrel{{\\prime }}{\\text{R}}}_{i}\\right|$$ (22)\n\n$$\\:VAF=\\left(1-\\frac{Var(R-\\stackrel{{\\prime }}{\\text{R}})}{Var\\left(R\\right)}\\right)\\times\\:100\\%$$ (23)\n\nThe SVR model demonstrates significant advantages in handling outliers and continuous variables, making it an effective method for addressing both regression and classification problems. Given the widespread popularity of the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model for its exceptional performance and minimal reliance on feature engineering, this study adopted an SVR model based on Gradient Boosting Trees.\n\nYOLO for Apple localization and ripeness identification\n\nTo enhance the model\u2019s generalizability and robustness, this study utilized various data augmentation techniques, including image cropping, translation, rotation, and brightness adjustment, to expand the original dataset while maintaining class balance. The original dataset consisted of 650 images, distributed across three ripeness categories: High-Ripeness (241 images), Medium-Ripeness (215 images), and Low-Ripeness (234 images). These augmentation techniques were applied equally across all categories, increasing the dataset size by 3.2 times to a total of 2,160 images.\n\nThe augmented dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing sets in an 8:1:1 ratio, ensuring each subset preserved the class balance of the original dataset. For model evaluation, the mean Average Precision (mAP) at a threshold of 0.50 (mAP@50) was employed as the primary performance metric. This metric evaluates the precision-recall trade-off for image classification at a confidence threshold of 0.50, ensuring robust assessment of the model\u2019s capability to differentiate ripeness categories. This approach mitigates the risk of overfitting by exposing the model to a more diverse range of scenarios while improving its adaptability to unseen data. To enhance the model\u2019s generalizability and robustness, this study utilized various data augmentation techniques, including image cropping, translation, rotation, and brightness adjustment, to expand the original dataset while maintaining class balance. The original dataset consisted of 650 images, distributed across three ripeness categories: High-Ripeness (241 images), Medium-Ripeness (215 images), and Low-Ripeness (234 images). These augmentation techniques were applied equally across all categories, increasing the dataset size by 3.2 times to a total of 2,160 images.\n\nTo evaluate the model\u2019s performance, this study employed three key metrics: Recall, Precision, and mean Average Precision at a threshold of 0.50 (mAP@50). These metrics provide a robust assessment of the model\u2019s classification capabilities and are defined as follows:\n\n$$\\:Recall=\\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$$ (24)\n\n$$\\:\\text{}Precision=\\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$$ (25)\n\nwhere TP (True Positives) represents the correctly identified samples, FN (False Negatives) refers to the samples incorrectly classified as negative, and FP (False Positives) refers to the samples incorrectly classified as positive.\n\nmAP@50 is calculated as the mean of the Average Precision (AP) values across all classes, where AP is defined as the area under the Precision-Recall ( \\(\\:\\text{P}-\\text{R}\\) ) curve. Specifically, at a confidence threshold of 0.50, the mAP is computed as:\n\n$$\\:AP={\\int\\:}_{0}^{1}\\:P\\left(r\\right)dr,\\:mAP@50=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum\\:_{i=1}^{N}\\:A{P}_{i}$$ (26)\n\nhere, \\(\\:\\text{P}\\left(\\text{r}\\right)\\) denotes Precision as a function of Recall, and \\(\\:\\text{N}\\) represents the total number of classes.\n\nThe Recall curve, Precision curve, and mAP@50 curve were generated to visualize and analyze the model\u2019s performance comprehensively. These visualizations highlight the tradeoffs between precision and recall at different thresholds and provide insights into the model\u2019s robustness.\n\nThe experiments were running an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 GPU and a 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-13700 H 2.40 GHz CPU, with the CUDA toolkit 12.0. The models were optimized using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer, with the number of training epochs set to 100 and a batch size of 32. To thoroughly assess the performance of the proposed models, Precision, Recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP@50) were chosen as the key evaluation metrics.",

            "content": "If you simply must have blue text bubbles\u2014but don't require all of Apple's newest phone technology\u2014the iPhone 16e could right for you, reviewers say.\n\nApple (AAPL) announced the 16e last month, a comparatively low-cost iPhone that includes its latest AI features but not such capabilities as MagSafe wireless charging technology and the Dynamic Island function that lets users see some background activities\u2014like timers and map directions\u2014on their home screens.\n\nInvestopedia read a selection of reviews to get a sense of early responses to the phone, which was to hit stores yesterday. Here's a selection of what we found, along with links to the reviews.\n\nFor $600, the phone comes without some features that are present in other iPhone 16 models. While that means it might not match everyone's needs, several reviewers wrote, it might be a fit for someone who hasn\u2019t upgraded in a while or is dipping their toe in the iPhone waters for the first time.\n\n\u201cIt's for the person holding on to an iPhone 8 Plus or iPhone X, ready to upgrade because their more than seven-year-old smartphone isn't working too well nowadays. They want a new phone, and it just needs to be an iPhone,\u201d says a Wired review.\n\nA CNET review said that Apple chose to implement some of its best features in the simplified model, citing battery life (though the review says more testing would be needed), a high-quality camera (though no ultra-wide camera), quick upload speeds, and Apple emergency features including satellite support to reach emergency responders when there's no cell signal. TechCrunch says the iPhone 16e \"isn't an exciting device. It's a safe one,\" with reliability that keeps costs down.\n\nWhile other models in the iPhone 16 family start just shy of $800, some reviewers think the list price for the iPhone 16e is still too high, given the omissions. Other budget-friendly phones on the market offer more bells and whistles at a lower cost, several wrote.\n\n\u201cOn Android, you can buy a $500 phone with a fast refresh-rate screen, two rear cameras, seven years of software support, and wireless charging. On iOS, you can buy this $599 phone with one rear camera, a standard 60Hz screen, wireless charging (but no MagSafe), and an ample but unstated amount of software support. Apple has no competition when it comes to phones running iOS. The company can gate-keep these conveniences behind a higher price tag, and that\u2019s simply the way things will be,\u201d reads a review from The Verge.\n\nStill, USA Today says it's \"the best entry point into Apple's ecosystem in years,\" and a step up from the company's iPhone SE, which had its third generation release in March 2022.\n\n",

            "content": "As Netflix's new series \"Apple Cider Vinegar\" demonstrates, many wellness trends that may or may not have scientific backing are spread on social media. Drinking apple cider vinegar to boost your health is an example of this. Though vinegar has been used for thousands of years in food preservation and medicine, today, you will find many influencers promoting its benefits. But is what they say actually true?\n\nWhile research reveals that apple cider vinegar actually does have some potential benefits, it's not a miracle cure that can completely turn your health around. To help you determine what's true, let's discuss apple cider vinegar's possible benefits and side effects, along with the ideal daily dosage.\n\nWhat is apple cider vinegar or ACV?\n\nWhen you combine apples, sugar and yeast and allow it to ferment, it creates apple cider vinegar. Over several weeks, the yeast will digest the sugar to make alcohol. Once this happens, natural bacteria will turn the alcohol into acetic acid, which gives apple cider vinegar its pungent odor and taste.\n\nYou have two options when you buy apple cider vinegar: filtered and pasteurized, or raw and unfiltered. The cloudy sediment that collects in the bottom of the bottle is \"the mother,\" which is a combination of bacteria and yeast. Some speculate that the mother is what provides the health benefits, as it contains trace amounts of healthy bacteria and probiotics.\n\nApple cider vinegar can be used in the kitchen, around the home and for your health as a:\n\nDeodorizer\n\nPreservative\n\nDressing or vinaigrette\n\nCleaner\n\nFacial toner\n\nMarinade\n\nFruit and vegetable wash\n\nDenture cleaner\n\nHair rinse\n\nDandruff treatment\n\nWeed killer\n\nMouthwash\n\nAnna Gragert/CNET\n\n4 apple cider vinegar health benefits\n\nAlthough more research is needed, several small and medium-sized studies show the benefits of apple cider vinegar for some health issues and as a potential weight loss aid.\n\n1. May help control blood sugar and diabetes\n\nUp to 95% of diabetics have type 2 diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Type 2 diabetes occurs from insulin resistance, which is \"when cells in the body don't respond properly to insulin, which leads to increased levels of sugar or glucose in the blood,\" according to Amelia Ti, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator in NYC.\n\nEven if you don't have diabetes, it's best to keep blood sugar levels in the normal range. Studies have shown that apple cider vinegar can improve insulin response and lower blood sugar levels after meals.\n\nConsuming apple cider vinegar before going to sleep has also been shown to reduce fasting blood sugar after waking. Make sure to talk with your doctor before consuming ACV if you have diabetes, especially if you're on medication due to potential side effects.\n\n\"ACV alone will not lower blood sugar levels and should not be considered a substitute for diabetes medications,\" states Ti.\n\nRead more: The Atlantic Diet: Why Eating Whole, Local Foods May Improve Your Health\n\n2. Kills harmful bacteria\n\nThose looking to preserve food naturally may want to consider using apple cider vinegar. It is a known pathogen killer, which includes microbes like staph and candida.\n\nVinegar is a popular preservative in Korea since it can prevent E. coli and norovirus from growing in food. E. coli can cause food poisoning when consumed, but the bactericidal effects of the acetic acid in apple cider vinegar can prevent it from occurring.\n\nRead more: 12 Best Probiotic Foods to Eat for Gut Health\n\n3. Could lead to weight loss\n\nAnother benefit of apple cider vinegar that may be useful is its ability to help with weight loss. When taken before or during a meal, ACV has been shown to help with satiety (the feeling of fullness).\n\nIn one study, participants ate approximately 200 to 275 fewer calories when apple cider vinegar was combined with a meal. Over three months, participants taking one to two tablespoons of ACV per day saw up to 3.7 pounds in weight loss and a reduction in body fat.\n\n4. Might improve cholesterol levels\n\nHigh cholesterol and triglyceride levels can increase your risk of heart disease.\n\nIncorporating up to an ounce of apple cider vinegar into your day, along with a lower-calorie diet, may reduce total cholesterol and triglycerides while also increasing HDL \"good\" cholesterol.\n\nThose with type 2 diabetes may also see positive results on their total cholesterol and triglyceride levels when adding a half ounce of ACV to their diet.\n\nRead more: 7 Money-Saving Tips for Eating Healthily on a Budget\n\nPotential apple cider vinegar side effects\n\nAlthough there are benefits of apple cider vinegar usage, there are also potential side effects to consider. The high acidity can strip tooth enamel, which won't come back once it's gone. It may cause damage to your esophagus or throat if you drink it undiluted.\n\nHere are some other potential side effects of apple cider vinegar:\n\nCan cause hypokalemia (low potassium levels)\n\nCan interact with diuretics, insulin and other medications\n\nCan cause nausea or vomiting\n\nCan weaken tooth enamel\n\nCan cause esophageal (throat) burns or ulcers when consumed in excess\n\nWatering it down with water or juice not only makes ACV more palatable, but it can also reduce the risk of damaging your throat and teeth. Combining one or two tablespoons with either may also cure an upset stomach.\n\nMarisa Moore, a registered dietitian nutritionist, also advises, \"It's important to remember that no one food is a silver bullet. If you choose to incorporate apple cider vinegar, do so safely and with a focus on maintaining a balanced whole diet for your overall health and well-being.\"\n\nHow much apple cider vinegar should you drink daily?\n\nApple cider vinegar dosage depends on the reason you're using it. In general, Ti states, \"I recommend 1 teaspoon to tablespoon ACV diluted in 6-8 oz of warm water before meals.\"\n\nIf you want to drink it, dilute it with water or your favorite juice or tea. You can also eat it by incorporating it in your favorite foods, especially dressings, vinaigrettes and even when making your own mayonnaise.\n\nThere are also plenty of premade apple cider vinegar drinks out there, which may make ACV more pleasant to taste. You can find these drinks from brands such as Bragg, Poppi, Remedy and Sidekick Sodas. Local health stores and even grocery stores may carry these, so keep an eye out if you're interested in apple cider vinegar drinks.\n\nYou can also add a cup or two to a bath for skin issues. Mixing a tablespoon of ACV with a cup of water, and then soaking gauze or cotton in the solution can make a wet wrap.\n\nTo use apple cider vinegar as a hair rinse, combine up to two tablespoons with a cup of water, then pour over the hair after shampooing. Wait five minutes, then rinse. It can be drying, so use it sparingly. ACV can also irritate the scalp, so a weaker dilution may be better.\n\nAnnick Vanderschelden/Moment/Getty Images\n\nThe bottom line\n\nSome studies have found the benefits of apple cider vinegar, but we need more research to definitively prove how beneficial ACV is. It may help with weight loss, controlling type 2 diabetes, blood sugar and cholesterol and it can also prevent harmful bacteria growth on foods. Drinking undiluted apple cider vinegar can cause tooth enamel erosion or throat damage. Mixing ACV with water or juice before consuming it can prevent damage to the teeth and throat. As with any natural remedy, speak with your doctor before trying apple cider vinegar and do a skin test before using it on your skin.\n\n\"Remember that the advantages of adopting an overall healthy lifestyle (e.g. nutritious and balanced diet, adequate hydration, regular physical activity/movement, good sleep, stress management, etc.) are far greater than those of any single food, drink, or supplement,\" concludes Ti. \"There is no quick fix and ACV is definitely not a miracle solution!\"",

There was a standard AirPort Express, a higher-end AirPort Extreme with more advanced networking features, and an AirPort Time Capsule that doubled as an external storage drive for backing up a Mac with Time Machine.\n\n\n\nApple discontinued the AirPort line in 2018, but the company could return to the Wi-Fi router market in an unexpected way in the future.\n\nBack in December, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported that Apple was developing its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip that will debut in new Apple TV and HomePod mini models later this year. He said the chip is \"so sophisticated\" that it could \"theoretically\" turn these devices into a wireless access point. However, it is unclear if Apple will actually follow through with that idea, so temper your expectations for the time being.\n\nApple is reportedly aiming to make a bigger push into smart home products, with the company rumored to be planning an all-new smart home hub for release later this year. Apple is also said to be planning a HomeKit-enabled smart home camera that can connect to the hub, and together the products could serve as a home security system. If future Apple TV and/or HomePod models could effectively double as AirPort routers for Wi-Fi, that would be another way for Apple to expand its presence in the smart home market.\n\nApple's chip will support Wi-Fi 6E, according to Gurman, whereas the final AirPort models supported what is now known as Wi-Fi 5. However, Apple supply chain analyst Jeff Pu believes the chip will actually support Wi-Fi 7.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the Apple TV and HomePod actually become Wi-Fi routers, but Apple is seemingly developing technology that allows for it.",

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best money making stocks to buy now.\n\nThe US markets have been on a stellar run over the past couple of years, with two-year gains of 53%. This is the best performance for the broad market index since the 66% rally between 1997 and 1998.\n\nREAD ALSO: 15 Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years and 12 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Invest in According to Analysts.\n\nThe stock market has benefited from waning inflation, declining interest rates, and a resilient economy that has avoided recession. While continued growth is projected for 2025, analysts also warn of the rally having gone too far, with a correction in the offing this year. Moreover, the looming threat of fierce trade wars is already taking a toll on investor sentiment.\n\nThe broad market index fell for the fourth successive day on Tuesday, February 25, slipping 0.47% amid heightened concerns about economic growth and global trade. According to CNBC, investors are turning to US bonds, with treasury yield dropping below 4.3% to touch the lowest level since December.\n\nThe US president has announced that tariffs on Canada and Mexico will begin next month, ending the month-long suspension. The new administration also recently imposed additional 10% tariffs on Chinese goods and continues to warn the European Union of similar import taxes, citing the bloc\u2019s treatment of Washington.\n\nProtectionist policies have sparked market concerns about which countries will be next on the American president\u2019s list, leaving several large multinationals unsure of how to plan. Past trends show that the broad market index dropped by 5% on days when the US, under Trump\u2019s first stint as president, announced tariffs in 2018 and 2019. The index fell by a cumulative 7% when other countries imposed retaliatory tariffs.\n\nThe recent consumer confidence survey for February has added to the negative mood, with results coming in weaker than economists\u2019 estimates and registering the largest deterioration since August 2021. This is the third straight monthly decline, pushing the index to 98.3%, its lowest since June 2024.\n\nStephanie Guichard, senior economist of global indicators at The Conference Board, stated the following about the dip:",

While I didn\u2019t dive in during the X.10 days, I\u2019ve been using a variety of smart home devices for well over a decade now, and jumped in on HomeKit as soon as it crossed the Atlantic.\n\nBut a recent experience of something as simple as replacing a failed light-bulb really drove home how much further we have to go before we can expect non-techies to climb on board \u2026\n\nOne of my Philips Hue color ambiance bulbs failed a couple of days ago. It was probably more than 10 years old by then, having been moved between two or three different lamps, so I didn\u2019t consider that too unreasonable a lifespan.\n\nNo problem, I thought, I\u2019ll just order a replacement and be up-and-running again within a couple of minutes. The new bulb duly arrived, I opened the Home app, selected the room, tapped the + button, selected Add Accessory and the code scan window opened.\n\nI had a very vague and possibly incorrect recollection that the last time I did this a long time ago it was a conventional barcode we scanned, but the app clearly told me to scan the QR code.\n\nSo, I tried to scan the QR code printed on the bulb itself. The Home app made a number of attempts at identifying it, briefly showing white boxes in a variety of sizes, shapes, and angles, but no luck.\n\nI went very close, to fill the frame. Nada. I backed right out. Nope.\n\nI dug the Quick Start guide out, which was interesting as I\u2019d ordered a twin-pack in order to have a spare, and there was just a single guide with a single QR code. But the leaflet said to scan it, so \u2026\n\nNope \u2013 just a repeat of the bulb-scanning experience.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing this stuff a long time, so just rolled my eyes and went to plan C: plugging it into the lamp, opening the Hue app, waiting for that to find it, and then finally adding it to the Home app. But it reminded me that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a quick, slick, It Just Works experience with anything smart home related. Pretty much every device I\u2019ve ever added to my home has required the ritual sacrifice of at least one goat.\n\nThis is the problem we still need to fix with smart home kit. It\u2019s utterly ridiculous that it\u2019s this hard to change a lightbulb, FFS!\n\nIt\u2019s the problem Apple promised to fix with HomeKit, but didn\u2019t. It\u2019s the problem the company really needs to solve if it ever hopes to persuade normals to buy into smart homes.\n\nTo be fair, the company is aware of this. A patent application published five years ago described an approach to smart home devices which can completely configure themselves, with the only job of the user being to grant permission.\n\nApple cameras would use Apple Intelligence to scan your home, identify objects like sofas and cookers, use those to label each room \u2013 and then intelligently add devices to the network.\n\nPlug that new smart bulb into a living room lamp, and the system would say to itself \u201cAha, that\u2019s been added to a lamp in the living room, and the previous bulb there was named Living Room Table Lamp, so I\u2019ll just name it and configure it to match the previous bulb, and add it to all the same scenes.\u201d\n\nIf it\u2019s instead added to a new lamp, the system would think \u201cOk, this has been added to a floor lamp in the dining room, so I\u2019ll provisionally call it Dining Room Floor Lamp and ask the homeowner to confirm and advise whether they want to add it to the two living room scenes they have.\u201d\n\nA good first step would be to apply this kind of intelligence to the Apple-branded smart home products we\u2019re expecting to see launched \u2013 but equally important will be the Cupertino company offering this to the Connectivity Standards Alliance for inclusion in the Matter standard. Apple has form for occasional acts of industry altruism of this kind, such as allowing the Qi2 standard to be based on MagSafe.\n\nWith that approach implemented, changing a smart light bulb would be as easy as, well, changing a light-bulb.\n\nPhoto: Philips/Signify",

The goal of the NHL Watch Comms App is to provide that information to the officials directly on their wrist.\n\nOfficials across the League have been using this technology on a widespread scale, with almost all wearing the watch this season.\n\n\u201cHaving a participation rate over 90 percent in just the first few years speaks volumes, Lehanski said. \u201c(The officials) participated in the process from Day One. We knew we had to build a solution here for a very specific case, and we wanted them to be involved.\u201d\n\nThe League collaborated with Apple and Presidio, which developed the custom app for Apple Watch.\n\n\u201cAs an innovation partner to the NHL, Presidio was approached to develop a solution designed to enhance game clock and penalty box awareness, thereby improving player and official safety and reducing game interruptions,\u201d said Andres de Corral, vice president of digital services at Presidio, in a statement. \u201cOur team worked closely with NHL officials and their operations and technology teams to identify and deliver the ideal solution to realize their vision.\u201d\n\nLehanski was quick to compliment the collaboration between the NHL, Apple and Presidio to develop and expand on this technology.\n\n\u201cIn all these technology relationships we have, we can credibly make the claim that we\u2019re working with the world\u2019s best partner in that space,\u201d Lehanski said. \u201cAnd we feel exactly that way about this solution that we built with Apple and Presidio.\u201d\n\nThe NHL has a long-standing relationship with Presidio helping the League to improve the player, official, coach and fan experience. Presidio's work spans the NHL\u2019s entire technology ecosystem \u2013 from modernizing the NHL\u2019s IT infrastructure, to developing and managing mission-critical applications and enhancing streaming and production experiences for fans.\n\nThe NHL and Apple have long collaborated on ways technology can improve the game. Since 2017, iPad and Mac have delivered real-time video for coaches and players to make in game adjustments.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nApple shareholders emphatically voted down a shareholder proposal looking to slash the tech giant\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at its annual meeting Tuesday. Over 97% of shareholders voted against the proposal asking Apple to \u201ccease DEI efforts,\u201d according to a Feb. 25 securities filing .\n\nThe shareholder proposal was submitted by conservative think tank the National Center for Public Policy Research, which also submitted a similar proposal to the board of Costco. This proposal was shot down by 98% of the big box store\u2019s shareholders at its board meeting last month.\n\nApple\u2019s management advised shareholders to vote against the anti-DEI proposal in the company\u2019s annual proxy materials. The company said at the time that the proposal \u201cinappropriately attempts to restrict Apple\u2019s ability to manage its own ordinary business operations, people and teams, and business strategies.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe overwhelming rejection of NCPPR\u2019s anti-DEI proposals at Apple and Costco come as public and private companies alike have rolled back or altered diversity, equity and inclusion practices to comply with executive orders from President Donald Trump. After reversing a broad range of federal DEI policies on his first day in office, Trump ordered federal agencies to investigate private sector practices as well.\n\nAccording to Apple\u2019s Tuesday submission to the Securities and Exchange Commission, over 8.84 billion shareholders opposed the proposal, with just 2.1 million shareholders in support. Around 87.8 million shareholders abstained.\n\n\u201cThe board at Apple and its investors have today made it clear that the company\u2019s DEI programs are valuable for its staff and the business,\u201d Kohinoor Choudhury, DEI campaign manager for responsible investing nonprofit ShareAction, said in an emailed statement Tuesday.\n\nNCPPR\u2019s proposal was short, requesting that Apple stop its DEI efforts. The think tank cited the Supreme Court\u2019s decision striking down race-conscious admissions in higher education, as well as subsequent lawsuits that companies have faced over their DEI programs as a reason the tech giant should abandon its own policies.\n\nThe think tank\u2019s supporting statement in the proxy materials also cited the wave of program rollbacks that followed last summer, including at Tractor Supply, Lowes, Ford and the maker of Jack Daniel\u2019s.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order set off a number of announced policy changes, as companies look to make sure their DEI programs comply. A number of major banks have adjusted their filing language on such efforts, and companies including Meta, Target, McDonald\u2019s and more, have rolled back DEI programs.\n\nChoudhury said the rejection of the anti-DEI proposal at Apple \u201cmakes good business sense,\u201d and DEI policies \u201chelp businesses attract and keep talent and encourage innovation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hope to see shareholders continue to step up [at annual board meetings] and use their influence to uphold responsible investment standards on critical issues such as tackling workplace inequalities,\u201d Choudhury noted in her statement.\n\nCostco\u2019s management similarly advised its shareholders to reject NCPPR\u2019s proposal, and said in its proxy materials that \u201cit is the proponent and others that are responsible for inflicting burdens on companies with their challenges to longstanding diversity programs.\u201d\n\nWhile an increasing number of ESG-related shareholder proposals have reached a vote in recent years, the 2024 proxy season was the first time that an increase in anti-ESG proposal filings was responsible for the overall rise, according to Morningstar Sustainalytics. However the increase in filings has not corresponded with an increase in shareholder support for such measures, according to The Conference Board.",

            "content": "A lot has been written about the iPhone 16e, and not all of it flattering.\n\nIn particular, the baffling removal of MagSafe has fueled a lot of criticism, and I completely understand why.\n\nIn one fell swoop, MagSafe took away the most annoying element of wireless charging: the millimeter-by-millimeter shuffle of your handset to make its charging coils line up just right.\n\nBut Apple obviously doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem \u2014 or at least, not for the kind of buyer that the iPhone 16e is aimed at. In his Daring Fireball post about the new handset, John Gruber writes that company representatives assured him the 16e\u2019s target audience won\u2019t mind.\n\nApple users tend \u201cnot to use inductive charging at all, and when they do, they might not care that the 16e is stuck with a pokey 7.5W Qi charging speed\u201d, he says, paraphrasing the Apple line.\n\nI think Apple is probably right on this one, and not just because the world\u2019s first every three-trillion-dollar company knows a thing or two about selling iPhones.\n\nYou can\u2019t miss what you\u2019ve never had\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nI\u2019m actually sympathetic to my colleague Jeff Parsons\u2019 view that the lack of MagSafe is a deal-breaker.\n\nEver since buying my iPhone 14 Pro after a 13-year break with Android, I\u2019ve been rather smitten with my Belkin 3-in-1 charging stand and its beautiful convenience: just clip the iPhone on, and it quickly charges without messing around with cables.\n\nIt\u2019s so good that I don\u2019t even charge my phone at night anymore, as I know a lot of my working day will be at the desk \u2014 more than enough time for it to charge up. Personally, I can\u2019t imagine going back to pre-MagSafe life, and I imagine many Tom\u2019s Guide readers feel much the same way.\n\nBut if you\u2019re reading this, you might follow the minutia of every smartphone development and have strong opinions on it. Without stating the obvious, having more than a casual interest in smartphone tech is a minority pursuit.\n\nI\u2019m inclined to believe Apple when it says that the target market for the iPhone 16e won\u2019t be bothered by the lack of MagSafe.\n\nSo I\u2019m inclined to believe Apple when it says that the target market for the iPhone 16e won\u2019t be bothered by the lack of MagSafe. They\u2019ll see an iPhone with FaceID, Apple Intelligence and \u2014 most importantly of all \u2014 a $200 discount and be happy with their purchase.\n\nAs Apple Insider noticed, Apple seems to be specifically aiming the 16e at those using older handsets, noting in its accompanying press release that the battery lasts \u201cup to six hours longer than iPhone 11 and up to 12 hours longer than all generations of iPhone SE.\u201d It adds that the A18 processor is significantly faster than the A13 in the iPhone 11.\n\n\u201cWell, obviously,\u201d you might say \u2014 or more dismissive words to that effect \u2014 but again, that just suggests you\u2019re not who Apple is aiming the 16e at.\n\niPhone 11 comparison\n\nThe iPhone 11, charging happily without MagSafe (Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\nThe iPhone 11 is a telling comparison. It\u2019s the final generation before MagSafe was introduced with the iPhone 12. And no iPhone SE handsets have had the feature. The iPhone 16e is just following that trend.\n\nJust how I didn\u2019t know what I was missing with MagSafe when on Android, neither do iPhone SE or 11 users \u2014 and the latter may not baulk at the price, either. The iPhone 11 launched at $699 back in 2019, which makes the $599 iPhone 16e seem like a bargain \u2014 even though, again, readers of Tom\u2019s Guide will appreciate it\u2019s much more complicated than that.\n\nTo paraphrase Gruber\u2019s piece: you\u2019re likely not in the 16e demographic, but your friends and family members might well be. While a lack of MagSafe may be a deal breaker for you, don\u2019t be surprised if it hasn\u2019t even registered for everyday iPhone upgrades, just as Apple anticipates.",

            "content": "Apple's newest budget iPhone eschews some features such as MagSafe and multiple cameras to be more affordable but balances that with a processor powerful enough to run Apple Intelligence. If you just picked up a new iPhone 16E, you're probably wondering where to start with Apple's AI tech.\n\nCNET\n\nOr if you have another compatible iPhone -- an iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro (or their Plus and Max variants) running iOS 18.3 -- and discovered that Apple Intelligence was enabled automatically, I want to share five features, plus one in the new iOS 18.4 public beta, that I'm turning to every day.\n\nMore features will be added as time goes on -- and keep in mind that Apple Intelligence is still officially beta software -- but this is where Apple is starting its AI age.\n\nOn the other hand: Are you not impressed with Apple Intelligence or want to wait until the tools evolve more before using them? You can easily turn off Apple Intelligence entirely or use a smaller subset of features.\n\nSummaries bring TL;DR to your correspondence\n\nIn an era with so many demands on our attention and seemingly less time to dig into longer topics\u2026 Sorry, what was I saying?\n\nOh, right: How often have you wanted a \"too long; didn't read\" version of not just long emails but the fire hose of communication that blasts your way? The ability to summarize notifications, Mail messages and web pages is perhaps the most pervasive and least intrusive feature of Apple Intelligence so far.\n\nWhen a notification arrives, such as a text from a friend or group in Messages, the iPhone creates a short, single-sentence summary.\n\nApple Intelligence summarized two text messages. Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nSometimes summaries are vague, and sometimes they're unintentionally funny, but so far I've found them to be more helpful than not. Summaries can also be generated from alerts by third-party apps like news or social media apps -- although I suspect that my outdoor security camera is picking up multiple passersby over time and not telling me that 10 people are stacked by the door.\n\nNobody told me there's a party at my house. Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nThat said, Apple Intelligence definitely doesn't understand sarcasm or colloquialisms -- you can turn summaries off if you prefer.\n\nYou can also generate a longer summary of emails in the Mail app: Tap the Summarize button at the top of a message to view a rundown of the contents in a few dozen words.\n\nIn Safari, when viewing a page where the Reader feature is available, tap the Page Menu button in the address bar, tap Show Reader and then tap the Summary button at the top of the page.\n\nSummarize long articles in Safari in the Reader interface. Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nSiri gets a glow-up and better interaction\n\nI was amused during the iOS 18 and the iPhone 16 releases that the main visual indicator of Apple Intelligence -- the full-screen, color-at-the-edges Siri animation -- was noticeably missing. Apple even lit up the edges of the massive glass cube of its Apple Fifth Avenue Store in New York City like a Siri search.\n\nInstead, iOS 18 used the same-old Siri sphere.\n\nNow, the modern Siri look has arrived as of iOS 18.1, but only on devices that support Apple Intelligence.\n\nSiri under Apple Intelligence looks like a multicolor halo around the edges. James Martin/CNET\n\nWith the new look are a few Siri interaction improvements: It's more forgiving if you stumble through a query, like saying the wrong word or interrupting yourself mid-thought. It's also better about listening after delivering results, so you can ask related followup questions.\n\nHowever, the ability to personalize answers based on what Apple Intelligence knows about you is still down the road. What did appear, as of iOS 18.2, was integration of ChatGPT, which you can now use as an alternate source of information. For some queries, if Siri doesn't have the answer right away, you're asked if you'd like to use ChatGPT instead. You don't need a ChatGPT account to take advantage of this (but if you do, you can sign in).\n\nInvoke Siri silently without triggering everyone else's devices\n\nSpeaking of Siri, perhaps my favorite new feature is the ability to bring up the assistant without saying the words \"Hey Siri\" out loud. In my house, where I have HomePods and my family members use their own iPhones and iPads, I never know which device is going to answer my call (even though they're supposed to be smart enough to work it out).\n\nPlus, honestly, even after all this time I'm not always comfortable talking to my phone -- especially in public. It's annoying enough when people carry on phone conversations on speaker, I don't want to add to the hubbub by making Siri requests.\n\nInstead, I turn to a new feature called Tap to Siri. Double-tap the bottom edge of the screen on the iPhone or iPad to bring up the Siri search bar and the onscreen keyboard.\n\nDouble-tap the bar at the bottom of the screen to bring up a voice-free Siri search. Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nOn a Mac, go to System Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri and choose a key combination under Keyboard shortcut, such as Press Either Command Key Twice.\n\nYes, this involves more typing work than just speaking conversationally, but I can enter more specific queries and not wonder if my robot friend is understanding what I'm saying.\n\nRemove distractions from your pictures using Clean Up in the Photos app\n\nUntil iOS 18.1, the Photos app on the iPhone and iPad has lacked a simple retouch feature. Dust on the camera lens? Litter on the ground? Sorry, you need to deal with those and other distractions in the Photos app on MacOS or using a third-party app.\n\nNow Apple Intelligence includes Clean Up, an AI-enhanced removal tool, in the Photos app. When you edit an image and tap the Clean Up button, the iPhone analyzes the photo and suggests potential items to remove by highlighting them. Tap one or draw a circle around an area -- the app erases those areas and uses generative AI to fill in plausible pixels.\n\nRemove distractions in the Photos app using Clean Up. Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nIn this first incarnation, Clean Up isn't perfect, and you'll often get better results in other dedicated image editors. But for quickly removing annoyances from photos, it's fine.\n\nStay on task with the AI-boosted Reduce Interruptions Focus mode\n\nFocus modes on the iPhone can be enormously helpful, such as turning on Do Not Disturb to insulate yourself from outside distractions. You can also create personalized Focus modes. For example, my Podcast Recording mode blocks outside notifications except from a handful of people during scheduled recording times.\n\nWith Apple Intelligence enabled, a new Reduce Interruptions Focus mode is available. When active, it becomes a smarter filter for what gets past the wall holding back superfluous notifications. Even things that are not specified in your criteria for allowed notifications, such as specific people, might pop up. On my iPhone, for instance, that can include weather alerts or texts from my bank when a large purchase or funds transfer has occurred.\n\nTo enable it, open Control Center, tap the Focus button and choose Reduce Interruptions.\n\nThe Reduce Interruptions Focus mode (left) intelligently filters possible distractions. Turn it on in Control Center (middle). When something comes in that might need your attention, it shows up as a notification marked Maybe Important (right). Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nOne more (beta) AI thing...\n\nThe iOS 18.4 developer and public betas add a new smart notification feature that is subtle and, so far, helpful. When a notification arrives that seems like it could be more important than others, Prioritize Notifications pops it to the top of the notification list on the lock screen (with a colorful Apple Intelligence shimmer, of course). In my experience so far, those include weather alerts, texts from people I regularly communicate with and email messages that contain calls to action or impending deadlines.\n\nTo enable it, go to Settings > Notifications > Prioritize Notifications and then turn the option on. There are no other settings -- you're relying on the AI algorithms to decide what gets elevated to a priority -- but it seems to be off to a good start.\n\nIn the iOS 18.4 beta, Apple Intelligence can prioritize notifications to grab your attention.

Learn more\n\nApple quietly launched a new budget-friendly iPhone on February 19 called the iPhone 16e. It's a significantly updated option for cost-conscious iPhone users over the iPhone SE released in 2022.\n\nApple released the iPhone 16e on February 28, replacing the 2022 iPhone SE and iPhone 14 as entry-level options. The company no longer sells the earlier models in new condition.\n\nStarting at $599, the iPhone 16e is a more economical version of the $799 iPhone 16 (our best iPhone for most people). It includes Apple Intelligence, Face ID, and an Action button for customizable shortcuts, among other notable features.\n\nIf you intend to purchase the phone, check our guides to the best iPhone 16e cases and screen protectors for accessory options from Apple, Zagg, Spigen, and other top brands.\n\niPhone 16e: Specs\n\nSpecifications iPhone 16e Screen 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display Processor Apple A18 Rear camera 2-in-1 48MP main camera with 2x zoom Front camera 12MP Battery Up to 26 hours of video playback (per Apple) Storage 128GB, 256GB, 512GB Starting price $599\n\niPhone 16e: Price\n\nThe iPhone 16e starts at $599 with the 128GB storage option. The price rises to $699 for the 256GB version and $899 for the 512GB option.\n\nApple released the iPhone 16e on February 28. It's available to order from Apple, Best Buy, and nationwide carriers like Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T.\n\niPhone 16e: Features\n\nSimilar to Apple's iPhone 16, the iPhone 16e has an aluminum frame with flat edges and a flat rear glass panel that Apple says is the \"toughest back glass in a smartphone.\" It's available in black and white matte finishes.\n\nThe iPhone 16e looks like the standard iPhone 16 but has a notch instead of a Dynamic Island. Apple\n\nThe iPhone 16e has the same 6.1-inch display size as the iPhone 16 and a similar Super Retina XDR OLED panel that can achieve up to 1,200 nits brightness. It uses Apple's Ceramic Shield glass for the display, which the company says is \"tougher than any smartphone glass.\" It features IP68 water and dust resistance.\n\nThe iPhone 16e runs on a slightly modified version of Apple's A18 processor with a four-core GPU rather than the five-core GPU on the standard A18 processor. We're testing the phone now and expect it to be about as powerful as the standard iPhone 16 models. It can run Apple Intelligence features like voice access to the ChatGPT AI chatbot through Siri, the Writing Tools feature that helps you write and summarize emails, creating custom emojis with Genmoji, and object removal in the Photos app.\n\nDespite featuring one less GPU core, the iPhone 16e also supports demanding AAA game titles that were exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro models and iPhone 16 series at large.\n\nThe iPhone 16e's single camera is 48MP and can take optical-quality 2x photos. Apple\n\nLike the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16e includes a 48MP Fusion main camera that can take 2x photos at optical quality. It's a single-lens camera system, but Apple labels it a \"two-in-one\" camera, given its integrated optical 2x option.\n\nThe iPhone 16e uses Face ID for unlocking the phone and authenticating in apps. Apple\n\nFace ID is used for unlocking the phone and in-app authentication, but the iPhone 16e has a notch instead of the iPhone 16's Dynamic Island.\n\nApple touts the iPhone 16e's battery life as the \"best battery life ever on a 6.1-inch iPhone. \" It claims the phone lasts up to six hours longer than the iPhone 11 and 12 hours longer than the 2022 iPhone SE. The device features a USB-C port for charging and data transfers, and while it supports wireless charging with the Qi standard, it does not support MagSafe.\n\nThe Action Button was first introduced in the iPhone 15 Pro in 2023. It now features on the iPhone 16e. Apple\n\nThe iPhone 16e includes Apple's Action Button (introduced with the iPhone 15 Pro models in 2023), which provides handy shortcuts to certain features and functions. However, it does not include the latest Camera Control button common to the flagship iPhone 16 series.\n\nApple's first-ever cellular \"C1\" modem features in the iPhone 16e, which the company boasts is the most power-efficient on an iPhone. It supports 5G networks but not super-fast mmWave 5G networks. However, the phone supports Apple's satellite-based safety features, including Messages via satellite, Emergency SOS via satellite, and Roadside Assistance via satellite. It also supports Crash Detection.",

Is it missing any of the flashy features of the iPhone 16?\n\nAll valid questions that I, too, was asking\u2014but that was before I got my hands on an early sample of the new iPhone 16E. And after playing around with it for a couple of days, I'm ready to give you the TL,DR on this shiny new launch. Ready? Let's jump in.\n\nPros:\n\nHas most of the key features of the iPhone 16\n\nApple Intelligence\n\nGreat camera\n\nSmart object removal from photos\n\nHas the new action button\n\nSignificantly cheaper than the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nDecent battery life\n\nCons:\n\nNo MagSafe\n\nNo ultra-wide camera\n\nLooking for a deeper dive? Got you\u2014keep scrolling!\n\nThe good\n\nLet's face it\u2014iPhones aren't cheap, so it's definitely nice that Apple is offering a more affordable option (it's $400 cheaper than the and a whopping $600 cheaper than the ).\n\nBecause the 16E is part of the iPhone 16 family, it does things that an iPhone 14 or 15 can't do. You'll get access to Apple Intelligence, ChatGPT integration, a customizable action button on the side of your phone (to quickly pull up your preferred shortcut, whether it be Google Translate, Shazam, the camera app, your flashlight, the magnifier, the voice memo app, or more), the ability to edit objects out of your photos, and of course, that crisp, lightning-fast feel.\n\nThis phone might be Apple's more economical option, but it will still feel like a massive upgrade if you're coming from an older iPhone. It's USB-C-compatible, the battery lasts significantly longer, the camera takes great pictures and videos, you can zoom up to 10x, and it runs on the latest-generation A18 chip (which basically means it runs faster and better).\n\nHannah Oh\n\nThe not-so-good\n\nWith the 16E, you lose out on the iPhone 16's camera control button, brighter display, extra ultra-wide camera, and three additional color options (Pink, Teal, and Ultramarine). It also lacks MagSafe compatibility, so your magnetic phone stand or stick-on wallet won't work with this phone. Luckily these aren't essential features, but if any of them really catch your eye, it might be worth paying a little more for the .\n\nSo, is the iPhone 16E worth it?\n\nAside from a few pretty minor cons, iPhone 16E is an excellent paired-down option\u2014it's more budget-friendly while still boasting tons of key features. If you're suuuper technical and love having the most optimized tech that Apple has to offer, you can always level up to the 16 Pro or 16 Pro Max. But for casual users that are looking for key features at a discount, the iPhone 16E absolutely does the trick. Sounds like it's time for a new phone...",

            "content": "If you tried to break up with Apple Intelligence, it's not getting the message. Apple's latest iOS 18.3.2 update patches a security issue -- that's good -- but enables Apple Intelligence automatically, even if you previously turned it off. The same applies to iPad OS 18.3.2 and MacOS Sequoia 15.3.2.\n\nI won't hold it against you if you want to pass on Apple's AI tech for now. It is, after all, still technically in beta -- which is no doubt why it's annoying that Apple Intelligence is getting turned back on. Message summaries can be dodgy, generated images are unpredictable and the promised leap in Siri's capabilities has been officially pushed back.\n\nTurning off Apple Intelligence is easy, though, whether you're turning off the whole thing or selectively switching off individual features.\n\nSee also: Did a well-meaning friend send you a message about Apple Intelligence possibly reading your private information? I explain what's actually going on.\n\nWhy turn off Apple Intelligence in the first place?\n\nSince the first Apple Intelligence features rolled out in iOS 18.1, some people have chosen to opt out of the new technology. Tools such as Image Playground, Genmoji and message summaries can use up to 7GB of your device's internal storage -- a sizable chunk, especially if you tend to run against the upper limit of its free space.\n\nEven if storage is not an issue, you just may not be interested in Apple's set of AI features. According to a new survey by SellCell, 73% of Apple users think AI adds little to no value to the experience. In a separate survey, CNET found that 25% of smartphone owners aren't interested at all.\n\nOr, honestly, you may not want to deal with features that are creating inaccurate summaries or that can be replicated without Apple Intelligence.\n\nThe trainer killed someone? Screenshot by Nelson Aguilar/CNET\n\nThe good news is that it's easy to turn off Apple Intelligence entirely. Or if you'd prefer to pick and choose, you can selectively disable some of the features. Doing so also lets you reclaim the storage it's using.\n\nIs Apple Intelligence really ready to be on by default?\n\nI'm not an AI crank -- I appreciate features such as notification summaries and the Clean Up tool in the Photos app. And yet, Apple Intelligence is also a work in progress, an evolving set of features that Apple is heavily hyping while gradually developing. I wouldn't hold it against you if you wanted to not be distracted or feel like you're doing Apple's testing for them (that's what the developer and public betas are for).\n\nRemember that Apple Intelligence works only on the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16, iPhone 16E, iPhone 16 Pro or M-series Macs and iPads (plus the newest iPad mini).\n\nHere's what you need to know about disabling it.\n\nWatch this: Does Apple Think We're Stupid? Apple Intelligence Ads Say Yes 06:15\n\nHow to see the amount of storage Apple Intelligence is using\n\nIf you're concerned about the storage requirements of Apple Intelligence, you can find out how much the system is using by going to Settings > General > iPhone (or iPad) Storage > iOS (or iPadOS).\n\nSee how much space Apple Intelligence is using in Settings. Screenshots by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nNote that even after turning off Apple Intelligence, that storage still shows up in the iOS Storage list. However, I was able to confirm that if the phone's storage fills up and the system needs that now-inactive space, iOS reclaims what it needs.\n\nOnce I filled my iPhone's storage, the inactive Apple Intelligence data was purged to accommodate the added files, dropping from 5.89GB to 2.87GB. Screenshots by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nHow to turn off Apple Intelligence entirely (iPhone, iPad and Mac)\n\nOpen Settings (iPhone or iPad) or System Settings (Mac) and choose Apple Intelligence & Siri. Then turn off the Apple Intelligence option. Confirm your choice in the dialog that appears by tapping Turn Off Apple Intelligence.\n\nTurn off Apple Intelligence entirely with one switch. Screenshots by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nHere's what you lose:\n\n(Curiously, the Clean Up tool in Photos sticks around even when Apple Intelligence is turned off, perhaps because the first time you use it the app downloads resources for it and holds onto them.)\n\nHow to turn off individual Apple Intelligence features\n\nMaybe you're finding some Apple Intelligence features helpful while others are annoying (or just highly amusing). You can turn off specific features in the settings for apps to which they apply.\n\nFor example, to disable text summaries in Messages notifications, go to Settings > Apps > Messages and switch off the Summarize Messages option.\n\nTurn off Messages summaries while still using other Apple Intelligence features. Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nSome features are not as app-specific. Writing Tools, which use Apple Intelligence to proof or rewrite text, appear as an option when you select text, regardless of the app. To turn that off, you need to disable Apple Intelligence system-wide.\n\nAlso note that nearly every app includes an Apple Intelligence & Siri option in Settings, with a Learn from this App option (turned on by default). That applies just to whether Apple Intelligence and Siri can monitor how you use it to make suggestions; it doesn't affect any particular Apple Intelligence features.\n\nHow to turn off Apple Intelligence features in Screen Time settings\n\nAnother option for restricting what Apple Intelligence can do is buried in the Screen Time settings. Screen Time is designed to control which apps and features can run on another device, such as the iPhone used by a child in your household. But it's also helpful for tracking how much time you're spending on the device and, in this case, turning off some components of Apple Intelligence.\n\nOpen the Settings app and go to Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions. Turn on the Content & Privacy Restrictions option if it's not already enabled. If this is the first time you're flipping this switch, don't worry -- everything is allowed by default. Tap Intelligence & Siri. Tap on the following three features and decide whether to allow or don't allow their use: Image Creation (such as Image Playground and Genmoji), Writing Tools and the ChatGPT Extension (which uses ChatGPT to process requests that are beyond the built-in Apple Intelligence capabilities).\n\nTurn off selected Apple Intelligence features in the Screen Time settings. Screenshots by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nFor more on iOS 18.3, see how the Mail app sorts messages into categories and if you haven't upgraded already, make a good backup first.",

Photo-Illustration: The Strategist; Photos: Retailers\n\nApple rarely discounts its own products, but third-party retailers occasionally offer deals on the company\u2019s flagship products, like AirPods and iPads, and you\u2019ll typically find the best discounts on older models once a new one comes out. Still, Apple products have solid longevity, and the savings are often worth the trade in features.\n\nI\u2019ve combed through all the listings for Apple\u2019s products at major retailers to find the best deals, omitting anything that\u2019s getting too old or isn\u2019t discounted enough (this varies depending on the product category). The company has a bunch of new gadgets, like the iPhone 16E, the Apple Watch Series 10, and new AirPods with noise cancellation, so, unsurprisingly, we\u2019re seeing good deals right now on the AirPods Pro and Apple Watch SE, but I also found a great discount on the M1 MacBook Air.\n\nAirPods and Beats deals\n\nBeats Flex $49 $70 now 30% off $49 If you worry about your earbuds falling out while you\u2019re on a run, these have a band that goes behind your neck to ensure you don\u2019t lose them.

Sure, it\u2019s missing the bells and whistles of my iPhone 16 Pro Max, but for my parents, the iPhone 16e is the ideal upgrade, as they trade in their three-year-old iPhone SE 3 phones for $100 off.\n\nI outlined the real iPhone 16e price based on inflation and size. The biggest perk is that the new iPhone starts at double the storage. So, while the iPhone SE 3 started at $429 for 64GB, the true equivalent, the 128GB iPhone SE 3, was $479. After three years of harsh inflation, the price would have been $530.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me making excuses because I\u2019m in charge of the Apple Card bill, but suddenly, $70 more for the much better iPhone 16e doesn\u2019t seem so bad, especially when my parents will get new perks.\n\nLarger, brighter 6.1-inch screen\n\nHigher resolution 48MP 2-in1- camera\n\nBetter 12MP TrueDepth front camera with Face ID\n\nPhotonic Engine, Night mode and Audio Zoom\n\nA18 chipset with a 4-core GPU\n\nApple Intelligence\n\nCustomizable Action Button\n\nCrash Detection\n\nStrong Ceramic Shield glass\n\nIP68 dust and waterproof rating\n\nUSB-C instead of Lightning\n\nMost importantly, way more battery life\n\nIt launches on Friday to tempt iPhone upgrade holdouts to finally upgrade their smartphone (Image credit: Max Buondonno / The Shortcut)\n\nIt\u2019s also missing some stuff, as I outline below, but the iPhone 16e isn\u2019t meant for early adopters who may be waiting for the rumored iPhone 17 Pro Max or the nifty sound but equally unconfirmed iPhone 17 Air. It\u2019s the core iPhone 16 features on a budget.\n\nThe only things that they would like on the eventual iPhone 17e are \u201cadditional colors and MagSafe. If you could tell Tim Cook that, please.\u201d You got it, Mom.\n\nEveryone has someone in their life who doesn\u2019t want to overpay. This iPhone is meant for upgrade holdouts like my parents who need a long-lasting iPhone with excellent battery life but don\u2019t need to spend more than $500 after Apple\u2019s $100 trade-in SE 3 credit. The only things that they would like on the eventual iPhone 17e are \u201cadditional colors and MagSafe. If you could tell Tim Cook that, please.\u201d You got it, Mom.\n\nSee iPhone 16e deals from US carriers\n\nThe Shortcut\u2019s long & short review\n\nFace ID replaces the Touch ID, and it works really well and alows for extra screen space (Image credit: Max Buondonno)\n\n\ud83d\udc40 Face ID is a winner. It\u2019s a radical change for my parents\u2019 iPhone usage, but I had them use my iPhone 16 as a test, and they actually loved Face ID and didn\u2019t miss the physical home button as much as I thought they could. In fact, it\u2019s proven more reliable than using their fingerprints at their age.\n\niPhone 16e has a larger and brighter display than the iPhone SE 3 (Image credit: Matt Swider / The Shortcut)\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 Bigger, brighter screen. The reason they love Face ID is that without the home button, it allows for a bigger screen. Apple\u2019s 6.1-inch OLED display is an upgrade in size (up from a 4.7-inch LCD) and brightness (up to 1,200 nits HDR). My mom\u2019s favorite part: \u201cThe wider screen makes it so much easier to type.\u201d\n\nMy mom\u2019s favorite part: \u201cThe wider screen makes it so much easier to type.\u201d\n\nThe iPhone 16e (left) vs the iPhone 16 Pro Max.

Apple\u2019s 6.1-inch screen offers a balance of a big screen that\u2019s still manageable to hold in one hand. Taking the new iPhone to a busy Rockefeller Center in NYC, I felt more confident holding it caseless. Of course, I do recommend an iPhone 16e case for protection and a pop of color.\n\nThe iPhone 16e comes in just two colors: black (as seen above) and white (Image credit: Max Buondonno / The Shortcut)\n\n\u26ab\u26aa \u2018I wish there were more colors.\u2019 My parents are trading in a red (Mom) and a white (Dad) iPhone SE 3. The fact that there are only two colors is \u201ca bit of a letdown,\u201d according to my Mom.\n\niPhone 16e uses the main 48MP camera (left) to zoom in via a 2x crop zoom (right) to retain optical image quality (Image credit: Max Buondonno / The Shortcut)\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 48MP 2-in-1 camera. It seems like the same 48MP camera as the iPhone 16, but it\u2019s not. The sensor is, in fact, smaller, and it uses Hybrid Focus Pixels instead of 100% Focus Pixels. The early verdict? Not as much of a downgrade. It turns out that perks like the use of Apple\u2019s Photonic Engine and night mode (new over the iPhone SE 3) matter. The zero shutter lag doesn\u2019t hold up as well at night, but it\u2019s a solid camera.\n\niPhone 16e gets a better-than-expected 12MP camera, up from 7MP on the iPhone SE 3 (Image credit: Max Buondonno / The Shortcut)\n\n\ud83e\udd33 12MP TrueDepth camera. My parents do take selfies with their grandkids, and, good news, there\u2019s a nice upgrade over the 7MP iPhone SE 3 front-facing camera. Better HDR, night mode, and 4K video outpace the old FaceTime HD camera. Will my parents take slow-mo 1080p video at 120fps? I doubt it. But it\u2019s here.\n\niPhone 16e has a single rear camera, but it does zoom in via a 2x cropped zoom at optical quality (Image credit: Matt Swider / The Shortcut)\n\n\ud83d\udd2d Does it have a telephoto camera? Apple\u2019s 2-in-1 iPhone 16e camera crops into 48MP photos to offer a zoomed-in look. It\u2019s still optical quality and much better than digitally zoomed-in photos, even if it\u2019s coming from a single camera lens.\n\n\ud83d\udc50 No Ultra-wide camera. My parents refuse to tap the ultrawide camera button on my iPhone when snapping family photos. They\u2019d rather back up into a ditch than use the UI. So I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll miss this one.\n\nSee iPhone 16e deals from US carriers\n\nOne thing missing is an Ultra wideband chip for precision tracking of AirTags, AirPods and other iPhones. The second-gen UWB chip is in the rest of the iPhone 16 lineup (Image credit: Max Buondonno / The Shortcut)\n\n\ud83d\udef0\ufe0f No Ultra wideband chip. We use Apple\u2019s Find My a lot as a family for finding our AirTags, AirPods 4 and each other\u2019s iPhones, but the iPhone 16e lacks the precise location tracking found in the Ultra wideband chip. There\u2019s no way to use the superb Find Nearby feature to pinpoint a lost item. This is a reason to consider the rest of the iPhone 16 lineup, which all offer the second-gen chip and WiFi 7 instead of WiFi 6.\n\n\ud83d\ude97 Crash detection. I didn\u2019t see many people highlight this yet, but the iPhone SE 3 didn\u2019t have this peace of mind feature, so it\u2019s new to the iPhone 16e. First seen in the iPhone 14, it\u2019s a safety feature that\u2019s now in all new iPhones.\n\nThe notch returns in the iPhone 16e (left) whereas the rest of the lineup, like the iPhone 16 Pro Max (right) has the interactive Dynamic Island (Image credit: Max Buondonno / The Shortcut)\n\n\ud83c\udfdd\ufe0f Notch vs Dynamic Island. Face ID is here by way of the notch, meaning it doesn\u2019t have Apple\u2019s Dynamic Island, which is increasingly useful for persistent notifications. I appreciate seeing live game scores, timers, and Uber pick-up/drop-off time estimates in this space, but most of these items still live on the lock screen. Not a deal breaker.\n\n\ud83e\udd7d No Spatial Photos or Video. I\u2019d love to see my parents use the iPhone 16e to capture spatial video for use in my Apple Vision Pro headset when I visit, but that\u2019s not possible with the single-lens camera on the iPhone 16e.\n\niPhone 16e comes with a Ceramic Shield for an extra durable glass front (Image credit: Max Buondonno / The Shortcut)\n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Ceramic Shield upgrade. Apple and Corning\u2019s durable and scratch-resistant glass is marketed as \u201ctougher than any smartphone glass.\u201d According to our four years of tests, first conducted when the iPhone 12 launched, this is true. It\u2019s a huge bonus since the iPhone SE 3 just used normal glass on the front.\n\niPhone 16e comes with the Action Button that can be customized beyond being just a mute switch (Image credit: Max Buondonno / The Shortcut)\n\n\ud83d\udd18 Custom Action Button. There\u2019s no Camera Control, but the Action Button, which was first introduced in the iPhone 15 Pro, can be used to be tailored to your needs: it can still act as an on/off toggle that silences the iPhone 16e, launch the camera or be programmed to do any other shortcut.\n\niPhone 16e with Apple Intelligence enabled can summarize Safari web pages where those Substack authors blab on and on and on. (Image credit: Matt Swider / The Shortcut)\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Apple Intelligence. The key benefits for my parents\u2019 iPhone 16e phones are notification and Mail summaries. This makes things easier to read at a glance (even if comically wrong occasionally). Apple\u2019s AI Writing Tools might have been helpful before my dad retired, though I\u2019d also be out of a $5 per email rewrite allowance as a kid. They\u2019ll still find summaries helpful in Safari (pictured above).\n\nThe iPhone 16e (right) uses the Apple C1 modem and got 5G download speeds that were plenty fast (Image credit: Matt Swider / The Shortcut)\n\n\ud83d\udcf6 Apple C1 modem is a \ud83d\ude80. The iPhone 16e marks the first time we got to test out an Apple-designed cellular modem. No one but Qualcomm has been able to supply a good iPhone modem. We were made to believe Apple\u2019s modem might suck but it turns out it just sucks down data at fast 5G speeds. It\u2019s also smaller (more room for battery) and more energy efficient.\n\nWe were made to believe Apple\u2019s modem might suck but it turns out it just sucks down data at fast 5G speeds.\n\n\ud83d\udce1 No mmWave? Not a biggie. My parents, Verizon users, won\u2019t get the bonus of mmWave 5G (the radio isn\u2019t in the iPhone 16e) for faster, short-range speed boosts, but they don\u2019t hang out in airports or at stadiums as much as someone like myself. Not an issue for them.\n\nApple\u2019s latest chip, the A18, has one fewer GPU core in the iPhone 16e vs the iPhone 16, but it\u2019s still snappy when gaming (Image credit: Matt Swider / The Shortcut)\n\n\u2699\ufe0f Latest A18 chipset. It\u2019s similar to the power of the iPhone 16, with one fewer GPU core than the iPhone 16 and two fewer GPU cores than the iPhone 16 Pro. My parents aren\u2019t gaming on their phones outside of Candy Crush (Mom) or Wordle (Dad), so I think they\u2019re safe. And the A18 means this phone will last 3+ years without a hitch.\n\niPhone 16e uses USB-C instead of Lightning (Image credit: Matt Swider / The Shortcut)\n\n\ud83d\udd0c USB-C is universal. My parents own a MacBook Pro and iPad Pro, both of which have USB-C connections to charge.

When I visit, I\u2019ll finally be able to charge my devices without sifting through a tangled web of Lightning cables.\n\nThe iPhone 16e, which lacks MagSafe, just slides off of our favorite charger, the mophie snap+juice pack with stand (Image credit: Matt Swider / The Shortcut)\n\n\u26a1 Charges wireless, but no MagSafe. iPhone 16e doesn\u2019t have MagSafe, and that\u2019s the one techie upgrade even my non-techie parents wanted. It can still charge wirelessly, but lining up the phone with a charging pad is more of a pain and the 7.5W charging rate is far from the 25W wireless charging rate I can get from an iPhone 16.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit more water resistant than the iPhone SE 3 (Image credit: Max Buondonno / The Shortcut)\n\n\ud83d\udca6 IP68 water-resistant.

That\u2019s the difference between IP68 and IP67, and I\u2019m all about the extra protection.\n\niPhone 16e has the longest battery of any 6.1-inch iPhone.

The iPhone 16e is the longest-lasting iPhone in the 6.1-inch size, and while I want to do more testing to confirm this over the next month, Apple\u2019s estimates blow away what we\u2019ve seen from the iPhone SE 3.\n\n26 hours of video playback battery (up from 15 hours)\n\n21 hours of streaming video playback (up from 10 hours)\n\n90 hours of audio playback (up from 50 hours)\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing my parents are going to appreciate, it\u2019s an even longer-lasting iPhone battery. I\u2019ll love it too.

But it doesn\u2019t have all the AI bells and whistles of the pricier Samsung Galaxy S25 series.\n\nMy OnePlus 13R review: this $599 phone is actually $499 with an any-device, any-condition $100 recycling reward. It tops all of its rivals when it comes to specs: a 6.78-inch screen, 256GB of storage, 12GB of RAM, three cameras, a 6,000mAh battery, and Qualcomm\u2019s last-gen-but-still-mighty Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip (just shy of the top-tier Snapdragon 8 Elite, like on the OnePlus 13).\n\n\ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f None of these iPhone 16e rivals get you out of \u201cgreen bubble jail\u201d with your family and friends, however.

            "content": "It finally happened: Apple stopped treating its affordable iPhone as a second class citizen. We expected a new iPhone SE, but we got the iPhone 16e, which sits at the same table as the other iPhone 16 models. It\u2019s not just the name, it\u2019s also the size, the chip that powers it, and a couple of other details that make the iPhone 16e a very interesting entrant into the iPhone 16 lineup.\n\nHowever, the iPhone 16e is also significantly more expensive than the (now discontinued) iPhone SE. Is it worth it, or should you just dish the extra cash for the \u201creal\u201d iPhone 16? Read on.\n\nApple iPhone 16e price\n\nThe iPhone 16e starts at $599 with 128GB of storage space. Increase that to 256GB and the price goes up to $699, and if you opt for the 512GB variant, the price jumps to $899.\n\nCompared to the old iPhone SE, which cost $429 when it came out in 2022, it\u2019s a big price increase. Given that the iPhone SE has been discontinued (alongside the iPhone 15), the cheapest new iPhone is now the 16e, and it\u2019s in a very different price range.\n\nOn the other hand, the iPhone 16e starts at 128GB of storage, which is double what you got with the last generation of the iPhone SE. And unlike the old SE, the iPhone 16e doesn\u2019t immediately scream \u201cold.\u201d Instead, it looks like and performs like a modern iPhone.\n\nThe display is a 6.1-inch OLED, very similar to the one on iPhone 16. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\n\nI reckon the pricing will incite mixed responses from potential buyers. Folks who will never pay more than five hundred bucks for a phone are now priced out. Others may be excited that they can get a \u201creal\u201d member of the iPhone 16 family for only $599.\n\nApple iPhone 16e design\n\nWhen I reviewed the iPhone SE, back in 2022, it was a very different experience. That phone looked dated compared to the top iPhones of the day, with a significantly smaller display and massive bezels on top and bottom.\n\nBut the iPhone 16e looks pretty great. On the front, it\u2019s basically an iPhone 14, with a large, 6.1-inch OLED display. There\u2019s no Dynamic Island on top; instead, you get the notch which hides the front camera, the Face ID camera, the speaker, and various sensors.\n\nOn the back, there\u2019s only a single camera coupled with a flash light. It\u2019s a big unit, though, and in an odd way it looks better (cleaner, at least) than the multi-camera arrays on more expensive iPhones. Only two colors are on offer, black and white. My review unit was white, and I loved both the matte white glass on the back, and the way the white frame contrasts with the dark display bezels on the front.\n\nThe frame is made of aluminum, and just like on the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16e also gets the Action Button. It\u2019s nice of Apple to include it; I typically set it to perform one thing and never change it again, but it\u2019s better than the old switch.\n\nOverall, Apple struck the right balance with the iPhone 16e\u2019s design. It\u2019s a no-nonsense iPhone that doesn\u2019t look ancient, and it also doesn't look or feel cheap in any way.\n\nYou only get one camera. But it's a two-in-one. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\n\nApple also sent me a blue and a pink silicone case for the iPhone 16e. The light silicone cases are a good fit for the iPhone 16e, which, at 167 grams, is the lightest phone in the lineup. Compare it directly with any of the Pro models, and you\u2019ll feel a pretty big difference in weight.\n\nThere\u2019s one more thing to consider here, and that is size. At 6.1 inches, the iPhone 16e is essentially the same size as the iPhone 16 (it\u2019s a hair shorter, but you won\u2019t notice that). The iPhone SE was a far smaller phone, and with it out of the way, it means that Apple is no longer selling truly small phones.\n\nApple iPhone 16e performance and battery life\n\nMore than any other \u201caffordable\u201d Apple phone, the iPhone 16e strikes me as the businessman\u2019s phone. It looks good but not flashy. It performs, however, just as well as the iPhone 16, and it even beats it in a couple of very important ways.\n\nThe iPhone 16e has Apple\u2019s A18 chip inside; it\u2019s the same chip you\u2019ll find inside the iPhone 16, but it only has four GPU cores instead of five. You won\u2019t notice the difference.\n\nApple doesn\u2019t say how much RAM its phones have, but benchmarks indicate that the iPhone 16e comes with 8GB of RAM, just like the iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Pro models.\n\nCombine that with 128GB of starting storage, and it means that the iPhone 16e performs pretty much the same as the iPhone 16. This was my experience, too: Everything felt fast, no matter how many apps I had open and which apps I used. Yes, even my favorite gaming benchmark, PUBG, was snappy on its highest settings. GeekBench scores confirmed this: with a 3201 single-core, 7423 multi-core score, the iPhone 16e is just a hair slower than the iPhone 16.\n\nYou don\u2019t get all the niceties of the Pro models, of course. The iPhone 16e doesn\u2019t have the ProMotion, 120Hz display, or the Dynamic Island, but none of these omissions are dealbrekers for me.\n\nTwo colors are on offer, both matte: White and black. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\n\nHere\u2019s a big selling point for the iPhone 16e: It has excellent battery life. Apple says it can handle up to 26 hours of video playback, compared to 22 hours on the iPhone 16. I couldn\u2019t compare the two devices directly, but during the week that I used it as my main phone, the iPhone 16e typically lasted two days after being fully charged, and that's with very heavy use.\n\nThis is partly thanks to Apple\u2019s C1 cellular chip, which made its debut in the iPhone 16e. The chip worked as intended for me; I never had problems with connectivity, calls or messages. If it can do that whilst adding a couple hours of battery life to the phone, it\u2019s a huge win.\n\nApple wouldn\u2019t be Apple, however, if it didn\u2019t throw a curveball at prospective buyers by removing MagSafe from the iPhone 16e. If you\u2019ve never used it, you won\u2019t care. To me, it\u2019s a big deal; I use a bunch of MagSafe accessories, including Apple Wallet and wireless charging. The iPhone 16e does support wireless charging, though, so you should be able to get a decent experience with MagSafe accessories by using a MagSafe case. I couldn\u2019t get a sample case fast enough for this text, but once I get it, I\u2019ll definitely try it out and let you know how it works.\n\nApple iPhone 16e: Apple Intelligence\n\nBeing in Europe, I don't get to experience Apple Intelligence on an iPhone yet (it's coming in April). I've played with Apple Intelligence on the Mac, and while nothing seemed essential, the tools are fun and helpful and they'll probably become better over time.\n\nAI is extremely important for Apple (and, frankly, any other phone maker these days), so it actually makes sense that Apple made its \"cheap\" iPhone a bit more powerful than expected in order to give it full Apple Intelligence support.\n\nLightning port is out, USB-C is in. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\n\nI don't believe people are buying (or even should be buying) phones based on what type of AI features they support, at least not right now. I do suspect that, over time, these features will become as indispensable as having access to search or basic photo editing. In that sense, even if you're in Europe and don't have a good idea what AI on an iPhone is like, it's good to know that the iPhone 16e is fully future-proof when it comes to Apple Intelligence.\n\nApple iPhone 16e camera\n\nYou only get one, 48-megapixel camera on the back of the iPhone 16e. On paper, it's very similar to the one you get on the iPhone 16, though Apple calls this one a 2-in-1 camera system. That's because it can produce 24-megapixel or 48-megapixel wide photos, or 12-megapixel 2x zoom photos.\n\nSharp (perhaps overly so), detailed, with accurate colors: A typical iPhone photo. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\n\nIt's not quite the same as having two cameras, and low light performance can be sketchy. But what you need to know is that the iPhone 16e's camera is not an afterthought like it was on the iPhone SE. Most of the time, you'll get sharp, vibrant photos, and the default, 24-megapixel resolution will give you plenty of detail.\n\nBy default, the iPhone 16e takes 24-megapixel photos. But if the conditions are good, you can turn it up to 48 megapixels for those extra details. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\n\nIs it even worth zooming in if there's no dedicated telephoto camera? Yes, it actually is. Zooming into the same scene I typically got a better, smoother photo, even in moderately low light. If there's a detail you want to focus on, you should use that 2x button.\n\nLeft: On 1x magnification, you get a 24-megapixel photo. The iPhone 16e handles multiple light sources admirably; colors are accurate, and the photo is very sharp, though some of the details get smudgy when you zoom in. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable Right: With 2x magnification, you only get a 12-megapixel image, which is a bit more noisy, but it's smoother, with better background details. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\n\nIn low light, the results were alright, though you can't expect Pro-level performance here. I took an evening stroll on the island Rab in Croatia, and managed to take some fairly sharp and detailed photos of the historic Romanic buildings.\n\nThe iPhone 16e handles low light scenes well, but don't expect miracles. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\n\nBut pointing the camera onto the fishing boats in the night's distance yielded very blurry results.\n\nSelfies are pretty great, and you can tune them to your liking by using Photographic Styles, which are somewhat unfairly hidden in the camera settings. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\n\nThe selfie camera appears to be unchanged from iPhone 16, so there\u2019s not much to write about. It takes great selfies, and yes, Photographic Styles are supported, so you can go to the camera settings and tune them to your liking.\n\nApple iPhone 16e: Should you buy?\n\nThe Apple logo on the back has never been this subtle. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\n\nThe iPhone 16e marks a big change in direction for Apple. The company does not sell any phones cheaper than $599 right now, making the barrier to entry for its ecosystem a lot higher than before.\n\nThat said, the iPhone 16e is an excellent phone. It looks good, has all the niceties of a modern iPhone, including a big, OLED display and a modern, 48-megapixel camera. It actually beats other phones in the lineup in several ways; it\u2019s the lightest new iPhone you can buy, and it has excellent battery life. It performs just as well as the iPhone 16, and fully supports Apple Intelligence. It doesn\u2019t have MagSafe, which is a shame, but not everyone will care. Most people who want a no-nonsense iPhone for the least amount of money won\u2019t mind the other omissions, either, such as the lack of Dynamic Island. Finally, it\u2019s future-proof; since it has Apple\u2019s super-fast A18 chip, it\u2019ll probably be fast enough in three, four, or even five years.\n\nAll of this makes the iPhone 16e good value for money. But this is not the iPhone SE, and it\u2019s not a cheap Apple phone; those things are gone for now. It\u2019s just a cheaper iPhone 16.\n\nFeatured Video For You Apple iPhone 16e is the new affordable Apple phone",

            "content": "The iPhone 16e isn't for me. If you're an avid tech enthusiast and Apple fan, it's probably not for you either. It's for the person holding on to an iPhone 8 Plus or iPhone X, ready to upgrade because their more than seven-year-old smartphone isn't working too well nowadays. They want a new phone, and it just needs to be an iPhone.\n\nA part of my brain won't stop thinking about whether this nearly once-in-a-decade upgrade for these folks wouldn't be better served if Apple had included its nice-to-have amenities, like MagSafe or the ultra-wideband chip for improved AirTags tracking. Even lacking these features, the price of the iPhone 16e feels $100 too high considering the many excellent competing phones in this bracket. It also makes the iPhone lineup confusing\u2014it's $170 more than Apple's previous iPhone SE that's no longer available.\n\nI have spent much of my time this past week using the iPhone 16e and thinking about its $599 MSRP, which naturally must mean that something is awry. This may not matter much to people in the US, who favor purchasing through carriers that subsidize the cost, though they're still paying for a $600 (locked) phone spread over a few years. But when the used iPhone marketplace is healthy and thriving, it feels as though anyone considering an iPhone 16e will find better value with an iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Pro.\n\nCell Boost\n\nThe best iPhone 16e feature? Battery life. Considering this is a 6.1-inch iPhone, which historically perform the lowest in battery tests, this is a welcome surprise. With average use over the past week, I struggled to bring the phone below 50 percent. (It usually hovered around 51 or 49 percent by bedtime.) Yes, that means the iPhone 16e has better battery life than the iPhone 16.\n\nOn one particular day when I used it for GPS navigation, music streaming, and picture snapping, it was left with around 30 percent before bed. And another busy day, I hit nearly nine hours of screen-on time and had 15 percent in the tank. That's excellent. It's still not the best iPhone battery life in the lineup\u2014that'd be the iPhone 16 Pro Max and iPhone 16 Plus\u2014but it's enough to keep that battery anxiety at bay when you're out and about.\n\nApple claims this battery boost is in part thanks to the first-ever Apple-designed C1 modem inside the phone. Apple spent years building this connectivity chip to reduce its reliance on partners like Qualcomm, and it seems to have paid off. I didn't experience any issues with cellular connectivity over the past week with the AT&T eSIM Apple provided, though this also could depend on region. (I'm in New York City.) I ran speed tests via Ookla on various phones alongside the iPhone 16e and did not find anything out of the ordinary. That said, remember Antennagate? We'll have to wait and see how the C1 modem performs in the hands of far more people across the world.",

            "content": "Today, Apple Original Films announced the groundbreaking new documentary event \u201cBono: Stories of Surrender,\u201d a bold and lyrical visual exploration of Bono\u2019s one-man show by the same name, to premiere globally on Friday, May 30, 2025 on Apple TV+. Based on his celebrated memoir, \u201cSurrender: 40 Songs, One Story,\u201d and the accompanying book/theatre tour, the film hails from RadicalMedia and Plan B Entertainment, with award-winning filmmaker Andrew Dominik (\u201cThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,\u201d \u201cBlonde\u201d) directing.\n\n\u201cBono: Stories of Surrender\u201d is a vivid reimagining of Bono\u2019s critically acclaimed one-man stage show, \u201cStories of Surrender: An Evening of Words, Music and Some Mischief\u2026\u201d As he pulls back the curtain on a remarkable life and the family, friends and faith that have challenged and sustained him, he also reveals personal stories about his journey as a son, father, husband, activist and rock star. Along with never-before-seen, exclusive footage from the Beacon Theatre shows, the film features Bono performing many of the iconic U2 songs that have shaped his life and legacy.\n\nAlso set to premiere on May 30, 2025 on Apple Vision Pro, \u201cBono: Stories of Surrender (Immersive)\u201d will be the first feature-length film available in Apple Immersive Video, a remarkable media format recorded in 8K with Spatial Audio to produce a 180-degree video that places viewers onstage with Bono and in the center of his story. With this special edition of the film available only on Vision Pro, viewers will feel completely immersed in the music and storytelling. Releasing an immersive version of the film for Vision Pro alongside its debut on Apple TV+ is the latest example of Bono\u2019s enduring commitment to innovation. Since U2\u2019s earliest days, Bono and the band have consistently pushed boundaries and embraced new technologies to forge deeper and unexpected connections with their audience.\n\nAcademy Award and Emmy Award-winning RadicalMedia\u2019s Jon Kamen and Dave Sirulnick (\u201cSummer of Soul,\u201d \u201cHamilton,\u201d \u201cDavid Byrne\u2019s American Utopia\u201d) produce alongside Academy Award-winning Plan B Entertainment\u2019s Brad Pitt, Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner (upcoming \u201cF1,\u201d \u201cMoonlight,\u201d \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d).

            "content": "Fifteen days ago, Apple released a tool for iPhone and iPad that allegedly allows you to migrate purchases from one Apple Account to another. The primary requirement is that you must be logged in with both Apple Accounts on the same iPhone or iPad.\n\nThe only problem is that there are also secondary, tertiary, quaternary, quinary, senary, septenary, octonary, nonary, and denary requirements as well. There were so many requirements that I had to learn what comes after tertiary!\n\nBest of all is that the tool doesn\u2019t explain what went wrong when your two Apple Accounts don\u2019t meet the very strict criteria. It just fails.\n\nSome of you at home may be wondering how one could end up with two actively used Apple Accounts. My situation is like that of the others for whom Apple apparently made this Rube Goldberg migration tool.\n\nI primarily use the Apple Account that is associated with iCloud. However, my iTunes and App Store purchases are associated with a different Apple Account that I used prior to the Apple Account used with iCloud.\n\nSince iOS 5, this issue has haunted me. It requires maintaining separate passwords and billing information for each Apple Account.\n\nAt times, I\u2019ve accidentally subscribed to iCloud storage using my Apple Account associated with App Store purchases. It\u2019s surprisingly difficult to cancel an iCloud subscription from an Apple Account not associated with iCloud. I think the process has required going through the Music app or App Store app on the Mac.\n\nThe way I\u2019ve realized I paid $10 for iCloud using the wrong Apple Account is also a pain. Past examples include realizing that my photos haven\u2019t been syncing for days, my devices haven\u2019t backed up to iCloud in weeks, and my iCloud Mail has been bouncing back for senders who had to find other ways to contact me.\n\nAs I mentioned, I\u2019ve been dual-wielding Apple Accounts on each device since 2011. It started even before that.\n\nWhen I was 18 or 19, I started a free trial of Apple\u2019s MobileMe cloud service with the email address zachall@me.com. Short and sweet. (The only better email address I\u2019ve had was zhall@apple.com when I worked at an Apple Store in college, and shoutout to whoever has zac@mac.com. I envy you.)\n\nAnyway, being a broke college student, I didn\u2019t see the value in paying $99/year for 20 GB of email and file storage when Gmail and Dropbox were free. (Dropbox was also really good for Mac users at the time, and you could add capacity to your free storage quota in a number of simple ways.)\n\nMobileMe ran from 2008 to 2011. Then iCloud replaced the artist also formerly known as .mac and iTools, and the still unchanged 5GB tier meant iCloud was free to use. During the iOS 5 beta period, I changed my one and only Apple Account from using a Gmail address to using a free iCloud email address. That\u2019s when zacheryhall@me.com became my Apple Account for my many iTunes and App Store purchases.\n\nOnce iOS 5 came out of beta and iCloud.com officially launched, Apple unlocked access to Apple Accounts that were previously tied to a lapsed MobileMe/.mac/iTools subscription. At last, zachall@me.com was available for me to use again \u2014 and without an upfront payment of $99 or any money for that matter.\n\nAt that point, I wanted to switch from using zacheryhall@me.com anywhere to using zachall@me.com everywhere. The only problem was that I couldn\u2019t merge Apple Accounts, and there was no mechanism for transferring purchases from one Apple Account to another.\n\nSince 2011, I\u2019ve maintained two Apple Accounts with two passwords and two sets of billing information on each Apple device, carefully remembering not to subscribe to iCloud or AppleCare+ from the wrong Apple Account. AppleCare+ is another subscription that cancelling from the Apple Account used for purchases is near impossible to do.\n\nFor the reasons listed here, I was rather ecstatic when Apple quietly released the ability to migrate purchases from one Apple Account to another.\n\nWho was this tool for? Picture me standing under a dozen illuminated signs all pointing down at ME!\n\nBut alas, two weeks later, I\u2019m no closer to migrating purchases from my Apple Account used for iTunes and the App Store than I was 14 years ago.\n\nI\u2019ve tried fulfilling each requirement listed by Apple, including saying goodbye to every TestFlight app associated with my Apple Account used for purchases. Workflow, the predecessor to Shortcuts that Apple bought years ago, was the hardest TestFlight to remove from my history.\n\nI guess my next move is to stop making any purchases or maintaining any subscriptions and seeing if that helps. I could also make a third Apple Account to which I could transfer my kids\u2019 Apple Accounts, but there\u2019s a real chance they could get stuck there for a while and not return to my theoretically unified Apple Account.\n\nFor now, the \u201cMigrate\u201d button in the Settings app on my iPhone and iPad is just something that I\u2019ll stare at in utter confusion, poking it from time to time while asking, Why?\u201d",

            "content": "Aside from my phone, earbuds are by far the most essential tech item that I own. Since I'm almost always listening to something, whether it's a podcast, music or an audiobook, I use them every day without fail, typically multiple times throughout the day.\n\nBecause of that, I ask a lot of my earbuds. Not only should they play music, but I also want them to deliver clear audio on calls, stay in my ears on long runs and drown out some of the noise on busy subway trains.\n\nWhile I've tried a handful of earbuds throughout the years, I always come back to my trusty AirPods. But recently, I discovered a pair of $20 buds that some shoppers \u2014 and a fellow Shop TODAY editor \u2014 claim can serve as a replacement for the popular style.\n\nSo I tried both of the earbuds, wearing them for workouts, calls and plenty more to see how they stack up. Keep reading to discover my thoughts.\n\nThe JBL Go Air Pop Earbuds and the Apple AirPods 4 appear side by side. Courtesy of Emma Stessman\n\nBest affordable earbuds: JLab Go Air Pop Earbuds\n\nWeight: 28.5 grams | Battery life: 8+ hours | Total playtime: 32+ hours | Waterproof rating?: IPX4\n\nIt's not hard to see why the JLab Go Air Pop Earbuds have more than 31,000 five-star ratings on Amazon. For their $25 price tag, they deliver some impressive features. The sound was high-quality and you can toggle between three different sound modes: JLab Signature, Balanced and Bass Boost modes, which the brand says can help you get the most out of your listening experience. (While the differences were pretty minor, the Bass Boost setting gave the music a bit of a heartier sound \u2014 which the brand says is good for workouts \u2014 while the vocals are slightly amplified in JLab Signature mode.)\n\nMy favorite aspect was the long-lasting battery life. On their own, the buds can last up to 8 hours, so I was able to listen to music, take meetings and watch videos during the workday without having to put them back into the case to charge. The case itself provides you with up to 32 hours of listening time, so I could charge the buds a couple of times before plugging the case in.\n\nThe USB cable is also built into the case, so I could easily charge it when I got a low battery warning without scrambling to find a cord. (Though it still requires a USB charging block.)\n\nThe JBL Go Air Pop Earbuds have a built-in charging cord. Courtesy of Emma Stessman\n\nBecause the earbuds have soft tips, they fit snugly in your ears and do a good job of blocking out external sounds. You get three different tip sizes in the package, and I found that the smallest ones fit my ears best. While they were comfortable for the most part \u2014 I have more narrow ear canals, so headphones with soft tips can be hit or miss \u2014 if I wore them for more than a couple of hours, my ears would start to feel sore.\n\nSometimes I struggle with earbuds with soft tips because they don't completely fit in my ears and fall out when I'm working out. Surprisingly, these stayed pretty securely in my ears during runs and strength training sessions.\n\nThe buds feature touch controls on the sides that allow you to switch songs, turn up the volume and change the sound. While some people may appreciate the convenience of the controls, I honestly wish they weren't there. I sometimes struggled with getting it to recognize my touch while running or walking and I would end up pausing the music when I wanted to skip a song or accidentally activating Siri. And while they fit snugly in my ears, during times of heavy movement I would sometimes have to adjust them and I would often activate the touch controls in the process.\n\nAdditionally, while the brand says that you can use the app to personalize your sound preferences, I found it to be hard to navigate and even after some Google searches, I couldn't figure out how to connect my buds to access the sound controls. So I would change them using the touch controls on the buds \u2014 but once again, my touch wouldn't always be recognized.\n\nAdditionally, I often use my earbuds to talk on the phone in busy environments, like on walks through New York City and at the gym. While the audio quality on my end was great, I noticed that when I was wearing them, people would ask me to repeat what I had said more often \u2014 my sister at one point even asked me to call her later because the background noise while I was at the gym was so distracting.\n\nBest splurge: Apple AirPods 4\n\nWeight: 34.7 grams | Battery life: Up to 5 hours | Total playtime: Up to 30 hours | Waterproof rating?: IP54\n\nAs mentioned before, I have often experimented with wearing other earbuds, but time and time again I come back to AirPods. As an iPhone user, they offer a seamless setup and continued use experience.\n\nThe Apple AirPods 4 debuted last September and when I first tried them, I was immediately impressed by the high-quality sound and the added noise cancellation features. And even after more than six months of continued use, I haven't found that their quality has faded at all.\n\nWhen I first got the AirPods, I regularly asked friends and family members I spoke to on the phone about the sound quality. They all said that the background noise, like the sound of cars, sirens and other people, was noticeably dimmed.\n\nApple's AirPods 4 have noise cancellation features. Courtesy of Emma Stessman\n\nThe Apple AirPods 4 are the first non-Pro model from the brand to feature active noise cancellation. Because they don't have silicone tips, when ANC is turned on, not all sounds are completely drowned out. Still, it does a pretty good job of minimizing the sounds of a busy office or a crowded subway train. (If you don't need the noise cancellation, the brand also offers a more affordable option without it.)\n\nI also like how you can easily change the sound setting from the toolbar, adjusting the volume and turning transparency mode or ANC on and off.\n\nThe buds also fit comfortably in my ears and stay in, even through high-movement activities like runs, HIIT workouts, walks and more. And I rarely find myself adjusting them throughout the day.\n\nThe main area where the Apple AirPods 4 is lacking is with its battery life. You can typically get up to five hours of listening time from one charge, though that time period shortens when you have the ANC turned on. I listened to music with the noise cancellation on on a recent cross-country flight, and three-quarters of the way through I had to pause my music and charge them for 20 minutes because they came close to dying.\n\nThe earbuds also use a USB-C charger and the cable isn't included. So if you don't have all of the latest tech, such as the newest iPhone, which uses the cable, you may need to buy one separately.\n\nBest overall: Apple AirPods 4\n\nWhile the most expensive product isn't always the best, in this case, it may be worth it to spend some extra money on your earbuds. While the JLab Go Air Pop Earbuds are a great affordable option with high-quality sound and impressive battery life, for my lifestyle, the Apple AirPods 4 are the better choice.\n\nI don't find myself adjusting them in my ears as much, I appreciate how easy they are to operate with other Apple products and I love the boosted sound quality for calls.\n\nHow we chose\n\nWe chose to compare the two earbuds because both of them are popular with shoppers and are editor favorites. I wore both of the brands for a number of activities, including workouts, walks, phone calls and meetings. I also used them to listen to multiple kinds of content, including both music and podcasts.\n\nWhy trust Shop TODAY?\n\nThe Shop TODAY editors and writers search the internet to find the best products out there.

            "content": "2025\n\nI\u2019m going to be, as we millennials say, \u201cfor real\u201d with you all about the iPhone 16e. After a couple of days with it, I prefer it over wielding the iPhone 16 Pro, at least for testing purposes. I\u2019m not saying there isn\u2019t a point in dropping a stack of cash on a Pro version of the iPhone or even the sub-level iPhone 16, but the iPhone 16e ticks all the boxes it needs to without this over-showmanship of everything Apple can do. Dare I say, it\u2019s subdued Apple, and I like it.\n\nIf anything, the iPhone 16e is what happens when Apple dials it down to only the essentials. I still don\u2019t know what the \u201ce\u201d stands for (I tried asking!), but I think it stands for \u201cexactly what you need.\u201d For Apple fans, the iPhone 16e is a chic little smartphone you buy for your kids or an elder, so you can keep an eye on them without the mental gymnastics of figuring out how to save some cash on an older model of the iPhone that can do it all. The iPhone 16e already does it all because it\u2019s built on the same processing architecture as the iPhone 16/16 Pro. This phone is also for people who haven\u2019t chosen a path yet; the iPhone 16e is the \u201centry-level\u201d foray into the walled garden. Apple bottled up enough of the experience to entice you from your budget Android device.\n\nApple iPhone 16e Apple's iPhone 16e is the \"essential\" iPhone with all the perks of being in the ecosystem\u2014especially Apple Intelligence. Pros Starts at 128GB of storage\n\nStarts at 128GB of storage Same A18 chip as the rest of the iPhone 16 family\n\nSame A18 chip as the rest of the iPhone 16 family Even the Action Button is there Cons Camera performance gets dubious after 2x\n\nCamera performance gets dubious after 2x Doesn't support mmWave\n\nDoesn't support mmWave No access to MagSafe accessories\n\niPhone 16e Review: Design\n\nLook, it\u2019s an iPhone 16\n\nThe third-generation iPhone SE was the last \u201cbudget\u201d iPhone. That phone looked like it existed for fan service; it had Touch ID, which harkened back to an iPhone generation that Apple had since left when the SE 3 was announced. It had a measly 64GB of storage space and a camera that couldn\u2019t even shoot in the dark. The 4.7-inch screen was cute, especially in 2022 when we were all clamoring for smaller phones, but in 2025, it\u2019s a screen for ants. The Google Pixel A-series quickly surpassed the iPhone SE. Apple\u2019s \u201cbudget\u201d phone stayed dated.\n\nThe iPhone 16e has a renewed sense of self. It is not a \u201cbudget\u201d Apple phone, but the entrance into the ecosystem that the company would like to invite you to sit in, even though it is very bright and slightly cold. It has all the essentials to enjoy tending in the walled garden. The design is a pared-down, lighter version of the iPhone 16. There have been complaints that the iPhone 16e is not colorful enough because it only comes in black and white, but you\u2019ll probably end up covering this thing in a case, anyway.\n\nThe iPhone 16e doesn\u2019t have the Dynamic Island, but it does have Face ID, which works just as quickly as the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro. Don\u2019t forget to scan yourself with sunglasses and a mask because typing in a six-digit passcode is still annoying when trying to do something fast. The 6.1-inch screen is a Super Retina XDR display, though it tops at 1,200 nits of brightness. The charging port is now USB-C, and there is Qi wireless charging but no MagSafe, which is fine because you can easily spoof the magnet anyway (I\u2019ve been doing it on Android for years).\n\nThe Action Button also makes an appearance here. I can see this being the main selling point of this specific iPhone model. It\u2019s beneficial for people buying this phone to help aid someone if they\u2019re alone. Imagine setting up a Shortcut for a routine that dims the lights or setting up a FaceTime bookmark to simplify the task of video calling the grandkids.\n\nMy favorite part about the iPhone 16e is its lightness relative to the rest of the iPhone lineup\u2014I\u2019m not even talking about the Plus or the Pro Max. I am talking about this phone weighing just under six ounces. The iPhone 16 is right at six ounces on the chart, but it has protruding glass, which adds a smidge more heft. Apple figures some of us will be buying this as a secondary phone. I liked that I could carry it around in my purse with the Pixel 9 Pro, which weighs seven ounces, and I barely felt it in there. That was with Apple\u2019s magenta silicone case on it.\n\nUnlike the iPhone 16 family, only one camera sensor is on the iPhone 16e. However, it\u2019s a 48-MP Fusion camera, a two-in-one camera system that can shoot in 24-MP and 48-MP resolutions like the rest of the iPhone 16 family. The iPhone 16e\u2019s primary camera offers some wiggle room with features like Portrait Mode with depth control. But there is no focus control. There\u2019s no ultrawide camera to zoom out into or macro photography, either. If you want to get close to something, you\u2019ll have to walk up to it.\n\nThe iPhone 16e supports Dolby Vision video up to 4K at 60 frames-per-second, which is ample enough for anyone just recording for the sake of logging it. Photographic Styles are on the iPhone 16e, which feeds the inner emo in me. I even took a nighttime landscape photo by keeping the shutter open for a few seconds. All the basic camera necessities are on the iPhone 16e, and I was pretty satisfied despite the \u201cfixed\u201d lens experience.\n\nThe perks of being an iPhone user\n\nThe iPhone 16e exists to help bring new users into the fold with its ecosystem perks, particularly the ones that Apple has been able to market as essential utilities. Things like Emergency SOS, Roadside Assistance, and messaging over satellite will do wonders at extolling the idea that the iPhone is a helpful aid to life. Features like Find My and Crash Detection will also make it easier for parents to default to the iPhone 16e as their kids\u2019 digital leash.\n\nApple Intelligence is another big get, and the iPhone 16e is in this timeline to bring even outliers up to speed with what it\u2019s doing with AI. I\u2019m still scratching my head at whether people joining the platform gravitate toward using the built-in features, but I can see typing to Siri getting the most play on this form factor. I\u2019m not so sure about the generative abilities of Image Playground. It\u2019s fast on the iPhone 16e, just like on the other iPhone 16s, but I\u2019m still not getting the desired results I want, which discourages me from using it. At the very least, you\u2019ll have things like Apple Intelligence in the Mail app to help you sift through threads and generative writing help for those days you hate people too much to construct a sentence. Again, Apple\u2019s point is that the device gives you access to the essentials, even the AI stuff.\n\niPhone 16e Review: Performance\n\nApple\u2019s homegrown chips\n\nOne of Apple\u2019s latest priorities is getting a handle on its supply chain so it has total control over what it produces without relying on third-party vendors. It\u2019s getting there with the advent of the C1 modem. The only drawback of the modem is that it only works with sub-6GHz 5G networks, so you\u2019ll have a hard time connecting inside stadiums and other overwhelmed, crowded places. But that\u2019s also why Apple can make such steady battery claims since most people don\u2019t need access to that stuff constantly. Apple says this is the \u201clongest battery life even in a 6.1-inch iPhone.\u201d I\u2019m still working on our official battery test to come in an update this week, but I can already tell you I have hardly charged the iPhone 16e since getting it set up five days ago.\n\nThe other homegrown part of the iPhone 16e is its processor. The A18 featured here isn\u2019t a copy-paste chip; the GPU is a four-core chip rather than a five-core like in the regular iPhone 16. Still, that\u2019s not going to slow you down. The Geekbench numbers for GPU performance were only 2,000 points apart between the two sibling devices. Apple Arcade games like Hello Kitty Adventure Island and Sonic Dream Team ran smoothly without hiccups on the iPhone 16e. Pok\u00e9mon Go was fine. Realistically, that\u2019s the caliber of mobile games people will play at this price point, and it\u2019s good to know the first-tier iPhone can handle a subscription to Apple Arcade, though it can handle stuff like Resident Evil 4 and Roblox, too. (The kid stuck with this iPhone will be very happy about that last part.)\n\niPhone 16e Review: Verdict\n\nShould you buy the iPhone 16e?\n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting to adore this phone or prefer it over the iPhone 16 Pro I typically use to test software. The light build alone makes the iPhone 16e a joy to handle. There\u2019s also virtually no difference in software experience between the iPhone 16e and the iPhone 16, so carrying around the whole kit and caboodle doesn\u2019t feel necessary. It\u2019s nice and freeing. Apple plans to push out Apple Intelligence features to the iPhone 16e simultaneously with the rest of the iPhone 16 family.\n\nThe iPhone 16e may not be capable of capturing objects from far away or come in a spectrum of neat colors. Nor does it sync up with the vast offering of MagSafe accessories and devices. Otherwise, it\u2019s everything you need to lock into the ecosystem and start buying other Apple accessories and subscribing to services. The iPhone 16e is the gateway drug.\n\nI know there will be a debate over the fact that there are cheaper Android devices that offer the same quality of features as the iPhone 16e. I say the iPhone 16e isn\u2019t for you. It\u2019s for the already-dedicated Apple users who don\u2019t want to fuss about what phone to buy to tether family members. With trade-ins and sales, the iPhone 16e could help bring in people who have wanted the device but were often limited by the high starting cost. It\u2019s also going to be a good deal for anyone upgrading from a much older iPhone 11 or earlier, and it\u2019s $200 cheaper than going outright for the iPhone 16 with 128GB of storage.",

In a regulatory filing submitted Tuesday evening, Apple disclosed that 97% of the outstanding shares that cast ballots voted against the measure.\n\nThe outcome vindicated Apple management\u2019s decision to stand behind its diversity commitment even though Trump asked the U.S. Department of Justice to look into whether these types of programs have discriminated against some employees whose race or gender aren\u2019t aligned with the initiative\u2019s goals.\n\nBut Apple CEO Tim Cook has maintained a cordial relationship with Trump since his first term in office, an alliance that so far has helped the company skirt tariffs on its iPhones made in China. After Cook and Trump met last week, Apple on Monday announced it will invest $500 billion in the U.S. and create 20,000 more jobs during the next five years \u2014 a commitment applauded by the president.\n\nTuesday\u2019s shareholder vote came a month after the same group presented a similar proposal during Costco\u2019s annual meeting, only to have it overwhelmingly rejected, too.\n\nThat snub didn\u2019t discourage the National Center for Public Policy Research from confronting Apple about its DEI program in a pre-recorded presentation by Stefan Padfield, executive director of the think tank\u2019s Free Enterprise Project, who asserted \u201cforced diversity is bad for business.\u201d\n\nIn the presentation, Padfield attacked Apple\u2019s diversity commitments for being out of line with recent court rulings and said the programs expose the Cupertino, California, company to an onslaught of potential lawsuits for alleged discrimination. He cited the Trump administration as one of Apple\u2019s potential legal adversaries.\n\nApple shareholders rejected an attempt to pressure the company into joining President Donald Trump\u2019s push to scrap corporate programs designed to diversify its workforce.\n\n\u201cThe vibe shift is clear: DEI is out and merit is in,\u201d Padfield said in the presentation.\n\nThe specter of potential legal trouble was magnified last week when Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier filed a federal lawsuit against Target alleging the retailer\u2019s recently scaled-back DEI program alienated many consumers and undercut sales to the detriment of shareholders.\n\nJust as Costco does, Apple contends that fostering a diverse workforce makes good business sense.\n\nBut Cook conceded Apple may have to make some adjustments to its diversity program \u201cas the legal landscape changes\u201d while still striving to maintain a culture that has helped elevate the company to its current market value of $3.7 trillion \u2014 greater than any other business in the world.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to create a culture of belonging,\u201d Cook told shareholders during the meeting.\n\nIn its last diversity and inclusion report issued in 2022, Apple disclosed that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees. Nearly two-thirds of its employees were men.\n\nOther major technology companies for years have reported employing mostly white and Asian men, especially in high-paid engineering jobs \u2014 a tendency that spurred the industry to pursue largely unsuccessful efforts to diversify.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nApple shareholders emphatically voted down a shareholder proposal looking to slash the tech giant\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at its annual meeting Tuesday. Over 97% of shareholders voted against the proposal asking Apple to \u201ccease DEI efforts,\u201d according to a Feb. 25 securities filing .\n\nThe shareholder proposal was submitted by conservative think tank the National Center for Public Policy Research, which also submitted a similar proposal to the board of Costco. This proposal was shot down by 98% of the big box store\u2019s shareholders at its board meeting last month.\n\nApple\u2019s management advised shareholders to vote against the anti-DEI proposal in the company\u2019s annual proxy materials. The company said at the time that the proposal \u201cinappropriately attempts to restrict Apple\u2019s ability to manage its own ordinary business operations, people and teams, and business strategies.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe overwhelming rejection of NCPPR\u2019s anti-DEI proposals at Apple and Costco come as public and private companies alike have rolled back or altered diversity, equity and inclusion practices to comply with executive orders from President Donald Trump. After reversing a broad range of federal DEI policies on his first day in office, Trump ordered federal agencies to investigate private sector practices as well.\n\nAccording to Apple\u2019s Tuesday submission to the Securities and Exchange Commission, over 8.84 billion shareholders opposed the proposal, with just 2.1 million shareholders in support. Around 87.8 million shareholders abstained.\n\n\u201cThe board at Apple and its investors have today made it clear that the company\u2019s DEI programs are valuable for its staff and the business,\u201d Kohinoor Choudhury, DEI campaign manager for responsible investing nonprofit ShareAction, said in an emailed statement Tuesday.\n\nNCPPR\u2019s proposal was short, requesting that Apple stop its DEI efforts. The think tank cited the Supreme Court\u2019s decision striking down race-conscious admissions in higher education, as well as subsequent lawsuits that companies have faced over their DEI programs as a reason the tech giant should abandon its own policies.\n\nThe think tank\u2019s supporting statement in the proxy materials also cited the wave of program rollbacks that followed last summer, including Tractor Supply, Lowes, Ford and the maker of Jack Daniel\u2019s.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order set off a number of announced policy changes, as companies look to make sure their DEI programs comply. A number of major banks have adjusted their filing language on such efforts, and companies including Meta, Target, McDonald\u2019s and more, have rolled back DEI programs.\n\nChoudhury said the rejection of the anti-DEI proposal at Apple \u201cmakes good business sense,\u201d and DEI policies \u201chelp businesses attract and keep talent and encourage innovation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hope to see shareholders continue to step up [at annual board meetings] and use their influence to uphold responsible investment standards on critical issues such as tackling workplace inequalities,\u201d Choudhury noted in her statement.\n\nCostco\u2019s management similarly advised its shareholders to reject NCPPR\u2019s proposal, and said in its proxy materials that \u201cit is the proponent and others that are responsible for inflicting burdens on companies with their challenges to longstanding diversity programs.\u201d\n\nWhile an increasing number of ESG-related shareholder proposals have reached a vote in recent years, the 2024 proxy season was the first time that an increase in anti-ESG proposal filings was responsible for the overall rise, according to Morningstar Sustainalytics. However the increase in filings has not corresponded with an increase in shareholder support for such measures, according to The Conference Board.",

            "content": "is a reviewer with 10 years of experience writing about consumer tech. She has a special interest in mobile photography and telecom. Previously, she worked at DPReview.\n\nThe iPhone 16E is everything I love and hate about iOS. FaceTime at your fingertips. A reliable camera. Simplicity. Familiarity. They\u2019re the pillars of the iPhone experience, and Apple\u2019s newest phone has \u2018em.\n\nMy husband picked up the 16E, concerned that he would have to \u201clearn something new\u201d to use it. He swiped around for a second and said, \u201cOh. It\u2019s just like my phone.\u201d It is just like his phone \u2014 a six-year-old iPhone XR \u2014 only updated with a few essential improvements (a faster processor, nicer screen, and a modern camera, that kind of thing) and little else.\n\nThat\u2019s the other pillar of the iPhone experience: You get exactly what Apple gives you and nothing more. On Android, you can buy a $500 phone with a fast refresh-rate screen, two rear cameras, seven years of software support, and wireless charging. On iOS, you can buy this $599 phone with one rear camera, a standard 60Hz screen, wireless charging (but no MagSafe), and an ample but unstated amount of software support. Apple has no competition when it comes to phones running iOS. The company can gatekeep these conveniences behind a higher price tag, and that\u2019s simply the way things will be. I\u2019m looking at you, ProMotion.\n\nThis is the world the iPhone 16E enters. It\u2019s Apple\u2019s cheapest phone, but it\u2019s not cheap \u2014 probably for the aforementioned \u201clack of competition\u201d reasons. It\u2019s an iPhone that does iPhone things, but it\u2019s probably missing at least one major feature for any given buyer, whether that\u2019s an extra camera or the convenience of a MagSafe ring. If you\u2019re clinging desperately to an older model and want a new iPhone for the least possible money, the 16E is the one to get.\n\nThat\u2019s the job of the 16E: be the path of least resistance to blue bubbles. But for a more discerning customer the answer\u2019s not as clear-cut.\n\nThe iPhone 16E is the spiritual successor to the iPhone SE, though Apple would rather you not think of it that way. The SE was the company\u2019s budget-friendly line, a kind of close-out bargain bin offer on last generation\u2019s chassis with upgraded internals. The design was wildly outdated by the end, but, hey, it only cost $429. That line appears to have ended with the 16E, which is fully a member of the iPhone 16 series.\n\nInstead of an older design that\u2019s a really good deal, we have a modern design that\u2019s only kind of a deal\n\nBut instead of an older design that\u2019s a really good deal, we have a modern design that\u2019s only kind of a deal. It\u2019s $200 cheaper than the $799 iPhone 16 and has a similar 6.1-inch OLED screen. There\u2019s no Dynamic Island \u2014 just a notch. And instead of two rear lenses, you get just one: a 48-megapixel main camera and no ultrawide to go with it. You get wired charging, but no MagSafe. The Action Button, but no Camera Control. This, not that. And so on.\n\nThere\u2019s a kind of equation that can help determine how much you should care about this list of missing features. How old is your current phone? Do other people in your household use MagSafe accessories that you want to share? Do you even know what MagSafe is? Would you like to follow sports scores at the top of your screen while you do other things on your phone, or are you a Seattle Mariners fan? (Love hurts, guys.) I don\u2019t know what that exact formula is because I barely scraped by in calculus, but just bear it in mind as you read the rest of this review.\n\nThe notch lives.\n\nThe 16E\u2019s screen is very likely a version of the iPhone 14\u2019s screen, complete with a notch housing the Face ID and front-facing camera array. The regular 16\u2019s screen gets just a little brighter in theory, but in practice they look about the same to me, brightness-wise. The 16E\u2019s screen doesn\u2019t go down to one nit like the 16\u2019s can, which is too bad because it\u2019s honestly cool as hell and handy when you\u2019re trying not to wake up your spouse with a bright phone screen. The notch\u2019s existence also means no Dynamic Island \u2014 that\u2019s the pill-shaped cutout Apple introduced with the iPhone 14 Pro, which houses tiny bits of timely info you might want to see at a glance.\n\nAll that time-sensitive information, like live sports scores and the proximity of your incoming Uber, is still presented on the 16E\u2019s lock screen. But the Dynamic Island keeps it at the top of your screen while you do other things on your phone. It\u2019s handy, and having gotten used to it, I missed it on the 16E. The extra visual confirmation is nice when you have a timer or screen recording in progress. The Dynamic Island probably won\u2019t be a great loss if you\u2019re used to a phone without it, though.\n\nMagSafe might be another case of \u201cif you\u2019ve never had it then you won\u2019t miss it,\u201d but I\u2019m a little less inclined to shrug off its absence on the 16E. Sure, there\u2019s still Qi wireless charging. And you can always use a case with magnets as a workaround if you want to use MagSafe accessories, even if it\u2019s not an elegant solution. But the beauty of MagSafe is the simplicity, and if you\u2019re a case-hater like me then it\u2019s a handy way to add a Pop Socket or a low-profile wallet to your phone without committing to a case. Aside from the SE, every iPhone from the 12-series onward has MagSafe. It feels like a standard feature now, and it\u2019s hard to understand why Apple left it out.\n\nSpend more money, get more cameras.\n\nThe iPhone 16E\u2019s rear camera uses a 48-megapixel sensor that combines pixels to help it better gather light, and it delivers nice images in most situations. There\u2019s no ultrawide camera and therefore no macro photography either. I missed the ultrawide more than once when stepping backward to frame a wide shot wasn\u2019t possible. There\u2019s a decent portrait mode, though it\u2019s the older version where you can\u2019t change the focus point after the fact. Photographic Styles are available to help dial in color reproduction, though they\u2019re also the previous-gen version and you can\u2019t tweak undertones.\n\nThis is a camera system most people will be perfectly happy with. If you\u2019re the least bit inclined photographically and want more flexibility \u2014 both in focal range and processing options \u2014 then consider an iPhone 16 or 16 Pro. But it\u2019s a good camera for a general audience. There\u2019s excellent 4K video recording, optical image stabilization, and reliable color reproduction. A more advanced phone camera would offer better chances of capturing moving subjects in dim light, but this one keeps up in most situations.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 13\n\nMuch of the 16E is familiar, but there is one entirely new component: Apple\u2019s C1 modem. This is its debut appearance, and the road to Apple\u2019s first in-house modem was reportedly full of setbacks and delays. I\u2019ve used it for the past week to make FaceTime calls, upload large video files in crowded places, and stream YouTube on the bus. I tested it alongside a regular iPhone 16 equipped with a Qualcomm-made modem \u2014 both on Verizon \u2014 and I didn\u2019t see any consistent difference in performance between the two.\n\nEvery time I thought the iPhone 16 was faring better with video call quality or upload speeds, I\u2019d try the same test again and the 16E would come out ahead. If I were none the wiser, I wouldn\u2019t have given the modem a second thought as I used the phone. Given the difficulty Apple seemingly encountered building this thing and the complexity of a cellular modem, \u201cit seems fine\u201d is actually a great outcome for the C1.\n\nApple claims switching to its own modem has allowed it to squeeze a little more battery life out of the 16E, offering \u201cthe best battery life ever on a 6.1-inch iPhone,\u201d according to its press release. Battery life certainly seems good. I spent an afternoon out of the house using a lot of navigation, streaming a podcast, testing connectivity, and watching YouTube. I clocked about five hours of screen time and was only down to 41 percent by the end of the day. I\u2019m confident that most people could get through a day comfortably on this battery, but that\u2019s not my biggest concern. I\u2019m more curious about long-term battery health \u2014 Apple\u2019s recent track record here is spotty \u2014 and there\u2019s just no way of knowing that after a week of testing.\n\nThe 16E only comes in black or white, but at least this fuchsia case is hot.\n\nThe other upgrade here is Apple Intelligence. Maybe you\u2019ve heard of it? Or seen it on a billboard? Or in a commercial a few dozen times? Apple would like us to think of its AI as a marquee feature on the 16E, but Apple Intelligence just doesn\u2019t feel like one \u2014 not yet, anyway. But it\u2019s all here: the AI writing tools, Image Playground, notification summaries, and the updated Siri with a ChatGPT extension. It\u2019s all pretty forgettable right now.\n\nCase in point: it took me several days to notice that Apple Intelligence wasn\u2019t running on the 16E I was testing, despite having the Apple Intelligence option turned on. I sorted it out \u2014 I guess something about the way I set it up prevented the necessary AI models from downloading \u2014 but this says a lot about how useful Apple Intelligence is right now. The most interesting stuff is yet to come, and the 16E will be ready for it, which is nice. But I definitely wouldn\u2019t let Apple Intelligence be a deciding factor in picking this phone versus, say, an iPhone 15.\n\nThe 16E makes more sense if you think Apple Intelligence is an essential feature.\n\nThat highlights where I\u2019m stuck trying to figure out the 16E. If you\u2019re coming from an older iPhone like an 11, don\u2019t want to spend a lot, and don\u2019t care about MagSafe or an ultrawide camera, then the 16E kind of makes sense. But a hundred dollars more will get you a new iPhone 15 with MagSafe, the Dynamic Island, and an ultrawide camera, though there\u2019s no Apple Intelligence or action button.\n\nThe 16E feels like it should offer the essentials, but it\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s an essential iPhone feature and what\u2019s not. It\u2019s probably more like a combination of features, and for some people, the 16E likely offers a combination they\u2019ll be happy with. Specifically, I mean people like my husband and anyone else with an old iPhone who is uninterested in learning what MagSafe is, rarely takes pictures, and just wants a dang iPhone. The 16E covers those essentials. For someone who wants more flexibility from their smartphone\u2019s camera or its system of accessories, this isn\u2019t the iPhone for you.\n\nI\u2019d rather have a cool magnetic accessory system and a neat quick-glance display feature built into my phone than Apple Intelligence, especially for $600. It doesn\u2019t quite add up for me, but maybe the math looks a little different for you.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nApple Inc. on Monday said it will commit $500 billion to U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, marking the largest-ever investment by the tech giant as the Trump administration looks to onshore factory jobs.\n\nAs part of the commitment, Apple and its partners will open a new facility in Houston by 2026 that makes servers for its artificial intelligence system, according to a release.\n\nThe company also plans to double its U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund to $10 billion, create a training academy in Detroit for upskilling workers and grow its investments in research and development. The fund was created in 2017 to support advanced manufacturing and skills development across the country.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe blockbuster commitment \u2014 which includes creating 20,000 jobs \u2014 comes as Apple and other Silicon Valley companies look to avoid tariffs on tech-related imports from China and other countries.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company has made similar investments over the years. In 2021, Apple said it would invest $430 billion in the U.S. to accelerate silicon engineering and 5G technology. In 2018, the company also said it would make a $350 billion contribution to U.S. manufacturing, including the creation of 20,000 jobs over the next five years.\n\n\u201cWe are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we\u2019re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments,\u201d CEO Tim Cook said in a statement Monday.\n\nApple\u2019s latest move is expected to support initiatives related to AI, silicon engineering and skills development for students and workers nationwide.\n\nAs part of the pledge, the iPhone maker said it plans to open a 250,000-square-foot facility in Houston next year that produces energy-efficient servers for its Apple Intelligence and Private Cloud Compute systems. As AI systems roll out, Apple said it plans to continue expanding data center capacity in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nApple is also expanding its advanced manufacturing fund, which includes a multi-billion-dollar commitment to produce silicon in a TSMC facility in Arizona. Apple is the facility\u2019s top customer and mass production of the company\u2019s chips began last month, the company said. To date, the fund has supported projects in 13 states, including Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Texas and Indiana.\n\nIn addition to the Houston facility, Apple said it will open a manufacturing academy in Detroit to help small and mid-sized companies implement AI and smart manufacturing techniques in their operations.\n\nCurrently, Apple supports more than 2.9 million jobs across the country, including direct employment and work with suppliers, manufacturers and app developers, according to a release.\n\nLast week, President Donald Trump signaled a move from Apple was coming at a recent meeting with U.S. governors, saying that Cook has stopped \u201ctwo plants in Mexico\u201d and will build products domestically, Bloomberg reported Friday.\n\nApple has not yet confirmed publicly whether production would be shifting from Mexico to the U.S. and did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Trump touted the investment as a win for his administration through his social media account on Truth: \u201cTHE REASON, FAITH IN WHAT WE ARE DOING, WITHOUT WHICH, THEY WOULD\u2019NT BE INVESTING TEN CENTS. THANK YOU TIM COOK AND APPLE!!!\u201d",

Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\n\nThe iPhone 16e is a stark departure from the iPhone SE (3rd Generation) it replaces \u2014 gone are the home button, boxy screen and smaller size. At a glance, the 16e looks very similar to the standard iPhone 16, but there are a few key differences.\n\nLike the iPhone 16, the 16e has a 6.1-inch display covering most of the phone\u2019s front. It has Apple\u2019s latest processor and software, including all its Apple Intelligence features. It has Face ID for security and a USB-C port for charging.\n\nThe 16e actually has more battery life than the iPhone 16 \u2014 up to 26 hours compared to the iPhone 16\u2019s 22.\n\nThe iPhone 16e costs $200 less than the iPhone 16 \u2014 naturally, it\u2019s missing a few features. There is a single 48-megapixel rear camera with two-times zoom but no ultra-wide or macro lens capability. The phone also does not have the camera control button like the other iPhone 16 models. While it can charge wirelessly, it is not MagSafe compatible, meaning there is no magnet to snap onto MagSafe wireless chargers. You can compare all the differences between the iPhone 16e and 16 here.\n\nIt is available in one size and two colors: black or white.\n\nWhy trust NBC Select?\n\nI am a reporter at NBC Select who covers technology including recent stories on smartwatches, cameras, Bluetooth speakers and more.

            "content": "The world of health care disruption and innovation often seems like a sprint, but it is a marathon.\n\nApple is a perfect illustration. The tech giant recently announced its new wide-ranging Apple Health Study. The longitudinal research aims to further understand how technology can play a role in improving physical and mental health and overall well-being.\n\nThe company stated that the study may take at least five years before its full impact is realized and will build on previous research from the Apple Women\u2019s Study, Apple Hearing Study and the Apple Heart and Movement Study. Even with that lag time, results from the study have the potential to be groundbreaking, the company notes.\n\nConsumers can volunteer for the latest study through the Research app in the company\u2019s iPhone and can opt out at any time. De-identified data from the study will explore relationships within various areas of health, such as mental health\u2019s impact on heart rate or how sleep can influence exercise. The study is being conducted in collaboration with Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, a research hospital and teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School, Boston.\n\n3 Things to Know about the Study\n\n1 | This is Apple\u2019s most expansive health study yet.\n\nUnlike prior Apple health studies that focused on specific areas, this research will gather data from iPhones, Apple Watches and AirPods to try to discover new relationships within different areas of health, both physical and mental.\n\nTakeaway\n\nMuch like its previous health studies, Apple will use the findings from this research to learn and inform its product development and potential features to add in the future. The hearing test offered through Apple\u2019s AirPods is an example of how previous studies impacted product development. Other advances that came out of Apple research studies include the Vitals app on the AppleWatch and the Walking Steadiness app on the iPhone.\n\nChanges in health can affect one or more parts of the body, and others may affect well-being overall, so helping to identify these changes earlier can help offer a more proactive approach to health. For example, early detection of a change in hearing health could reduce the risk for cognitive decline.\n\n2 | Survey tools will add important data to the research.\n\nStudy participants not only will contribute data but also will be prompted to answer questions periodically about their at-home life and habits. The study spans many health and disease areas, including activity, aging, cardiovascular health, circulatory health, cognition, hearing, menstrual health, mental health, metabolic health, mobility, neurologic health, respiratory health, sleep and more.\n\nTakeaway\n\nThe longitudinal, virtual study data can be used to predict, detect, monitor and manage changes in participants\u2019 health, Apple states. Additionally, researchers will explore connections across different areas of health.\n\n3 | Scale will be an important factor in this study.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to predict how many consumers will participate in the new Apple Health Study, but the company previously has had great success in recruiting participants for its research. More than 400,000 people participated in the first Apple Heart Study. Broadening the scope and scale of this study has the potential to reveal previously unknown connections between lifestyles and different areas of health.\n\nTakeaway\n\nAccess to a huge and diverse cohort (Apple device users) could help accelerate discovery and progress. \u201cWe anticipate we will likely find some signals that have previously just been missed because we haven\u2019t had studies that are this broad, or we haven\u2019t had studies that are this continuous. We haven\u2019t looked longitudinally or at this level of granularity,\u201d Calum MacRae, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who will serve as principal investigator on the Apple Health Study, noted in a recent interview.",

            "content": "Adam Conner /\n\nFeb 25, 2025\n\nAdam Conner is the vice president for technology policy at the Center for American Progress Action Fund.\n\nComposite. Google CEO Sundar Pichai, left; Apple CEO Tim Cook, right.\n\nLess than a month into his second term, US President Donald Trump has made clear that corruption and lawlessness will be hallmarks of his administration. Among other points of evidence, his refusal to enforce the law banning TikTok and urging other companies to break that law set a dangerous precedent. Then, on February 13, Apple and Google caved to his demands and made TikTok available in their app stores again. That two of the richest and most powerful companies in the world surrendered to a president\u2019s desire to flaunt the law sends an ominous signal about how American companies may respond to Trump\u2019s rampant disregard for the rule of law.\n\nThe law that bans TikTok clearly and explicitly prohibits Apple and Google from distributing it in their app stores. Uniquely, this law is primarily enforced not against foreign apps like TikTok themselves but by leveraging steep fines against the companies that host or distribute them, including via mobile app stores. Considering TikTok\u2019s 170 million US users, those fines could total as much as $850 billion. The executive order Trump issued halted enforcement of this law for 75 days, reiterated by subsequent letters of assurance sent to Google and Apple by Attorney General Bondi\u2014but that doesn\u2019t change the text of the law or provide these companies with meaningful legal protection.\n\nWhy would Apple and Google risk hundreds of billions of dollars in fines over an app neither of them owns or even makes much money off hosting? A possible answer: The Department of Justice is prosecuting numerous antitrust cases against both Apple and Google, and Trump\u2019s tariffs directly threaten Apple\u2019s manufacturing supply chains.\n\nThe number of major issues impacting these companies that Trump currently commands is alarming. Apple is facing a DOJ antitrust lawsuit for monopolizing the smartphone market. It\u2019s also facing huge price hikes thanks to Trump\u2019s promised tariff blitz. Meanwhile, Google lost an antitrust lawsuit to the DOJ\u2014a case filed during the first Trump administration\u2014which found the company holds an illegal monopoly on internet searches. The DOJ has also argued a second antitrust case against Google\u2019s advertising technology, which is currently being decided by a federal judge.\n\nAmid all their legal troubles, the CEOs of both companies have been seen attempting to cozy up to Trump. First, Apple CEO Tim Cook met with President-elect Trump at Mar-a-Lago, and then Google CEO Sundar Pichai was seen sitting front row at his inauguration alongside tech CEOs Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen the DOJ is willing to comply with dropping cases for political reasons. Both companies restored TikTok the same day the news broke that numerous DOJ employees had resigned to avoid executing what they alleged was a nefarious quid pro quo. It\u2019s the kind of coincidence we can expect to see often over the next four years.\n\nRegardless of your feelings about the TikTok ban, it\u2019s the law. Republicans control both arms of Congress, and they could easily pass a modification to the TikTok ban if they wanted. Instead, they\u2019re content to let the President and Attorney General declare laws he dislikes to simply not apply.\n\nIt\u2019s a tremendous leap of faith for these companies to risk crippling fines seemingly to satisfy a president notorious for changing his word. After all, this is the same president who tried to ban TikTok himself five years ago. The same president who lashed out at both Google and Apple in the very recent past. A president who might relish the ability in the future to threaten these companies with up to $850 billion in fines. These billionaire CEOs may think they\u2019re currying favor with Trump by agreeing to ignore the law, but they may have just handed him another weapon to use against them in the future.\n\nNow that two of the biggest companies in the history of the world have bent to Trump\u2019s will in clear violation of the law, how can any other company be expected to stand up to a president who demands they follow suit?",

In a regulatory filing submitted Tuesday evening, Apple disclosed that 97% of the outstanding shares that cast ballots voted against the measure.\n\nThe outcome vindicated Apple management\u2019s decision to stand behind its diversity commitment even though Trump asked the U.S. Department of Justice to look into whether these types of programs have discriminated against some employees whose race or gender aren\u2019t aligned with the initiative\u2019s goals.\n\nBut Apple CEO Tim Cook has maintained a cordial relationship with Trump since his first term in office, an alliance that so far has helped the company skirt tariffs on its iPhones made in China. After Cook and Trump met last week, Apple on Monday announced it will invest $500 billion in the U.S. and create 20,000 more jobs during the next five years\u2014a commitment applauded by the president.\n\nTuesday\u2019s shareholder vote came a month after the same group presented a similar proposal during Costco\u2019s annual meeting, only to have it overwhelmingly rejected, too.\n\nThat snub didn\u2019t discourage the National Center for Public Policy Research from confronting Apple about its DEI program in a pre-recorded presentation by Stefan Padfield, executive director of the think tank\u2019s Free Enterprise Project, who asserted \u201cforced diversity is bad for business.\u201d\n\nIn the presentation, Padfield attacked Apple\u2019s diversity commitments for being out of line with recent court rulings and said the programs expose the Cupertino, California, company to an onslaught of potential lawsuits for alleged discrimination. He cited the Trump administration as one of Apple\u2019s potential legal adversaries.\n\n\u201cThe vibe shift is clear: DEI is out and merit is in,\u201d Padfield said in the presentation.\n\nThe specter of potential legal trouble was magnified last week when Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier filed a federal lawsuit against Target alleging the retailer\u2019s recently scaled-back DEI program alienated many consumers and undercut sales to the detriment of shareholders.\n\nJust as Costco does, Apple contends that fostering a diverse workforce makes good business sense.\n\nBut Cook conceded Apple may have to make some adjustments to its diversity program \u201cas the legal landscape changes\u201d while still striving to maintain a culture that has helped elevate the company to its current market value of $3.7 trillion\u2014greater than any other business in the world.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to create a culture of belonging,\u201d Cook told shareholders during the meeting.\n\nIn its last diversity and inclusion report issued in 2022, Apple disclosed that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees. Nearly two-thirds of its employees were men.\n\nOther major technology companies for years have reported employing mostly white and Asian men, especially in high-paid engineering jobs\u2014a tendency that spurred the industry to pursue largely unsuccessful efforts to diversify.",

This new pledge builds on Apple\u2019s long history of investing in American innovation and advanced high-skilled manufacturing, and will support a wide range of initiatives that focus on artificial intelligence, silicon engineering, and skills development for students and workers across the country.\n\n\u201cWe are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we\u2019re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country\u2019s future,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO. \u201cFrom doubling our Advanced Manufacturing Fund, to building advanced technology in Texas, we\u2019re thrilled to expand our support for American manufacturing. And we\u2019ll keep working with people and companies across this country to help write an extraordinary new chapter in the history of American innovation.\u201d\n\nAs part of this package of U.S. investments, Apple and partners will open a new advanced manufacturing facility in Houston to produce servers that support Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that helps users write, express themselves, and get things done. Apple will also double its U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund, create an academy in Michigan to train the next generation of U.S. manufacturers, and grow its research and development investments in the U.S. to support cutting-edge fields like silicon engineering.\n\nThe $500 billion commitment includes Apple\u2019s work with thousands of suppliers across all 50 states, direct employment, Apple Intelligence infrastructure and data centers, corporate facilities, and Apple TV+ productions in 20 states. Apple remains one of the largest U.S. taxpayers, having paid more than $75 billion in U.S. taxes over the past five years, including $19 billion in 2024 alone.\n\nToday, Apple supports more than 2.9 million jobs across the country through direct employment, work with U.S.-based suppliers and manufacturers, and developer jobs in the thriving iOS app economy.\n\nOpening a New Manufacturing Facility in Houston\n\nAs part of its new U.S. investments, Apple will work with manufacturing partners to begin production of servers in Houston later this year. A 250,000-square-foot server manufacturing facility, slated to open in 2026, will create thousands of jobs.\n\nPreviously manufactured outside the U.S., the servers that will soon be assembled in Houston play a key role in powering Apple Intelligence, and are the foundation of Private Cloud Compute, which combines powerful AI processing with the most advanced security architecture ever deployed at scale for AI cloud computing. The servers bring together years of R&D by Apple engineers, and deliver the industry-leading security and performance of Apple silicon to the data center.\n\nTeams at Apple designed the servers to be incredibly energy efficient, reducing the energy demands of Apple data centers \u2014 which already run on 100 percent renewable energy. As Apple brings Apple Intelligence to customers across the U.S., it also plans to continue expanding data center capacity in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona, and Nevada.\n\nDoubling Apple\u2019s U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund\n\nAs part of this new investment, Apple is doubling its U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund, which was created in 2017 to support world-class innovation and high-skilled manufacturing jobs across America. The growing commitment will increase the fund from $5 billion to $10 billion, focused on promoting advanced manufacturing and skills development throughout the country.\n\nThe fund\u2019s expansion includes a multibillion-dollar commitment from Apple to produce advanced silicon in TSMC\u2019s Fab 21 facility in Arizona. Apple is the largest customer at this state-of-the-art facility, which employs more than 2,000 workers to manufacture the chips in the United States. Mass production of Apple chips began last month.\n\nSilicon used by Apple is designed to bring Apple users incredible features, performance, and power efficiency across their devices. Apple\u2019s suppliers already manufacture silicon in 24 factories across 12 states, including Arizona, Colorado, Oregon, and Utah. The company\u2019s investments in the sector help create thousands of high-paying jobs across the country at U.S. companies like Broadcom, Texas Instruments, Skyworks, and Qorvo.\n\nTo date, Apple\u2019s U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund has supported projects in 13 states \u2014 including Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Indiana \u2014 that have helped build local businesses, train workers, and create a wide range of innovative manufacturing processes and materials for Apple products.\n\nGrowing R&D Investments Across the U.S.\n\nApple continues to expand its R&D across the U.S. In the past five years, Apple has nearly doubled its U.S.-based advanced R&D spend, and it will continue to accelerate its growth.\n\nRecently, Apple announced the newest addition to its iPhone lineup, iPhone 16e. iPhone 16e delivers fast, smooth performance and breakthrough battery life, thanks to the industry-leading efficiency of the A18 chip and the new Apple C1 \u2014 the first cellular modem designed by Apple, and the most power-efficient modem ever on an iPhone. Apple C1 adds a new chapter to the story of Apple silicon and is the result of years of R&D investment, bringing together the work of thousands of engineers. Apple C1 is the start of a long-term strategy that will allow Apple to innovate and optimize the modem system for additional Apple products.\n\nIn the next four years, Apple plans to hire around 20,000 people, of which the vast majority will be focused on R&D, silicon engineering, software development, and AI and machine learning. The expanded commitment includes significant investment in Apple\u2019s R&D hubs across the country. This includes growing teams across the U.S. focused on areas including custom silicon, hardware engineering, software development, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.\n\nSupporting American Businesses with a New Manufacturing Academy in Detroit\n\nTo help companies transition to advanced manufacturing, Apple will open the Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit. Apple engineers, along with experts from top universities such as Michigan State, will consult with small- and medium-sized businesses on implementing AI and smart manufacturing techniques. The academy will also offer free in-person and online courses, with a skills development curriculum that teaches workers vital skills like project management and manufacturing process optimization. The courses will help drive productivity, efficiency, and quality in companies\u2019 supply chains.\n\nApple has long been committed to investing in education and skills development for American workers and students. That includes ongoing and expanding grant programs for organizations like 4-H, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and FIRST, which work closely with Apple in communities across the country to create free programming that helps young people learn vital skills like coding.\n\nApple\u2019s support for the next generation of innovators also includes efforts like the company\u2019s New Silicon Initiative, which prepares students for careers in hardware engineering and silicon chip design. Last year, this program expanded to students at Georgia Tech, and it now reaches students at eight schools across the country. Apple is continuing to expand the initiative, including a new collaboration with UCLA\u2019s Center for Education of Microchip Designers (CEMiD) beginning this year.\n\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro. Apple\u2019s six software platforms \u2014 iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS, and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud, and Apple TV+. Apple\u2019s more than 150,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth and to leaving the world better than we found it.\n\nPress Contacts\n\nNick Leahy\n\nApple\n\nnleahy@apple.com\n\nAnna Mitchell\n\nApple\n\nanna_m@apple.com\n\nApple Media Helpline\n\nmedia.help@apple.com",

The company also said data centers in Arizona, California, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon and Washington would see expansions from the investment plans.\n\nMonday's move is Apple's latest splashy announcement about investing in the United States, making it an acceleration of existing plans.\n\nThe company announced in 2021 that it was planning to invest $430 billion domestically over the next five years. In 2018, during Trump's first term, Apple said it would make a $350 billion \"contribution\" to the American economy over a stretch of five years, including the creation of 20,000 jobs.\n\nApple also confirmed Monday that an Arizona-based Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. facility, which began development under the Biden administration, had started producing chips for it there \u2014 news that media had previously reported.\n\nTrump sought to take credit for the latest announcement \u2014 and seemed to tip it last week shortly after meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook and implied the trade duties he has threatened on a host of imports played a role.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to be in the tariffs,\u201d Trump said last week, adding that Cook had halted plans to build two facilities in Mexico, an assertion Apple has not confirmed.\n\nIn a Truth Social post Monday, Trump cited \"faith in what we are doing\" as the reason for Apple's announcement.\n\nIn a note to investors, analysts at UBS cast some doubt about whether Apple can actually deploy $500 billion in the U.S. in the time frame it laid out, citing the company's overwhelming reliance on suppliers outside the U.S. and the fact that it has historically lagged other large tech firms in making large capital expenditures.\n\n\"While the headline figure on the surface is a large number, we believe it lacks substance at this juncture based on history,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nApple's playbook for avoiding tariffs appears to track closely with its strategy during the first Trump administration, when it allowed the president to take credit for a plant that had been making Mac computers in Texas for at least three years before he took office. Like other products Apple makes in the United States or says it intends to, the Mac made in Texas is not one of its mainstream models. Apple's key revenue-generating products like the iPhone are all still manufactured outside of the country.\n\nApple and Cook have also gone a step further in Trump's second term, both donating to Trump's inauguration fund. Cook attended Trump's swearing-in ceremony on Capitol Hill.\n\nApple said the new jobs it plans to hire for will be primarily related to research and development, engineering and AI.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nApple is accelerating its AI efforts as part of a four-year, $500-billion package of U.S.-based investments, the company said Monday .\n\nThe tech giant plans to build a 250,000-square-foot advanced server manufacturing facility in Houston, slated to open in 2026 in support of AI cloud computing goals tied to Apple Intelligence. Apple will also expand its data center capacity in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nThe investment plan includes funding to bolster in-demand skills. Apple plans to hire around 20,000 people, mostly focusing on silicon engineering, software development, AI and ML experts. It plans to expand an initiative to prepare students for careers in hardware engineering.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nApple\u2019s investment comes as the company continues to ramp up AI and generative AI efforts. Initially, the tech giant's public-facing approach was in stark contrast with a vendor-led race to embed the technology.\n\n\u201cOur M.O., if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work and not to get out in front of ourselves,\u201d CEO Tim Cook said of Apple\u2019s generative AI exploration during the company\u2019s Q1 2024 earnings call in February 2024.\n\nInternally, Apple developers and engineers were hard at work to bring the technology into the fold, identifying ways to boost computing capacity and train multimodal models. By October, the company released the first set of Apple Intelligence features.\n\n\u201cApple Intelligence is a breakthrough for privacy and AI with innovations like Private Cloud Compute, which extends the industry-leading security and privacy of Apple devices into the cloud,\u201d Cook said during Apple\u2019s Q1 2025 earnings call in January. Cook said enterprises, like SAP, are using the features to enhance employee and customer experiences.\n\nApple has been promoting Apple Intelligence on Mac computers. The strategy aims to boost adoption as enterprises refresh their hardware fleets.\n\n\u201cWith our latest advances in Apple Silicon and our fastest neural engine ever, customers are able to take advantage of the full capabilities of AI and Mac,\u201d Cook said in January. \u201cWe believe we've got the best AI PC out there for running workloads.\u201d\n\nApple is the fourth-largest enterprise PC vendor with a market share of nearly 10%, compared to Dell\u2019s 16%, HP\u2019s 21% and Lenovo\u2019s dominant 26% share, according to Gartner research.\n\nApple\u2019s AI investment announcement comes in the wake of similar funding plans across big tech, mostly geared at addressing compute capacity constraints.\n\nOpenAI, Oracle, Microsoft and other technology partners kicked off the new year with a $500 billion AI infrastructure push as part of a four-year effort called Stargate, President Donald Trump announced in January.\n\nAWS has sustained hefty levels of infrastructure investment to support AI and cloud. Cloud rival Google highlighted increased spending this year as it similarly expands AI and cloud capacity during an earnings call this month.\n\nAlibaba said it intends to spend at least 380 billion yuan ($52.4 billion) over the next three years to advance cloud computing and AI infrastructure. The investment, unveiled Monday, exceeds Alibaba\u2019s total AI and cloud spending over the past decade, the fourth-largest cloud provider by market share said.",

And others, too, a lot of chip makers coming in, a lot of automakers coming in.\u201d\n\nHowever, the investment builds on Apple\u2019s previous efforts to expand its supply chain outside of China in recent years, partly in response to production issues in China during the pandemic. Those investments include growing production for Mac Pro computers in Texas.\n\nTSMC, which makes chips for Apple, has also recently opened chipmaking plant in Arizona, helped by $6.6 billion in support from a bipartisan bill passed during the Biden administration to encourage investment in US chip manufacturing. However, Apple has mostly expanded production in places like India and Vietnam.\n\nStill, the US investment could help Apple avoid the cost of Trump\u2019s new tariffs. Although it will be a while before the new facilities are operational and the bulk of Apple\u2019s manufacturing will continue to occur overseas, the announcement could help the company curry favor with the president. And that could be useful if Apple seeks an exemption to the China tariffs, as it did during Trump\u2019s prior term.\n\n\u201cWe are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we\u2019re proud to build on our long-standing US investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country\u2019s future,\u201d said Cook in a statement from the company.\n\nTrump thanked Cook and Apple for the announcement in an all-caps post on Truth Social early Monday, in which he took credit for the decision.\n\n\u201cThe reason, faith in what we are doing, without witch (sic), they wouldn\u2019t be investing ten cents,\u201d he said.\n\nWhite House trade counselor Peter Navarro wouldn\u2019t rule out a tariff exemption for Apple on iPhone and other electronics imports from China, when asked by CNN on Monday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s always President Trump\u2019s decision,\u201d he said in an appearance on CNN News Central. Asked if he would support such an exemption, he refused to voice an opinion.\n\n\u201cI always let the boss do his thing,\u201d he said.\n\nNavarro defended the administration\u2019s imposition of new tariffs and threats of additional tariffs since taking office, and he echoed Trump\u2019s claim that the tariffs are the reason why Apple agreed to make the US investment in the first place.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just going to see hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars now across different industries and sectors coming into this country, investing here instead of Tim Cook going to China like he\u2019s had too much of a penchant to do for far too long,\u201d he said.\n\nApple\u2019s US investment won\u2019t directly circumvent the China tariffs, said Angelo Zino, equity analyst at CFRA research. But \u201cwe think it will at least put the company in the good graces of the new administration should exemptions be on the table,\u201d Zino said in emailed commentary following the Monday announcement.\n\nThe investment\n\nApple doesn\u2019t do much of its own manufacturing, largely using contractors instead. The company said it will work with thousands of manufacturing partners spread across all 50 states to produce more products in US facilities.\n\nThat includes a new server production facility in Houston that it said will support Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s brand of artificial intelligence products. Apple said the 250,000-square-foot server manufacturing facility, slated to open in 2026, will create thousands of jobs. The servers, previously manufactured outside of the United States, are a core to its artificial intelligence efforts, the company said.\n\n\u201cThe servers bring together years of R&D by Apple engineers,\u201d it said in its statement.\n\nApple said part of the investment will create an academy in Detroit to train small- and medium-sized businesses on implementing AI and smart manufacturing techniques. And the company will double its investment in its US Advanced Manufacturing Fund to $10 billion to promote \u201cadvanced manufacturing and skills development throughout the country.\u201d\n\nIt will also expand data center capacity in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona and Nevada, and plans to invest in corporate facilities and production of Apple TV+ shows in 20 states.\n\nAt least some of these efforts were likely underway prior to Monday. And the announcement echoes similar promises Apple made during the two previous administrations.\n\nIn 2021, weeks after Biden\u2019s inauguration, Apple said it would invest $430 billion in the United States over five years and create 20,000 new jobs, including construction of a new campus in North Carolina, which has reportedly been paused. And in January 2018, Apple said it would invest $350 billion in the United States over five years and create 20,000 jobs, including by growing US data center capacity.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a question about whether any of the promised investment dollars or new jobs announced Monday had also been included in prior announcements.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting and context.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nApple Inc. on Monday said it will commit $500 billion to U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, marking the largest-ever investment by the tech giant as the Trump administration looks to onshore factory jobs.\n\nAs part of the commitment, Apple and its partners will open a new facility in Houston by 2026 that makes servers for its artificial intelligence system, according to a release.\n\nThe company also plans to double its U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund to $10 billion, create a training academy in Detroit for upskilling workers and grow its investments in research and development. The fund was created in 2017 to support advanced manufacturing and skills development across the country.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe blockbuster commitment \u2014 which includes creating 20,000 jobs \u2014 comes as Apple and other Silicon Valley companies look to avoid tariffs on tech-related imports from China and other countries.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company has made similar investments over the years. In 2021, Apple said it would invest $430 billion in the U.S. to accelerate silicon engineering and 5G technology. In 2018, the company also said it would make a $350 billion contribution to U.S. manufacturing, including the creation of 20,000 jobs over the next five years.\n\n\u201cWe are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we\u2019re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments,\u201d CEO Tim Cook said in a statement Monday.\n\nApple\u2019s latest move is expected to support initiatives related to AI, silicon engineering and skills development for students and workers nationwide.\n\nAs part of the pledge, the iPhone maker said it plans to open a 250,000-square-foot facility in Houston next year that produces energy-efficient servers for its Apple Intelligence and Private Cloud Compute systems. As AI systems roll out, Apple said it plans to continue expanding data center capacity in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nApple is also expanding its advanced manufacturing fund, which includes a multi-billion-dollar commitment to produce silicon in a TSMC facility in Arizona. Apple is the facility\u2019s top customer and mass production of the company\u2019s chips began last month, the company said. To date, the fund has supported projects in 13 states, including Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Texas and Indiana.\n\nIn addition to the Houston facility, Apple said it will open a manufacturing academy in Detroit to help small and mid-sized companies implement AI and smart manufacturing techniques in their operations.\n\nCurrently, Apple supports more than 2.9 million jobs across the country, including direct employment and work with suppliers, manufacturers and app developers, according to a release.\n\nLast week, President Donald Trump signaled a move from Apple was coming at a recent meeting with U.S. governors, saying that Cook has stopped \u201ctwo plants in Mexico\u201d and will build products domestically, Bloomberg reported Friday.\n\nApple has not yet confirmed publicly whether production would be shifting from Mexico to the U.S. and did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Trump touted the investment as a win for his administration through his social media account on Truth: \u201cTHE REASON, FAITH IN WHAT WE ARE DOING, WITHOUT WHICH, THEY WOULD\u2019NT BE INVESTING TEN CENTS. THANK YOU TIM COOK AND APPLE!!!\u201d",

Trump noted the company was doing so to avoid paying tariffs.\n\nThat pledge, coupled with Monday\u2019s investment commitment, came as Trump continues to threaten to impose tariffs that could drive up the cost of iPhones made in China.\n\n\u201cWe are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we\u2019re proud to build on our long-standing US investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country\u2019s future,\u201d Cook said in a company blog post.\n\nThat $500bn includes everything from purchases from US suppliers for products like glass for its iPhones to US filming of television shows and movies for its Apple TV+ service. The company declined to say how much of the figure it was already planning to spend with its US supply base.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe announcement is similar to one Apple made in early 2018 \u2013 during the first Trump administration \u2013 which promised to create 20,000 new jobs as part of a $350bn spend in the US. Trump was also mulling a tariff then that could have affected iPhones at the time, but he did not end up targeting those devices during his first administration.\n\n\u201cThis [latest] pledge represents a political gesture towards the Trump administration,\u201d said Gil Luria, analyst at financial services adviser DA Davidson, who estimated that Apple has already committed to spending more than $150bn per year in the US, including the cost of goods sold and capital expenditure.\n\n\u201cEven without growing that spend very much, they would only need three to four years to meet their obligation\u201d, Luria said.\n\nApple also said an under-construction new factory in Houston, Texas \u2013 slated to open in 2026 \u2013 will produce servers to power Apple Intelligence, its suite of AI features that help draft emails and perform other tasks. The company claims this factory will create \u201cthousands of jobs\u201d.\n\nApple said it will work with Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, to build the Houston facility where it will assemble servers that go into data centres to power Apple Intelligence. Those servers are currently made outside of the US.",

Chairman and Co-founder Joe Tsai confirmed this during a panel at the World Governments Summit 2025 in Dubai. Bloomberg\n\nApple AAPL.O is dropping its most advanced, end-to-end security encryption feature for cloud data in the UK, the company said on Friday, an unprecedented move after reports that the government demanded a way to access user data.\n\nAdvanced Data Protection, an optional feature that extends end-to-end encryption to a wide range of user data, is no longer available in the UK for new users and current UK users will eventually need to disable this security feature, Apple said.\n\nGovernments and tech giants have long been locked in a battle over encryption, but such a demand from Britain would be particularly sweeping. Security officials argue that encryption hinders criminal investigations, while tech firms defend it as essential to user privacy.\n\nThe loss of end-to-end encryption for iCloud backup means Apple would be able in some instances to read user data such as iMessages that would otherwise be protected and pass it on to authorities if legally compelled. In contrast, if a user has end-to-end encryption, Apple cannot read the data under any circumstances.\n\nData that was encrypted before Apple offered its protection service in December 2022, such as health data, passwords and iMessage and FaceTime messaging services, will remain encrypted, Apple said.\n\nMore Apple news: Apple to launch new lower-cost iPhone to capture a broader market\n\nLaw enforcement agencies have frequently targeted those services through iCloud backups, which were not end-to-end encrypted before Apple offered Advanced Data Protection. Those backups \u2014 which can contain photos and other sensitive information and are widely used \u2014 can no longer be end-to-end encrypted for UK users, Apple said.\n\nBecause Apple does not possess the encryption keys of existing users of its data protection service in the UK, Apple said it will not be able to turn off the features for those users. Apple said it will offer those users a chance to turn it off themselves.\n\nA spokesperson for Britain's Home Office declined to comment on whether such an order had been issued. \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nApple said it \"was gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy.\"\n\nApple shares were largely unchanged on Friday late morning.\n\nApple has long resisted government efforts to weaken encryption, including in 2016 when U.S. authorities tried to compel it to unlock the iPhone of a San Bernardino shooter.\n\nThe company reiterated on Friday that it would \"never build a backdoor into its technology.\"\n\nOther tech firms have grappled with global encryption laws. Messaging platform Signal has previously threatened to leave the UK over similar concerns, while Meta Platforms META.O has faced pushback over its plans to expand encryption on WhatsApp.\n\nAdditional reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa And Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Peter Henderson",

Following the keynote announcement of Apple Intelligence at WWDC 2024, software exec Craig Federighi confirmed rumors of an Apple and Google partnership, saying, \"We\u2019re looking forward to doing integrations with other models, including Google Gemini, for instance, in the future.\"\n\nOf course, this came after Apple had announced a partnership with OpenAI, bringing ChatGPT to Apple Intelligence as a third-party option to use with Siri and other AI features. However, Federighi made it clear that Apple wanted to allow users to choose from multiple models. At the time, Federighi didn't share any specifics on a timeline, but this leak shows us that the Google Gemini integration is coming soon.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

Users were frustrated with the staggered (and delayed) rollout, underwhelmed by gimmicky features, and annoyed by AI-generated summaries that are sometimes inaccurate. Plus, users are still waiting for the alleged new and improved Siri which is slated for the upcoming iOS 18.4 release.\n\nBy comparison, Samsung has been quicker and more aggressive in deploying AI features for its Galaxy series and already has Google Gemini integration. It's unclear how Apple will plan to integrate Gemini, but it would be a way to catch up to its competitors and cover some of its shortcomings in the voice assistant department.\n\nOn that note, Apple is reportedly working on its own LLM for iOS 19 and macOS 16, which will likely be announced at this year's WWDC.",

            "content": "In a strategic shift, Apple Inc. AAPL has unveiled its latest product, the iPhone 16e, marking its exit from the budget smartphone market.\n\nBloomberg columnist Mark Gurman in his latest weekly \"Power On\" has shared that Apple\u2019s new iPhone 16e, priced at $599, is $170 more expensive than its predecessor, the iPhone SE.\n\nThis price hike places the iPhone 16e in a different segment, leaving the budget smartphone market to rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co., Alphabet Inc.\u2018s Google, and Chinese manufacturers.\n\nDespite lacking some features of the regular iPhone 16, the iPhone 16e offers most of the flagship lineup\u2019s features for $200 less.\n\nAlso Read: Apple and Meta in Race To Develop AI-Powered Humanoid Robots\n\nThe decision to increase the price of its low-end iPhone comes as Apple\u2019s China revenue declined by 11% and total iPhone sales fell about 1% during the holiday quarter.\n\nThis suggests that Apple is prioritizing profit margins over higher unit sales.\n\nApple\u2019s new pricing strategy could potentially impede its customer base expansion in emerging markets like India. However, the company may continue to sell older models in certain markets through carriers without advertising them on its website, a tactic Apple has used in the past.\n\nAlong with the iPhone 16e, Apple is also gearing up to launch the M4 MacBook Air and has confirmed that Apple Intelligence is coming to the Vision Pro.\n\nRead Next\n\nApple's Revamped iPhone SE To Kickstart Pivotal Year Amid Challenges\n\nImage: Shutterstock",

            "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 16e debut was surprising for two reasons: First, the company shifted away from the \u201cSE\u201d branding after nearly a decade. Then it priced the budget phone higher than expected at $599 \u2014 a notable jump from the $429 iPhone SE.\n\nThe iPhone 16e, which launches on February 28, is Apple\u2019s latest effort to diversify its iPhone lineup and prove the company\u2019s 18-year-old signature product can still appeal to new audiences. The iPhone is the driving factor behind Apple\u2019s nearly $4 trillion market cap, generating $69.1 billion of the $124.3 billion in revenue Apple reported for its first fiscal quarter of 2025.\n\nThe launch comes after Apple\u2019s previous budget phones have seen mixed success.\n\nData from market research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners suggests the iPhone SE only accounted for 5% of US iPhone sales for the quarter ending on December 31, 2024. Globally, the iPhone SE only made up 1% of Apple\u2019s iPhone sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research. The iPhone Mini, a smaller and less expensive model launched in 2020, was cut from the iPhone family after just two generations.\n\nThe higher price of the iPhone 16e raises questions about whether it would appeal to budget-minded shoppers. But despite the cost, the new budget smartphone could draw in more consumers, mostly because Apple is seemingly following a successful strategy from roughly seven years ago with the iPhone XR.\n\nApple is taking a different direction with the iPhone 16e\n\nThe iPhone 16e has largely been perceived as an iPhone SE replacement. It launched during the same timeframe Apple has historically introduced new SE models, and the company removed the iPhone SE from its online store after the announcement.\n\nBut the iPhone 16e is more like a successor to the iPhone XR, which was introduced in 2018 alongside the iPhone XS for those who wanted a more affordable device with many of the same qualities. With the iPhone XR and now the iPhone 16e, Apple prioritized screen size, battery life and performance, instead compromised on camera hardware to cut costs.\n\nThat strategy seemingly paid off with the iPhone XR. It was the best-selling phone globally in the third quarter of 2019, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nApple didn\u2019t release a new version of the iPhone XR in 2019. But its next-generation iPhone at the time, the iPhone 11, took a lot of cues from the XR in terms of design and pricing.\n\nAn iPhone SE next to an iPhone 12 Mini in March 2022. Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nAlthough the iPhone 16e isn\u2019t on sale yet, some analysts believe it could be more popular than the iPhone SE. That\u2019s partially because of its larger screen, says Gerrit Schneemann, a senior analyst in Counterpoint Research\u2019s smartphone division. The iPhone 16e has a 6.1-inch display, the same size as the iPhone 16, while the iPhone SE had a 4.7-inch screen.\n\n\u201c(Apple is) giving up on that kind of smaller form factor and realizing that people are interested in a larger display,\u201d Schneemann said to CNN. \u201cEven if it means discarding the $400 entry price.\u201d\n\nBefore the iPhone 16e reveal, Ming-Chi Kuo, a TF International Securities analyst known for being tapped into Apple\u2019s supply chain, predicted that Apple\u2019s next budget phone would sell \u201cslightly better\u201d than the previous iPhone SE.\n\nBut there are reasons to be skeptical. At $599, the iPhone 16e still commands a high barrier to entry, especially compared to the price of some Android phones. And there\u2019s the question of whether the iPhone 16e may detract from iPhone 16 sales, as Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to investors on February 19.\n\n\u201cThey have to be really careful to offer enough in this device that it is worth $600 to a buyer, but not offer so much that someone that would spend $1,300 or even $1,000 picks it over that,\u201d Daniel Newman, CEO of the technology research firm The Futurum Group, told CNN.\n\nWhy the iPhone 16e is important for Apple\n\nMultiple iPhone 16e phones with the new C1 cellular modem are stress tested at an Apple lab in Sunnyvale, California, on February 18, 2025. Stephen Nellis/Reuters\n\nApple\u2019s flagship iPhones usually steal the spotlight, and for good reason. The more expensive Pro and Pro Max models tend to be the most popular globally, according to data from market research firm Kantar, a trend that likely keeps Wall Street happy by boosting the iPhone\u2019s average selling price.\n\nBut the iPhone 16e could help Apple tap into an audience that may otherwise opt for an older secondhand iPhone or an Android phone. It could also help Apple better compete in the Chinese market, where it faces heightened rivalry from regional brands like Huawei and Xiaomi.\n\nBut perhaps most importantly, the iPhone 16e could be critical in popularizing Apple\u2019s technologies and apps, especially as it seeks to grow its services business to reduce its reliance on iPhone revenue. Putting Apple Intelligence in the iPhone 16e means that even those who don\u2019t want to pay $800 or more for a new phone can access Apple\u2019s AI tools. And getting Apple Intelligence in the hands of more consumers is crucial for the iPhone maker as Google, Microsoft, Samsung and other rivals are going all-in on AI.\n\n\u201cApple really needs to win,\u201d Newman said, referring to winning over Android fans and budget phone shoppers. \u201c\u2026Its whole AI strategy and its intelligence strategy and its app strategy for the future is really where I think its biggest growth opportunity comes.\u201d",

Look no further than our Apple Watch spring 2025 shopping guide as we take you through every option, key differences, and buying tips.\n\nBuyer\u2019s note: Shop Apple on Amazon for discounted prices that you can\u2019t find directly from Apple.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 is the newest Apple Watch. It features a larger display and the thinnest design yet. If you\u2019re shopping for an Apple Watch, chances are this is what you\u2019re after. Priced from $399, Apple Watch Series 10 includes the full suite of health and fitness features:\n\nECG app with heart health monitoring\n\nSleep tracking with sleep apnea notifications\n\nTemperature sensing for the new Vitals app and advanced cycle tracking\n\nDepth gauge to 6 meters and water temperature sensing\n\nThe larger displays come in 42mm and 46mm case sizes, and these displays are 40% brighter when viewing from angles. They can even drop down from 2000 nits peak brightness to just 1 nit in low light environments. The best part? A few watch faces can even show the seconds updating in always-on mode. Fast charging delivers 80% battery in just 30 minutes, and low power mode extends usage from 18 hours to 36 hours.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 also offers the most variety in material and color options. Aluminum comes in jet black, rose gold, and silver; titanium comes in slate, gold, and natural. Go for the cellular + GPS model if you want the ability to use phone, messaging, and streaming audio without an iPhone nearby.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 review\n\nFor those who want the most battery life, there\u2019s Apple Watch Ultra 2. Apple introduced this model in September 2023 and didn\u2019t change the hardware in 2024. Instead, Apple added a beautiful space black titanium option to the natural titanium version in the lineup.\n\nSo how much battery life are we talking? How about double? Apple Watch Ultra offers up to 36 hours in mixed use compared to 18 hours on Series 10 and SE 2. Low power mode extends that to up to 72 hours. The trade-off? Ultra 2 is also the thickest Apple Watch, which can be appealing for fans of rugged watches, and fast charging to 80% takes twice as long as Series 10 (1 hour versus 30 minutes).\n\nUltra 2 is especially made for enduring extreme workouts. It has a 49mm case height with the brightest display (3000 nits versus 2000 nits on Series 10). Ultra 2 also features a built-in Siren function, an Action Button for jumping into specific tasks like starting a workout, and support for high-speed water sports and recreational scuba diving to 40 meters.\n\nEvery Apple Watch Ultra 2 comes in one size of titanium with built-in cellular for $799. The optional decision to make is which color and which band configuration.\n\nHands-on with the new Apple Watch Ultra 2 color\n\nApple Watch SE 2, or Apple Watch SE (second-generation), is typically presented as simply Apple Watch SE. Introduced in September 2022, SE 2 is the most affordable Apple Watch in the lineup.\n\nWith a $249 starting price, Apple Watch SE 2 is generally defined by which features it lacks. For example, SE 2 doesn\u2019t have an always-on display, ECG (electrocardiogram), temperature sensing, or sleep apnea notifications.\n\nThe display on SE 2 is the least bright, maxing out at 1000 nits, compared to 2000 nits (Series 10) and 3000 nits (Ultra 2). The screen is also smaller with 40mm and 44mm options.\n\nHowever, Apple Watch SE 2 is a great product for customers trying their first smartwatch. Useful features include notifications, Apple Pay, workout tracking, and more. Apple Watch SE 2 also features heart health tracking, fall and crash detection.\n\nOther models\n\nWhile the current lineup consists of Series 10, Ultra 2, and SE 2, some previous models are still around. Apple, Amazon, and Best Buy each have refurbished models of older generations for a discount.\n\nwatchOS 11, the software that runs on Apple Watch, works with these models:\n\nFor the best experience, it is highly recommended to stay away from models not listed. In terms of future proofing, the processors inside Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2 are the fastest currently.",

Those unfortunately didn\u2019t stick around for very long before units began to sell out there too, but some of them are now back. While the entry-level 13-inch models are still mostly out of stock at Amazon, it has conjured up some 15-inch models in all colorways with 16GB of RAM and they are now back down at $1,099 shipped.

That means you\u2019re effectively getting a configuration that was $1,499 not more than 5 months ago at $1,099.\n\nWhile there is more than a good chance we see Apple update the MacBook Air lineup with the newer M4 chip this year, perhaps in the spring, considering how popular the now previous-gen models have been among 9to5Toys readers and the dwindling stock on units at Apple Stores, we though it pertinent to ensure these deals were front and center for folks.\n\nHere\u2019s how pricing shakes out across the lineup right now \u2013 some offers are live at Amazon, some at Best Buy:\n\nApple M3 MacBook Air features:\n\nLEAN.

Gibson claimed her wellness treatments cured her terminal brain cancer, a brazen and consequential lie that risked the lives of her followers.\n\nAs a two-time breast cancer survivor, I know cancer treatments are not for the fainthearted or noncompliant. But they have kept me \u2014 and millions of others \u2014 alive. Meanwhile, research shows patients who reject or delay the advice of their doctors are much more likely to die.\n\nToday, after an ordeal including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, I am 10 months cancer-free. And free, also, to binge this drama, enraged by the premise.\n\nIn the warped world inhabited by so-called wellness warriors, a strong person rejects conformity, and a weak person passively complies with the medical establishment.\n\nIn the warped world inhabited by so-called wellness warriors, a strong person rejects conformity, and a weak person passively complies with the medical establishment. This argument distorts the global medical community, twisting \u201cthe establishment\u201d into a nefarious moneymaking conspiracy. But while Big Pharma does rake in billions, cancer treatment is not a scam. And influencers who try to lure vulnerable people away from established science are toxic, in every sense of the word. Just as we have seen with Covid deniers and vaccine skeptics, disinformation can kill.\n\nI could not watch any movie, series, program or TEDx talk on cancer while I was in the middle of my own treatments and recovery. There was nothing entertaining about the stories, or the characters \u2014 too many of whom died. I just knew I didn\u2019t want to be like them.\n\nWhen I was first diagnosed with Stage 1 breast cancer in 2006, I eagerly did everything my surgeon and oncologist told me to do. I got the lumpectomy. I submitted to the prescribed brachytherapy (internal seed radiation) twice daily for one week and many years of Tamoxifen, a hormone-blocking medication with uncomfortable and inconvenient side effects.\n\nI wanted to live. And I trusted my doctors and medical team wanted me to live as much as I did.\n\nA single mom with sole custody of three sons, then 13, 16 and 18, I wanted to see them all through high school, college, weddings, my grandchildren and my eventual retirement.\n\nAlmost two decades later, in June 2023, a second breast cancer identified as triple-negative, invasive, aggressive Stage 3 showed up on my ultrasound. The three tumors measured 7 centimeters all together. Once again, I did absolutely everything my oncologist, surgeon and cardiologist ordered \u2014 including eliminating alcohol after reading about the link between drinking and cancer. I also gave up diet soda at the suggestion of my oncologist. Why not?\n\nBecause the truth is that cancer is scary. And highly motivating. The other main protagonist in \u201cApple Cider Vinegar\u201d is Milla Blake, a character who seems at least partly inspired by a real woman named Jessica Ainscough. Diagnosed with a rare cancer in her early 20s, Ainscough eventually stopped chemo and adopted an intense (and unproven) regimen of juices and coffee enemas. I deeply empathized with her honesty, vulnerability and courage as she searched for answers. She was aiming to fight for herself, not build a wellness empire based on lies.\n\nBut Ainscough also reportedly convinced her mother to forgo doctor recommendations and try the alternative therapy route. Her mother died from breast cancer in 2013. Ainscough would succumb to her own cancer a few years later. A tragedy layered on top of a tragedy.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that in 2022, the latest year numbers are available, over 600,000 people in the United States died from cancer. There are 18 million people with a history of cancer who are still alive, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nSurvival rates vary by cancer type, diagnosis timeline and various other personal variants. But the overall five-year survival rate for breast cancer in women is 90% \u2014 if those women follow the recommended surgery, chemotherapy and radiation protocol.\n\nOn the other hand, the Mayo Clinic notes that alternative treatments may be able to help with some symptoms, but they are not cures. If they were, doctors would use them.\n\nMichele Weldon rings a bell signifying the end of her cancer treatment. Courtesy Michele Weldon\n\nAs accurately presented in the series by screenwriter Samantha Strauss, chemotherapy is almost intolerable; my own treatments were cut short and surgery for a radical mastectomy moved up more than three months because my system could not handle the stress.\n\nI also went completely bald, just as the character Lucy did in the series. I wore a wig for a bit, until my hair began to grow back months after radiation ended. Chemo gave me mouth sores and made everything taste like gasoline; I ultimately lost more than 30 pounds.\n\nAnd still, I listened to the experts. Any anger I felt was directed at my cancer, not at my doctors. Unlike in most every other aspect of my professional and personal life, when dealing with cancer, I was completely obedient.\n\nA number of my friends have had their own cancer experiences, and I adamantly advise them to do everything their doctors and nurses recommend. I darkly joke that I spent my 30s sending flowers to my friends in hospitals having babies; in my 60s, I send flowers to my friends in hospitals having surgeries.\n\nUltimately, the tragedies presented in \u201cApple Cider Vinegar\u201d are real. But there is nothing inherently weak about following the science. And nothing inherently brave about ignoring it.",

            "content": "Even though Presidents Day deals have now come to an end, we're coming across plenty of superb offers in the tech space. For instance, the Apple Mac Mini M4 has received an unexpected fall in price -- considering it's only been on the market since November -- with Amazon now reducing the desktop to $549. This is a $50 savings that takes the PC close to its record low of $529.\n\nThis is an easy recommendation as the Mac Mini is found on CNET's best desktop computers with the model being our go-to for the best cheap desktop alternative to a MacBook or iMac. The 2024 PC comes with a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU, 16GB of unified memory as well a 256GB solid-state drive for storage.\n\nNeed more storage? The 512GB model is down to $719. That's a 10% price cut representing a saving of $80 -- and again is only $20 away from the cheapest cost we've ever seen at Amazon. Better yet, the 512GB model with 24GB unified memory is now at its lowest-ever price of $919, thanks to an $80 discount. There are plenty of options to suit your needs.\n\nHey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.\n\n\"The Mini can fit in your hand and be everything from an everyday home office computer to a full-on professional content-creation machine -- and an easily portable one at that -- with support for up to three 6K-resolution displays,\" wrote CNET managing editor Joshua Goldman in their review.\n\n\"True, there's a sizable price difference between the M4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini, but even the $799 M4 model I tested is strong enough for media creation as well as Apple Intelligence, the company's suite of AI features.\"\n\nWhy this deal matters\n\nApple discounts are rare, so whenever one like this materializes, it's always worth considering. This one in particular drops the base model M4 Mac Mini desktop to only $20 away from its lowest-ever price. While $50 doesn't seem like a lot on the surface, the new computer just launched in November last year, so it's a nice savings if you want an upgrade.\n\nWant to check out the competition?

            "content": "You\u2019ll often hear people complain that Apple\u2019s \u201cluxury gadgets\u201d are too expensive for them. If they\u2019re talking about a $1,599 iPhone 16 Pro Max or a $2,299 iPad Pro, then this point of view is understandable. But strictly speaking, even the most expensive of Apple\u2019s Pro devices are premium products, not luxury. There\u2019s a big difference.\n\nWant to see a real luxury product? How about an $8,900 Gucci jacket. Or a $10,000 Dior bag. Or a $17,000 Apple Watch. Real luxury is about exclusivity and as much about the number of people who don\u2019t buy your product. But with more than 200 million iPhones sold per year, the luxury niche tag is simply no longer applicable to Apple.\n\nTake the new $599 iPhone 16e. It\u2019s a solid but spartanly equipped smartphone with an older design and only one camera (which doesn\u2019t offer a real optical zoom, no matter how often Apple claims this). The 16e is not a luxury product. It\u2019s part of a growing group of Apple devices that are meant to appeal to a mass market looking for a good-looking product at a decent price. It\u2019s J. Crew, not Cartier.\n\nOf all Apple\u2019s products, only a handful\u2014the iPad Pro, Mac Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2014can truly be described as premium. In addition to Apple\u2019s brand image and good design, the iPhone Pro and iPad Pro offer exceptional performance and ease of use. And the video professional or app developer who spends big on a Mac Pro can be sure they will get high stability and first-class hardware in return. But it\u2019s hard to find luxury in a product that essentially offers the same experience as one costing thousands less.\n\nThe iPad Pro and Mac Pro are some of the few premium products Apple still makes. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry\n\nIs Apple still a premium manufacturer?\n\nApple launches more and more affordable products every year. Although these are first-class products, they are aimed more at the mass market and are significantly cheaper than other Apple products.\n\nThe M4 Mac mini is often available for under its $599/\u00a3599 MSRP. Even at full price, this is an excellent deal, but despite its many strengths, this is hardly a premium computer.\n\nThe Apple Watch SE isn\u2019t a luxury smartwatch, nor can it even be described as premium compared to the Apple Watch Series 10. But you can pick one up for as little as $199/\u00a3189. It\u2019s primarily intended for younger family members who are joining the Apple world at an early age.\n\nA colorful HomePod mini is available for just $99, $250 less than the classic HomePod. This cute smart speaker has its charms even if audio quality is relatively weak at the bass end.\n\nThe current Apple TV delivers a first-class home cinema experience, voice control, and intuitive remote control for $129.\n\nAirPods 4 offer AirPods Pro-level sound quality with ANC for $179.\n\nAt $349 (and often on sale), the 10th-gen iPad is clearly targeted at budget buyers. It costs nearly a thousand dollars less than the 13-inch iPad Pro.\n\nApple had to make a decision years ago. Should it remain a pure premium manufacturer, a kind of Porsche among consumer tech manufacturers, by offering only the best to people willing to pay for it? This would have been risky because it would mean the survival of the company hangs on the success of a very small number of high-priced products. (As an illustration of these risks, mistakes in product development are currently causing the aforementioned German sports car manufacturer serious difficulties.) So Apple chose a different path.\n\nThe iPhone 16e is another product aimed at a mass market, not a luxury one. Foundry\n\nLess luxury, more shipments\n\nApple has evidently decided to become a mass manufacturer offering a wide range of products catering to all income brackets. Premium devices such as the iPhone 16 Pro Max may deliver the biggest profit margin, but less profitable devices such as the iPhone 16e ensure a large number of users. This in turn leads to strong revenue through services such as iCloud+, AppleCare+, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and, last but not least, the App Store. Even growth regions such as India cannot be conquered with premium devices alone.\n\nA broad customer base brings another benefit: economies of scale. The larger the turnover, the higher the number of shipments, the more advantages you gain in areas such as development and marketing. It makes little economic sense to develop your own iPhone CPUs and operating systems for a few customers. But if you sell 230 million smartphones a year, you can negotiate completely different conditions with companies like TSMC.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that this strategic shift will have consequences: Apple could find that the premium portion of its brand diminishes in the coming years as people choose value over premium. But I would bet Apple will be just fine with that.",

While several schools had 1:1 programs, the iPad (and its $499 price point) kickstarted the mobility revolution. The iPad was a hit with students and teachers alike, but managing iPads at scale was, to put it mildly, a logistical nightmare for IT teams.\n\nSome of my favorite gear Abode Home Security System Abode is the best home security system and includes compatibility with HomeKit.\n\nAbout Apple @ Work: Bradley Chambers managed an enterprise IT network from 2009 to 2021. Through his experience deploying and managing firewalls, switches, a mobile device management system, enterprise grade Wi-Fi, 1000s of Macs, and 1000s of iPads, Bradley will highlight ways in which Apple IT managers deploy Apple devices, build networks to support them, train users, stories from the trenches of IT management, and ways Apple could improve its products for IT departments.\n\nApple\u2019s device management infrastructure was at the heart of this early chaos. In some ways, Apple didn\u2019t know what to build until they saw how the devices would be used. Until then, the iPhone was growing, but it was still in its early days. The App Store was still an infant as well. In 2011, Apple introduced the Volume Purchase Program (VPP) to help schools purchase and distribute apps in bulk. On paper (pun intended), it sounded like a game-changer. In practice, it was only scalable for smaller deployments.\n\nThe process for installing apps was clunky, requiring IT teams to distribute codes from a spreadsheet to load them onto devices. You could technically buy one copy of an app from iTunes and load it on hundreds of devices. Yes, we we were syncing devices through iTunes in bulk. Yes, it\u2019s as painful as it sounds. Upgrading iOS was an absolute nightmare and took days, if not weeks. Remember, at the time, there were no over-the-air updates.\n\nApple took another step forward in 2012 with the release of Apple Configurator. This macOS app allowed IT administrators to configure multiple iPads simultaneously, streamlining tasks like installing apps, setting restrictions, and managing profiles. We were still buying apps in bulk from the VPP store, but then you\u2019d take the first code to redeem the app from iTunes and then load the app and the spreadsheet into Apple Configurator. Yes, it\u2019s as clunky as it sounds. In fact, I had to file numerous support tickets as some of the purchases marked the first code as redeemed so that it couldn\u2019t be used.\n\nSome of my favorite gear Aqara Smart Lock U50 Upgrade your doors with Apple Home Key and the Aqara U50.\n\nWhile it wasn\u2019t an ideal solution for large-scale deployments compared to what we have today, Apple Configurator was a lifeline for smaller schools or one-off configurations. It was much faster to setup devices in bulk compared to the iTunes approach.\n\nThe next steps\n\nThis time period is when Apple had a decision to make: rebuild everything for a world where everyone is using an Apple device at all times or continue on the current path. Recognizing the need for a stronger solution, Apple spent the next several years improving its approach to device management from the ground up. In 2014, they introduced the Device Enrollment Program (DEP), a major foundational step forward. DEP allowed schools and businesses to automate the setup of iPads and Macs, ensuring they were enrolled in a device management solution straight out of the box based on the serial number.\n\nOver the next few years, Apple beefed up its enterprise tools with some low-hanging fruit, such as Managed \u2018Open In,\u2019 new macOS device management commands, User Enrollment, and expanded configuration profile settings.\n\nBy 2018, Apple had really defined its vision for device management with the launch of Apple School Manager and Apple Business Manager. This platform unified the features of VPP and DEP, creating a single interface that made managing devices, apps, and Apple IDs much simpler. It also tackled a significant pain point for IT teams: licensing. Apple School Manager let administrators assign, revoke, and reassign app licenses over the air based on the devices, solving the headaches that came with VPP\u2019s early implementation. Early OTA app licenses were tied to Apple/iTunes IDs, which were difficult to create in bulk for students/teachers/employees. There were no Managed Apple Accounts at this time.\n\nSome of my favorite gear eufyCam 2C Upgrade your home security with wireless cameras that includes HomeKit compatibility.\n\nZero touch and beyond\n\nBy the decade\u2019s end, Apple had overhauled entirely its device management tools in flight. What had once been a major frustration for IT teams became an efficient and reliable system. Apple School Manager\u2014and its counterpart, Apple Business Manager\u2014grew into absolutely critical platforms for managing devices in schools and in the enterprise.\n\nZero-touch deployments were straightforward to configure and roll out. While there was some technical debt around the underlying code (that Apple largely addressed with Declarative Device Management), all of the known problems were solved. At this time, I told countless people that all of the \u201chacks\u201d around managing and deploying Apple devices at scale had largely been solved. There was a known best path for everything.\n\nYou have to give Apple\u2019s enterprise product and engineering teams a lot of credit for every iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and Mac sold today. Without the really tedious work they did in the 2010s, Apple\u2019s enterprise revenue growth wouldn\u2019t have been possible.\n\nApple @ Work is exclusively brought to you by Mosyle, the only Apple Unified Platform.

            "content": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Apple said Friday it will stop offering an advanced data security option for British users after the government reportedly demanded that the company provide backdoor access for any data those users have stored in the cloud.\n\nThe iPhone maker said its Advanced Data Protection encryption feature is no longer available for new users in the United Kingdom and will eventually be disabled for existing users.\n\nAdvanced Data Protection, which Apple started rolling out at the end of 2022, is an opt-in feature that protects iCloud files, photos, notes and other data with end-to-end encryption when they\u2019re stored in the cloud.\n\nBritish security officials demanded in a secret order that the U.S. tech giant create so-called backdoor access so that they could view fully encrypted material, The Washington Post reported earlier this month, citing anonymous sources.\n\nApple \u201ccan no longer offer Advanced Data Protection\u201d in the U.K., the company said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy,\u201d Apple said, without referring to the government demand.\n\nThe Washington Post report said the British government served Apple with what\u2019s known as a \u201ctechnical capability notice\u201d ordering it to provide the access under a sweeping law called the Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which has been dubbed the snoopers\u2019 charter.\n\nThe law officially gives British spies the ability to hack into devices and harvest vast amounts of bulk online data, much of it from outside the U.K. It contains provisions to compel companies to remove encryption to allow for electronic eavesdropping, while making it a criminal offense to reveal that the government has issued such demands.\n\n\u201cWe do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices,\u201d the U.K. Home Office said in a brief statement.\n\nApple did not reveal how many users in Britain have been using Advanced Data Protection. It said the feature would still be available to users in the rest of the world.\n\nSome types of data will still be end-to-end encrypted in the U.K. by default, Apple said, including passwords on the iCloud Keychain, information on the Health app, and communications on services including iMessage and FaceTime.\n\nEnd-to-end encryption means that messages are scrambled so that only the sender and recipient can see them. If anyone else intercepts the message, all they will see is a garble that can\u2019t be unscrambled without the key.\n\nThe episode illustrates \u201cone of the fundamental flaws in government efforts to undermine encryption,\u201d said Mike Chapple, an IT professor at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business. Faced with having to choose between security and complying with government regulations, companies like Apple tend to remove security features entirely, said Chapple, a former computer scientist at the National Security Agency.\n\n\u201cThe net effect is reduced security for everyone. If other governments follow the UK\u2019s lead, we risk a future where strong encryption is functionally outlawed, which puts all of us at risk not just to government surveillance but also to eavesdropping by other bad actors.\u201d",

            "content": "Nissan\u2019s credit was downgraded to \u201cjunk\u201d stats by ratings firm Moody\u2019s today; that is a bad thing. The company walked away from a deal with Honda, and now Nissan is essentially an orphan, alone in a cruel world. Will the Japanese automaker fall pray to an artful dodger or, perhaps, is there a Daddy Warbucks waiting in the wings?\n\nThe list of potential suitors for Nissan has grown and, as always, your Morning Dump correspondent refuses to cede to logic or probability. Instead, I think the most appropriate home for Nissan is with Apple. I will explain why and then you can tell me I\u2019m full of crap. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m used to it.\n\nThere\u2019s no shame in being wrong sometimes, so long as you\u2019re willing to learn from your mistakes. Volvo made a mistake when it stopped selling its wagons in the UK and now, thankfully, Volvo is admitting it was wrong. Ford also misunderstood the EV market and is working hard to correct its course.\n\nIt\u2019s Friday, I was going to end on the news that Carvana had a bad quarter, but I think I should leave you all with some happy news.\n\nApple Is A Perfectly Imperfect Match For Nissan\n\nThe Nissan news is just getting wilder with every passing day. There have been so many twists and turns that I feel like it\u2019s easiest just to bullet-point it:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhew, ok. We\u2019re sort of caught up. But wait, more stuff is happening!\n\nFirst, the bad news for Nissan. Somewhat predictably, ratings agency Moody\u2019s has taken a look at Nissan\u2019s credit and decided that none of this is good. Here\u2019s the latest report from The Wall Street Journal:\n\nThe ratings company said Friday that it downgraded Nissan\u2019s senior unsecured rating by one notch to Ba1 from Baa3, the lowest investment grade. Moody\u2019s maintained its negative rating outlook. Moody\u2019s said the rating action reflects Nissan\u2019s weak profitability driven by slowing demand for its aging model portfolio. A slowdown has been evident in China, but now the carmaker faces challenges in the U.S. market as well, it said. The ratings company said the negative outlook took into account the risks associated with implementing the carmaker\u2019s new restructuring plan.\n\nThe lowering of its credit rating will make it harder for Nissan to borrow money at good terms, though the company has about $13 billion on hand and a little less in unused credit lines if it needs quick cash.\n\nFoxconn, who accelerated all of this with its inquiry to Renault, is now saying it\u2019s interested in a deal with Honda and Nissan according to Nikkei Asia:\n\nTaiwan\u2019s electronics manufacturer Foxconn has proposed forming a partnership with Japanese automaker Honda Motor, with the aim of creating a four-company framework for cooperation that would include Nissan Motor and its affiliate Mitsubishi Motors, according to a source familiar with the matter. Foxconn had been seeking a partnership with Nissan to strengthen its electric vehicle business before Honda and Nissan announced they were looking at integrating their businesses. While those merger talks terminated last week, the two Japanese companies are expected to continue their business partnership. Through partnering with Honda, Foxconn aims to form a broader framework for cooperation to compete with Tesla of the U.S. and Chinese EV makers.\n\nThere\u2019s something for everyone in this deal, right? Honda gets access to Mitsubishi, Nissan gets a lifeline, and Foxconn gets a bunch of partners to help offset the growing threat of Tesla and Chinese companies like BYD and Xiaomi. It remains highly unclear if anyone would accept this deal, but it\u2019s a fun thought.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSince Tesla was mentioned, I should probably mention that a group of Japanese business and political leaders are trying to push Tesla to buy the company. From Reuters:\n\nThe proposal, led by former Tesla board member Hiromichi Mizuno, is being supported by ex-premier Yoshihide Suga and his former aide Hiroto Izumi, the report said, citing unnamed sources. The group is hopeful that Tesla will become a strategic investor, since they believe it is keen to acquire Nissan\u2019s plants in the United States, according to the report.\n\nCould Nissan\u2019s facility pump out Cybercabs? Maybe!\n\nAll of those are potential outcomes, though I think a better outcome for Nissan is that Apple buys it. If you remember, Apple spent billions of dollars and maybe a decade trying to make a car before giving up. Building cars sucks. Instead, Apple has shifted to trying to expand its popular Car Play infotainemtn system deeper into cars.\n\nApple is flush with cash, holding onto roughly $50 billion with a market cap of about $3.7 trillion. It could easily afford to buy Renault\u2019s shares or do some kind of other stock swap to make every current Nissan shareholder quite happy. There is no question of means here. Apple could do it.\n\nAnd, unlike every other non-Foxconn suitor, Apple doesn\u2019t have a competitive portfolio of cars to compete with the automaker. Nissan, for its part, lacks a competitive software offering in the automotive space and is behind on autonomy. Honda made a deal with Sony to create the Afeela, premised on the idea that the car is less important than the software. Apple clearly believes the same thing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhy didn\u2019t Sony just build its own car? Because, again, building cars sucks. Apple could support Nissan\u2019s restructuring, simplify its operations, utilize Nissan\u2019s ability to make cars (specifically EVs, a segment where Nissan was early with the Leaf, even it\u2019s fallen a bit behind), take advantage of its huge industrial footprint, and offer the first cars Powered By Apple.\n\nIf you think about it, Apple isn\u2019t really a manufacturer. It\u2019s a tech, design, and marketing company. Apple\u2019s most important product is the iPhone and it outsources its production to other companies. Specifically, it outsources the production to Foxconn!\n\nI\u2019m not crazy to suggest this, I promise. From that same Reuters story:\n\nNissan in recent weeks has been searching for a strategic partner in the tech industry, with some board members suggesting Tesla and Apple as ideal targets, the report said.\n\nThink about it Tim Cook!\n\nVolvo Admits It Shouldn\u2019t Have Cut Britain Off From Its Vital Supply Of Estates\n\nIn spite of loving English literature (Graham Greene, Iris Murdoch, Evelyn Waugh, George Eliot), I\u2019d never actually been to England until 2023. Then, in the span of about a year, I went to England three times!\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt was great. I love English people. I love English brews. I especially love staring at all the cars we never got here in the United States. Wagons abounded, though the Brits call them \u201cestates.\u201d I noticed many Volvo estates, especially being used by the government as police/ems/fire vehicles. What I\u2019d forgotten at the time was that Volvo was only selling estates to fleet users and not regular people.\n\nVolvo! The wagon company! I\u2019ve owned two Volvo wagons in my life and zero Volvo sedans or SUVs. Keeping wagons from Britain was a great mistake, as the company admits to Auto Express:\n\n\u201cWhen you tell a retail customer [estates] aren\u2019t offered, they go off and buy someone else\u2019s,\u201d said Robert Deane, Volvo Car UK commercial operations director. Which meant a free hit for BMW, Audi, Mercedes and the UK\u2019s biggest-selling car brand, Volkswagen, which registered 4,353 estates last year. Volvo took the V60 and V90 (and S60 saloon) off the market in summer 2023, having seen demand dwindle to about five to 10 per cent of its total volume as more customers gravitated to SUVs.\n\nGood on Volvo for fixing this oversight.\n\nFord\u2019s Target Is BYD As Much As Tesla\n\nIt\u2019s likely we\u2019ll soon hear about a cheaper Tesla model, but, until one actually appears, it\u2019s Chinese automaker BYD that is currently accepted as making the best affordable electric cars. In particular, the BYD Seagull offers about 250 miles of city range at a cost to consumers of under $10,000 in its home market. That is hard to beat.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith its Skunkworks project, Ford seems to consider BYD its target in terms of cost, according to comments from CEO Jim Farley in this Detroit Free Press report:\n\n\u201cWe think that our battery strategy is more fit than our competitors,\u201d Farley said at a Wall Street conference recently. \u201cAnd we have understood BYDs through teardowns and future knowledge from the supply chain.\u201d [\u2026] In 2022, Ford established Skunkworks, where Farley said, \u201cMy badge does not work in that building,\u201d alluding to the top-secret development happening there. He said Ford hired a whole new team in California, with many from competitive all-EV brands. \u201cThey have developed a platform that we think is fully competitive with BYD,\u201d Farley said.\n\nWhat automakers learned was that merely catching up to Tesla is both difficult and expensive. Instead, Ford seems to be aiming at Tesla\u2019s biggest competitor.\n\nCheck Out This Sweet Mitsuoka\n\nIt\u2019s Friday! We survived most of the week and just have to make it through a few more hours to get to the weekend. Japanese car customizer Mitsuoka is now offering a new \u201cJade Green\u201d color on its cars and celebrating the new shade with this gorgeous \u201cRyugi Wagon Adventure.\u201d\n\nIt might look like a vintage Jaguar, but it\u2019s actually a Toyota Corolla Fielder underneath.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDid I mention that the inside looks like they skinned a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle? I feel like that only adds to the charm.\n\nWhen is Mitsuoka going to open up an arm in the United States?\n\nWhat I\u2019m Listening To While Writing TMD\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWas \u201cHard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\u201d the first time you heard Jay-Z? The Annie-backed track was an unlikely hit and the video was basically on MTV nonstop back when that mattered.\n\nThe Big Question\n\nWho should buy Nissan?",

He spoke the day after he and the Apple leader \u2014 who Trump said also promised hundreds of millions of dollars in US investment \u2014 met in Washington.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to be in the tariffs,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what manufacturing facilities Trump was referencing, though Foxconn Technology Group \u2014 which manufactures the company\u2019s iPhones \u2014 already has a large manufacturing presence in Mexico and has announced plans to expand its footprint there.\n\nA representative for Apple didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCook is among the tech industry leaders who have sought to nurture a close relationship with the president since his reelection, attending his inauguration last month and traveling to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida during the presidential transition.\n\nCook\u2019s company risks being caught in the middle of an escalating trade fight between the US and China, with Trump\u2019s 10% tariff on Chinese-made goods posing a challenge for Apple as it seeks to address sluggish iPhone sales. China is weighing a probe into Apple\u2019s policies and the fees it charges app developers. China is Apple\u2019s biggest manufacturing hub, while the US is its largest market.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, Cook was able to leverage his relationship with the president to win tariff carve-outs for its signature iPhone. But the president has suggested that the company\u2019s devices might not be so lucky this time as he seeks to impose sweeping new tariffs on imported goods, telling reporters that he\u2019s looking to avoid exemptions.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s government has pledged to help companies like Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., shift production lines in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s executive orders imposing across-the-board 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Trump has paused implementation of those tariffs for now, but said they could still go back into effect if he doesn\u2019t see sufficient progress on immigration and anti-narcotic priorities.\n\nShortly following the election, Cook posted to social media that Apple looked \u201cforward to engaging with you and your administration to help make sure the United States continues to lead with and be fueled by ingenuity, innovation, and creativity.\u201d\n\nBut Trump has also sparred with the company over its privacy policies, saying it should do more to help federal law enforcement access encrypted phones. Apple has resisted requests from law enforcement to build a backdoor into its phone operating system that would allow authorities to access data without a user\u2019s password, saying that could leave phones vulnerable to hackers.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Introduced in February 2025, the iPhone 16e is the next-generation version of the iPhone SE, and it is the most affordable iPhone that Apple sells at the current time.\n\nThe iPhone 16e is a blend of the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 16 in terms of design, featuring a 6.1-inch OLED display with a notch for the TrueDepth camera system, an aluminum frame with squared-off edges, a Ceramic Shield display, a single-lens rear camera, and an A18 chip with Apple Intelligence support.\n\nWith the iPhone 16e, Apple phased out several older technologies. There are no longer iPhones with Lightning ports, LCD displays, or 64GB storage options, and 6.1 inches is now the smallest display size that Apple offers.\n\nApple didn't call the iPhone 16e the iPhone SE 4 because it adopts enough features from the iPhone 16 to join the iPhone 16 lineup. It has the same current-generation A18 chip with 6-core CPU, but there is a 4-core GPU instead of a 5-core GPU, so GPU performance won't be quite as good. The chip uses a 16-core Neural Engine and it has 8GB RAM, so it is compatible with all Apple Intelligence features. Storage starts at 128GB, up from 64GB with the iPhone SE, and the iPhone 16e can be upgraded to 512GB storage.\n\nPriced starting at $599, the iPhone 16e is $200 less than the iPhone 16, but it is $170 more than the prior iPhone SE, which was priced at $429. It is Apple's cheapest iPhone, but the definition of cheaper is no longer quite as affordable as it was with the iPhone SE.\n\nThe iPhone 16e looks almost identical to the iPhone 14, featuring an aluminum frame in either black or white, a glass back, and a notch rather than the Dynamic Island that the iPhone 16 uses. It uses the same 6.1-inch Super Retina OLED XDR display as the iPhone 14, which is protected by Ceramic Shield technology. The display features 800 nits max brightness and 1200 nits peak HDR brightness, plus it has features like True Tone, Wide Color, and Haptic Touch.\n\nThere is no Camera Control button, but Apple did add the Action button that replaces the mute switch. The Action button is customizable and can be used to activate the flash light, turn on the camera, open the Translate app, turn on a Focus mode, and more. The Action button supports Visual Intelligence, a feature previously limited to iPhone 16 models with Camera Control.\n\nThe single-lens 48-megapixel f/1.6 Fusion camera is the same as the Wide camera in the iPhone 16, and it is a 2-in-1 camera system that offers standard wide photos and photos with a 2x zoom. The camera does not support some options like Focus Control for Portraits or next-generation Photographic Styles. Since there is just one lens, the iPhone 16e cannot capture spatial photos or videos.\n\nAs for video, the iPhone 16e supports 4K dolby vision video recording like the iPhone 16, but it dos not include Cinematic mode or Action mode. It does, however, support the new Audio Mix feature for optimizing the audio in video recordings. The iPhone 16e also uses the same 12-megapixel front-facing TrueDepth camera with f/1.9 aperture, but it does not support Cinematic mode or the newer photographic styles.\n\nApple equipped the iPhone 16e with its new C1 modem chip, which is Apple's first custom-designed 5G modem. The C1 supports 6GHz 5G networks, but it is not compatible with mmWave. The modem is not as fast as Qualcomm's modems, but it is more battery efficient.\n\nApple says that the iPhone 16e has the longest battery life of an iPhone with the 6.1-inch form factor, and the battery lasts for up to 26 hours when watching videos, up to 21 hours when streaming video, and up to 90 hours when listening to audio.\n\nThere is a USB-C port for charging purposes instead of a Lightning port like the prior-generation iPhone SE had, but MagSafe charging is not supported. Instead, the iPhone 16e is limited to standard 7.5W Qi-based wireless charging.\n\nModern safety features are available in the iPhone 16e, including Crash Detection that's able to automatically contact emergency services if a car crash is detected, Emergency SOS via satellite for off-grid emergencies, Roadside Assistance via satellite, and Messages via satellite for sending texts when a Wi-Fi or cellular connection is unavailable.\n\nApple added Wi-Fi 7 to the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro models, but the iPhone 16e is limited to Wi-Fi 6, so it is not able to connect to the 6GHz Wi-Fi band available with Wi-Fi 6e and Wi-Fi 7. There is no Ultra Wideband chip for Precision Finding in the Find My app and for indoor mapping, nor is there Thread networking technology included.\n\nPre-orders for the iPhone 16e began on Friday, February 21, and a launch will follow on Friday, February 28.",

            "content": "Apple pulls data protection tool after UK government security row\n\n2 days ago Zoe Kleinman \u2022 @zsk Technology editor\n\nGetty Images\n\nApple is taking the unprecedented step of removing its highest level data security tool from customers in the UK, after the government demanded access to user data. Advanced Data Protection (ADP) means only account holders can view items such as photos or documents they have stored online through a process known as end-to-end encryption. But earlier this month the UK government asked for the right to see the data, which currently not even Apple can access. Apple did not comment at the time but has consistently opposed creating a \"backdoor\" in its encryption service, arguing that if it did so, it would only be a matter of time before bad actors also found a way in. Now the tech giant has decided it will no longer be possible to activate ADP in the UK. It means eventually not all UK customer data stored on iCloud - Apple's cloud storage service - will be fully encrypted. Data with standard encryption is accessible by Apple and shareable with law enforcement, if they have a warrant. The Home Office told the BBC: \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\" In a statement Apple said it was \"gravely disappointed\" that the security feature would no longer be available to British customers. \"As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products, and we never will,\" it continued. How does encryption work? The ADP service is opt-in, meaning people have to sign up to get the protection it provides. From 1500GMT on Friday, any Apple user in the UK attempting to turn it on has been met with an error message.\n\nApple\n\nExisting users' access will be disabled at a later date. It is not known how many people have signed up for ADP since it became available to British Apple customers in December 2022. Prof Alan Woodward - a cyber-security expert at Surrey University - said it was a \"very disappointing development\" which amounted to \"an act of self harm\" by the government. \"All the UK government has achieved is to weaken online security and privacy for UK based users,\" he told the BBC, adding it was \"na\u00efve\" of the UK to \"think they could tell a US technology company what to do globally\". Online privacy expert Caro Robson said she believed it was \"unprecedented\" for a company \"simply to withdraw a product rather than cooperate with a government\". \"It would be a very, very worrying precedent if other communications operators felt they simply could withdraw products and not be held accountable by governments,\" she told the BBC. Meanwhile, Bruce Daisley, a former senior executive at X, then known as Twitter, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: \"Apple saw this as a point of principle - if they were going to concede this to the UK then every other government around the world would want this.\"\n\nWhat did the UK ask for?",

            "content": "Apple has stopped offering its end-to-end encrypted iCloud storage, Advanced Data Protection (ADP), to new users in the UK, and will require existing users to disable the feature at some point in the future. The move comes following reports earlier this month that UK security services requested Apple grant them backdoor access to worldwide users\u2019 encrypted backups.\n\n\u201cApple can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users and current UK users will eventually need to disable this security feature,\u201c says Apple spokesperson Julien Trosdorf in a statement to The Verge. \u201cWe are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy.\u201d\n\nADP works by protecting iCloud data with end-to-end encryption, meaning it can only be decrypted by the person who owns the iCloud account on their own devices. Apple originally launched ADP in late 2022, allowing iCloud data like file backups and photos to be protected by the feature. Removing ADP means that British users\u2019 files will be accessible to Apple, and shareable with law enforcement, though that would still require a warrant.\n\nSome types of iCloud data are end-to-end encrypted by default, and will remain so even in the UK. This includes passwords, health data, payment information, and iMessage logs. iCloud file backups, photos, notes, and voice memos are among the data types that will no longer be encrypted.\n\nApple has already stopped offering Advanced Data Protection to new users in the UK, advising them that it \u201ccan no longer offer\u201d the service. Apple won\u2019t be able to disable ADP automatically on existing iCloud accounts, because of the way the end-to-end encryption feature works. Trosdorf tells The Verge that UK users will be given an amount of time to disable ADP to keep using their iCloud account, though the company has not said when the deadline will be.\n\n\u201cApple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom,\u201d says Trosdorf. \u201cAs we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.\u201d\n\nApple says it \u201ccan no longer offer\u201d encryption to new users in the UK. Screenshot: Apple\n\nEarlier this month The Washington Post reported that the UK Home Office, led by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, had demanded backdoor access to encrypted files uploaded not only by Brits, but by users worldwide. The company was reportedly served a document called a technical capability notice under the UK\u2019s Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, also known as the Snoopers\u2019 Charter. Apple has the right to appeal any demand made under the act, but not to delay implementation of the order.\n\nIt was reported then that Apple was likely to disable its UK encryption instead of granting security services a backdoor, but that this might not placate the Labour government, which would still not be able to access encrypted files uploaded elsewhere in the world. Apple did not issue any statement at the time, and even now has not explained why ADP is being disabled, but even revealing that the government had made a demand under the Investigatory Powers Act would reportedly be a criminal offense.\n\nUK security services have repeatedly pushed back against end-to-end encrypted services in the past, making the argument that encryption is used by terrorists and child abusers to hide from law enforcement. \u201cEnd-to-end encryption cannot be allowed to hamper efforts to catch perpetrators of the most serious crimes,\u201d a government spokesperson told The Guardian in 2022 when Apple first introduced end-to-end encryption.\n\nApple has made its own arguments against the UK\u2019s position in the past. \u201cThere is no reason why the UK [government] should have the authority to decide for citizens of the world whether they can avail themselves of the proven security benefits that flow from end-to-end encryption,\u201d Apple told the British parliament in March 2024 during a debate on an amendment to the Investigatory Powers Act.\n\nApple is not the only tech company to offer end-to-end encrypted backups. Google has offered encrypted backups to Android users since 2018, and Meta also offers the option to encrypt WhatsApp backups. Both are currently still available in the UK.\n\nADP remains available outside of the UK, and can be enabled from iCloud\u2019s settings options. To activate it, any devices tied to your Apple ID will have to be up-to-date, and you must turn on Apple\u2019s Account Recovery features as well. ADP is free to use, and if you\u2019re outside the UK we recommend enabling it.",

            "content": "If you're confused about who the iPhone 16e is for, you're not alone \u2014 I know I won't be upgrading.\n\nI'm going to cut right to it. I should have been an easy sell for the iPhone SE 4, but I'm vehemently against the iPhone 16e.\n\nIf you've read any of my opinion pieces here in my nearly six-year tenure at AppleInsider, you'd know that I'm not an iPhone fanatic. Unlike most of my coworkers, I've never owned a Pro-level iPhone model.\n\nIn fact, my history with the iPhone lineup is pretty telling. I started with the iPhone 4, though I wound up swapping it for a flip phone back when those were still a thing.\n\nI just didn't care about the iPhone then.\n\nSeveral years later, I got myself an iPhone 5c \u2014 refurbished. This was the first smartphone that I genuinely liked.\n\nI loved its compact size, I liked the feel of the smooth plastic back, and it came in a color I affectionately called \"punch-you-in-the-face-yellow\" which is sort of a thing for me.\n\nI really, really like yellow.\n\nIf not for a fateful collision with a sidewalk, I probably would have held onto the iPhone 5c for an embarrassingly long time.\n\nI jumped to Android for a very brief time because the Nexbit Robin was affordable and I was a broke college student. I learned quickly that I just wasn't cut out for an Android phone.\n\nThe next line of updates for me included the original iPhone SE, which I thought was fine. Three years later, I got a base model iPhone 11, which I did not like.\n\nIt was too big for my hands. It went crashing to the floor when it fell out of my back pocket constantly \u2014 at least I had a good case on it this time.\n\nDespite the iPhone 12 debuting the first mini iPhone, I didn't feel ready to upgrade. I wasn't planning on upgrading until the iPhone 14 line, but Mike was kind enough to point out that Apple was likely killing off the mini lineup.\n\nApple's iPhone 13 mini, beloved by at least one AppleInsider staffer\n\nSo I traded in my iPhone 11 for an iPhone 13 mini. It's the first iPhone I've actually liked, rather than just felt ambivalent towards, since the iPhone 5c.\n\nMagSafe and Face ID are fantastic upgrades over the iPhone 11, and thankfully, it fits in my pockets again.\n\nI'm not bitter about Apple killing off the mini lineup by the way, I say, bitterly.\n\nAll this to say, I'm hardly what you'd consider an iPhone evangelist. I have Apple products that I'll go to bat for, of course.\n\nI have an Apple Silicon iMac that I love, and a fourth-generation iPad Air that I adore. However, I think the age of both speaks to how often I upgrade my tech.\n\nBut I am an iPhone owner. And I am content to stay in the Apple ecosystem.\n\nMy iPhone 13 mini is getting a little long in the tooth. I briefly thought about upgrading to the iPhone 16 Pro, but I wound up holding off.\n\nI am not a Pro-level iPhone user and, while I'm not a broke college student anymore, I have a mortgage and student loans. The money could be better spent elsewhere.\n\nThat is the exact reason why I was excited when the rumor mill started suggesting that the iPhone SE 4 was on the way.\n\nThe promise of a better budget iPhone\n\nLeakers and analysts alike had been heralding the upcoming iPhone SE 4 for a while. While several rumors seemed implausible, everyone more or less had the same opinion on what it would be.\n\nIt would have a notch, rather than the Dynamic Island. It would be compatible with Apple Intelligence. It would look like the iPhone 14. It would probably feature Apple's new in-house modem.\n\nEssentially, we were expecting a better budget iPhone. You know, like a next-generation iPhone SE.\n\nWhat we got, however, was not that.\n\nThe iPhone 16... e?\n\nOn Wednesday, when the AppleInsider Staff was taking bets on when the new iPhone would be released \u2014 I called it, by the way \u2014 we were all still assuming it'd be the fourth-generation iPhone SE. After all, the reliable leakers were still calling it that, and the sketchy ones were going with 16e.\n\nWhen 11 AM ET hit, the Apple Store updated to show a new model of iPhone. It wasn't the iPhone SE. It was the iPhone 16e.\n\nThe iPhone 16 what-now?\n\nApple's weird history with appending letters to the end of a number aside, none of us really knew what to make of it at first. Who was the iPhone 16e targeting, because it wasn't immediately obvious.\n\nI think I was the first one to notice it didn't have MagSafe. Wes was the first to point out that the price was a hard sell, the iPhone 16e is priced at $599, while the iPhone SE 3 launched at $429.\n\nOnce things settled down and I had a chance to read through the specs, I felt confused.\n\nIt had a notch and not the Dynamic Island. It could utilize Apple Intelligence features. It had Apple's in-house modem. It looked like the iPhone 14.\n\nAt first blush, it appeared to be the phone we were told was coming. Yet, it wasn't the phone I was expecting.\n\nIt was a half-step between the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 16. It was also somehow less and more than the iPhone 15.\n\nI was severely disappointed that the price was $599, rather than the $499 I'd expected. That puts it in a weird spot in the iPhone lineup.\n\nIt's not better than the iPhone 15, it's just different\n\nWe run a lot of comparisons here, thanks to Malcolm's willingness to spend hours pouring over spec sheets. It's pretty clear that the iPhone 16e is an improvement over the iPhone SE 3. But is it better than its more recent predecessor \u2014 eh, I don't think so.\n\nFor $699, a mere $100 more, you can get an iPhone 15. When compared side by side, the differences aren't as damning as you'd expect.\n\nAt least on paper, the iPhone 15 has better cameras, plural. It's got more zoom options, which, by the way, the iPhone 16e can't zoom back to 0.5x. It has sensor-shift optical image stabilization, and the iPhone 16e only features optical image stabilization. It's worth pointing out that every mainline iPhone since the iPhone 12 Pro Max has had sensor shift.\n\nThe iPhone 15 camera setup\n\nIt also has both Cinematic and Action mode for video recording, while the iPhone 16e does not.\n\nI will give it to the iPhone 16e, it can record Spatial Audio, wind noise reduction, and Audio Mix, which are unavailable on the iPhone 15.\n\nThe iPhone 15 has significantly higher maximum typical brightness at base \u2014 1000 nits versus the iPhone 16e's 800 \u2014 and a much higher outdoor brightness at 2000 nits versus the iPhone 16e's...\n\nWell, Apple doesn't give stats for the iPhone 16e's peak outdoor brightness. The highest it lists is 1200 nits in HDR mode. Make of that information what you will.\n\nThe iPhone 15 doesn't feature Apple Intelligence, which I'd argue is probably fine for the casual user. I know that Apple Intelligence is not a selling point for me, and I don't think I'm in the minority of \"casual users.\"\n\nThe iPhone 15 has a 5-core GPU over the iPhone 16e's four cores.\n\nBoth phones feature Crash Detection, Emergency SOS via satellite, Roadside Assistance via Satellite, and Messages via Satellite, so there's no compromise there.\n\nYou'll get satellite features with either the iPhone 15 or the iPhone 16e\n\nThe iPhone 15 has Ultra Wideband, while the iPhone 16e does not.\n\nAnd yes, the iPhone 16e does have an improved battery life over the iPhone 15. I'm willing to concede that point. But I rarely run my battery to empty, even when I'm out all day, and I'm rocking an iPhone that made its debut three years ago.\n\nThis is where I'll remind you that the iPhone 16e lacks MagSafe. They couldn't even give us MagSafe, a feature that I think nearly everyone would have assumed was a standard iPhone feature by this point.\n\nInstead, it has Qi charging. It does not have Qi2 charging, either by the way.\n\nSo now, if you upgrade to the iPhone 16e from the iPhone 12 or newer, you lose MagSafe. MagSafe is one of the few iPhone features I actually care about.\n\nSo, what are we supposed to do with this, then?\n\nAnd yes, I recognize that you can get a magnet sticker and put it on your phone and sort of get some of the same compatibility back.\n\nAnd I know that there will be third-party cases that include the magnets, too, because I think they realize that iPhone owners have come to expect that.\n\nBut it isn't the same.\n\nFor an extra $200, which I recognize isn't a small amount of money, you get a bunch of iPhone 16 features that aren't available on the iPhone 16e.\n\nAgain, I ask, what was the target demographic?\n\nWhat the iPhone SE 4 should have been\n\nI can already tell a fair amount of folks are probably going to assume I'm arguing semantics.\n\n\"Oh, Amber, if they would have called it the iPhone SE 4, you wouldn't be so hard on it.\"\n\nAnd I think that's a reasonable assumption. I mean, I think you're wrong, but I think it's reasonable to assume that.\n\nIt comes down to price versus expectations. The iPhone 16e isn't that good of a deal.\n\nWhen the iPhone SE 3 was released, it was priced at $429. The then-current mainline iPhone, the iPhone 13, was priced at $799. That's a savings of about 46%.\n\nThe iPhone 16e costs $599. The iPhone 16 still costs $799. That's a savings of only 25%. That's significantly less.\n\nAnd yes, you could argue that everything is more expensive now. But it probably didn't need to be.\n\nThe third-generation iPhone SE camera\n\nThe iPhone SE 4 could have done away with the 2-in-1 camera system, which I can assume makes up a large part of the price discrepancy between the would-be iPhone SE 4 and the iPhone 16e.\n\nI think most people who were looking to upgrade to the iPhone SE 4 would have been fine with a 48MP single-camera system. It may come as a surprise to some, but not everyone who buys an iPhone is trying to be the next big iPhone photographer.\n\nAnd I understand that Apple was trying to get Apple Intelligence into as many people's hands as possible. So whatever Apple released was going to need the A18 chip. This likely explains why the \"budget model\" has so many high-end features. Because it already could do that.\n\nBut I don't think the entry-level iPhone should use Apple Intelligence as a selling point in the first place. That feels like something you should pay extra for.\n\nSatellite features are great \u2014 assuming you're ever out of range of cell service\n\nThe satellite features are another thing that could have been cut. Yes, I think the satellite features are fantastic. One of the reasons I was debating updating my phone to the iPhone 16 was to gain access to them.\n\nYou know, in case I find myself without cell service in the same fifteen block radius I spend 97% of my time in, I guess.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, we had thirteen generations of mainline iPhone that didn't have any satellite features. They're nice, but they could be an extra feature you pay more for by buying a mainline phone.\n\nAnd I hate to beat a dead horse here, but they couldn't have given us MagSafe?\n\nRequiem for the iPhone SE\n\nI know I'm far from the only person who is struggling to wrap their head around who the iPhone 16e is for.\n\nI know the general-yet-wobbly consensus on staff is that the iPhone 16e isn't for iPhone SE 3 owners. It's not even targeted toward new-to-Apple folks. Instead it seems like it was made for iPhone owners who have been too stubborn to upgrade from older models.\n\nEven the iPhone 16 splash page gives up the game\n\nWell, here I am, an iPhone owner who is still too stubborn to upgrade. And I probably would have been an easy sell at $499, for the record.\n\nHistorically, the iPhone SE didn't make up the bulk of Apple's orders. It was never designed to.\n\nInstead, it was designed to target the casual user. The John Everyman of modern technology.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that the iPhone SE was targeted toward me, specifically. But also to a lot of other people.\n\nThe iPhone SE is for your parents, or if you're younger, your grandparents. While there are many tech savvy septuagenarians, I'd argue there are significantly more senior citizens who aren't looking for a phone that gives them the option to use artificial intelligence to generate images of their pets or loved ones.\n\nMy dad's response to this image I generated of him was a polite, but disinterested \"Oh, look at that.\"\n\nThe iPhone SE is for enterprise solutions. The kind of work phones that need to run in-house apps. The iPhone SE might not be your employees' main phone, but everyone has to have one.\n\nThe iPhone SE is for people who largely use their iPhones for the same reason a significant chunk of people use an iPad instead of an iPad Air or iPad Pro. You're just using it because it does the two or three things you need it to do.\n\nYou use it to call people, text people, browse social media, and watch all your funny little videos. Not everyone needs to be able to shoot an entire movie on a smartphone.\n\nThe iPhone SE is for tweens who need a phone so they can call or text their parents when they need to be picked up from soccer practice.\n\nAs William said, a big target demographic is first-time iPhone owners who are looking for a cheap on-ramp to the iOS ecosystem.\n\nThe iPhone 16e isn't for those people.\n\nMy partner, who still clings to her iPhone SE 3, took one look at the iPhone 16e and balked.\n\n\"It doesn't come in (RED),\" she said.\n\n\"It does not,\" I replied, waiting to hear the words that I already knew were coming.\n\n\"Hard pass.\"\n\nLike me, she's a casual user. She would appreciate the camera upgrade, sure, but beyond that, nearly every other feature on the iPhone 16e would go wasted.\n\nMy dad, bless him, is never going to use Apple Intelligence. Hell, if he accidentally triggers it while using his phone, he'll probably call me and ask me how to get it to stop.\n\nHe's not going to care that he can record video with Spatial Audio. I can't even tell you the last time my dad recorded a video on his phone in the first place.\n\nAnd, anecdotally, I don't even really love the idea of trying to move him from the home button to the full-screen method of switching apps by swiping up from the bottom of the screen.\n\nIf you're the resident techy of your family, I assume you also have this same looming dread.\n\nI think Apple is planning on releasing a yearly version of the \"e\" series. After all, it has affixed the letter onto its mainline naming convention.\n\nAnd that's unfortunate. I think the \"e\" will forever be an awkward half-step between the previous generation and the current generation.\n\nIt will be marketed as a good upgrade for those who were already on the mainline series in the first place. And that's not what the iPhone SE was, and it's not what the iPhone 16e should be.\n\nI might be wrong, but I fully expect the iPhone \"e\" series to go the way of the mini. An attempt at cornering a market that Apple has identified, but ultimately not big enough for Apple to justify the cost of production.\n\nAnd they couldn't even give us MagSafe.",

            "content": "Hong Kong CNN \u2014\n\nApple offered the latest version of its budget friendly phone for pre-sale in key markets on Friday, in an effort to woo price-sensitive customers in countries like China and India.\n\nThe launch of the iPhone 16e, which costs $599 and is equipped with artificial intelligence, came in the same week that Chinese rival Huawei rolled out its flagship trifold phone in a rare overseas launch event. Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 starts at $799.\n\nAnalysts said the mid-range pricing strategy and earlier-than-expected release reflects Apple\u2019s effort to boost adoption in lower-end markets. The new handset replaces the SE series and is Apple\u2019s first lower-price model since 2022.\n\n\u201cThe 16e is a big step up from the SE and aligns more closely with market demand in that upper mid-end segment but China is hyper competitive, especially in that price range,\u201d Archie Zhang, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, a market analysis firm, told CNN.\n\nIn China, Apple\u2019s second most-largest market, homegrown giant Huawei has made a stunning comeback after being pummeled by American sanctions since 2019. According to data from Canalys, a market research firm, Huawei overtook the Cupertino-based tech giant last year with 16% market share, compared to Apple\u2019s 15%. In 2023, Apple was comfortably ahead with 19% market share, compared to Huawei\u2019s 12%.\n\nLast year, the iPhone maker introduced its Apple Intelligence, which has so far released its AI service to limited English-speaking markets, including the US, UK, Canada, and Australia. Chinese tech giant Alibaba said last week that Apple had chosen to work with it in rolling out its AI features in China, though the release date remains unclear.\n\nBesides the slow rollout of AI features and fierce competition from Chinese brands like Oppo, Huawei and Vivo, which often offer higher specs at lower prices, Apple also faces challenges like greater patriotism among Chinese consumers, according to Lori Chang, a senior analyst at market research company Isaiah Research.\n\nGlobally, Apple is increasingly facing an uphill battle in luring new customers. Its smartphone sales have declined since peaking in 2022, and its global shipment share has fallen from 19.3% in 2023 to 18.2% last year, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nHuawei\u2019s flashy comeback\n\nOn Tuesday, Huawei released its trifold smartphone, the Mate XT, in the Malaysian capital, marking one of its largest overseas smartphone launches since it was hit by export restrictions imposed by US President Donald Trump during his first term in 2019.\n\n\u201cThe significance of XT\u2019s overseas launch is to show how far we could go,\u201d a Huawei spokeswoman told CNN.\n\nThe world\u2019s first commercial trifold phone, which folds around two hinges and expands like a tablet, was first launched at home in China in September, just hours after Apple introduced its iPhone 16. But its steep price tag, at $3,673 outside China, positions it as a luxury device.\n\nHuawei\u2019s high-profile outside China has symbolic importance as it\u2019s another sign of its revival. However, its overseas phone sales are unlikely to skyrocket in the near future, as it relies on a domestic chipmaker for advanced semiconductors, which has struggled to boost production under US restrictions, Chang added.\n\nIn 2018, before the ban, Huawei sold nearly half of its smartphones outside of China. But its global phone sales plunged after Trump choked off its access to critical technologies like semiconductor chips in 2019. Its global smartphone shipment share stood at just 4.1% last year.\n\n\u201cIn the next two years, Huawei will likely focus on strengthening its market position domestically as it works to stabilize the output in chip production to ensure sufficient smartphone production before they can scale further,\u201d Chang said.",

            "content": "HIGH POINT, N.C., Feb. 20, 2025 \u2013 Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak, who serves as High Point University\u2019s Innovator in Residence, encouraged hundreds of students to follow their passion and seek out people to collaborate with during his visit to HPU\u2019s campus on Feb. 14.\n\nWozniak sat down with Dr. Daniel Hall, dean of the Earl N. Phillips School of Business, for a Life Skills and Leadership Series seminar about how students can incorporate creativity, innovation and coachability into their professional lives. Students filled HPU\u2019s Hayworth Fine Arts Center and listened as Wozniak shared lessons he learned while starting Apple with his best friend, Steve Jobs.\n\nWozniak\u2019s nearly hour-long talk with Hall highlighted the opening day of HPU\u2019s third and final Presidential Scholarship weekend this spring. The audience included current HPU students and accomplished high school students who are interested in attending HPU and were preparing to interview for potential scholarship increases at the university.\n\n\u201cBy the time you graduate from a university, you want one thing \u2014 enough money for an apartment,\u201d Wozniak said to laughter from the audience. \u201cTake a job with anybody. It doesn\u2019t have to be what your lifetime passion and goals are. You\u2019re young. You have extra time, and if you don\u2019t waste your time partying away and if you work on some of your own ideas, you can develop them to a great extent all on your own without having any money. That\u2019s one of the advantages you have.\u201d\n\nWozniak told students to look around them at things in their own lives that could be improved upon. He said some of the world\u2019s best innovations were developed by people who initially wanted them for themselves, such as the iPhone or the Apple II computer that quickly revolutionized the technology world after he built it.\n\n\u201cMr. Wozniak\u2019s talk about innovation and coachability truly resonated with me,\u201d said Mae Culbreth, a freshman double majoring in entrepreneurship and marketing from Waldorf, Maryland. \u201cHis emphasis on the importance of being open to feedback and constantly evolving your approach to challenges was inspiring. Innovation isn\u2019t just about having new ideas but also about adapting and improving based on what you learn along the way. It was a reminder of how crucial it is to stay coachable, especially when pursuing ambitious goals. I\u2019m excited to apply this mindset to my academic and professional journey.\u201d\n\nGrowing up, Wozniak described himself as a shy kid who had a ham radio license at age 10 and enjoyed being known for his basic inventions that flashed lights and made sounds. He said he was lucky in that he knew what he wanted to be from a young age.\n\nBy the time he was 12 years old, Wozniak had told his father that he wanted to follow in his footsteps and be an electrical engineer. He also hoped to someday be an elementary-school teacher, which he eventually did for several years after leaving Apple.\n\nWozniak said he developed several principles for himself to live by along the way. The first principle was simply, \u201cDon\u2019t seek huge accomplishments.\u201d By that, he meant he wanted to judge his life on if he is happy, not by how much power and money he accumulates.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be super high up in private planes, selling half-billion-dollar companies every day and buying another one the next day,\u201d Wozniak said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be that guy. I just wanted to be happy and smiling.\u201d\n\nThe Importance of Collaboration\n\nWozniak shared with students the importance of collaborating on projects with other people. He said he started collaborating with others \u2014 unbeknownst to them \u2014 when he was a kid reading about their innovations in different publications. He would then build off their work and incorporate their breakthroughs into his own inventions.\n\nWozniak later famously partnered with Jobs to start Apple in 1976. While Wozniak said Jobs didn\u2019t know how to build computers, he understood Wozniak as a person and could relate to him.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re young, you collaborate and it\u2019s usually with a friend. You might post some notices saying, \u2018Are there any engineers who want to help me on this?\u2019\u201d Wozniak said. \u201cI was lucky. I kind of created a computer all on my own. He didn\u2019t really know about computers, and when he would suggest something simple, I\u2019d be like \u2018All right.\u2019\u201d\n\nLeeAnn Bailey, a freshman majoring in computer science from Fork, Maryland, was among several HPU students in the audience who had questions for Wozniak. She asked how collaboration played a role in his success and what students can learn from his experiences.\n\n\u201cWhat I took away from his talk is to do things differently than what the norm is. Use creativity and innovation from within, and success will come from it,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cAnother interesting take from his talk is to be good to everyone, even if they are bad to you. Mr. Wozniak stated that since following that rule, he has no enemies.\u201d",

            "content": "Admittedly, I do not have the same kind of history with the iPhone\u2019s Home button as lifelong iPhone owners. I was there for a moment with the iPod touch and then, briefly, the iPhone 4S. I went back to Android. But I realize what a big deal it is that Apple has done away with the last remaining evidence of the old iPhone, especially since it was immortalized in the third-generation iPhone SE.\n\nThe Home button has been officially retired now that the iPhone 16e is out, and the iPhone SE 3 is, as once uttered on Laguna Beach, \u201cdunzo.\u201d The internet is not happy about it. Blogs and Reddit posts have been published speaking out against this great injustice done to fan service. How could a button once considered crucial to navigating the walled garden become extinct?\n\nMost of us have been without it for a long time now. The last flagship iPhone with a physical Home button was the iPhone 8/8 Plus in 2017. So much has happened since then. Babies have been born, and empires have crumbled. Not only has Apple since eschewed the Home button from the iPhone lineup, but it also replaced it with other buttons on the iPhone: the Action button and, more recently on the iPhone 16, the Camera Control button, which people are still figuring out in some capacity (I certainly am\u2014it\u2019s placed in kind of a funny area).\n\nPeople are upset because the Home button was a helper. I get that. It encouraged our elders to transition to a new digital way of life while offering a link to the past through a physical button that could clear the screen and take you back to the front page. But all good things must come to an end, especially as they evolve. The world is evolving into ambient computing; even Apple has acquiesced by branding it Apple Intelligence. If you really need a home button, the iPhone 16e has an Action button, which can be programmed to take you back to the front page of iOS. There are solutions to these problems.\n\nOn the iPhone 16e, Apple swapped out the iPhone SE 3\u2019s Touch ID fingerprint with a better, faster Face ID that remains unparalleled compared to similar face recognition technologies. Face ID is such a significant part of the Apple experience that the company developed a specific camera module and put it into the iPhone 16e because it\u2019s a marquee feature of being an iPhone user. The Home button is no longer a part of that narrative.\n\nWhen Android users lost physical buttons\u2014we lost an actual SCROLLING BUTTON with the end of the Nexus One\u2014we had to adjust, too. It was not easy. Frankly, I was shoved into it before I was even ready to go on-screen navigation only. At least iPhone users have had years to transition out.",

With the company\u2019s growing ambitions in developing in-house chips, it plans to replace Broadcom\u2019s Wi-Fi module with its own. Beyond cost savings, this move will enable Apple to achieve an unprecedented level of hardware and software integration.\n\nThere are rumors that the 2025 Apple TV and HomePod will use Apple\u2019s in-house Wi-Fi chip. But that\u2019s not it. Reputed TF International analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims barring the iPhone 17 Air, Apple will use its in-house Wi-Fi module on all other iPhone 17 models. He says apart from cost savings, the move will help \u201cenhance connectivity across Apple devices.\u201d\n\nFollowing Qualcomm, Broadcom\u2019s Wi-Fi chips will also be replaced by Apple\u2019s in-house chips at a faster pace.

However, it could provide better power efficiency or other connectivity enhancements.\n\nKuo previously claimed the chip would be fabricated on TSMC\u2019s 7nm node and support the Wi-Fi 7 standard.\n\nDespite using an Apple-built Wi-Fi module, the iPhone 17 lineup will not use the C1 modem. Instead, except for the iPhone 17 Air, all models will stick to a Qualcomm-supplied baseband.\n\nApple will likely move away from Qualcomm and Broadcom for such core components of its devices in the future.

Next came The Dropout, documenting how entrepreneur Elizabeth Holmes defrauded some of the world\u2019s biggest investors. Now, it\u2019s the turn of Belle Gibson, an Australian wellness scammer, to get a big-budget dramatisation. Apple Cider Vinegar, a new six-part series released on Netflix, charts the true story of the young influencer who tricked the world into believing she\u2019d cured her terminal brain cancer through diet and alternative therapies.\n\nGibson emerged in the infancy of Instagram, leveraging an impressive social media following into a successful app and lucrative book deal. She told her followers that she had been given \u201cfour months to live, tops\u201d by doctors due to a malignant tumour, before confounding medical expectations by rejecting conventional treatment in favour of focusing on nutrition and \u201cholistic\u201d therapies. But the premise she\u2019d built her burgeoning wellness empire on turned out to be a complete fabrication.\n\nAdapted from the book The Woman Who Fooled The World \u2013 penned by the two journalists, Beau Donelly and Nick Toscano, who originally broke the story in 2015 \u2013 Apple Cider Vinegar is brought to life by an all-star cast (Unbelievable\u2019s Kaitlyn Dever stars, alongside The Bold Type\u2019s Aisha Dee and The Babadook\u2019s Essie Davis). The show purports to be \u201cinspired by a true story\u201d, but with the caveat that \u201ccertain characters and events have been created or fictionalised\u201d. So, just how much is based on fact?\n\nIn the case of Belle Gibson herself, the vast majority of what we see on screen really did happen. Gibson was born in Tasmania on 8 October 1991 (though she even lied consistently about this, telling people that she was three years older), and her upbringing remains shrouded in mystery during various periods. She never knew her father; her mother, divorcee Natalie Dal-Bello, settled in Adelaide and remarried in 2012 after moving the family around the southeastern states of Australia for several years. She and her daughter are now estranged.\n\nWhat is clear is that, as early as her teenage years, Gibson had developed a taste for tall tales. An ex-boyfriend alleged that \u201cshe couldn\u2019t go five minutes without making up a story\u201d; a former classmate dubbed her \u201ca pathological liar\u201d.\n\nBut online was where Gibson really started to flex her storytelling muscles. From 2005, she was already uploading posts to internet forums stating that she had brain cancer. A couple of years later, after dropping out of school at 16, Gibson moved across the country to Perth, took a job at a call centre for a private health insurer, and proceeded to post even more bogus health claims in skateboarding chatrooms. She described being treated for cancer and undergoing major surgery; said that she \u201cdied\u201d for several minutes on the operating table; claimed that she needed to get a heart valve replaced but \u201ccouldn\u2019t afford it yet\u201d.\n\nopen image in gallery Kaitlyn Dever plays Belle Gibson, who was described by a classmate as a \u2018pathological liar\u2019 ( Netflix )\n\nIn 2010, she became pregnant with her partner at the time, Nathan Corbett, and gave birth to her son, Oli, at the age of 19. Gibson had relocated to Melbourne while pregnant and was waiting for Nathan, who was working interstate, to join her. Pregnant, alone and in a new city with no support network, Gibson turned once more to online forums for a sense of community \u2013 this time those aimed at mums-to-be. On one such website, What to Expect, she shared that she had cancer, detailed her fears about miscarrying, and offloaded her disappointment that she\u2019d been forced to cancel her baby shower because none of her friends had bothered to book travel to Melbourne.\n\nNathan moved in with her but struggled to get work. By early 2012, the pair had split up, though Nathan remained very involved in his son\u2019s life. That same year, Gibson joined Instagram \u2013 at that time still a burgeoning photo-sharing app. As Donelly and Toscano note in the book, there was no such thing as an \u201cinfluencer\u201d or \u201cInsta-famous\u201d yet \u2013 these were the early days.\n\nGibson started a relationship with a new man almost 20 years her senior, Clive, and began posting on Instagram about her health under the handle \u201cHealing Belle\u201d. She claimed to be curing herself of terminal brain cancer with alternative therapies: craniosacral therapy, oxygen therapy, colonics, ayurvedic treatments. Plus, of course, whole, organic foods and juices. \u201cBelle Gibson: Gamechanger with brain cancer + a food obsession,\u201d read her bio. Stylised pictures of food and drink and Belle herself \u2013 young, attractive, with perfect skin, oversized sunglasses and tousled blonde hair \u2013 made up her carefully curated feed.

The results? \u201cPerfectly normal.\u201d There was no mention of cancer whatsoever, nor of any other neurological problems.\n\nBut her Instagram followers didn\u2019t know that, and within a short space of time she had accrued 200,000 of them \u2013 an impressive number a decade ago. (Here, Apple Cider Vinegar deviates slightly from the truth, claiming she garnered more than 2 million followers.) Gibson\u2019s disciples called her \u201cinspirational\u201d, a \u201cwarrior\u201d, an \u201cangel\u201d. She was selling what many people battling cancer wanted \u2013 hope. And she looked so good doing it.\n\nIn 2013, she got serious about monetising her newfound influence, registering her business and recruiting a small team to develop an app called The Whole Pantry. Branded the world\u2019s first wellness app, it was a one-stop-shop for paleo, gluten-free and vegan recipes, plus healthy lifestyle guides. Despite being developed on a shoestring budget, the app\u2019s design was attractive and clean, with a slick user interface. It was an overnight sensation, downloaded hundreds of thousands of times and named as Apple\u2019s best food and drink app and the second-best iPhone app in the world by the end of the year. It was even selected as one of a small number of apps to be developed for the new Apple smartwatch.\n\nGibson quickly leveraged the success into a book deal, signing with Penguin for an A$132,000 (\u00a366,000) advance just two months after her app\u2019s launch. The Whole Pantry, which prominently charted Gibson\u2019s \u201ccancer journey\u201d in the introduction, was published in autumn 2014 and had sold 16,000 copies by the end of the year. But all of this success was predicated on one big whopper: there was simply no evidence, and never has been, that Gibson had ever had cancer.\n\nShe didn\u2019t spring up in a vacuum. Several years before Gibson started her business, another attractive young Australian woman, Jess Ainscough, started blogging about her cancer \u201crecovery\u201d journey using alternative therapies under the name The Wellness Warrior. Here, fact and fiction divide somewhat in the Netflix adaptation. A character called Milla is clearly based heavily on Ainscough\u2019s story, but with some key differences. In the show, she and Gibson are presented as rivals, with Milla feeling increasingly competitive. But in reality, while she had met Gibson at an event and occasionally interacted with her online, Ainscough didn\u2019t have much of an offline relationship with Gibson at all. There was certainly little rivalry on Ainscough\u2019s part \u2013 for a long time, she was the undisputed queen of beating cancer with new-age treatments. Apple Cider Vinegar does, however, chart the rest of her story pretty accurately.\n\nopen image in gallery Belle Gibson was confronted about her claims in an interview with \u201860 Minutes\u2019 journalist Tara Brown on 9 News ( 60 minutes/9 News )\n\nAinscough was diagnosed with a rare, slow-growing and incurable cancer in 2008 at the age of just 22 after discovering lumps in her arm. Doctors wanted to amputate; Ainscough refused, instead embarking on a quest to heal herself via an adherence to something called Gerson therapy (swapped, in the show, for the fictitious \u201cHirsch therapy\u201d). It involved copious amounts of raw juices and five coffee enemas a day and, for a while, it seemed to be working. Ainscough was touted as an odds-beating wellness guru, amassing thousands of followers and landing a book deal, 2013\u2019s Make Peace With Your Plate, as well as a career as a motivational speaker.\n\nBut the difference between Gibson and Ainscough was that the latter really did have cancer \u2013 and, in 2015, at the age of 29, she died. Her mother Sharyn had died from breast cancer the previous year, having copied her daughter and shunned conventional medicine in favour of Gerson therapy. Towards the end of her life, Ainscough admitted that her \u201cbeliefs have been completely shaken up\u201d; she tried radiotherapy in a last-ditch attempt to survive but it was too late.\n\nIn a bizarre move, Gibson attended Ainscough\u2019s funeral, though she had not been invited, and wept loudly throughout. Whether she was grieving for Ainscough or herself is unclear: it was March 2015, and she had just received an email from two reporters at The Age asking probing questions about her business\u2019s alleged donations to various charities. Donations that, the reporters already knew, had never been received by said charities \u2013 despite Gibson holding specific fundraising drives for them. These causes included the Schwarz family, to whom Gibson had pledged \u201c100 per cent\u201d of money from app downloads for one week, to go towards their son\u2019s inoperable brain cancer treatment.\n\nopen image in gallery Belle Gibson was taken to court for misleading the public ( AAP/David CroslingITV )\n\nThe question of whether or not she really had cancer had been the original tip-off, brought to the publication by Gibson\u2019s former friend Chanelle. In the show, the character is Gibson\u2019s manager, as well as a close friend of Milla. In reality, she was simply an entrepreneur who had moved to Melbourne and befriended Gibson. In the year or so she had known Gibson, Chanelle had become suspicious of the cancer claims \u2013 stories simply didn\u2019t seem to add up. After confronting Gibson at her home alongside another friend, Jarrod, in 2014 \u2013 a confrontation in which Gibson cried and obfuscated, unable to provide proof of her diagnosis or treatment \u2013 Chanelle decided to go to the press. Her friend had refused to come clean, refused to admit she was lying, and refused to get a proper diagnosis from a doctor, claiming she was \u201ctoo busy\u201d.\n\nPublishing a story on someone\u2019s medical history without proof, though, is defamatory and legally spurious. The Age instead went after Gibson\u2019s charity fraud. After they published the story, which garnered international attention, questions were soon raised about the app founder\u2019s health. After all, if she was lying about charity donations, what else might Gibson be lying about?\n\nJust how much she intentionally deceived or delusionally convinced herself of a fake illness remains unclear to this day\n\nFrom there, the house of cards quickly toppled. Gibson went on the defensive but could not produce any evidence of her cancer diagnosis. Penguin pulled the book; Apple pulled the app. Gibson did one print and one televised interview, but continued to maintain that she had never lied. She admitted that she may have been \u201cmisdiagnosed\u201d or misled herself, but that she had truly believed she had terminal cancer and was dying. Just how much she intentionally deceived or delusionally convinced herself of a fake illness remains unclear to this day. She never apologised for her actions.\n\nIn 2017, the Federal Court of Australia found Belle Gibson guilty of misleading and deceptive conduct in civil court proceedings, and she was fined A$410,000 (\u00a3205,000). However, there was \u201cprecious little if anything\u201d left financially in The Whole Pantry by the time it was wound up as a company in 2016. By late 2023, the entire fine amount was still outstanding.\n\nThe latest strange twist to this tale took place in 2019, when Gibson claimed to have joined Melbourne\u2019s Oromo community, originally from Ethiopia, and attempted to reinvent herself as \u201cSabontu\u201d. She was reportedly asked to leave the community once its leader, Dr Tarekegn Chimdi, was made aware of her past conduct. \u201cIt was concerning when someone is using the community\u2019s name who is not a member of that community,\u201d he told reporters at the time.\n\nGibson is no longer on any form of social media.\n\n\u2018Apple Cider Vinegar\u2019 is out now on Netflix",

The 48MP Fusion camera takes gorgeous photos and videos, and with an integrated 2x Telephoto, it is like having two cameras in one, so users can zoom in with optical quality. When outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage, Apple\u2019s groundbreaking satellite features \u2014 including Emergency SOS, Roadside Assistance, Messages, and Find My via satellite \u2014 help iPhone 16e users stay connected and get assistance when it matters most.1\n\niPhone 16e will be available in two elegant matte finishes \u2014 black and white \u2014 with colorful cases available to accessorize. Pre-orders begin Friday, February 21, with availability beginning Friday, February 28.\n\n\u201ciPhone 16e packs in the features our users love about the iPhone 16 lineup, including breakthrough battery life, fast performance powered by the latest-generation A18 chip, an innovative 2-in-1 camera system, and Apple Intelligence,\u201d said Kaiann Drance, Apple\u2019s vice president of Worldwide iPhone Product Marketing. \u201cWe\u2019re so excited for iPhone 16e to complete the lineup as a powerful, more affordable option to bring the iPhone experience to even more people.\u201d\n\nA Beautiful and Durable Design with Breakthrough Battery Life\n\niPhone 16e is built to last, featuring splash, water, and dust resistance with a rating of IP68; the Ceramic Shield front cover with an advanced formulation that is tougher than any smartphone glass; and the toughest back glass in a smartphone.2 The 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display with OLED technology has an edge-to-edge design that is perfect for watching HDR videos, playing games, and reading crisp text.3 iPhone 16e has the best battery life ever on a 6.1-inch iPhone, lasting up to six hours longer than iPhone 11 and up to 12 hours longer than all generations of iPhone SE.4 And with Face ID enabled by the TrueDepth camera system, users can securely unlock their iPhone, authenticate purchases, sign in to apps, and more. iPhone 16e also offers convenient charging options, including both wireless charging and USB-C for easy connection to a wide range of accessories.\n\nPerformance and Connectivity\n\niPhone 16e is powered by Apple\u2019s latest-generation A18 chip, which enables fast, smooth performance, incredible power efficiency, and Apple Intelligence. The 6-core CPU is up to 80 percent faster than the A13 Bionic chip on iPhone 11, handling both everyday and intensive tasks with ease \u2014 from simple workloads, to more demanding actions with Apple Intelligence. The 4-core GPU powers stunning graphics performance and unlocks next-level mobile gaming on the go, enabling graphically demanding AAA titles and hardware-accelerated ray tracing for more realistic lighting and reflections. The 16-core Neural Engine is optimized for large generative models and runs machine learning (ML) models up to 6x faster than A13 Bionic.\n\nExpanding the benefits of Apple silicon, C1 is the first modem designed by Apple and the most power-efficient modem ever on an iPhone, delivering fast and reliable 5G cellular connectivity. Apple silicon \u2014 including C1 \u2014 the all-new internal design, and the advanced power management of iOS 18 all contribute to extraordinary battery life.\n\nBuilt for Apple Intelligence\n\niPhone 16e is built for Apple Intelligence, unlocking exciting new capabilities that make iPhone even more helpful and powerful. With the Clean Up tool, it\u2019s easy to remove distracting elements in images, and natural language search in the Photos app allows users to search for just about any photo or video by simply describing what they are looking for.\n\nUsers can also explore creative new ways to express themselves visually with Image Playground, create the perfect emoji with Genmoji, and make their writing even more dynamic with Writing Tools. They can now type to Siri, and Siri is more conversational with the ability to follow along if users stumble over their words. Siri can also maintain context from one request to the next. With extensive product knowledge, Siri can answer thousands of questions about the features and settings of Apple products, so users can learn how to do things like take a screen recording or schedule a text message to send later.\n\nWith access to ChatGPT seamlessly integrated into Writing Tools and Siri, users can choose to access ChatGPT\u2019s expertise without jumping between applications, so they can get things done faster and easier than ever before. In addition, users can access ChatGPT for free without creating an account, and privacy protections are built in \u2014 their IP addresses are obscured and OpenAI won\u2019t store requests. Users can choose whether to enable ChatGPT integration, and are in full control of when to use it and what information is shared with ChatGPT.\n\nApple Intelligence marks an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI and is designed to protect users\u2019 privacy at every step. It starts with on-device processing, meaning that many of the models that power Apple Inteligence run entirely on device. For requests that require access to larger models, Apple\u2019s groundbreaking Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of iPhone into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence. When using Private Cloud Compute, users\u2019 data is never stored or shared with Apple; it is used only to fulfill their request.\n\nAccess Favorite Features and Unlock Visual Intelligence with the Action Button\n\niPhone 16e features the Action button, allowing users to easily access a variety of functions with just a press. Once customized in Settings, the Action button can be used to quickly open the camera or flashlight; switch between Ring and Silent modes; recognize music with Shazam; activate Voice Memos, Focus, Translate, and accessibility features like Magnifier; or use Shortcuts for more options. The Action button can even access in-app functionality like launching the camera in Snapchat, unlocking a car door with FordPass, tracking a child\u2019s sleep schedule with Napper, and more.\n\nThe Action button on iPhone 16e also unlocks a new visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence to help users learn about objects and places. Visual intelligence can summarize and copy text, translate text between languages, detect phone numbers or email addresses with the option to add to contacts, identify an animal or plant, and more. Visual intelligence also allows users to search Google so they can see where they can buy an item, or benefit from ChatGPT\u2019s problem-solving skills. Users are in control of when third-party tools are used and what information is shared.\n\nA Powerful Camera System to Capture Any Moment\n\nThe powerful 2-in-1 camera system on iPhone 16e is perfect for capturing everyday moments and important memories, including in Night mode and Portrait mode. Using computational photography, the 48MP Fusion camera takes super-high-resolution photos, so users can capture gorgeous images that balance light and detail. With an integrated 2x Telephoto, users have the equivalent of two cameras in one, and can zoom in with optical quality to get closer to the subject and easily frame their shot. And the front-facing TrueDepth camera with autofocus enables sharper close-ups and beautiful group selfies. The latest generation of HDR captures subjects and the background with true-to-life renderings of skin tones, while ensuring photos have bright highlights, rich mid-tones, and deep shadows.\n\niPhone 16e takes stunning videos with the ability to record in 4K with Dolby Vision up to 60 fps, and users can stop and restart a recording for more flexibility when capturing the moment. iPhone 16e also records video in Spatial Audio for immersive listening with AirPods, Apple Vision Pro, or a surround sound system, and enables more ways to edit video sound with Audio Mix. Users can adjust their sound after capture to focus on the voice of the person on camera, make it sound like the video was recorded inside a professional studio, or position vocal tracks in the front and environmental noises in surround sound. With wind noise reduction, powerful ML algorithms automatically reduce unwanted noise for better audio quality.\n\nGroundbreaking Safety and Communication Capabilities\n\niPhone 16e helps users stay connected and get assistance when it matters most. Apple\u2019s satellite features help users text via satellite when they\u2019re outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage. This includes Messages via satellite to text friends and family; Emergency SOS via satellite to connect with emergency services; and Roadside Assistance via satellite to reach a roadside assistance provider in case of car trouble. Users can also use the Find My app to share their location via satellite, reassuring friends and family of their whereabouts while traveling off the grid. Crash Detection on iPhone 16e can detect a severe car crash and automatically dial emergency services if a user is unconscious or unable to reach their iPhone.5\n\nFeaturing iOS 18\n\niOS 18 makes iPhone 16e more personal, capable, and intelligent than ever.6 With more customization options, users can give apps and widgets a new dark or tinted look and arrange them in any open space on the Home Screen. The controls at the bottom of the Lock Screen can be customized; Control Center has been redesigned to provide users with easier access to many of the things they use every day, including third-party apps; and new privacy protections include the ability to lock and hide apps to protect sensitive apps and the information inside them. iOS 18 also provides powerful updates for staying connected. In Messages, users can use text effects to bring words, phrases, sentences, and more to life. Tapbacks expand to include emoji, Genmoji, or stickers, and now users can schedule a message to send later. When messaging contacts who do not have an Apple device, the Messages app now supports RCS for richer media and more reliable group messaging when compared to SMS and MMS.\n\nBetter for the Environment\n\niPhone 16e is designed with the environment in mind. As part of Apple 2030, the company\u2019s ambitious goal to be carbon neutral across its entire carbon footprint by the end of this decade, Apple is transitioning to renewable electricity for its manufacturing, and investing in wind and solar projects around the world to address the electricity used to charge all Apple products, including iPhone 16e. Today, all Apple facilities run on 100 percent renewable electricity \u2014 including the data centers that power Apple Intelligence.\n\nTo achieve Apple 2030, the company is designing products with more recycled and renewable materials, which further drives down the carbon footprint. iPhone 16e features over 30 percent recycled content overall, including 100 percent recycled cobalt and 95 percent recycled lithium in the battery, 85 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, and more.7 Additionally, the main logic board and back glass of iPhone 16e are designed to be manufactured more efficiently, reducing the amount of raw materials needed. The packaging is also entirely fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of removing plastic from its packaging by the end of this year.8\n\nPricing and Availability\n\niPhone 16e will be available in white and black in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage capacities, starting at $599 (U.S.) or $24.95 (U.S.) per month for 24 months.\n\nApple offers great ways to save and upgrade to the latest iPhone.

            "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nApple on Wednesday announced a cheaper new version of the iPhone 16 called the iPhone 16e, signaling a renewed push into the budget smartphone market for the tech giant. It\u2019s also the first iPhone with a cellular modem designed by Apple, and the cheapest iPhone Apple currently sells that supports Apple Intelligence.\n\nThe iPhone 16e costs $599 and launches on February 28.\n\nAdding Apple Intelligence on a cheaper iPhone could be crucial for putting the company\u2019s AI tools in the hands of more consumers. Apple has faced increased competition from Google and Samsung in recent years, both in the budget smartphone market and in the AI space. Google\u2019s cheaper Pixel A-series of phones have been well received, for example, and both Google and Samsung have prioritized updating Android devices with new AI features over the last year.\n\nThe launch also marks a shift away from the iPhone SE, the budget iPhone line Apple debuted in 2016 and last updated in 2022. The iPhone SE made up only a sliver of Apple\u2019s iPhone market share, according to research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, which reports it accounted for just 5% of US iPhone sales as of December 2024.\n\nThe iPhone 16e, despite being more expensive than the SE, could be more appealing to those who want a device that feels more like Apple\u2019s more recent phones. The iPhone SE was the last iPhone with a traditional home button and fingerprint sensor on the front, a longtime staple that Apple began shifting away from with the iPhone X in 2017.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook teased the launch in a social media post on February 13, saying a new \u201cmember of the family\u201d would arrive on February 19.\n\nApple announced the iPhone 16e on February 19. Apple\n\nWhat the iPhone 16e can do\n\nApple claims the new 5G modem in the iPhone 16e is the \u201cmost power-efficient modem ever on an iPhone.\u201d The new modem is arriving more than five years after Apple acquired the majority of troubled chipmaker Intel\u2019s smartphone modem business in 2019. Using its own modems makes Apple less reliant on partners and suppliers, giving it more control over product development and launch timing.\n\nThe iPhone 16e marks a long-awaited overhaul to Apple\u2019s cheaper iPhone. The $429 iPhone SE, while less expensive, looked like the seven-year-old iPhone 8 and lacked features found on most new phones, such as face unlock and a nearly borderless screen. After Wednesday\u2019s announcement, the iPhone SE is no longer available on Apple\u2019s online store.\n\nUnlike the iPhone SE, the iPhone 16e has a lot in common with the iPhone 16, bringing it up to speed with Apple\u2019s current lineup. Both phones have a 6.1-inch screen, Face ID, a 48-megapixel camera and the Action button for programming shortcuts. However, the iPhone 16e is cheaper and it lacks a dedicated second camera for capturing wider shots and the Camera Control button for quickly accessing the camera.\n\nIt\u2019s powered by the same processor as the rest of the iPhone 16 lineup, enabling it to run Apple Intelligence.\n\nApple Intelligence, which until now has only been available on the iPhone 16 family, 2023\u2019s iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max and certain iPads and Macs, is a blanket term that refers to a handful of AI-powered tools \u2013 such as the ability to generate emojis and images with a prompt, summarize notifications, and remove objects from photos as well as ChatGPT integration with Siri.\n\nThe popularity of ChatGPT following its late 2022 release sent a shockwave through the tech industry, prompting companies such as Microsoft, Google and Samsung to incorporate generative AI into their products.\n\nBut Apple was largely considered to be a latecomer to consumer-facing artificial intelligence. Like many tech companies, Apple has long used AI to power backend features, like camera modes, but didn\u2019t begin rolling out Apple Intelligence until last fall. Apple Intelligence\u2019s arrival on a cheaper device like the iPhone 16e signals the company sees AI as being a core part of its products moving forward.\n\nTech giants have positioned generative AI and chatbots as the next major evolution in how consumers use and interact with technology. Yet it\u2019s unclear whether AI tools like Apple Intelligence will be compelling enough to drive smartphone upgrades, with Apple\u2019s iPhone revenue falling short of Wall Street\u2019s expectations in its fiscal first quarter of 2025.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and context.",

            "content": "A new iPhone in February?! Apple launched the iPhone 16E on its site Wednesday, expanding the iPhone 16 line while also bringing a much-needed overhaul to the 2022 iPhone SE with an all-new name, design, processor and Apple Intelligence features.\n\nThe iPhone 16E starts at $599 (\u00a3599, AU$999), which is $170 more than the previous SE's $429 starting price. By contrast, the regular iPhone 16 starts at $799. The price puts the phone towards the higher end of the affordable phone market, between rivals like the $499 Google Pixel 8A and Samsung's Galaxy S24 FE, which starts at $650.\n\nAt a time when phone-makers have bet their success on implementing custom artificial intelligence features into their devices faster than their rivals, Apple makes it clear that its AI isn't limited to its expensive flagship devices. Powering the iPhone 16E is Apple's A18 chip (the same one found in the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus) so it can run Apple Intelligence. This makes the new Apple phone a rarity: a sub-$600 device that can run the same AI features as its more expensive siblings.\n\nOtherwise, the iPhone 16E has a curious value proposition. On paper it seems like an upgrade in nearly every way to the iPhone SE. But it lacks the iPhone SE's main appeals: a low price and a small design. That's not to say that the iPhone 16E isn't worth its $600 starting price, which will no doubt be lower with carrier deals and discounts at launch. But like the old iPhone SE, you have to wonder how long will this phone be relevant for?\n\nWatch this: The iPhone 16E Has Arrived 05:08\n\niPhone 16E release date\n\nThe iPhone 16E will be available to preorder starting Friday, Feb. 21, and will go on sale on Friday, Feb. 28. Apple announced the new phone on Wednesday, Feb. 19 and these release dates follow Apple's usual iPhone release timeline.\n\niPhone 16E design\n\nThe iPhone 16E has an Action button that can trigger a shortcut or start a Visual Intelligence search. Apple\n\nThe iPhone 16E's design seems to have been inspired in part by the iPhone 14's aluminum body. The back glass is matte, which should help keep fingerprints from accumulating. In lieu of a mute switch, there's an Action button for activating a shortcut. Since the iPhone 16E lacks a Camera Control button, you'll be able to trigger Visual Intelligence searches with the Action button. The phone has a USB-C port for charging (instead of the iPhone 14's Lightning port).\n\nThe iPhone 16E marks the end of Apple selling a phone with a home button, which defined the first decade of iPhone designs, dating back to the original one. The iPhone 16E also has a 6.1-inch screen, which means that Apple no longer sells a truly small iPhone option. But the screen, locked at a 60Hz refresh rate, seems like a miss by Apple when the majority of budget Android handsets sport high refresh-rate displays starting at 90Hz. Also, note that the iPhone 16E has a screen notch and lacks a Dynamic Island cutout.\n\nOddly the iPhone 16E doesn't come in a color: only black or white.\n\nThe original iPhone SE launched in 2016 and its design was based on the iPhone 5S. SE stood for \"special edition,\" though over the years some of us have referred to it as \"small edition.\" In 2020, Apple launched the second-generation iPhone SE with a design based on the iPhone 8 but with the A13 Bionic processor from the iPhone 11 series. In 2022, the third-generation iPhone SE launched. Its design was largely similar to the 2020 version but had the A15 Bionic chip from the iPhone 13 series.\n\nThe iPhone 16E's C1 modem and battery\n\nThe iPhone 16E supports Apple Intelligence, including fun features like GenMoji. Apple/CNET\n\nThe iPhone 16E also has something no other iPhone has: an Apple-designed 5G modem. It's called the C1 chip, and in a launch video on Apple's site, the company claims that it is the \"most power-efficient modem ever in an iPhone.\"\n\nThe C1 modem supports 5G, but not the fast millimeter-wave 5G found in places like stadiums. It will be interesting testing phone calls and data speeds once we get our hands on the iPhone 16E.\n\nApple also says that the combination of the A18 and C1 chip raises the efficiency and adds up to a longer battery life. There are two ways for a phone-maker to gain customers: lower a phone's price and lengthen its battery life. While Apple didn't give us a lower price than the SE, its battery life might be the best feature. Again, I look forward to testing the 16E.\n\nThe new iPhone also lacks support for MagSafe charging and accessories. No MagSafe is a bit of a bummer, since that means you can't use magnetic accessories and can only wirelessly charge the phone at a slow 7.5-watt speed. (It can charge wired at 20 watts, though.)\n\niPhone 16E cameras\n\nThe rear has a single 48-megapixel camera. Apple/CNET\n\n\n\nThe iPhone 16E sports a single rear camera with a 48-megapixel sensor. While you don't get even an ultrawide option, the main camera has a high enough resolution to do sensor cropping to offer a 2x magnification \u2013 not quite the same as having a second camera, but possibly close.\n\nAround the front is a 12-megapixel camera that supports Face ID and has autofocus for selfies.\n\niPhone 16E final thoughts for now\n\nIn one sense the iPhone 16E carries the mantle of the SE series and how Apple uses parts of old iPhones to create an affordable one. But that name change also represents a symbolic change from Apple having a cheap phone to Apple having an affordable iPhone 16 -- much like how Samsung has its Galaxy FE models.\n\nWith the name change to iPhone 16E, it will be curious to see how Apple handles upgrades. As opposed to the multiple years between iPhone SE releases, will this be a phone that Apple updates yearly? Will there be an iPhone 17E? All this remains to be seen. I am excited to test the iPhone 16E, so keep an eye out for more coverage on the phone at CNET and our review coming soon.",

            "content": "Apple has released a sleeker and more expensive version of its lowest priced iPhone in an attempt to widen the audience for a bundle of artificial intelligence technology that the company has been hoping will revive demand for its most profitable product lineup.\n\nThe iPhone 16e unveiled Wednesday is the fourth-generation of a model that\u2019s sold at a dramatically lower price than the iPhone\u2019s standard and premium models. The previous bargain-bin models were called the iPhone SE, with the last version coming out in 2022.\n\nLike the higher-priced iPhone 16 lineup unveiled last September, the iPhone 16e includes the souped-up computer chip needed to process an array of AI features that automatically summarize text, audio and create on-the-fly emojis while smartening up the device\u2019s virtual assistant, Siri. It will also have a more powerful battery and camera.\n\nAll those upgrades will translate into a higher starting price for an iPhone 16e at $600, a 40% increase from $430 for the last iPhone SE. But iPhone 16e will be more affordable than the cheapest standard iPhone 16 at $800. The new phone will be available in stores Feb. 28, but can be pre-ordered beginning Friday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so excited for iPhone 16e to complete the lineup as a powerful, more affordable option to bring the iPhone experience to even more people,\u201d said Kaiann Drance, an Apple vice president in charge of promoting a device lineup that accounts for more than half of the company\u2019s revenue.\n\nBut Apple is also trying to balance its desire to offer a more affordable iPhone that will lure more people into its sphere of product against its self interest in maximizing its profits from selling higher price products, according to Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.\n\n\u201cThe problem with a lower-end product in a luxury portfolio is that you want it to be good but not so good as to cannibalize the crown jewels,\u201d Chatterjee said.\n\nAlthough Apple has been hyping its foray into AI since last June, the complete set of features still haven\u2019t been released in the U.S. and the technology still isn\u2019t even available in some parts of the world.\n\nThe delays in making the iPhone\u2019s AI \u2014 dubbed \u201cApple Intelligence\u2019\u201d \u2014 more widely available through free software updates dinged the Cupertino, California, company during the past holiday when sales of the device dipped slightly from their 2023 levels.\n\nApple has primarily been losing the ground in China, where it hasn\u2019t yet specified when the iPhone\u2019s AI technology will be available. But the company recently struck an AI partnership with Alibaba in China that could pave the way for the technology coming to iPhones in that country this spring.\n\nBesides being able to handle AI for the first time, the iPhone 16e has a different look from previous SE models. It boasts a 6.1-inch display screen, slightly larger than the 4.7-inch display on SE model and no longer has a home screen button like the SE had. The new iPhone 16e will rely include a facial recognition option for unlocking the device, just like the higher priced models do.\n\nApple\u2019s shares edged higher Wednesday to close at $244.87, below the stock\u2019s peak of roughly $260 reached in late December.",

Apple stock was little changed on the news, which was widely expected.\n\nThe Cupertino, Calif.-based company said the iPhone 16e packs a lot of cutting-edge technology into a low-cost device. It replaces the third-generation iPhone SE and features a revamped design and improved technical specs. The iPhone 16e also is capable of running artificial intelligence applications, branded Apple Intelligence.\n\nWall Street analysts say the new iPhone should help Apple better compete in more price-sensitive markets, such as China.\n\nIn its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 28, Apple's iPhone revenue fell 0.8% year over year to $69.14 billion. Sales were particularly weak in China. But the company noted that iPhone sales grew in markets where Apple Intelligence features were available.\n\nThe iPhone 16e runs on Apple's A18 processor and includes the first cellular modem designed by Apple, the Apple C1. It sports improved cameras and adds satellite communications features for when users are outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage.\n\nAnalysts say the device should have higher margins since it uses an in-house modem rather than one from Qualcomm (QCOM).\n\nThe new handset will be available on Feb. 28 with preorders beginning Friday. It starts at $599, vs. the cheapest current iPhone 16 handset at $799.\n\nOn the stock market today, Apple stock rose 0.2% to 244.87.\n\n\"The launch could be an incremental tailwind for Apple, replicating prior cycles of SE shipments,\" Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani in a report Sunday.

The company\u2019s iPhone business has been in a slump, with sales down 2 percent from their peak of $205.5 billion in 2022. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has chalked up some of the iPhone\u2019s struggles to the limited availability of Apple Intelligence, which was announced months before it became available and is offered only on the company\u2019s newest models in English-speaking markets like the United States. In a call with analysts last month, Mr. Cook said the new A.I. features drove iPhone sales in markets where it was available.\n\nBut surveys have found that A.I. hasn\u2019t been a major reason that people are buying new phones, said Jeff Fieldhack, research director at Counterpoint Research, a market research firm. \u201cPeople are buying phones for the same reasons they always have: The battery isn\u2019t recharging or the phone is aging and not working,\u201d he said.\n\nApple\u2019s business also stands to benefit from raising the price of its introductory model. The iPhone 16e is 40 percent more expensive than the last iPhone SE, which cost $429. The increase means that Apple stands to collect $170 more on each of the lowest-priced iPhones it sells. That will lift total sales at a time when the number of phones it sells has been relatively stable, at about 230 million phones a year.",

I loyally used the free version until my last year of high school. For a long time I took advantage of being able to play on demand with Daily Mixes and clearing the app to eliminate advertisement interruptions. I knew all the little workarounds. Eventually I could no longer tolerate the advertisements and limitations of the free version. I hated having only six song skips per hour. It was awful. I finally broke down and upgraded to the paid Premium plan.\n\nThe Spotify experience has been so much better with the Premium subscription. As much as I listen to music I think it is so worth the money. I love all of the features from the curated playlists to the music library interface. I love having so many actions in the music player. You can add to a playlist, hide a song, add to queue, share a song, etc etc. All the things. As a third party app, Spotify is integrated into so many devices which can function as a speaker. Whenever I am tired of listening to music I can listen to podcasts within the same app. All my listening activity is in one place.\n\nSpotify has created an exclusive culture and a sense of missing out if you don\u2019t use the platform. Yeah, they got me there. The highly anticipated Wrapped, posting lyrics, and just even saying you use Spotify seems to label you as \u201ccool.\u201d The majority of people in my circles use Spotify (I know this is relative). That was not the initial reason why I use Spotify though.\n\nA couple of my friends used Apple Music and told me they preferred it. (It is funny to mention here that they have since then switched to Spotify.) I decided to give Apple Music a try and began a free trial. One thing I immediately noticed was the sound quality which is so much better than Spotify\u2019s. Apple Music also offers the Dolby Atmos listening experience on some songs which significantly enhances the song. I liked this feature but felt it was overwhelming for everyday listening.\n\nI love that Apple pays artists more per stream than Spotify. Overall I wish artists were compensated more for their work. I don\u2019t like the way streaming platforms give artists little for their work. The best way to support an artist is to buy their merchandise and attend their live shows.\n\nWhile trying Apple Music I noticed that the Apple Music platform seems to focus more on music and artists and only that for its users\u2019 listening experience. They have separate apps for classical music and podcasts. Spotify tends to stray from its original purpose and focus on podcasts, audiobooks, videos and other mediums that do not relate to music.\n\nOne major gripe I had with the Apple Music app was the user interface and menus. Navigation seemed clunky to me. The process of adding and removing songs from playlists was not as user-friendly as Spotify. I acknowledge I have used Spotify for years and am experienced with its interface. But if I had no prior interaction with the Spotify app I think I would still prefer Spotify\u2019s interface to Apple Music\u2019s.\n\nI have been on Spotify for so long and would rather not leave all my playlists and saved songs. Some of the ones I still use are years old. We go way back. I also have my library organized the way I like it. I don\u2019t want to start over. After considering the pros and cons of both platforms I chose to remain loyal to Spotify. The pros outweighed the cons for me. Maybe I\u2019ll give Apple Music another chance someday but for now I\u2019m sticking with Spotify.",

We're expecting Apple to announce something later today, and though nothing has been confirmed as yet, all the signs point towards a refresh for the company's ageing iPhone SE line. In the following posts, I'll be rounding up the latest news and rumors about the iPhone SE 4 (or might that be the iPhone 16E?), and keeping you updated with all the official information as it's revealed by Apple.\n\nWhat does Apple's teaser tell us? Get ready to meet the newest member of the family.Wednesday, February 19. #AppleLaunch pic.twitter.com/0ML0NfMeduFebruary 13, 2025 Let's kick off with a proper look at Apple's official teaser, which was shared to X on February 13. Tim Cook's shiny Apple logo doesn't give a lot away, but the internet has some compelling theories. Firstly, the tagline \"get ready to meet the newest member of the family\" does tally with rumors of a new iPhone SE. It'd be part of the iPhone family, but does that also hint at a rebrand? The iPhone SE 3 was simply the iPhone SE (2022) and there have also been rumors that the new model might be called the iPhone 16E. The circle around the logo could also be hinting at the new SE's single camera, or the move away from a physical home button. It does also look a lot like an AirTag (potentially the AirTag 2?), but we weren't expecting to see a new one of those for quite a while yet...\n\nThe Apple Store is down! (Image credit: Apple) OK, here's our first big indicator that a product launch is imminent. Apple has closed its online store for maintenance, which is almost always a sign that new devices are on the way. In this case, Apple has only closed the product page for the iPhone SE (2022), which (surprise!) strongly hints that a replacement device is about to be revealed. But will it be the iPhone SE 4, the iPhone SE (2022), or the iPhone 16E? Given Tim Cook's \"family\" comment, my money's on the latter.\n\nWhat might the iPhone SE 4 look like? Are you ready for iPhone SE 4? pic.twitter.com/ohacicAvgBFebruary 10, 2025 We don't yet know the name of Apple's new device, but is this its official design? The above images (or perhaps best-guess renders) shared by leaker Majin Bu are the closest thing we have to a peek at the new iPhone SE's possible design. They certainly line up with previous leaks; the device in question has a notch, a flat metal frame, and a single-lens camera. There's also a customizable action button (a nice bonus for a more affordable iPhone). The notch means this should also be the first SE model with Face ID, which is a nice time-saver on my iPhone 16 Pro. If this is all true, it could prove popular \u2013 if the price is right...\n\nThe iPhone 16e is official! (Image credit: Apple) The iPhone 16e is official! Apple officially announced the new device on its website at 11am ET / 8am PT / 4pm GMT, confirming that the iPhone 16e is a new member of the iPhone 16 family and not, as many suspected, a standalone iPhone SE 4. Specs incoming...\n\n(Image credit: Apple) Here's the official product page for the iPhone 16e in the UK. The phone will start at $599 / \u00a3599 / AU$999 and comes in either 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB storage configurations. That's a huge increase on the $429 / \u00a3419 / AU$719 starting price of the iPhone SE (2022). Can we really consider this a budget phone?\n\nFarewell, iPhone 14 and iPhone SE (2022) (Image credit: Apple) And just like that, the iPhone 14 and iPhone SE (2022) are no more. Apple has removed both models from its website.\n\nThe official iPhone 16e announcement video Introducing iPhone 16e - February 19 - YouTube Watch On Here's the official iPhone 16e announcement video, hosted by Tim Cook himself.\n\nInitial reaction from TechRadar's US Managing Editor of News, Jake Krol: \"The iPhone 16e seemingly took some inspiration from the iPhone 4, and I'm kind of here for it\"\n\nDo the specs justify the price? Now for those specs... The iPhone 16e features the A18 chipset, a 6.1-inch OLED display, Apple Intelligence compatibility, a single 48MP rear camera, and a 12MP front-facing camera. There's a notch instead of the Dynamic Island, but the new phone does inherit the Action button from the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 lines. All told, then, this is a major step up from the iPhone SE (2022), but the iPhone 16e's $599 / \u00a3599 / AU$999 price tag also marks a major increase over that of its predecessor.\n\n(Image credit: Apple) Here's that 48MP camera lens up close. It's the same 'Fusion' camera as you'll find on the iPhone 16, which Apple claims \"has the capabilities of two cameras in one.\" That's because it features an integrated 2x telephoto that lets you zoom in with optical quality. The 48MP Fusion camera lets you shoot 4K video in Dolby Vision, too, which is neat.\n\n'I think this could be a hit for Apple' Some more reactions to the iPhone 16e announcement from the TechRadar team for you here: \"I like the simple, unfussy design paired with some powerful chips and access to Apple Intelligence. I think this could be a hit for Apple, though the price is a bit high, but I think people will gobble it up.\" \u2013 Roland Moore-Colyer, Managing Editor, Mobile Computing \"At $599, the iPhone 16e is more expensive than any of us were hoping \u2013 but it looks like there's some serious Apple power under the hood, too. Looking forward to trying this one out, but not sure I'd recommend pre-ordering.\" \u2013 Jamie Richards, Staff Writer, Mobile Computing \"It's somehow killed off two phones [the iPhone 14 and previous iPhone SE] without filling the void left by either of them.\" \u2013 Rob Dunne (aka The Dunnster), VPN Editor\n\nNo MagSafe?! (Image credit: Apple) A quick look at Apple's new model comparison page reveals a few frustrating omissions for the iPhone 16e. The biggest is the lack of MagSafe support. Yes, you read that right: the iPhone 16e will not support MagSafe cases, wallets, and wireless chargers. The phone does have wireless charging capabilities, but only up to 7.5W, which is punishingly slow. There's also no ultra-wideband (UWB) technology, and the GPU is made up of only four cores (compared to five and six on the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro Max, respectively).\n\n'Apple is finally simplifying its iPhone lineup' \"Apple is finally simplifying its iPhone lineup, squeezing almost all of it into the 16 family. This is a good thing for people trying to choose and it also means that the distance from a budget iPhone to a Pro one isn't as great as it used to be. For my money, though, the inclusion of the C1 chip is the most intriguing bit. It isn't often your most affordable handset gets your newest and maybe most controversial piece of tech.\" \u2013 Lance Ulanoff, Editor-at-Large \"What would have sold it for me is Apple opting down in terms of computing power to offer a non-AI iPhone alternative, which would cater to a big chunk of consumers who just aren't bothered about AI et. But then, that's basically admitting that consumers might not care about Silicon Valley's latest golden goose.\" \u2013 Josie Watson, Managing Editor, Lifestyle \"I've never noticed Tim Cook's accent before \u2013 isn't it lovely?\" \u2013 Becky Scarrott, Audio Editor Thanks, Becky.\n\n(Image credit: Apple) Here's the front and back of the new iPhone 16e, which comes in either Black or White (where are the funky colors, Apple?).\n\nC1, who? (Image credit: Apple) Let's talk quickly about that C1 modem. Ever since Apple acquired Intel\u2019s modem business for $1 billion, the company has been racing to build its own modem in a bit to reduce reliance on Qualcomm, which produces the modems for all current iPhone models. Perhaps surprisingly, the iPhone 16e is the first beneficiary of this years-long project. It's not yet clear how much better or worse Apple's C1 modem is versus Qualcomm's equivalent, but superior battery efficiency could be on the cards for iPhone 16e owners. Indeed, Apple is touting 26 hours of video playback, which is certainly an impressive figure.\n\n(Image credit: Future) So what does the iPhone 16e get that makes it worth more than the iPhone SE, besides the latest Apple A18 processor? The addition of FaceID is especially interesting. Unlike basic face unlock methods on Android phones, Apple isn't just using a camera for FaceID. It has specialized hardware that would make it a more expensive proposition for a bargain phone. FaceID needs an infrared emitter to spray your face with invisible dots (you can see them with an infrared camera). Then it has a special camera to read those dots and make a 3D model of your face, which is much more secure than simply reading a photograph of your face. That's why banks have long allowed Apple to use FaceID to unlock banking apps, but Android phones usually won't let you use your face to unlock your bank account. I've used every unlock method, and I'd have to say that Apple's FaceID is the fastest and most reliable by a wide margin. Whatever sacrifices the iPhone 16e makes, Apple clearly felt the super-fast, secure unlock method was worth the trade for bargain hunters.\n\nAn Apple iPhone 5c in green (Image credit: Future) Let's be honest, this is a huge price hike for Apple's bargain iPhone offering. It's a big jump over the iPhone SE (2022), which started at $429 / \u00a3419 / AU$719, but that phone was also more expensive than its predecessor, the iPhone SE (2020), which cost only $399 / \u00a3389 / AU$679. Of course, to be fair to Apple, the original budget iPhone was the iPhone 5c, launched in 2013, and that phone cost $549 / \u00a3469 / AU$739 at launch (wow, sorry GBP :-\u00a3). Also, previous budget iPhone models have skimped on the processing power, and therefore the potential longevity with software updates, compared to the base model iPhone of the same year. It's a very big deal that the iPhone 16e gets an Apple A18 chipset and Apple Intelligence features. Those would have been doubtful for the predicted iPhone SE 4 that did not arrive today.\n\nAn Apple iPod nano in white If the iPhone 16e is drumming up Apple nostalgia for long-time Apple followers, for me it resembles nothing so much as the original (in)Famous iPod nano. I personally loved the nano's look and design, but it replaced the iPod mini, the most popular iPod of all time (thus far). The iPod mini was bright and colorful, available in pink and blue and green. The iPod nano was sleek and professional, available only black and white. The iPod nano was the future, of course, with its solid state storage. I might argue that Apple's incredible investment in the iPod nano and solid state drives drove the price of that technology down faster, and ultimately led to the smartphones and other mobile innovation we have today. It all started with the iPod nano, folks. So, if the iPhone 16e color options make you sad, they don't bring me down. They remind me of an important an influential time for Apple, when it shifted from old and fun to innovative and new.\n\nImage 1 of 1 The Galaxy S25 Edge has two cameras, one less than the Galaxy S25 (Image credit: Future/Viktoria Shilets) One Apple product that the iPhone 16e might foreshadow is the rumored iPhone 17 Air. With Samsung launching a super-slim Galaxy S25 Edge later this year, it is more likely than ever than we'll see an extra-thin iPhone from Apple to answer the long-running rumors. With its single high-resolution, wide aperture camera, the iPhone 16e might be a good model for a thin iPhone 17 Air. Cameras add much of the thickness to today's big phones, so I expect two cameras on an iPhone Air at most, but one great camera with flexible shooting modes, like we see on the new iPhone 16e, would do the trick. Will the iPhone 17 Air arrive looking like a slimmed-down iPhone 16e? We'll find out eventually, if the rumors are true.",

With the arrival of the iPhone 16e and the axing of the iPhone SE from Apple's lineup there's now no longer a device available offering a one-touch Home button (capacitive or otherwise) to return to the homescreen. The button became the home of Touch ID on the iPhone and has been a fixture since Steve Jobs unveiled the very first device back in 2007. But, like all good things, its time has come to an end. If you still like unlocking devices with a finger, you're going to have to pick up one of the best iPads to do so. @tomsguide \u266c Lo-fi hip hop - NAO-K\n\nBuy or skip? (Image credit: Apple) The dust has settled on yesterday's iPhone 16e announcement and we've been analyzing the new device to see if it's worth your time and money. In fact, we've compiled 5 reasons to buy and 3 reasons to skip the iPhone 16e if you're in the market for an upgrade. Things like the full screen design, the camera system and that all-powerful A18 chipset with Apple Intelligence are all big pluses. But this isn't an iPhone SE in the typical style and that $599 price tag may be tough to swallow. It remains to be seen whether the iPhone 16e gets a place on our list of the best cheap phones. Read the full story: iPhone 16e: 5 reasons to buy and 3 reasons to skip\n\nHow to preorder the iPhone 16e (Image credit: Apple) The iPhone 16e was just announced today but the newest iPhone already has several deals available for those who preorder the handset. Apple is offering up to $630 off the iPhone 16e if you trade-in an older iPhone. You can find more deals from network carriers here. As for the smartphone, preorders start on Friday February 21 with the phone released on February 28.\n\nApple Intelligence features will be available on the 16e (Image credit: Future) As part of the iPhone 16e there were questions about whether or not Apple Intelligence would be available. As it turns out with the A18 chip, the 16e will get the full suite of currently available Apple Intelligence features. These include Writing Tools, Image Playground and Genmoji, email summaries and an enhanced Siri with integrated ChatGPT. More will be sure to come as Apple continues its slow rollout of Apple Intelligence.\n\nRedditors react (Image credit: Shutterstock) Out of curiosity we checked in on the r/iphone and r/apple subreddits to see how fans of Apple and the iPhone reacted to the news. The main announcements posts have received hundreds of comments many of them expressing sticker shock at $599, though a number of people seem to believe that the enormous price hike is related to the tariffs instated by President Trump against China and goods manufactured in China. As one Canadian redditor posted, \"People need an affordable phone and iPhone SE was that. Not anymore. lol I was waiting to buy it but the 16 is only 200 CAD more.\" Of course, some people responded that that kind of thinking is the \"trap\" Apple wants you to fall in. MagSafe charging seems to be another point of discussion as Redditors, like us, appear baffled that Apple chose to cut costs there while still raising the. Over on the r/iphone subreddit, one of the most popular posts that isn't the announcement is simply titled, \"The iPhone 16e is a complete rip off.\" Among other things it says, \"What's the point in selling an iPhone 16e, with a worse camera and no dynamic island compared to the 16 for just $100 less? For that price you could just buy a 15 or even just a 16 from most stores.\" It seems people wanted a budget-friendly SE-type phone and at this price point, globally, Apple appears to have a lot of disappointed fans. We'll be curious to see of recent rumors of Apple expecting to sell around 20 million iPhone 16e will come to fruition after this announcement.\n\nWhat you don't get for $599 @tomsguide \u266c Relaxed (Sped Up) - MC Mablo Dos Pared\u00f5es Here's a brief breakdown of what the iPhone 16e features, but also what it appears to be missing, which could put off many from picking up Apple's latest iPhone. Perhaps it's better to snag a refurbished iPhone 15 Pro or the base iPhone 16.\n\nVersatile camera for all types of lighting conditions Image 1 of 4 (Image credit: Apple) (Image credit: Apple) (Image credit: Apple) (Image credit: Apple) I've used all three iPhone SE models for extended periods of time, so I know what it's like having to deal with just a single rear camera. It's no different for the iPhone 16e, but this time it is greeted with a newer 48MP camera that's more versatile than ever before. For only a single rear camera, you can still take portrait photos that capture stunning detail with backgrounds that have that soft out-of-focus look. Unlike the previous SE models, the iPhone 16e features a dedicated night mode that should make it better adapted for challenging lighting conditions. Considering how there was such a disparity in low light performance between the iPhone SE 2022 and Google Pixel 8a, I'm eager to see how much better equipped the is iPhone 16e for nighttime shots.\n\n$100 separates the iPhone 16e and iPhone 15 \u2014 which would you get? (Image credit: Future) Can you believe that $100 separates the price of the iPhone 16e and iPhone 15? With the announcement of the iPhone 16e, it now becomes the cheapest new iPhone that Apple currently sells, as the iPhone SE 2022 is now retired. This one's a lot tougher because of how they're separated by only $100, which will make you think a lot harder on which to choose. For the iPhone 15, it benefits from having a 12MP ultrawide camera that lets users capture more of the scene. It also has Action and Cinematic modes with video capture, which aren't available on the newer iPhone 16e. However, the 16e has access to Apple Intelligence, which adds a wealth of functionality to the phone \u2014 which is made better by the fact it also has the newer A18 chip.\n\nMoving up to 128GB storage is a good step forward (Image credit: Apple) Rumors leading up to the iPhone 16e's reveal hinted that the fourth generation would come with a starting storage capacity of 64GB. That would've been the same as the previous as the iPhone SE 3 before it, but that didn't turn out to be the case. Thankfully, Apple's upgraded it to a more generous 128GB storage with the base model. That's double the amount, giving you more free space than ever before. If that's not enough, you can opt to get it in 256GB or 512GB capacities. Our iPhone 16e vs. iPhone SE 3 comparison breaks down all their biggest differences.\n\nBiggest differences between iPhone 16e vs. iPhone SE 3 (Image credit: Apple) Naturally, it's only right to compare the new versus the old. That's why be break down all the differences in our iPhone 16e vs. iPhone SE 4 comparison to help you determine which could be the better phone. Visually, there's a stark difference with their designs, as the new iPhone 16e grows in size. In turn, it also benefits from having a larger 6.1-inch OLED display and longer battery life. The iPhone 16e also gains an upgraded 48MP rear camera that offers and effective 2x zoom with optical-like quality. And if that's not enough to convince you, the iPhone 16e also has access to many Apple Intelligence features. Then again, there's also the matter of their price differences. There's a lot separating the $429 starting cost of the iPhone SE 3 and the higher $599 one with the iPhone 16e.\n\niPhone 16e has better battery life than the iPhone 16 (Image credit: Apple) Surprisingly, the iPhone 16e has slightly better battery life than the base iPhone 16. Apple typically does not release battery capacity information so we don't know specifically if the 16e battery is larger or different from the 16. However, on Apple's compare page, the 16e is listed as having up to 26 hours of video playback, compared to 22 for the 16. It also has 90 hours of audio playback, 10 more than the 16.\n\niPhone 16e has Wi-Fi 6 \u2014 not Wi-Fi 7 (Image credit: FREEPIK2/Shutterstock) We can confirm that the iPhone 16e will feature the Wi-Fi 6 standard. A slight downgrade from the Wi-Fi 7 that is available on the main iPhone 16 series. Simply, Wi-Fi 6 is slower than Wi-Fi 7, for more details check out our guide to the differences between Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7. We also have an explainer about the Wi-Fi 7 standard and the new features it provides along with faster speeds.\n\nLacking MagSafe may be a deal breaker (Image credit: Tom's Guide) An iPhone that lacks a few features but comes in at a more wallet-friendly price has a lot of appeal. However, it appears Apple chose to omit MagSafe from the iPhone 16e, a potential deal breaker for many. The new iPhone does have a USB-C port and features wireless charging via any Qi charger, but it's much weaker than the 25W that Apple updated MagSafe charging to 25W last year. Perhaps, this won't matter to some, but it's an unfortunate that it's missing either way.\n\nRest in Peace Home Button (Image credit: Apple) With the release of the iPhone 16e \u2014 and the demise of the iPhone 14 and the third-generation iPhone SE \u2014 Apple is now selling an entire lineup of iPhones that do not feature a home button. Fare thee well home button, for those who enjoy buttons, you get the newish Action button that launched on the iPhone 15, but the distinct Home button is no more.\n\n$599 starting cost could be problematic (Image credit: Apple) It's been nearly 3 years since the last iPhone SE model, which actually saw its price increase by $30 to $429. However, Apple has a much wider price gap between the iPhone SE 2022 and iPhone 16e. In fact, it's an increase of $170. The new $599 starting cost of the iPhone 16e makes it a tough sell in the best cheap phones conversation, but there are valid reasons for the price hike. For example, it's sporting a newer design that makes it a bigger phone, complete with a larger 6.1-inch OLED display and bigger battery. There's also double the storage at 128GB starting, versus the previous 64GB. And finally, there's the host of Apple Intelligence features you get.\n\n4K record with Dolby Vision and Audio Mix (Image credit: Apple) If Apple's video sample above from the iPhone 16e is any indication, you can probably expect outstanding results when recording video. The 48MP camera on the back can shoot video at up to 4K 60 fps with Dolby Vision, which appears to deliver wider dynamic range in the video above. Interestingly enough, the iPhone 16e also supports Audio Mix, which allows users to tune the audio to improve the quality.\n\nYes to Face ID, no to Dynamic Island (Image credit: Apple) If you look at the official image of the iPhone 16e above, you can obviously make out the notch on the top of its 6.1-inch OLED display. The components for Face ID are all there, which replaces Touch ID with the previous models. However, what's missing is the Dynamic Island. The iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max were actually the first to debut the Dynamic Island, but the standard iPhone 14 didn't have it. In a way, it makes sense given how the iPhone 16e shares a lot in common with the iPhone 14. Still, it's a bit of a bummer considering how valuable the Dynamic Island is when it comes to notifications and widgets.\n\n2-in-1 48MP Fusion camera offers usable 2x zoom (Image credit: Apple) Despite sticking with just a single rear camera, as opposed to the dual-camera setups on other phones, the iPhone 16e's camera is regarded as a 2-in-1 system due to how its 48MP rear camera can still deliver 2x zoom with optical-like results. We've seen Apple do this before with the pixel binning techniques of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16, which also offers decent 2x zoom by just relying on their main cameras. You can see the sample that Apple shares from this 2x zoom image above, which is still incredibly detailed for what's effectively a digital zoom.\n\nYes, Visual Intelligence is available on the iPhone 16e (Image credit: Apple) Apple loves to keep us all guessing. Many have reported that the iPhone 16e wouldn't have access to Visual Intelligence, one of the marquee Apple Intelligence features only available to iPhones with the Camera Control button. Well, it looks like the iPhone 16e joins the select few that have access to this helpful feature. The iPhone 16e has access to this with the help of the Action Button.\n\nAction Button debuts on iPhone 16e (Image credit: Apple) Leaked images and renders indicated that the iPhone 16e would gain the Action Button, so it's no surprise it's here officially. Even though it's not new, this marks the first time that the SE line gets access to the mappable Action Button. It replaces the alert slider in past iPhone SE models.\n\nNew design with OLED screen, IP68 rating, and longer battery life (Image credit: Apple) Sporting a totally refreshed design, the iPhone 16e features a 6.1-inch Super Retina OLED display, Face ID support, wireless charging, and am IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. Naturally, it looks a lot like the iPhone 14's design. With the battery, Apple says that the iPhone 16e lasts up to six hours longer than iPhone 11 and up to 12 hours longer than all generations of iPhone SE.\n\niPhone 16e is now official, meet the newest member of the family (Image credit: Apple) Apple has finally announced the iPhone 16e, which is essentially the fourth generation model in the company's iPhone SE lineup. Many of the rumored details about the budget phone came true, including an A18 chip, Apple Intelligence, and a 48MP camera. However, the price jumps way up to $599.\n\nHidden clues in Tim Cook's post? Get ready to meet the newest member of the family.Wednesday, February 19. #AppleLaunch pic.twitter.com/0ML0NfMeduFebruary 13, 2025 When Tim Cook shared a post on X about being ready to \"meet the newest member of the family,\" he also shared a short video of what appears to be an animated version of Apple's logo. However, a closer inspection could yield clues that uncover what exactly this new member could be. At a certain point in the short clip, we see a faint circular outline that indicates perhaps a new AirTag. But looking closer at the animation of the Apple logo, we can see a reflection of some kind with edges. It's hard to say if this is the iPhone SE 4 in question, but it could be. All of the rumors over the past week indicate it's going to be the next generation iPhone SE. Apple could officially announce it at any point now that the big day is here. What do you think?\n\niPhone SE 4 \u2014 why OLED will be a big deal (Image credit: Tom's Guide) Every time I turn on my iPhone SE 2022, I'm reminded most about one thing \u2014 its boring looking LCD screen. It's a throwback like no other after years of being accustomed to the OLED panels used in many of the best phones around. That's why an OLED display for the iPhone SE 4 is a big deal. Not only would it make feel more modern, but it could also make it much more usable. The iPhone SE 2022 reached a pitiful peak brightness of 596 nits with its LCD display. In comparison, the iPhone 14 reached 758 nits. Visually speaking, an OLED display on an iPhone SE 4 would make it pop a whole lot more and we suspect even brighter results with the panel.\n\nBigger battery in iPhone SE 4 could be good news Swipe to scroll horizontally Video Playback rating Battery life (Hrs:Mins) iPhone 14 20 hours 9:28 iPhone SE 3 (2022) 15 hours 9:05 iPhone SE 2 (2020) 13 hours 9:18 iPhone SE (2016) 13 hours n/a With the iPhone SE 4 tipped for a big redesign that would make it look a lot more like the iPhone 14, it would also mean having a much larger battery. In fact, it's almost guaranteed to beat its predecessors in the battery life department. In the table above, you'll see how all previous iPhone SE models rank according to Apple's video playback rating. The most recent iPhone SE 3 from 2022 barely made an improvement at 15 hours, while the iPhone 14 goes the extra distance at 20 hours. More importantly, though, is how they compare in our own battery benchmark test. You can see how all the models, including the iPhone 14, barely get over 9 hours from a full charge. Given how the iPhone SE 4 is expected to have an A18 chip, we can certainly expect it to be extremely power efficient. We'd be surprised, in fact, if it ends up getting anything less than 10 hours.\n\nCatch up on all the last-minute rumors with our video iPhone 16e - MAJOR Changes Revealed! - YouTube Watch On Apple could announce the iPhone SE 4 at any moment now, but if you're pressed for time and want all the juicy details, then watch our video on all the last-minute rumors for the anticipated iPhone SE 4. From the new design that it's reportedly going to have, to Apple Intelligence features it could get, our own global editor-in-chief, Mark Spoonauer explains what to expect.\n\nWill it get upgraded video recording capabilities? (Image credit: Tom's Guide) So far, the rumors hint at the iPhone SE 4 getting an upgraded 48MP camera, which would be up from its predecessor's 12MP one. Yet, there's very little know even now about the video recording capabilities of this new camera. At the very least, we suspect it would offer the same shooting modes as the current iPhone SE 2022 \u2014 so that would be 4K video recording at 24 fps, 25 fps, 30 fps, or 60 fps. There's also slow motion, which again we think will match the current model's support for 1080p at 120 fps or 240 fps. It's unclear if Apple will improve on these modes, as they pretty match up what the current iPhone 16 offers. However, it'll be interesting if the iPhone SE 4 ends up getting Cinematic mode for video, which could be problematic due to the lack of an ultrawide camera. Although, Apple could lean on AI to effectively get the same result.\n\nAction Button could debut on an iPhone SE (Image credit: Tom's Guide) The iPhone SE 4 is tipped for big upgrades, like getting an OLED display and 48MP main camera, but one of the new features that could be flying under the radar is the Action Button. Although it's technically not new to the iPhone stable, it is for the SE series. Rumors have hinted at the alert slider being swapped for the Action Button, which should give the iPhone SE 4 more functionality than ever before. With this mappable side button, it can be programmed to perform simple and complex actions. Given the budget nature of the series, this new addition would only amplify its value.\n\niOS 18.4 news today? (Image credit: Future) If the rumors are true, we could see iOS 18.4 launch alongside the iPhone SE 4 / iPhone 16E today. But some of the most exciting promised features may be delayed. iOS 18.4 reportedly was going to include big Apple Intelligence changes, especially to Siri. These include on-screen awareness, better understanding of personal context and deep app control. However, this may not happen now until iOS 18.5. We could see Apple Intelligence roll out in more languages, though, along with improved news summaries, new emoji and the ability to set your default map and translation apps (at least in the EU).\n\nThe first phone with Apple's own 5G modem (with a catch) (Image credit: @SonnyDickson on X) There's potentially good news and bad news with the iPhone SE 4's modem. The good news is that it should be Apple's first in-house 5G modem, and with Apple in total control of that hardware we could see longer battery life when surfing the web. However, a recent report out of South Korea (via GSM Arena) says that Apple's modem will lack support for mmWave 5G and perhaps offer fewer carrier aggregation features as Qualcomm's latest modem. The result could be slower upload and download speeds, something we'll be testing for ourselves at Tom's Guide.\n\nThe iPhone SE 4's competition (Image credit: Tom's Guide) Assuming that the iPhone SE 4 does stick to a similar price as before, then it'll be eligible for our best cheap phones guide. And although these are far from flagship phones, there are still some real contenders. The current top dog is the Google Pixel 8a, an Android phone that offers a bevy of features and a long software update schedule, plus an AI-ready chipset and strong display and camera specs. It's going to be hard to dethrone the Pixel, but if Apple's made enough changes to the new iPhone SE, it's possible it could claim the top spot for itself \u2014 or at least climb several places.\n\nA true member of the iPhone 16 family (Image credit: Future) Whatever Apple calls the new cheap iPhone, it was assumed for a long time that it would be using the body of the iPhone 14, as well as several of its components inside and out. But new rumors are now suggesting that the iPhone 16E properly merits the name as it would be based on the latest iPhone 16 model instead of the two-year-old iPhone 14. Granted, without an Action Button or a Dynamic Island, the only real difference the iPhone SE 4 would have from an iPhone 14 is the USB-C port and the unique camera layout. But using a more modern basis for the new SE would help futureproof the new budget iPhone for longer.\n\nSE might stand for Sales Explosion (Image credit: Majin Bu) Whatever the iPhone SE 4 ends up offering, it's likely to be a big seller, with analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicting that the new iPhone SE will hit 22 million units sold by the end of the year. This would make sense given the likely sub-$500 pricing. Buying a new iPhone is an expensive undertaking, so if a new one appears with a more easily justifiable cost, it could persuade a lot of holdouts into switching iPhones.\n\nA fresh MacBook Air (Image credit: Tom's Guide) A new MacBook Air armed with an M4 chip like the latest MacBook Pros and iPad Pro could also be on the cards for today, or at least arrive within the next month. No other big changes are believed to be coming to Apple's lightweight laptop, which is presumably why it's tipped to get a low-key launch announcement. But using Apple's latest silicon would mean a nice performance bump, helping the MacBook Air fare better against similar machines like the Snapdragon X Elite-powered Dell XPS 13 or Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x.\n\nA whole new HomePod (Image credit: Future) Leaving the iPhone SE 4 to the side for a moment, today could see big changes to other Apple products. The HomePod, Apple's smart speaker, last got an update in 2023, but is effectively the same kind of product as it was before. But the new HomePod 3 (or perhaps HomePad) could change things up dramatically by adding a display to the speaker, in the style of an Amazon Echo Show or the Google Pixel Tablet.\n\nLeaving Lightning behind (Image credit: Future) Another feature the iPhone SE 4 could abandon is the Lightning port, Apple's proprietary charging connector that was in regular use up until the iPhone 15 series. With the EU having passed legislation requiring all mobile devices to use a common charging standard, Apple has fallen in line with its Android rivals and adopted USB-C. This is the connector we should see on the iPhone SE 4, even though the iPhone 14 it's based on still came with Lightning. Just like with Touch ID, the iPhone SE series has been carrying the torch for this outdated Apple tech for the past few years by itself. While the move to USB-C has been pretty smooth and certainly makes charging easier, it's funny to think we're seeing the end of Lightning for good.\n\nToodleoo to Touch ID (Image credit: Future) The rumored move to a whole new design for the iPhone SE means we could end up with an iPhone line-up without any models using the Touch ID home button. Touch ID has been used on iPhones since the iPhone 5s launched in 2013, although the arrival of Face ID in 2017 with the iPhone X made it clear that its days were numbered. While it will live on through the iPad and iPad Air's power button-mounted versions and also the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Magic Keyboard, Apple only selling iPhones using Face ID is a historic moment.\n\nA new price point could be a big deal (Image credit: 4RMD / YouTube / Apple) Price is always an important consideration when buying phones, and the price of the new iPhone SE could be make or break. The current $430 price of the iPhone SE 3 places it firmly within our best cheap phones guide, and about half as much as the cheapest flagship iPhone 16. But if Apple bumps the price up to compensate for all the upgrades the new model is tipped to offer, then things could quickly change. Phones like the Nothing Phone 2a or Samsung Galaxy A35 offer superb specs for their costs, and the iPhone SE 4 sounds like it won't be able to fully compete based on other rumors. It would still be cheaper than other iPhones, but it may not be a true budget-friendly phone.\n\niPhone SE or 16E? (Image credit: Apple) We've assumed for a long time that Apple would continue with the iPhone SE name, making this rumored new model the iPhone SE 4 or iPhone SE 2025. But tipsters, including Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, who point to Tim Cook's announcement as possible evidence of a name swap to iPhone 16E. Describing the contents of the launch as \"the newest member of the family\" could mean a number of things. But with the existing rumors of the iPhone 16E name circulating, it could mean Apple retires the SE title and instead markets the new cheaper iPhone as a fully-fledged member of the iPhone 16 series. If that's the case, that could be good news for features and software, as Apple would probably not compare a vastly underpowered phone to its latest flagship models.\n\niPhone SE origins (Image credit: Tom's Guide) Good morning, and happy Apple day! This is TG\u2019s Assistant Phones Editor Richard Priday, and I\u2019ll be steering this live blog for the early shift. Today could be the day we see the first new iPhone SE in about three years, as well as the first update to Apple\u2019s AirTag trackers. We may even hear about upgrades to the Apple Vision Pro or MacBook Air, or maybe even some changes to the HomePod. But we\u2019ll get into those properly as the morning goes on. The iPhone SE 2022, in case you're not familiar, is based on the iPhone 8 from 2017 - an aging design that Apple really should have replaced before now! Instead, the new iPhone SE is thought to use the shell of the iPhone 14 from 2022, but with a few changes that both improve its capabilities and tone down some other specs.\n\niPhone SE 4 colors \u2014 it might be just two options (Image credit: Future) The iPhone SE series has never been greeted with many color options, which is to say that it might not be that different for the rumored iPhone SE 4. Currently, the iPhone SE 3 (the 2022 version) is available in three options: Midnight, Starlight, and Product Red. According to known leaker Majin Bu, the iPhone SE 4 will be available in white or black. That's probably accurate, but you can't count out on Apple bringing out a Product Red version at some point. The only outlier in the series was the original iPhone SE, which was available in four colors: silver, gold, space grey, and rose gold.\n\nThe countdown has begun (Image credit: Future) And here we are! February 19 is the day that Tim Cook mentioned when we'll \"meet the latest member of the family.\" All fingers point at a possible iPhone SE 4 reveal, which could be rebranded as the iPhone 16E. Nevertheless, we'll know before the day's over as to what Apple's expected to reveal. Aside from the iPhone SE 4, Apple's announcement could also be related to something else entirely different. Perhaps we'll get a new HomePod with an integrated display? Or perhaps a much-needed upgrade for the company's popular AirTag?\n\niPhone SE 4 vs. iPhone 17 \u2014 should you hold off until the fall? (Image credit: 4RMD / Majin Bu) There's a good probability that Apple will formally reveal the iPhone SE 4 at the company's expected announcement on February 19. This would mean that shoppers could pick it up very soon, but there's also the iPhone 17 to think about as well. In our iPhone SE 4 vs. iPhone 17 comparison, we take all the rumors and everything we know about both unannounced phones and compare them. Even though we're still a long away before an iPhone 17 reveal at perhaps Apple's fall iPhone event, there's enough leaks and rumors that give us a preview of what to expect. Given how Apple's kept the pricing of its standard iPhone model at $799, this would effectively make it $300 more than the rumored $499 cost of the iPhone SE 4. There's a lot to mull over that price difference, but we try to break it all down.\n\niPhone SE 4 might not get this Apple Intelligence feature (Image credit: Future) The iPhone SE 4 is probably on track to offer Apple Intelligence features, especially given how it's rumored to be powered by an A18 chip under the hood. That's the same chipset running on the current iPhone 16, which is built from the ground for AI. While we're confident that this would mean getting access to Apple Intelligence features as the new Siri, Photo Clean Up, Writing Tools, and more, there is probably one that it won't get. That would be Visual Intelligence, due to how the Camera Control button is tied to the feature \u2014 something that doesn't appear to be coming in the iPhone SE 4.\n\nLong, overdue upgrade to the HomePod? (Image credit: Apple) There's been whispers about a potential new HomePod, which could very well be the gadget in question that Tim Cook's referring to in his post on X. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed in December that this new HomePod could feature a \"6 to 7-inch OLED\" display. However, he went on to sat that it could be delayed into the Q3 2025. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman also went on to say that this new HomePod is likely to launch this year. He described the new home hub as \"the most significant release of the year.\" Of course, this would be an ambitious release given how it would be the first time for Apple to explore a new product category. Right now, the closest thing to a home hub of sorts is StandBy Mode on the iPhone, but this would be a standalone device much like the Amazon Echo Show.\n\nThis could be a dealbreaker for the iPhone SE 4 (Image credit: Toranji) In the three years since Apple released the iPhone SE 2022, there's no denying that there's going to be a fair amount of upgrades in store for the iPhone SE 4. Yet, there's could be one dealbreaker that could lead some to not buy it. A Chinese retailer accidentally listed the phone in question, with a clear indication that it would be sporting 8GB of RAM and 64GB storage. Both are pitiful by today's standards, with the 8GB of RAM being the bare minimum to run Apple Intelligence features, but the 64GB of storage would be laughable for a phone that's likely to be $499.\n\nRetailer accidentally posts new iPhone listing (Image credit: Boulanger) More confirmation about a potential iPhone SE 4 release comes from an accidental listing from French retailer Boulanger. While the placeholder doesn't explicitly mention the iPhone SE 4, it does translate to \"Smartphone Apple new smartphone coming soon iPhone.\" Another tidbit from the accidental listing includes the price, which at \u20ac9,999.05 (~$10,395) appears to be yet just another placeholder until it's confirmed. We expect the actual cost to be around $499, which would be an increase of $70 over the last iPhone SE 2022.\n\nBiggest rumored iPhone SE 4 upgrades make for a satisfying return (Image credit: Majin Bu) Speaking of iPhone SE 4 rumors, there's a lot for Apple to change since the iPhone SE 2022's release three years ago. Apple's going to need to make a lot of big changes if the iPhone SE 4 has a chance at beating some of our favorite best cheap phones. We detail all the big upgrades that could come to the iPhone SE 4, like a new Apple A18 chip, improved camera, OLED screen, and much more. Based on all the leaks and rumors, it should adopt the iPhone 14's design.\n\niPhone SE 4 could set a sales record (Image credit: Future) Even before it's announced, there's optimism about the fourth generation iPhone SE model as analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that Apple could ship 10 million units in the first half of 2025. he goes on to say that it could be \"performing slightly better than previous SE models.\" This record breaking mark isn't a surprise given how it's been years since the last model, with a span of three years. Paired with a much lower cost than the cheapest iPhone 16, consumers might be attracted to pick up the iPhone SE 4. Of course, there are going to be tradeoffs going with a cheaper model, but it'll be interesting to see what Apple Intelligence features that the company decides to roll out to it.",

That\u2019s a lot of stuff to keep track of, especially if you\u2019re a forgetful sort. But all of these things and many more are ideal uses for Apple AirTags, which are on sale right now at Amazon. Save 21% on the price of a single AirTag, now just $23, or go big and save 29% on a 4-pack of AirTags for just $70.\n\nSee AirTag at Amazon\n\nSee AirTags (4-Pack) at Amazon\n\nEven if you\u2019re not an iPhone user, Apple AirTags are among the very best tracking devices available. And if you are an iPhone, iPad, or MacBook user, AirTags are virtually indispensable because of how accurately they track your missing items and how easily they lead you back to them.\n\nAll Your Stuff in One App\n\nThere are hundreds or even thousands of ways to attach an AirTag to basically anything you want to keep track of, either direct from Apple or from Amazon. Holders that allow you secure your AirTag to a backpack, purse, keychain and more mean you can use the Find My app on your iPhone or iPad to track as many items as you have AirTags for. Non-Apple users can download Apple\u2019s Tracker Detect app to locate AirTags.\n\nOnce you pair your AirTag to your device \u2014 and with iOS it\u2019s a one-tap process \u2014 you can locate your AirTag with incredible accuracy. Any iPhone from the 11 on has the U1 chip which enables Ultra Wideband mode, which lets you use Precision Finding mode to hunt down the lost item with the AirTag attached. Your phone will let you know if you\u2019re getting hotter or colder, and give you a location down to the foot. The AirTag will also play sounds on command to make your hunt easier.\n\nWhere to Use AirTags\n\nThat\u2019s actually the wrong question \u2014 it should be where not to use them, and there are few if any answers there. Wallets and handbags, car keys, and luggage are the obvious ones. If you\u2019re one of the vast number of people who has a difficult time finding your car in a large parking lot or garage, keep an AirTag in the glove compartment or trunk, and the Find My app will lead you to your wheels. There are special dog and cat collars with AirTag holders should your furry friend get lost. The possibilities, as the saying goes, are endless.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve come up with your list of things you would rather not lose, head to Amazon and pick up as many AirTags as you need while they\u2019re on sale. Single AirTags are $23, and 4-packs are $70. Every one of them is worth the price if it can lead you back to a lost valuable just once.\n\nSee AirTag at Amazon\n\nSee AirTags (4-Pack) at Amazon",

            "content": "The Apple Studio Display is expected to get an upgrade in the not-too-distant future. Here's what the rumor mill has claimed will be coming.\n\nThe Apple Studio Display was launched back in early 2022, making it almost three years old at the time of publication. After a stumbling start, the display has received many firmware updates, improving its capabilities over time.\n\nHowever, the rumor mill constantly believes that there will be a hardware update on the horizon for the model. One that will bring more features to the premium monitor in its second-gen release.\n\nThis is what has been claimed by the rumor mill about the next iteration of Apple's second-most expensive display.\n\nA switch to MiniLED\n\nThe current backlighting system of the Apple Studio Display uses rows of LEDs, which shine through a TFT LCD layer. For a second-gen model, Apple is believed to be switching the tech used for backlighting from LED to MiniLED.\n\nThe idea is that Apple could use many hundreds of MiniLEDs for the backlighting, allowing for a more even level of light being emitted to the user's eyes. With the strategic use of localized dimming, the display could feasibly make sections of the screen much darker than an LED backlight could manage, allowing for much deeper blacks and dark shades of color to be used.\n\nWhile not quite to the level of OLED on that front, it should be fairly close without the expense.\n\nMiniLED could give Apple Studio Display a brighter and more vibrant screen.\n\nRumors on the MiniLED version have circulated not that long after the launch of the original model. Going back to May 2022, Display Supply Chain Consultants analyst Ross Young insisted that a 27-inch MiniLED monitor was to be produced by Quanta, but COVID-19 lockdowns derailed the plans.\n\nYoung also said the display was on track for an October 2022 release. Later in the year, Young said an early 2023 release was on the cards, but that too didn't happen.\n\nBy February 2023, Young said that there were no signs of the display entering mass production, and so a release wasn't imminent.\n\nIn April of the same year, Young then said Apple had \"killed off the 27-inch display completely.\" While Apple had made some supply chain progress in 2022, it was paused \"at least for now.\"\n\nJust one day later, TF Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo proposed that the screen was to enter mass production in 2024 or early 2025, complete with the MiniLED backplane.\n\nThings went pretty quiet about the new Apple Studio Display until February 2025, when Young raised the prospect of the display once again, complete with Mini LED.\n\nResolutions and sizing\n\nThe current Apple Studio Display has a 5K Retina screen, with a resolution of 5,120 by 2,880. The next one may be a lot higher than that.\n\nThe monitor was said back in March 2022 to have a 7K display. This works out to be a lot higher than the 6K panel used in the Pro Display XDR.\n\nAt the time, the high resolution was thought to mean Apple was planning to change the size of the screen. At 32 inches, this would give the new monitor a pixel density of 245ppi, higher than the 218ppi of both monitors.\n\nA 7K Apple Studio Display would have a higher resolution than the Pro Display XDR.\n\nFor Apple to reuse the 218ppi pixel density, a 7K screen would have to measure at around 36 inches.\n\nThe early 2025 rumors, however, indicate that Apple would be using the same size of display as the existing model. Young's claim was that the focus would be on the backlighting change, while retaining the 27-inch size and 5K resolution.\n\nA February 2025 rumor from Bloomberg also said that the new model will be \"roughly\" the same size of screen.\n\nProMotion\n\nBoth the Pro Display XDR and Apple Studio Display have a maximum refresh rate of 60Hz. The next display may go further than that.\n\nIn November 2024, an anonymous rumor sent to the Upgrade podcast claimed that Apple would be upping the refresh rate to 90Hz in a new model.\n\nDue to the nature of anonymous rumors, there's no way to determine the track record of the leaker, or whether it is valid.\n\nThe Apple Studio Display has a 60Hz refresh rate. ProMotion could increase it.\n\nProMotion was brought up in Young's February 2025 claim, mentioning the feature by name., but not the refresh rates involved.\n\nAs a feature, ProMotion on an iPad Pro or a Pro-grade iPhone can go up to 120Hz. It's also an adaptive refresh rate, which can change from the highest to very low rates, depending on the content being viewed.\n\nIt's plausible that a 120Hz refresh rate could be used on a new monitor, as other displays on the market can go even higher than that.\n\nThunderbolt 5\n\nThe rest of the specifications of the new Apple Studio Display are pretty much unknown, but it's likely to follow the same formula as the existing model. For example, having an onboard A-series chip to handle processing duties, as well as the image signal processing of the built-in webcam.\n\nHowever, there are two features that are entirely plausible for Apple to employ in a future display, even if they're not brought up in rumors.\n\nThunderbolt 5 would help give more bandwidth to devices connected to the Apple Studio Display\n\nThe first is Thunderbolt 5, the latest connectivity standard Apple is starting to use in its hardware, such as the M4 Mac mini. With it being incorporated into Mac and MacBook Pro models, it makes sense for support to be included in a new display.\n\nWhile Thunderbolt 4 offers up to 40Gbps of bandwidth, Thunderbolt 5 provides a lot more.\n\nFor a start, Thunderbolt 5 can handle 80Gbps of bi-directional bandwidth, or up to 120Gbps for asynchronous connections. This latter one is intended for video-intensive usage rather than pure data.\n\nPart of that can be explained by the capabilities of each connection. Thunderbolt 4 can handle a single 8K-resolution screen or two 4K screens at 60Hz.\n\nThunderbolt 5 can deal with multiple 8K displays at once, or three 4K screens at 144Hz. When pushed, it could even support a single display at up to 540Hz.\n\nThen there's power, with Thunderbolt 4 supporting 100W and Thunderbolt 5 dealing with up to 240W through a single cable.\n\nAdding Thunderbolt 5 is a no-brainer for Apple, especially since the bandwidth can be used by other Thunderbolt devices connecting to the display and using its connection.\n\nCurves\n\nThe other plausible option is more unlikely, but there's still an outside chance: a curved screen.\n\nIn February 2024, Apple applied for a patent titled \"Privacy Films for Curved Displays,\" a revision of an already granted patent in 2023.\n\nA dedicated display could be curved, unlike a MacBook Pro screen.\n\nThe patent specifically referred to a covering layer on the curved screen, similar to a polarizing film that limits the output to someone sitting in a specific spot.\n\nWhile not discussing the production of a curved display, and not serving as evidence that one's on the way, it does at least indicate someone within Apple has thought about it.\n\nIt's also quite reasonable to think about Apple creating a curved display separate to a Mac. With the exception of the all-in-one design of the 24-inch iMac, the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air are notebooks, and therefore they require the use of flat displays.\n\nIf Apple were to create a curved screen, one of its external monitors or a future iMac are the most likely candidates to use one.\n\nArrival time\n\nObviously, Apple's release schedule is shrouded in mystery, and we usually have to look at release patterns to properly estimate the next model's introduction. However, for the Apple Studio Display and even the Pro Display XDR, there haven't been any second-gen releases, making pattern-spotting impossible.\n\nThe Apple Studio Display will almost certainly include a webcam in an updated model.\n\nWhat we do have are the best guesses of rumor merchants. This is relatively unscientific and unreliable, especially considering previous claims of a release have already passed by the dates without a new model launch.\n\nThe current rumors as of February 2025 has Young claiming an introduction later in 2025. By contrast, Bloomberg said a few days later that an actual release will instead occur in 2026, with it marketed as a companion item to an M5 MacBook Pro.\n\nIn either case, consumers wanting a new Apple Studio Display have a long wait ahead of them. That is, if the rumors turn out to be correct this time.",

With the arrival of the iPhone 16e and the axing of the iPhone SE from Apple's lineup there's now no longer a device available offering a one-touch Home button (capacitive or otherwise) to return to the homescreen. The button became the home of Touch ID on the iPhone and has been a fixture since Steve Jobs unveiled the very first device back in 2007. But, like all good things, its time has come to an end. If you still like unlocking devices with a finger, you're going to have to pick up one of the best iPads to do so. @tomsguide \u266c Lo-fi hip hop - NAO-K\n\nBuy or skip? (Image credit: Apple) The dust has settled on yesterday's iPhone 16e announcement and we've been analyzing the new device to see if it's worth your time and money. In fact, we've compiled 5 reasons to buy and 3 reasons to skip the iPhone 16e if you're in the market for an upgrade. Things like the full screen design, the camera system and that all-powerful A18 chipset with Apple Intelligence are all big pluses. But this isn't an iPhone SE in the typical style and that $599 price tag may be tough to swallow. It remains to be seen whether the iPhone 16e gets a place on our list of the best cheap phones. Read the full story: iPhone 16e: 5 reasons to buy and 3 reasons to skip\n\nHow to preorder the iPhone 16e (Image credit: Apple) The iPhone 16e was just announced today but the newest iPhone already has several deals available for those who preorder the handset. Apple is offering up to $630 off the iPhone 16e if you trade-in an older iPhone. You can find more deals from network carriers here. As for the smartphone, preorders start on Friday February 21 with the phone released on February 28.\n\nApple Intelligence features will be available on the 16e (Image credit: Future) As part of the iPhone 16e there were questions about whether or not Apple Intelligence would be available. As it turns out with the A18 chip, the 16e will get the full suite of currently available Apple Intelligence features. These include Writing Tools, Image Playground and Genmoji, email summaries and an enhanced Siri with integrated ChatGPT. More will be sure to come as Apple continues its slow rollout of Apple Intelligence.\n\nRedditors react (Image credit: Shutterstock) Out of curiosity we checked in on the r/iphone and r/apple subreddits to see how fans of Apple and the iPhone reacted to the news. The main announcements posts have received hundreds of comments many of them expressing sticker shock at $599, though a number of people seem to believe that the enormous price hike is related to the tariffs instated by President Trump against China and goods manufactured in China. As one Canadian redditor posted, \"People need an affordable phone and iPhone SE was that. Not anymore. lol I was waiting to buy it but the 16 is only 200 CAD more.\" Of course, some people responded that that kind of thinking is the \"trap\" Apple wants you to fall in. MagSafe charging seems to be another point of discussion as Redditors, like us, appear baffled that Apple chose to cut costs there while still raising the. Over on the r/iphone subreddit, one of the most popular posts that isn't the announcement is simply titled, \"The iPhone 16e is a complete rip off.\" Among other things it says, \"What's the point in selling an iPhone 16e, with a worse camera and no dynamic island compared to the 16 for just $100 less? For that price you could just buy a 15 or even just a 16 from most stores.\" It seems people wanted a budget-friendly SE-type phone and at this price point, globally, Apple appears to have a lot of disappointed fans. We'll be curious to see of recent rumors of Apple expecting to sell around 20 million iPhone 16e will come to fruition after this announcement.\n\nWhat you don't get for $599 @tomsguide \u266c Relaxed (Sped Up) - MC Mablo Dos Pared\u00f5es Here's a brief breakdown of what the iPhone 16e features, but also what it appears to be missing, which could put off many from picking up Apple's latest iPhone. Perhaps it's better to snag a refurbished iPhone 15 Pro or the base iPhone 16.\n\nVersatile camera for all types of lighting conditions Image 1 of 4 (Image credit: Apple) (Image credit: Apple) (Image credit: Apple) (Image credit: Apple) I've used all three iPhone SE models for extended periods of time, so I know what it's like having to deal with just a single rear camera. It's no different for the iPhone 16e, but this time it is greeted with a newer 48MP camera that's more versatile than ever before. For only a single rear camera, you can still take portrait photos that capture stunning detail with backgrounds that have that soft out-of-focus look. Unlike the previous SE models, the iPhone 16e features a dedicated night mode that should make it better adapted for challenging lighting conditions. Considering how there was such a disparity in low light performance between the iPhone SE 2022 and Google Pixel 8a, I'm eager to see how much better equipped the is iPhone 16e for nighttime shots.\n\n$100 separates the iPhone 16e and iPhone 15 \u2014 which would you get? (Image credit: Future) Can you believe that $100 separates the price of the iPhone 16e and iPhone 15? With the announcement of the iPhone 16e, it now becomes the cheapest new iPhone that Apple currently sells, as the iPhone SE 2022 is now retired. This one's a lot tougher because of how they're separated by only $100, which will make you think a lot harder on which to choose. For the iPhone 15, it benefits from having a 12MP ultrawide camera that lets users capture more of the scene. It also has Action and Cinematic modes with video capture, which aren't available on the newer iPhone 16e. However, the 16e has access to Apple Intelligence, which adds a wealth of functionality to the phone \u2014 which is made better by the fact it also has the newer A18 chip.\n\nMoving up to 128GB storage is a good step forward (Image credit: Apple) Rumors leading up to the iPhone 16e's reveal hinted that the fourth generation would come with a starting storage capacity of 64GB. That would've been the same as the previous as the iPhone SE 3 before it, but that didn't turn out to be the case. Thankfully, Apple's upgraded it to a more generous 128GB storage with the base model. That's double the amount, giving you more free space than ever before. If that's not enough, you can opt to get it in 256GB or 512GB capacities. Our iPhone 16e vs. iPhone SE 3 comparison breaks down all their biggest differences.\n\nBiggest differences between iPhone 16e vs. iPhone SE 3 (Image credit: Apple) Naturally, it's only right to compare the new versus the old. That's why be break down all the differences in our iPhone 16e vs. iPhone SE 4 comparison to help you determine which could be the better phone. Visually, there's a stark difference with their designs, as the new iPhone 16e grows in size. In turn, it also benefits from having a larger 6.1-inch OLED display and longer battery life. The iPhone 16e also gains an upgraded 48MP rear camera that offers and effective 2x zoom with optical-like quality. And if that's not enough to convince you, the iPhone 16e also has access to many Apple Intelligence features. Then again, there's also the matter of their price differences. There's a lot separating the $429 starting cost of the iPhone SE 3 and the higher $599 one with the iPhone 16e.\n\niPhone 16e has better battery life than the iPhone 16 (Image credit: Apple) Surprisingly, the iPhone 16e has slightly better battery life than the base iPhone 16. Apple typically does not release battery capacity information so we don't know specifically if the 16e battery is larger or different from the 16. However, on Apple's compare page, the 16e is listed as having up to 26 hours of video playback, compared to 22 for the 16. It also has 90 hours of audio playback, 10 more than the 16.\n\niPhone 16e has Wi-Fi 6 \u2014 not Wi-Fi 7 (Image credit: FREEPIK2/Shutterstock) We can confirm that the iPhone 16e will feature the Wi-Fi 6 standard. A slight downgrade from the Wi-Fi 7 that is available on the main iPhone 16 series. Simply, Wi-Fi 6 is slower than Wi-Fi 7, for more details check out our guide to the differences between Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7. We also have an explainer about the Wi-Fi 7 standard and the new features it provides along with faster speeds.\n\nLacking MagSafe may be a deal breaker (Image credit: Tom's Guide) An iPhone that lacks a few features but comes in at a more wallet-friendly price has a lot of appeal. However, it appears Apple chose to omit MagSafe from the iPhone 16e, a potential deal breaker for many. The new iPhone does have a USB-C port and features wireless charging via any Qi charger, but it's much weaker than the 25W that Apple updated MagSafe charging to 25W last year. Perhaps, this won't matter to some, but it's an unfortunate that it's missing either way.\n\nRest in Peace Home Button (Image credit: Apple) With the release of the iPhone 16e \u2014 and the demise of the iPhone 14 and the third-generation iPhone SE \u2014 Apple is now selling an entire lineup of iPhones that do not feature a home button. Fare thee well home button, for those who enjoy buttons, you get the newish Action button that launched on the iPhone 15, but the distinct Home button is no more.\n\n$599 starting cost could be problematic (Image credit: Apple) It's been nearly 3 years since the last iPhone SE model, which actually saw its price increase by $30 to $429. However, Apple has a much wider price gap between the iPhone SE 2022 and iPhone 16e. In fact, it's an increase of $170. The new $599 starting cost of the iPhone 16e makes it a tough sell in the best cheap phones conversation, but there are valid reasons for the price hike. For example, it's sporting a newer design that makes it a bigger phone, complete with a larger 6.1-inch OLED display and bigger battery. There's also double the storage at 128GB starting, versus the previous 64GB. And finally, there's the host of Apple Intelligence features you get.\n\n4K record with Dolby Vision and Audio Mix (Image credit: Apple) If Apple's video sample above from the iPhone 16e is any indication, you can probably expect outstanding results when recording video. The 48MP camera on the back can shoot video at up to 4K 60 fps with Dolby Vision, which appears to deliver wider dynamic range in the video above. Interestingly enough, the iPhone 16e also supports Audio Mix, which allows users to tune the audio to improve the quality.\n\nYes to Face ID, no to Dynamic Island (Image credit: Apple) If you look at the official image of the iPhone 16e above, you can obviously make out the notch on the top of its 6.1-inch OLED display. The components for Face ID are all there, which replaces Touch ID with the previous models. However, what's missing is the Dynamic Island. The iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max were actually the first to debut the Dynamic Island, but the standard iPhone 14 didn't have it. In a way, it makes sense given how the iPhone 16e shares a lot in common with the iPhone 14. Still, it's a bit of a bummer considering how valuable the Dynamic Island is when it comes to notifications and widgets.\n\n2-in-1 48MP Fusion camera offers usable 2x zoom (Image credit: Apple) Despite sticking with just a single rear camera, as opposed to the dual-camera setups on other phones, the iPhone 16e's camera is regarded as a 2-in-1 system due to how its 48MP rear camera can still deliver 2x zoom with optical-like results. We've seen Apple do this before with the pixel binning techniques of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16, which also offers decent 2x zoom by just relying on their main cameras. You can see the sample that Apple shares from this 2x zoom image above, which is still incredibly detailed for what's effectively a digital zoom.\n\nYes, Visual Intelligence is available on the iPhone 16e (Image credit: Apple) Apple loves to keep us all guessing. Many have reported that the iPhone 16e wouldn't have access to Visual Intelligence, one of the marquee Apple Intelligence features only available to iPhones with the Camera Control button. Well, it looks like the iPhone 16e joins the select few that have access to this helpful feature. The iPhone 16e has access to this with the help of the Action Button.\n\nAction Button debuts on iPhone 16e (Image credit: Apple) Leaked images and renders indicated that the iPhone 16e would gain the Action Button, so it's no surprise it's here officially. Even though it's not new, this marks the first time that the SE line gets access to the mappable Action Button. It replaces the alert slider in past iPhone SE models.\n\nNew design with OLED screen, IP68 rating, and longer battery life (Image credit: Apple) Sporting a totally refreshed design, the iPhone 16e features a 6.1-inch Super Retina OLED display, Face ID support, wireless charging, and am IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. Naturally, it looks a lot like the iPhone 14's design. With the battery, Apple says that the iPhone 16e lasts up to six hours longer than iPhone 11 and up to 12 hours longer than all generations of iPhone SE.\n\niPhone 16e is now official, meet the newest member of the family (Image credit: Apple) Apple has finally announced the iPhone 16e, which is essentially the fourth generation model in the company's iPhone SE lineup. Many of the rumored details about the budget phone came true, including an A18 chip, Apple Intelligence, and a 48MP camera. However, the price jumps way up to $599.\n\nHidden clues in Tim Cook's post? Get ready to meet the newest member of the family.Wednesday, February 19. #AppleLaunch pic.twitter.com/0ML0NfMeduFebruary 13, 2025 When Tim Cook shared a post on X about being ready to \"meet the newest member of the family,\" he also shared a short video of what appears to be an animated version of Apple's logo. However, a closer inspection could yield clues that uncover what exactly this new member could be. At a certain point in the short clip, we see a faint circular outline that indicates perhaps a new AirTag. But looking closer at the animation of the Apple logo, we can see a reflection of some kind with edges. It's hard to say if this is the iPhone SE 4 in question, but it could be. All of the rumors over the past week indicate it's going to be the next generation iPhone SE. Apple could officially announce it at any point now that the big day is here. What do you think?\n\niPhone SE 4 \u2014 why OLED will be a big deal (Image credit: Tom's Guide) Every time I turn on my iPhone SE 2022, I'm reminded most about one thing \u2014 its boring looking LCD screen. It's a throwback like no other after years of being accustomed to the OLED panels used in many of the best phones around. That's why an OLED display for the iPhone SE 4 is a big deal. Not only would it make feel more modern, but it could also make it much more usable. The iPhone SE 2022 reached a pitiful peak brightness of 596 nits with its LCD display. In comparison, the iPhone 14 reached 758 nits. Visually speaking, an OLED display on an iPhone SE 4 would make it pop a whole lot more and we suspect even brighter results with the panel.\n\nBigger battery in iPhone SE 4 could be good news Swipe to scroll horizontally Video Playback rating Battery life (Hrs:Mins) iPhone 14 20 hours 9:28 iPhone SE 3 (2022) 15 hours 9:05 iPhone SE 2 (2020) 13 hours 9:18 iPhone SE (2016) 13 hours n/a With the iPhone SE 4 tipped for a big redesign that would make it look a lot more like the iPhone 14, it would also mean having a much larger battery. In fact, it's almost guaranteed to beat its predecessors in the battery life department. In the table above, you'll see how all previous iPhone SE models rank according to Apple's video playback rating. The most recent iPhone SE 3 from 2022 barely made an improvement at 15 hours, while the iPhone 14 goes the extra distance at 20 hours. More importantly, though, is how they compare in our own battery benchmark test. You can see how all the models, including the iPhone 14, barely get over 9 hours from a full charge. Given how the iPhone SE 4 is expected to have an A18 chip, we can certainly expect it to be extremely power efficient. We'd be surprised, in fact, if it ends up getting anything less than 10 hours.\n\nCatch up on all the last-minute rumors with our video iPhone 16e - MAJOR Changes Revealed! - YouTube Watch On Apple could announce the iPhone SE 4 at any moment now, but if you're pressed for time and want all the juicy details, then watch our video on all the last-minute rumors for the anticipated iPhone SE 4. From the new design that it's reportedly going to have, to Apple Intelligence features it could get, our own global editor-in-chief, Mark Spoonauer explains what to expect.\n\nWill it get upgraded video recording capabilities? (Image credit: Tom's Guide) So far, the rumors hint at the iPhone SE 4 getting an upgraded 48MP camera, which would be up from its predecessor's 12MP one. Yet, there's very little know even now about the video recording capabilities of this new camera. At the very least, we suspect it would offer the same shooting modes as the current iPhone SE 2022 \u2014 so that would be 4K video recording at 24 fps, 25 fps, 30 fps, or 60 fps. There's also slow motion, which again we think will match the current model's support for 1080p at 120 fps or 240 fps. It's unclear if Apple will improve on these modes, as they pretty match up what the current iPhone 16 offers. However, it'll be interesting if the iPhone SE 4 ends up getting Cinematic mode for video, which could be problematic due to the lack of an ultrawide camera. Although, Apple could lean on AI to effectively get the same result.\n\nAction Button could debut on an iPhone SE (Image credit: Tom's Guide) The iPhone SE 4 is tipped for big upgrades, like getting an OLED display and 48MP main camera, but one of the new features that could be flying under the radar is the Action Button. Although it's technically not new to the iPhone stable, it is for the SE series. Rumors have hinted at the alert slider being swapped for the Action Button, which should give the iPhone SE 4 more functionality than ever before. With this mappable side button, it can be programmed to perform simple and complex actions. Given the budget nature of the series, this new addition would only amplify its value.\n\niOS 18.4 news today? (Image credit: Future) If the rumors are true, we could see iOS 18.4 launch alongside the iPhone SE 4 / iPhone 16E today. But some of the most exciting promised features may be delayed. iOS 18.4 reportedly was going to include big Apple Intelligence changes, especially to Siri. These include on-screen awareness, better understanding of personal context and deep app control. However, this may not happen now until iOS 18.5. We could see Apple Intelligence roll out in more languages, though, along with improved news summaries, new emoji and the ability to set your default map and translation apps (at least in the EU).\n\nThe first phone with Apple's own 5G modem (with a catch) (Image credit: @SonnyDickson on X) There's potentially good news and bad news with the iPhone SE 4's modem. The good news is that it should be Apple's first in-house 5G modem, and with Apple in total control of that hardware we could see longer battery life when surfing the web. However, a recent report out of South Korea (via GSM Arena) says that Apple's modem will lack support for mmWave 5G and perhaps offer fewer carrier aggregation features as Qualcomm's latest modem. The result could be slower upload and download speeds, something we'll be testing for ourselves at Tom's Guide.\n\nThe iPhone SE 4's competition (Image credit: Tom's Guide) Assuming that the iPhone SE 4 does stick to a similar price as before, then it'll be eligible for our best cheap phones guide. And although these are far from flagship phones, there are still some real contenders. The current top dog is the Google Pixel 8a, an Android phone that offers a bevy of features and a long software update schedule, plus an AI-ready chipset and strong display and camera specs. It's going to be hard to dethrone the Pixel, but if Apple's made enough changes to the new iPhone SE, it's possible it could claim the top spot for itself \u2014 or at least climb several places.\n\nA true member of the iPhone 16 family (Image credit: Future) Whatever Apple calls the new cheap iPhone, it was assumed for a long time that it would be using the body of the iPhone 14, as well as several of its components inside and out. But new rumors are now suggesting that the iPhone 16E properly merits the name as it would be based on the latest iPhone 16 model instead of the two-year-old iPhone 14. Granted, without an Action Button or a Dynamic Island, the only real difference the iPhone SE 4 would have from an iPhone 14 is the USB-C port and the unique camera layout. But using a more modern basis for the new SE would help futureproof the new budget iPhone for longer.\n\nSE might stand for Sales Explosion (Image credit: Majin Bu) Whatever the iPhone SE 4 ends up offering, it's likely to be a big seller, with analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicting that the new iPhone SE will hit 22 million units sold by the end of the year. This would make sense given the likely sub-$500 pricing. Buying a new iPhone is an expensive undertaking, so if a new one appears with a more easily justifiable cost, it could persuade a lot of holdouts into switching iPhones.\n\nA fresh MacBook Air (Image credit: Tom's Guide) A new MacBook Air armed with an M4 chip like the latest MacBook Pros and iPad Pro could also be on the cards for today, or at least arrive within the next month. No other big changes are believed to be coming to Apple's lightweight laptop, which is presumably why it's tipped to get a low-key launch announcement. But using Apple's latest silicon would mean a nice performance bump, helping the MacBook Air fare better against similar machines like the Snapdragon X Elite-powered Dell XPS 13 or Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x.\n\nA whole new HomePod (Image credit: Future) Leaving the iPhone SE 4 to the side for a moment, today could see big changes to other Apple products. The HomePod, Apple's smart speaker, last got an update in 2023, but is effectively the same kind of product as it was before. But the new HomePod 3 (or perhaps HomePad) could change things up dramatically by adding a display to the speaker, in the style of an Amazon Echo Show or the Google Pixel Tablet.\n\nLeaving Lightning behind (Image credit: Future) Another feature the iPhone SE 4 could abandon is the Lightning port, Apple's proprietary charging connector that was in regular use up until the iPhone 15 series. With the EU having passed legislation requiring all mobile devices to use a common charging standard, Apple has fallen in line with its Android rivals and adopted USB-C. This is the connector we should see on the iPhone SE 4, even though the iPhone 14 it's based on still came with Lightning. Just like with Touch ID, the iPhone SE series has been carrying the torch for this outdated Apple tech for the past few years by itself. While the move to USB-C has been pretty smooth and certainly makes charging easier, it's funny to think we're seeing the end of Lightning for good.\n\nToodleoo to Touch ID (Image credit: Future) The rumored move to a whole new design for the iPhone SE means we could end up with an iPhone line-up without any models using the Touch ID home button. Touch ID has been used on iPhones since the iPhone 5s launched in 2013, although the arrival of Face ID in 2017 with the iPhone X made it clear that its days were numbered. While it will live on through the iPad and iPad Air's power button-mounted versions and also the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Magic Keyboard, Apple only selling iPhones using Face ID is a historic moment.\n\nA new price point could be a big deal (Image credit: 4RMD / YouTube / Apple) Price is always an important consideration when buying phones, and the price of the new iPhone SE could be make or break. The current $430 price of the iPhone SE 3 places it firmly within our best cheap phones guide, and about half as much as the cheapest flagship iPhone 16. But if Apple bumps the price up to compensate for all the upgrades the new model is tipped to offer, then things could quickly change. Phones like the Nothing Phone 2a or Samsung Galaxy A35 offer superb specs for their costs, and the iPhone SE 4 sounds like it won't be able to fully compete based on other rumors. It would still be cheaper than other iPhones, but it may not be a true budget-friendly phone.\n\niPhone SE or 16E? (Image credit: Apple) We've assumed for a long time that Apple would continue with the iPhone SE name, making this rumored new model the iPhone SE 4 or iPhone SE 2025. But tipsters, including Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, who point to Tim Cook's announcement as possible evidence of a name swap to iPhone 16E. Describing the contents of the launch as \"the newest member of the family\" could mean a number of things. But with the existing rumors of the iPhone 16E name circulating, it could mean Apple retires the SE title and instead markets the new cheaper iPhone as a fully-fledged member of the iPhone 16 series. If that's the case, that could be good news for features and software, as Apple would probably not compare a vastly underpowered phone to its latest flagship models.\n\niPhone SE origins (Image credit: Tom's Guide) Good morning, and happy Apple day! This is TG\u2019s Assistant Phones Editor Richard Priday, and I\u2019ll be steering this live blog for the early shift. Today could be the day we see the first new iPhone SE in about three years, as well as the first update to Apple\u2019s AirTag trackers. We may even hear about upgrades to the Apple Vision Pro or MacBook Air, or maybe even some changes to the HomePod. But we\u2019ll get into those properly as the morning goes on. The iPhone SE 2022, in case you're not familiar, is based on the iPhone 8 from 2017 - an aging design that Apple really should have replaced before now! Instead, the new iPhone SE is thought to use the shell of the iPhone 14 from 2022, but with a few changes that both improve its capabilities and tone down some other specs.\n\niPhone SE 4 colors \u2014 it might be just two options (Image credit: Future) The iPhone SE series has never been greeted with many color options, which is to say that it might not be that different for the rumored iPhone SE 4. Currently, the iPhone SE 3 (the 2022 version) is available in three options: Midnight, Starlight, and Product Red. According to known leaker Majin Bu, the iPhone SE 4 will be available in white or black. That's probably accurate, but you can't count out on Apple bringing out a Product Red version at some point. The only outlier in the series was the original iPhone SE, which was available in four colors: silver, gold, space grey, and rose gold.\n\nThe countdown has begun (Image credit: Future) And here we are! February 19 is the day that Tim Cook mentioned when we'll \"meet the latest member of the family.\" All fingers point at a possible iPhone SE 4 reveal, which could be rebranded as the iPhone 16E. Nevertheless, we'll know before the day's over as to what Apple's expected to reveal. Aside from the iPhone SE 4, Apple's announcement could also be related to something else entirely different. Perhaps we'll get a new HomePod with an integrated display? Or perhaps a much-needed upgrade for the company's popular AirTag?\n\niPhone SE 4 vs. iPhone 17 \u2014 should you hold off until the fall? (Image credit: 4RMD / Majin Bu) There's a good probability that Apple will formally reveal the iPhone SE 4 at the company's expected announcement on February 19. This would mean that shoppers could pick it up very soon, but there's also the iPhone 17 to think about as well. In our iPhone SE 4 vs. iPhone 17 comparison, we take all the rumors and everything we know about both unannounced phones and compare them. Even though we're still a long away before an iPhone 17 reveal at perhaps Apple's fall iPhone event, there's enough leaks and rumors that give us a preview of what to expect. Given how Apple's kept the pricing of its standard iPhone model at $799, this would effectively make it $300 more than the rumored $499 cost of the iPhone SE 4. There's a lot to mull over that price difference, but we try to break it all down.\n\niPhone SE 4 might not get this Apple Intelligence feature (Image credit: Future) The iPhone SE 4 is probably on track to offer Apple Intelligence features, especially given how it's rumored to be powered by an A18 chip under the hood. That's the same chipset running on the current iPhone 16, which is built from the ground for AI. While we're confident that this would mean getting access to Apple Intelligence features as the new Siri, Photo Clean Up, Writing Tools, and more, there is probably one that it won't get. That would be Visual Intelligence, due to how the Camera Control button is tied to the feature \u2014 something that doesn't appear to be coming in the iPhone SE 4.\n\nLong, overdue upgrade to the HomePod? (Image credit: Apple) There's been whispers about a potential new HomePod, which could very well be the gadget in question that Tim Cook's referring to in his post on X. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed in December that this new HomePod could feature a \"6 to 7-inch OLED\" display. However, he went on to sat that it could be delayed into the Q3 2025. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman also went on to say that this new HomePod is likely to launch this year. He described the new home hub as \"the most significant release of the year.\" Of course, this would be an ambitious release given how it would be the first time for Apple to explore a new product category. Right now, the closest thing to a home hub of sorts is StandBy Mode on the iPhone, but this would be a standalone device much like the Amazon Echo Show.\n\nThis could be a dealbreaker for the iPhone SE 4 (Image credit: Toranji) In the three years since Apple released the iPhone SE 2022, there's no denying that there's going to be a fair amount of upgrades in store for the iPhone SE 4. Yet, there's could be one dealbreaker that could lead some to not buy it. A Chinese retailer accidentally listed the phone in question, with a clear indication that it would be sporting 8GB of RAM and 64GB storage. Both are pitiful by today's standards, with the 8GB of RAM being the bare minimum to run Apple Intelligence features, but the 64GB of storage would be laughable for a phone that's likely to be $499.\n\nRetailer accidentally posts new iPhone listing (Image credit: Boulanger) More confirmation about a potential iPhone SE 4 release comes from an accidental listing from French retailer Boulanger. While the placeholder doesn't explicitly mention the iPhone SE 4, it does translate to \"Smartphone Apple new smartphone coming soon iPhone.\" Another tidbit from the accidental listing includes the price, which at \u20ac9,999.05 (~$10,395) appears to be yet just another placeholder until it's confirmed. We expect the actual cost to be around $499, which would be an increase of $70 over the last iPhone SE 2022.\n\nBiggest rumored iPhone SE 4 upgrades make for a satisfying return (Image credit: Majin Bu) Speaking of iPhone SE 4 rumors, there's a lot for Apple to change since the iPhone SE 2022's release three years ago. Apple's going to need to make a lot of big changes if the iPhone SE 4 has a chance at beating some of our favorite best cheap phones. We detail all the big upgrades that could come to the iPhone SE 4, like a new Apple A18 chip, improved camera, OLED screen, and much more. Based on all the leaks and rumors, it should adopt the iPhone 14's design.\n\niPhone SE 4 could set a sales record (Image credit: Future) Even before it's announced, there's optimism about the fourth generation iPhone SE model as analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that Apple could ship 10 million units in the first half of 2025. he goes on to say that it could be \"performing slightly better than previous SE models.\" This record breaking mark isn't a surprise given how it's been years since the last model, with a span of three years. Paired with a much lower cost than the cheapest iPhone 16, consumers might be attracted to pick up the iPhone SE 4. Of course, there are going to be tradeoffs going with a cheaper model, but it'll be interesting to see what Apple Intelligence features that the company decides to roll out to it.",

            "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nNetflix\u2019s new series \u201cApple Cider Vinegar\u201d certainly takes aim at wellness influencers, but the Western medical system isn\u2019t safe from criticism either.\n\nThe show is a dramatization of the story of Belle Gibson, a convicted Australian scammer who claimed she had terminal brain cancer who is played by Kaitlyn Dever, and the impact she had by selling books and an app that claimed clean eating made her well again.\n\nAlso featured is a fictionalized representation of one of the people Gibson impacted named Lucy. In the show, her character stops her cancer treatments in hopes that Gibson\u2019s method will cure her in a more compassionate way than the hospital system.\n\nShow creator Samantha Strauss said the character of Lucy was important to depict what a lot of people feel when fighting a disease: not listened to, not in control and not acknowledged as a full person.\n\n\u201cSo, it makes sense we want to put our faith in the hands of someone (likely beautiful) on the internet,\u201d Straus said in an email. \u201cWe know they\u2019re selling us something, but when you\u2019re terrified that you\u2019re sick and dying, or that someone you love is sick and dying, you can\u2019t put a price on hope.\u201d\n\nThe problems depicted in the show are not just a work of fiction. There is a real need for more widespread preventative and lifestyle treatment in the US medical system, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University in Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cThere are many patients who are suffering from auto immune diseases, chronic pain diseases, other chronic diseases where their regular medical system has failed them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically just doing kind of Band-Aid fixes to get them past their symptoms.\u201d\n\nDoctors often know that patients feel gaps in care\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely understandable that people are starving \u2026 for information around healthy eating,\u201d Mozaffarian said.\n\nDiseases that the scientists know are connected to diet \u2013\u2013 including diabetes, heart disease, depression and gut problems \u2013\u2013 are rampant, he said. And not enough funding has gone into research about how other health problems are connected to what you eat, Mozaffarian said.\n\nThat means many times you go to see a doctor they aren\u2019t going to have a lot of current information on how foods or behaviors impact your concerns, he said.\n\n\u201cYou have this perfect storm of widespread disease, widespread confusion and widespread desperation for information,\u201d Mozaffarian added. \u201cAnd while that craving for better nutrition information can be a good thing, it also leaves people open to people with half-true or completely false health claims to step in.\u201d\n\nIn addition, people don\u2019t always feel comfortable bringing their wellness practices to their doctor, said Dr. Summer Allen, a family medicine physician at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re going to have someone give them an open mind or try to understand what\u2019s drawn them to a certain behavior or to a certain lifestyle or health,\u201d she said.\n\nTraditionally, medicine has worked in a paternalistic way, she said. You explained your symptoms to your doctor, they told you what to do, and you did it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not where we\u2019re at from a society standpoint, given just the abundance of knowledge and information we have now, and also because people really are experts about their body and what they\u2019re experiencing,\u201d she said.\n\nIt can be tempting to turn to often beautiful influencers to help you solve wellness problems, said show creator Samantha Strauss. Ben King/Netflix\n\nRespected resources exist but can be hard to access\n\nIdeally, everyone would have a team of health care providers who collaborated with you and could help guide you in the behavioral changes to improve your health, but unfortunately, that isn\u2019t always easy, Allen said.\n\nBut as some professionals in the field advocate for a more whole-person approach, there are things you can do to connect with resources who can help you integrate prevention, behavior and alternative approaches into your care, she said.\n\nThe American College of Lifestyle Medicine has a certification for doctors who specialize in lifestyle behavioral interventions, and you can search for a doctor near you in the database, said Dr. Jonathan Bonnet, a lifestyle medicine-certified physician and clinical associate professor (affiliate) at Stanford University School of Medicine.\n\nNot all insurance plans cover it, but nutritionists are also really helpful for wading through what nutrition \u201chacks\u201d are worthwhile and what you should focus your diet on for better health, Mozaffarian said.\n\nStriking a balance\n\nThe truth is, the things that are shown to be most important to your health aren\u2019t exciting and they aren\u2019t a product you can buy, Bonnet said.\n\n\u201cIf anyone is telling you, hey, this is going to change our world and cure everything, that would be more suspect,\u201d Bonnet said. \u201cThe larger the claim, the more suspicious I would be.\u201d\n\nSleeping well, eating whole foods, getting physical activity, reducing your stress and maintaining close relationships should be your biggest priorities \u2013\u2013 whether you are fighting a disease or not, he added.\n\nWhen a new hack or wellness trend pops up, Mozaffarian recommends utilizing a triangle of trust, that is three sources that you trust sharing positive information about it. They could be a government source, a university site, a trusted physician or even studies in a medical journal, he added.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to choose between traditional or alternative medicine, Mozaffarian said. They can work together.\n\n\u201cThere are some really good functional medicine doctors who have spent their careers thinking about these things and trying to go to the root cause of disease,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are also a lot who don\u2019t know really what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nAnd practices that are seen as outside the US medical system, like acupuncture and meditation, actually do show real scientific benefit, he added.\n\n\u201cThere have been randomized trials showing that they make a difference in people\u2019s lives and sometimes even beat out medicines for certain conditions,\u201d Mozaffarian said.\n\nWhatever practices or supplements you try, just be sure to tell your doctor about it, Allen said. Some patients are scared to disclose alternative methods they have tried, but it is important that your doctor know so they do not prescribe anything that is harmful when combined with what you are already doing, she said.\n\nSpoiler alert ahead\n\nAt the end of the show (spoiler alert), next to depictions of the downfall of a wellness scammer, the audience sees Lucy going for her chemotherapy treatments while also doing yoga, taking ice baths and meditating. Balance is key, Strauss said.\n\nGet inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

            "content": "AI is getting added to everything it seems, and sometimes, when you don't want it. The latest security updates from Apple not only include Apple Intelligence features (for devices that support them), but they're turned on by default. If you're just not interested, or you have valid reasons like the ones below for putting the brakes on AI in your device, keep reading to learn how to turn off Apple Intelligence or some individual features.\n\nEven if you did previously disable the tech, you may have found it back on again with the releases of the recent iOS 18.3.1, iPadOS 18.3.1 and MacOS Sequoia 15.3.1 updates. Before, the features were opt-in only, and then Apple enabled them for everyone who installed the last update. If you click Continue on the setup screen in the latest incremental update, you could find it back on again. (I say \"could\" because, in my testing, this behavior is not consistent. Apple Intelligence was turned back on for me on a Mac Mini and iPhone 16 Pro, but not a MacBook Air.)\n\nWhy turn off Apple Intelligence in the first place?\n\nSince the first Apple Intelligence features rolled out in iOS 18.1, some people have chosen to opt out of the new technology. Tools such as Image Playground, Genmoji and message summaries can use up to 7GB of your device's internal storage -- a sizable chunk, especially if you tend to run against the upper limit of its free space.\n\nEven if storage is not an issue, you just may not be interested in Apple's set of AI features. According to a new survey by SellCell, 73% of Apple users think AI adds little to no value to the experience. In a separate survey, CNET found that 25% of smartphone owners aren't interested at all.\n\nOr, honestly, you may not want to deal with features that are creating inaccurate summaries or that can be replicated without Apple Intelligence.\n\nThe trainer killed someone? Screenshot by Nelson Aguilar/CNET\n\nThe good news is that you can turn off Apple Intelligence entirely. Or if you'd prefer to pick and choose, you can selectively disable some of the features. Doing so also lets you reclaim the storage it's using.\n\nIs Apple Intelligence really ready to be on by default?\n\nI'm not an AI crank -- I appreciate features such as notification summaries and the Clean Up tool in the Photos app. And yet, Apple Intelligence is also a work in progress, an evolving set of features that Apple is heavily hyping while gradually developing. I wouldn't hold it against you if you wanted to not be distracted or feel like you're doing Apple's testing for them (that's what the developer and public betas are for).\n\nRemember that Apple Intelligence works only on the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro or M-series Macs and iPads (plus the newest iPad mini).\n\nHere's what you need to know about disabling it.\n\nWatch this: Does Apple Think We're Stupid? Apple Intelligence Ads Say Yes 06:15\n\nHow to see the amount of storage Apple Intelligence is using\n\nIf you're concerned about the storage requirements of Apple Intelligence, you can find out how much the system is using by going to Settings > General > iPhone (or iPad) Storage > iOS (or iPadOS).\n\nSee how much space Apple Intelligence is using in Settings. Screenshots by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nNote that even after turning off Apple Intelligence, that storage still shows up in the iOS Storage list. However, I was able to confirm that if the phone's storage fills up and the system needs that now-inactive space, iOS reclaims what it needs.\n\nOnce I filled my iPhone's storage, the inactive Apple Intelligence data was purged to accommodate the added files, dropping from 5.89GB to 2.87GB. Screenshots by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nHow to turn off Apple Intelligence entirely (iPhone, iPad and Mac)\n\nOpen Settings (iPhone or iPad) or System Settings (Mac) and choose Apple Intelligence & Siri. Then turn off the Apple Intelligence option. Confirm your choice in the dialog that appears by tapping Turn Off Apple Intelligence.\n\nTurn off Apple Intelligence entirely with one switch. Screenshots by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nHere's what you lose:\n\n(Curiously, the Clean Up tool in Photos sticks around even when Apple Intelligence is turned off, perhaps because the first time you use it the app downloads resources for it and holds onto them.)\n\nHow to turn off individual Apple Intelligence features\n\nMaybe you're finding some Apple Intelligence features helpful while others are annoying (or just highly amusing). You can turn off specific features in the settings for apps to which they apply.\n\nFor example, to disable text summaries in Messages notifications, go to Settings > Apps > Messages and switch off the Summarize Messages option.\n\nTurn off Messages summaries while still using other Apple Intelligence features. Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nSome features are not as app-specific. Writing Tools, which use Apple Intelligence to proof or rewrite text, appear as an option when you select text, regardless of the app. To turn that off, you need to disable Apple Intelligence system-wide.\n\nAlso note that nearly every app includes an Apple Intelligence & Siri option in Settings, with a Learn from this App option (turned on by default). That applies just to whether Apple Intelligence and Siri can monitor how you use it to make suggestions; it doesn't affect any particular Apple Intelligence features.\n\nHow to turn off Apple Intelligence features in Screen Time settings\n\nAnother option for restricting what Apple Intelligence can do is buried in the Screen Time settings. Screen Time is designed to control which apps and features can run on another device, such as the iPhone used by a child in your household. But it's also helpful for tracking how much time you're spending on the device and, in this case, turning off some components of Apple Intelligence.\n\nOpen the Settings app and go to Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions. Turn on the Content & Privacy Restrictions option if it's not already enabled. If this is the first time you're flipping this switch, don't worry -- everything is allowed by default. Tap Intelligence & Siri. Tap on the following three features and decide whether to allow or don't allow their use: Image Creation (such as Image Playground and Genmoji), Writing Tools and the ChatGPT Extension (which uses ChatGPT to process requests that are beyond the built-in Apple Intelligence capabilities).\n\nTurn off selected Apple Intelligence features in the Screen Time settings.

This AirTag upgrade will include a couple of nice quality of life upgrades, including much improved precision finding.\n\nApple is also working on a new smart home hub, which some refer to as \u2018HomePad.\u2019 While this product was initially on track for a March debut, recent reports suggest that it might not hit the market until a little bit later.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s also M4 Ultra Mac Studio and Mac Pro in the works, which won\u2019t launch until WWDC this summer.\n\nMy favorite Apple accessories on Amazon:\n\nFollow Michael: X/Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram",

            "content": "Apple is planning big for its entire Mac line this year with the new M5 chip upgrades. For the past few months, it has been debated whether Apple will launch the new OLED iPad Pro with an M5 chip at its usual time frame, but based on recent reports, it appears that the company's top-of-the-line iPad would have to wait. A prominent analyst has reported that the M5 chip will debut with the MacBook Pro models later this year before trickling down to the iPad Pro.\n\nApple to launch new MacBook Pro models with an M5 chip later this year, but the iPad Pro upgrade could be delayed\n\nIt was previously noted that Apple has commenced mass production of its M5 chip for its forthcoming products, including the iPad Pro. However, Mark Gurman from Bloomberg claims in his latest Power On newsletter that the M5 iteration of Apple's custom silicon will arrive with the launch of the MacBook Pro models in the second half of 2025, possibly by the end of the year.\n\nThe new M5 MacBook Pro models will essentially look the same as the current models with no major design variations, as the new and improved chipset will be the highlight of the update. The M5 chip will bring noticeable computational and graphical performance gains to the Mac lineup, and the company will likely begin the upgrade cycle with the forthcoming MacBook Pro models.\n\nThe report also mentions that the company will upgrade the redesigned Mac mini and possibly the iMac with the new M5 chip at the same time. We suspect that all the upgrades will take place together in the last quarter of 2025, as the company will keep up with its typical product release timeframes.\n\nAs for the iPad Pro, the device would possibly sit idle with an M4 chip until the end of this year or early next year. The iPad Pro will not be redesigned this year, as the company just updated the design of the device with an ultra-thin form factor. If Apple releases the M5 iPad Pro later this year, it will be switching its typical release time frame, but be sure to take the word with a grain of salt as the company could announce the device earlier than expected. There is also a possibility that the company would stick to its timeline but skip a year and launch the upgraded iPad Pro next year. We will keep you updated with the latest information as soon as further details are available.",

            "content": "Late last week, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook teased the launch of a new product on Wednesday, Feb 19, 2025. The rumor mill speculates that Cook is referring to the iPhone SE 4 \u2013 the low-cost version of the company\u2019s flagship mobile device.\n\nAhead of the product launch, Apple stock looks attractive but volatile \u2013 making it a tricky pick to buy at its current price of around $245. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with AAPL stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is very high.\n\nWe arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of AAPL stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Apple along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below.\n\nHow does Apple\u2019s valuation look vs. the S&P 500?\n\nGoing by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AAPL stock looks expensive compared to the broader market.\n\n\u2022 Apple has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 9.1 vs. a figure of 3.1 for the S&P 500\n\n\u2022 Additionally, the company\u2019s price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 29.0 compared to 24.4 for S&P 500\n\n\u2022 And, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30.2 vs. the benchmark\u2019s 24.4\n\nHow have Apple\u2019s revenues grown over recent years?\n\nApple\u2019s Revenues have grown marginally over recent years.\n\n\u2022 Apple has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 2.3% over the last 3 years (vs. 9.8% for S&P 500)\n\n\u2022 Its revenues have grown 2.0% from $383 Bil to $391 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. change of 5.6% for S&P 500)\n\n\u2022 Also, its quarterly revenues grew 6.1% to $95 Bil in the most recent quarter from $89 Bil a year ago (vs. 7.2% change for S&P 500)\n\nHow profitable is Apple?\n\nApple\u2019s profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe.\n\n\u2022 Apple\u2019s Operating Income over the last four quarters was $123 Bil, which represents a high Operating Margin of 31.5% (vs. 12.6% for S&P 500)\n\n\u2022 Apple\u2019s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $118 Bil, pointing to a high OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 30.2% (vs. 14.4% for S&P 500)\n\nDoes Apple look financially stable?\n\nApple\u2019s balance sheet looks very strong.\n\n\u2022 Apple\u2019s Debt figure stood at $107 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is currently $3.7 Tril (as of 2/14/2025). This implies a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 3.0% (vs. 19.7% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable]\n\n\u2022 Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $65 Bil of the $365 Bil in Total Assets for Apple. This yields a strong Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 17.9% (vs. 14.1% for S&P 500)\n\nHow resilient is AAPL stock during a downturn?\n\nAAPL stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during the last 2 economic downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on AAPL stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Apple Stock Go In A Market Crash? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes.\n\nCOVID Recession (February to April 2020)\n\n\u2022 AAPL stock fell 31.4% from a high of $79.40 on 12 February 2020 to $54.45 on 23 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500\n\n\u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Covid peak by 5 June 2020 \u2013 taking 74 days to recover while the S&P 500 took 148 days\n\n\u2022 Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $258.74 on 26 December 2024 and currently trades at around $245\n\nGreat Recession (December 2007 to June 2009)\n\nDuring the 2007-09 recession, AAPL stock fell from a peak value of $6.01 on 30 December 2007 to $2.35 on 20 January 2009 a decline of 60.9% (vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500)\n\nHowever, the stock fully recovered to its pre-recession peak by 9 November 2009 \u2013 taking 293 days to recoup its losses vs. the 1480 days taken by the S&P 500 to recover\n\nPutting all the pieces together: What it means for AAPL stock\n\nIn summary, Apple\u2019s performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Growth: Neutral\n\n\u2022 Profitability: Very Strong\n\n\u2022 Financial Stability: Extremely Strong\n\n\u2022 Downturn Resilience: Very Strong\n\n\u2022 Overall: Very Strong\n\nHence, despite its very high valuation, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that AAPL is a tricky stock to buy.\n\nNot too happy about the volatile nature of AAPL stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.",

Back in the day they were called a Mini Series and they were the Television Event of the Day, and the build-up was enormous. And we received two of them a year, maybe three if we were lucky. And as kids, most of them flew over our heads largely, but we watched them anyway. Now there are several \u2018dropping\u2019 each week. And so many that you start, but never finish. Even though Tracey from the office reckons you really should stick with it, because her husband Dan liked it a lot, and his mate Rhys was tipped off in the first place by Gavin\u2019s brother Marcus. The whole cricket team had liked it you see\u2026\n\nAnyway, I did watch \u2014 with some interest \u2014 Apple Cider Vinegar. And I actually bloody loved it.\n\nApple Cider Vinegar gets pretty impressionistic with the truth pretty quickly. But it has a larger point to make of course.\n\nSkewering the alternative medicine and diet culture, and the influencers that, embarrassingly will trade for clicks with just about anything, Apple Cider Vinegar is first and foremost a deep satire, and scathing scythe through the idea of such industries, and such influencers \u2014 but it\u2019s also centred around a real person, and uses their real name.\n\nPlaying out like a bit of creative non-fiction, Apple Cider Vinegar reminded me of the great book-length pieces by Janet Malcolm, and before her, Truman Capote. For there\u2019s a deeper truth to nudge around when you are not concerned with getting every single fact just right, and instead arrange the details in a form of \u201ctruth-y\u201d-ness that is truthful to the degree that it must be, but also unashamedly breaks some eggs to make that damn omelette.\n\nLast year, the big one was Baby Reindeer \u2014 which I watched because everyone said I had to. And it even gave me the inspiration to write an essay which I called I watched Baby Reindeer Just Like Everyone Said I Had To!\n\nI really did enjoy Baby Reindeer, and I totally felt uncomfortable about it too \u2014 and I liked that actually. If you feel too comfortable watching something you might as well be listening to Coldplay (although paradoxically too much Coldplay, by which I mean a second song, can have me shifting in my seat). What I\u2019m trying to say is, I like the fact that I\u2019m being asked to question the ethics, the logistics, and the decisions made by the show creators around the levels of truth included, and the little lies that help pull the story into important places.\n\nShare Sounds Good!\n\nApple Cider Vinegar tells an Australian story, well, actually, it\u2019s a small handful of Australian stories \u2014 there\u2019s Belle Gibson, the shameless thief and liar, quite possibly a victim of past-life trauma that never got the care she needed and combined being a pathological liar with Munchausen\u2019s by proxy. Her \u2018escape\u2019 towards a life of intended luxury was one of broad, dangerous delusion, and that\u2019s at the very least.\n\nFictionalised versions of other real people have stories that intersect, and this is where it gets tricky. You\u2019ll be able to Google and read, already, that some people don\u2019t like the way the show lampooned them, or was disrespectful to their family member, or stripped them of agency. And this is the breaking eggs to make omelettes I referred to. A brutal way to put it. But also the reality if not quite the (actual) truth.\n\nApple Cider Vinegar doesn\u2019t paint the wellness industry all that well; doesn\u2019t see it as anything more than smoke and/or mirrors, and silly quackery. And, look, I\u2019ll throw a caveat here, this show might be triggering to people that have had tough experiences around medicine, maybe ignored, or waitlisted for far too long, or misdiagnosed, but the science is science for a reason, and the basic tenet is your doctor knows more than you will ever know, unless you happen to be a doctor too. Not just mates with a doctor, or friends with a healer that sold their own recipe book and rubbed essential oils into creases the doctor\u2019s pills were just not reaching.\n\nGet more from Simon Sweetman in the Substack app Available for iOS and Android Get the app\n\nWe must remember that this type of TV is a satirical skewering, it is the cartoon in the newspaper that has a dark truth-bomb incorporated in its devastation, rather than being the meticulously fact-checked feature that was worked on for months. And as TV, as entertainment, Apple Cider Vinegar is quite close to exquisite, particularly within the format of the Netflix 6-episode Limited Series. At the helm, an amazing performance by Kaitlyn Dever, an American playing an Australian, something of a role-reversal from how it so often goes in the world of the Netflix limited series (looking at you again Nicole Kidman). Dever was little more than a kid when she had a recurring run on Justified, and was very good. She was great in an adult role on the brilliant (deeply crushing) Dopesick, and here, as Belle Gibson she is electric. Positively charged, and absolutely shocking. She is a new kind of character you hate, and the control the actor has over this is compelling. And a huge part of the magic of the show.\n\nBut it would only work if Apple Cider Vinegar had something to say. And the fact that the real Belle Gibson has thus far avoided paying fines means the truth that the TV show never quite fully gets to might just be because it is in fact stranger than fiction.\n\nI loved Apple Cider Vinegar, was glued to it. You might be too.\n\nShare\n\nAnd if you\u2019d seen it already, I\u2019d love to know what you reckon.\n\nLeave a comment\n\nMessage Simon Sweetman\n\nThanks for reading Sounds Good! !

            "content": "Apple's next iPhone may launch next week. No, it's not the iPhone 17, but the long-awaited iPhone SE. This will be the fourth generation of the \u201cSpecial Edition\u201d iPhone, arriving three years after its last refresh. It's usually the cheapest in the lineup, and rumors suggest it will cost around $499, which\u2014if true\u2014would be a small price bump over the $429 MSRP for the 2022 model.\n\nPhotograph: Majin Bu\n\nThe price may be justified because this iPhone SE may not look like its predecessor and will be a bigger phone. It's rumored to feature a 6.1-inch screen, a sizable jump from the 4.7-inch screen, with OLED in tow and Face ID, officially ditching the Home button with Touch ID baked in. It's also expected to feature USB-C and MagSafe for all your modern charging needs.\n\nIf its predecessor is anything to go by, it will likely be powered by Apple's A18 chipset, the same as the iPhone 16, which means this device will have access to Apple Intelligence. However, the new Camera Control button that debuted on the iPhone 16 isn't expected here, meaning there won't be any way to access Apple's Visual Intelligence feature, which lets you point the iPhone camera at objects and have Siri provide context.\n\nX content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe iPhone SE was initially expected to launch this past week after a Bloomberg report, but Bloomberg's Mark Gurman now says Apple has delayed it to the following week. Apple CEO Tim Cook seems to have confirmed this on X, saying there will be a new product launch on Wednesday, February 19.\n\nThe OnePlus Watch 3 Has a Big Battery\n\nAlso arriving next week is OnePlus\u2019 next Wear OS smartwatch, the OnePlus Watch 3. After a dismal launch with the original\u2014which had a proprietary operating system\u2014OnePlus turned things around with the OnePlus Watch 2, which was one of the few full-featured smartwatches with a three-day battery life. Now it's upping the ante with a five-day battery life claim for its latest wearable. That's just by default\u2014if you enable battery-saver mode, it can purportedly last 16 days on a single charge.\n\nThat's unheard of on a smartwatch of this type, and the innovation is two-pronged. OnePlus is one of the few Wear OS smartwatch makers utilizing a dual-engine architecture, with Wear OS and the Snapdragon W5 chipset running the intense graphical tasks and the Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) powered by an upgraded BES2800 MCU chipset handling all the smaller background tasks. This is paired with a new silicon-carbon battery technology the company just introduced in the OnePlus 13, which allows for denser batteries that don't need to be thicker. Hence, this watch has a big 631-mAh battery cell (its predecessor had a 500-mAh cell) without a drastic size increase.\n\nIt retains the stainless steel casing, but now there's a titanium alloy bezel around the screen for extra protection, and the 2D sapphire crystal display is brighter, too. It'll come in Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium, with more details about features, specs, and price to come on February 18.",

            "content": "Apple Business Model vs. Microsoft Business Model: An Overview\n\nMore than any other American companies, Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) dominate the intersection of technology and consumer access. Even though they compete across a huge range of sub-industries, such as computing software, hardware, operating systems, mobile devices, advertising, applications, and web browsing, each firm primarily targets different markets.\n\nOn Feb. 15, 2025, AAPL had a market cap of around $3.6 trillion. Microsoft lagged behind it at $3.04 trillion.\n\nKey Takeaways As of 2025, Apple and Microsoft are two of the biggest companies in the world, alternating the title of the world's most valuable company.\n\nBoth companies have market caps of over $3 trillion.\n\nApple's business model targets small and medium sized businesses, and consumers with devices targeted toward them. They are able to keep their base due to easy-to-use designs and data migration to new product lines.\n\nMicrosoft is an innovative leader in cloud computing, professional and business solutions, with a lower focus on personal computing than it used to have.\n\nThe Apple Business Model\n\nIt is difficult to recall a modern American business so thoroughly dominated by the ideas and personality of one individual as Apple was under Steve Jobs. Jobs' remarkable innovations propelled Apple to unprecedented heights until his passing in 2011.\n\nDuring Steve Jobs' second reign\u2014he was fired in 1985 and returned in 1997\u2014Apple returned to relevancy and revolutionized multiple subindustries. In 2001, the company released the iPod, a pocket-sized device that could hold 1,000 songs, which soon took over the Sony Walkman. In 2007, Apple completely redefined mobile phones when the iPhone was released.\n\nApple easily bests its competitors in terms of hardware sales and high-end gadgets. Thanks to the company's early 2000s reputation as a nonconformist response to Microsoft, millennials grew up using Macs in large numbers. This is buoyed by the company's brilliant insistence on integrating its products, making it easier to keep using new Apple products and thus more difficult to switch to a competitor's interface; this is sometimes referred to as the \"Apple Ecosystem Lock.\"\n\nThe weakness in the Apple's business model lies in the historic success of the company's golden invention: the iPhone. Nearly half of all Apple revenue comes from iPhone sales, and no comparable innovation has taken off since its former CEO died.\n\nHowever, CEO Tim Cook continued driving improvements and innovations to existing products and services. In 2023, new iOS 18, MacBook Pro and Air Models, iPad Air and Pro models, the iPhone 16 variants, the Apple Watch series, and AirPods 4 were all launched.\n\nThe iPhone remained Apple's key revenue generator in 2024, with sales of $201.18 billion out of $391.04 billion over the year (51%). Apple's services generated $96.2 billion in sales.\n\nThe Microsoft Business Model\n\nFor years, Microsoft dominated the computer industry with its Windows software; Apple was an afterthought for more than a generation of operating products. Before Google Web browsing began to dominate the market, Microsoft gave away Internet Explorer for free, driving Netscape and other similar companies out of business.\n\nThe Microsoft revenue model historically relied on just a few key strengths. The first, and most important, was the licensing fees charged for the use of the Windows operating system and the Microsoft Office suite.\n\nHowever, technological developments have made its operating system less of a revenue generator. Microsoft has moved its Office suite to an online subscription service to generate recurring revenue, acquired LinkedIn and its subscription and sales solutions, and developed cloud-based solutions for businesses and developers that generate recurring revenues. Its primary revenue generator was server products and cloud services, which generated $97.7 billion in FY 2024. This was followed by office products and cloud services, with $54.9 billion generated. Windows was third, generating $23.24 billion.\n\nMicrosoft has a popular gaming console and associated services that Apple does not\u2014the Xbox and its subscription services. Gaming and gaming services accounted for the fourth largest revenue stream for Microsoft in 2024, $21.5 billion.\n\nIs Microsoft Doing Better Than Apple? Each company has transitioned to focus on different products and services, so they each rank well. However, Apple generated more returns for investors as of February 2025 (33.23% year-over-year), while Microsoft lagged at 0.07%. Microsoft generated $245.12 billion in revenue in 2024, while Apple generated 391.04 billion. Microsoft earned $88.14 billion in net income to Apple's $93.74 billion. It seems Apple did slightly better (as far as finances go) than Microsoft in 2024.\n\nWhich Is Best, Microsoft or Apple? That depends on what you're evaluating. They each have different products and services and are very successful.\n\nWho Won the Apple vs. Microsoft Lawsuit? The copyright infringement lawsuit between Apple and Microsoft ended in 1992 in favor of Microsoft. Apple sued Microsoft for violating a copyright it held on certain elements of graphic user interfaces.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nApple and Microsoft are two tech giants that have dominated their industry for many years. Each began with similar business models but eventually went in different directions, with Microsoft catering more to productivity, business solutions, and cloud computing while keeping many of its consumer-facing products and services. Apple continues to market mostly to consumers and small- and mid-sized businesses.",

The best MacBooks are fantastic laptops, and while they don't afford you the freedom of customization that other brands offer, that's not something everyone will care about. Most of us just want a high-quality laptop that'll get us through work, school, and play with minimal fuss.\n\nAlthough MacBooks can get a bit pricey \u2014 with the latest M4 MacBook Pros reaching into truly frightening territory \u2014 they justify the price with Apple's signature design, user-friendly OS, and zippy M-series processors. Plus, you can often find MacBook Air and Pro models on sale (with the cheapest ones priced around $850 to $999).\n\nAfter testing out Apple's entire lineup of laptops, we're here to help you narrow down the choices and take home the Apple machine of your dreams.\n\nYour first big decision: MacBook Pro vs Air\n\nWith today's current lineup of MacBooks, you really only have two options: The MacBook Pro or the MacBook Air. So, which is right for you?\n\nIf you're a creative who regularly pushes your laptop to the limit with demanding video and photo editing applications, you'll want to aim for the Pro. The name of the game with the Pro line is processing power, and the latest iterations are the speediest and most performance-driven yet.\n\nTesting the M1 MacBook Air after its 2020 release. Credit: Zlata Ivleva / Mashable Testing the super-powered M3 MacBook Pro. Credit: Kimberly Gedeon / Mashable\n\nIf convenience and portability are your top priorities, then the Air will be most suited to you. It's thin and light, and it even comes in a 13-inch option if you'll be lugging it around wherever you go. Plus, ever since the debut of Apple's M Series chips, the MacBook Air has become a pint-sized powerhouse. The most current model utilizes the M3 chip, so you won't be sacrificing all that much in terms of power.\n\nWhich generation MacBook is the best?\n\nThis will come down to what you're willing to give up in performance, and in some cases, quality. But, whatever you do deem worthy of sacrificing, you'll be paid back in savings. For example, the 2022 model M2 MacBook Air won't come with the latest chip, but you'll still be scoring an impressive laptop that frequently goes on sale for just $849.99. That's compared to the $1,249 price tag of the most recent Air, and the $1,599 asking price of the latest Pro.\n\nA photo from Mashable's test of the M1 MacBook Air.

Credit: Molly Flores / Mashable\n\nSo, if you've got a lighter budget, don't fret \u2014 you can still get a MacBook at an affordable price. Older MacBooks are still very much worthy of your consideration, and they won't cost you nearly as much.\n\nWhat are the best MacBooks?\n\nAfter testing out the latest Apple laptops, we think there are five MacBooks worth buying in 2025.

Boo, I say. Boo. As Six Colors contributor Joe Rosensteel wrote, \u201cNetflix deeply regrets accidentally making Netflix a better product for its customers.\u201d\n\nJust yesterday on our Six Colors podcast, I suggested it was high time for Apple and Netflix to make a deal to get Netflix content in the Apple TV app. And it seems maybe, at long last, after years of no movement, finally such a deal is happening?\n\nAfter hearing from a member in The Incomparable\u2019s Discord that they\u2019d gotten Netflix\u2019s Midnight Mass to show up in their watchlist, I decided to give their method a shot. I searched for the show in tvOS\u2019s unified search, hit the Open In\u2026 button, and sure enough was prompted if I wanted to connect Netflix to the Apple TV app.\n\nYes, please.\n\nUnfortunately, since doing that (and verifying that Netflix does now appear in Settings > Apps > TV under the Connect to Tv section) I\u2019ve been unable to actually get any shows to appear in my own watchlist, despite starting several episodes of various series. If this is indeed rolling out\u2014as other places, such as 9to5Mac, are also now reporting\u2014it\u2019s doing so gradually.\n\nBut an end to our long national nightmare might finally be in sight and maybe the TV app will finally fulfill its destiny of being the place to see everything you want to watch. All it needs now is a live TV grid.\n\n[Dan Moren is the East Coast Bureau Chief of Six Colors. You can find him on Mastodon at @dmoren@zeppelin.flights or reach him by email at dan@sixcolors.com.

            "content": "The Apple Watch often makes headlines for saving lives by detecting signs of AFib, calling emergency services after a crash or fall, and other safety features. That wasn\u2019t really the reason I bought one a few years ago.\n\nI was merely interested in the Apple ecosystem perks, like automatic Mac unlocking, iPhone notification mirroring, and music playback controls. So, despite sometimes recording my random workouts, I muted activity ring alerts. Closing them didn\u2019t mean much to me.\n\nThat all changed when I received a single notification late last year.\n\nHealth data keeps you in check\n\nIt was October 23, 2024. I was sitting on my couch at home when my iPhone\u2019s Health app alerted me about a change in my average resting heart rate. Following months of inactivity and overthinking stressful matters beyond my control, that rate started to climb from 53 BPM in May to an all-time high of 66 BPM in October. I then checked my cardio fitness data, and it had dropped to its lowest value yet, with an alarming VO2 max of 34.9 mL/kg/min.\n\nFoundry\n\nThe great thing about the Apple Health app is that it proactively monitors users\u2019 metrics and notifies them about relevant changes, be they positive or negative. Those wearing their Apple Watches for prolonged periods can also view graphs visualizing their changes over the years.\n\nI glanced at my arm and realized I had been underutilizing the health computer strapped to my wrist.\n\nFitness+ just works (out)\n\nFor a long list of personal reasons, I no longer hit the gym. That is not an excuse to remain idle, as the alternatives are plentiful. In my case, I decided to opt for Fitness+ workouts, as the service is bundled with my Apple One subscription and won\u2019t cost me an additional $10 per month. As it turns out, it\u2019s exactly the kind of coaching I need.\n\nBeyond its ease of use and accessibility on Apple TV\u2019s larger screen, I appreciate the diversity of Fitness+ content. I get to pick between multiple workout types, durations, coaches, music genres, equipment, and so on. Thanks to the included filters, I can quickly narrow the results and find a video that matches my current mood and energy levels. Each session also typically features three coaches that cater to different capabilities. I don\u2019t have to browse through hundreds of videos to find the right one and helps me jump right into the action.\n\nFoundry\n\nTo get started, I committed to at least 10 minutes of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), as it\u2019s one of the most demanding workouts on the platform. On certain days, I\u2019d increase the duration to 20 or 30 minutes, or opt for kickboxing, yoga, or core when seeking lighter activities.\n\nBy December, my average resting heart rate had dropped to 60 BPM and VO2 max rose to 41.9 mL/kg/min. This pushed me to further embrace Apple Fitness+, as it was evidently improving my cardiovascular health. At some point, you adapt to specific coaches and their approaches, and working out with them every evening becomes a rewarding activity you look forward to rather than a dreadful chore.\n\nFree Fitness features\n\nBesides the subscription service, Apple offers free features in its built-in Fitness app. For starters, I re-enabled activity ring notifications, as I\u2019ve been committed to closing them daily for over a month now. This reminds me to stand every hour, exercise for at least 30 minutes, and burn over 500 active calories a day.\n\nThe app also offers daily, weekly, monthly, and seasonal awards that challenge you to finish certain tasks. I especially value the social aspect of the app, which lets me view my friends\u2019 activities, compete against them, and exchange motivational texts. It truly helps push one\u2019s boundaries and adopt healthy routines.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 (42mm) Read our review\n\nA well-rounded smartwatch\n\nWhile the Apple Watch is primarily known for the Fitness app and its paid offerings, its health features extend beyond that. Thanks to sleep tracking support, I\u2019ve been making a conscious decision to meet my nightly sleep goal to ensure I\u2019m well-rested during the day.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mindfulness app has taught me to dedicate short breaks during the day to focus on my breathing. It also helped me train my brain to focus on deep breaths during anxiety flare-ups. This has played a key role in stress management, which can notably impact one\u2019s cardiovascular health.\n\nOther nice-to-have perks include loud noise alerts, which remind me to enable active noise cancelation (ANC) in clamorous environments to protect my hearing. Likewise, ECG tests offer reassurance and peace of mind when performed periodically.\n\nWhat I love about my Apple Watch Series 9 is how versatile it is. When I first bought an earlier model years ago, it was primarily for the integrations with my iPhone and Mac. Today, I still rely on those Continuity features, but it also accompanies me as I work out and collects essential data throughout the day.\n\nThat chilling Health notification I received last fall kickstarted my active lifestyle. Had I not used an Apple Watch, that catalyst would\u2019ve been eliminated from the equation, barring me from escaping an increasingly unhealthy cycle.\n\nApple\u2019s commitment to introducing and maintaining health features makes me appreciate its products more now. Not only do these devices perform their typical computing tasks, but, in a way, they also take care of us and ensure we\u2019re doing all right.",

            "content": "Jason Hiner/ZDNET\n\nEver since upgrading to iOS 18, my iPhone's battery life has taken a serious hit. Things only got worse with subsequent releases, and nothing has been improved by the latest 18.3.1 security patch. By lunchtime, my battery is rarely above 40%, and I've had to make power banks my new best friends.\n\nAlso: Can rebooting your iPhone really make it run faster? I tried it every day to find out\n\nDay or night, the battery drain has been relentless -- far worse than anything I remember with previous updates. Even Low Power Mode barely makes a difference, leaving me constantly searching for a charger.\n\nI decided to investigate\n\nSo, a few weeks ago, I began looking into the issue.\n\nFor any battery drain problem, the first place I always look is under the Battery screen in Settings. This section is a treasure trove of information, not only related to the battery but also to the apps that are running and consuming power. Two charts are displayed here: Battery Level, which shows how the charge level changes at 15-minute intervals, and Activity, which uses a bar chart to illustrate which apps have been active and using battery power in hourly intervals. You can tap on the bars for a deeper dive into what's been happening on your iPhone during that period.\n\nBut other than elevated usage by Home & Lock Screen (basically, any activity on the lock screen, such as notifications or widgets), there was nothing out of the ordinary. I did try disabling the iPhone's always-on display -- the setting to do this is under Settings > Display & Brightness > Always On Display -- but to no avail.\n\nThe problem persisted.\n\nI found the culprit\n\nAfter more investigating, testing, tweaking settings, and a lot of frustration, I found the culprit: Apple Intelligence. With Apple Intelligence enabled (the setting can be found under Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri), I found it impossible to make it through a day without recharging. However, with it disabled, my battery life returned to its former levels, allowing me to leave the power bank at home.\n\nAlso: Apple finally lets you migrate purchases between two accounts - here's how\n\nAnd here's the kicker: I'm not even using Apple Intelligence. I had enabled it briefly for testing, but I quickly moved on to other things. Honestly, I find it pretty underwhelming, but I didn't expect it to drain my battery so much -- especially when it wasn't actively being used.\n\nThis issue doesn't seem to be limited to my hardware, either. I've come across plenty of similar reports, and it's not just affecting iPhones. Some users are blaming Apple Intelligence for excessive battery drain on MacBooks as well. I've noticed the same on my MacBook Pro -- turning Apple Intelligence off immediately fixes the problem.\n\nSerious optimization issues\n\nThe effect is consistent across my devices. On my iPhone, MacBook Pro, and even, to a lesser extent, my iPad, the pattern is the same: turn Apple Intelligence on, and battery life drops like a rock; turn it off, and things go back to normal.\n\nAt this point, it's clear that Apple Intelligence has some serious optimization issues. While it might have potential for some users, the battery tradeoff is hard to justify right now.\n\nAlso: How to remotely access and control someone else's iPhone (with their permission)\n\nIf your iPhone's battery life has been especially bad since upgrading to iOS 18 and you've enabled the Apple Intelligence feature, it might be the culprit. I say \"might\" because this is one of those \"your mileage may vary\" situations. That said, if you're not finding Apple Intelligence all that useful, there's no harm in turning it off to see if it helps.\n\nHere's the kicker: Apple really wants you to use Apple Intelligence. Installing iOS 18.3 automatically enabled the feature, and I've heard from multiple users that the 18.3.1 update re-enabled it even after they had turned it off.\n\nNow, I'm not anti-Apple Intelligence -- it has its merits for some users -- but for those who don't find it helpful, the battery tradeoff is significant. I really hope Apple can address this battery drain in the coming months because, right now, it's pretty painful.\n\nThat said, battery issues seem to have become the norm for iPhones. Maybe it's time to accept that the dream of all-day battery life is fading, and chargers and power banks are just part of life now.",

            "content": "\ufeff\n\nThe new PowerBeats 2 Pro earbuds have a slate of new features for audio-related purposes. However, for sports-specific usage, they have one big new feature: Built-in heart rate sensing. This would not only be the first time Apple has created a non-watch heart rate sensor, but even more notably, the first time the company has enabled heart rate broadcasting over existing Bluetooth heart rate standards.\n\nThe question then becomes: Is it accurate?\n\nUnfortunately, it turns out, that was not the question I should have started with.\n\nThe real question to start with is: Is the heart rate function (accuracy aside), even usable?\n\nA lot of hours later, I have answers to both of those questions. And trust me, it\u2019s a very mixed bag.\n\nI\u2019ve actually been a long-time fan of PowerBeats. There were the first Beats product I owned years ago, before eventually switching to the Beats Studio buds, then the AirPods Pro 2. But hey, I\u2019m a fan of orange (as is every other company apparently), so a quick $249USD (299EUR in my case) purchase on Apple.com, and they arrived two days later.\n\nNote that this review will focus exclusively on the heart rate features. This is not a review of the audio pieces (good or bad), the other new features, or the color orange. Cool? Good, let\u2019s begin.\n\nFinally, if you found this review useful, consider becoming a DCR Supporter, which gets you an ad-free site, plus the behind-the-scenes video series between both myself (and my wife) on everything that happens in the DCR Sports Tech Cave/universe.\n\nThe Tech Specs:\n\nJust very quickly, let\u2019s run through the tech specs here for completeness.\n\nMulti-microphone: 6 microphones in total, 3 mics per side\n\nModes: Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), Transparency, Regular/Off\n\nSensors: Optical for heart rate, optical for in-ear detection, accelerometer, gyroscope\n\nButtons on earbuds: To change settings/configuration (for playback controls, mode controls)\n\nBattery: 10 hours (+ 35 hours in the charging case)\n\nFast Chart: 5 minutes charge is 1.5 hours playback\n\nBluetooth: Bluetooth 5.3 (single device connection though)\n\nWeight: 8.7g per earbud, case is 69g\n\nEartips: Includes 5 sets of removable silicon earbuds (XS, S, M, L, XL)\n\nApp Compatibility: Android & iPhone (but can pair as Bluetooth audio playback to any Bluetooth-compatible device)\n\nHeart Rate Compatibility: Broadcasts as Bluetooth HR profile, though, see details below.\n\nApple FindMy Support: Built-in\n\nWhen it comes to how it compares to the PowerBeats Pro (original, here\u2019s the key differences:\n\nUses Apple H2 instead of Apple H1 chipset\n\nContains 5 eartip options instead of 4 eartip options\n\nAdds Active Noise Cancellation audio options\n\nAdds Transparency Mode\n\nAdds Adaptive EQ\n\nAdds Personalized Spatial Audio\n\nAdds Heart Rate Monitoring\n\nIncreases battery life (24hrs to 45hrs for case+buds total), 9hrs to 10hrs for buds in ANC off mode\n\nAdds wireless charging for case (Qi)\n\nPrice remains same at $249USD/299EUR\n\nGot all that? Good, let\u2019s get cooking.\n\nHeart Rate Pairing & Enablement:\n\nNever have I ever spent so much time trying to get an Apple product to work. And the actual solution? Use Android.\n\nI\u2019m not kidding. After over 90 minutes of troubleshooting trying to get heart rate sensor pairing working within the Apple ecosystem, I gave up and turned to Android to capture my heart rate data for accuracy testing. It was the only way I could make it work. Still, I\u2019ll cover how this all works, both in theory, and in practice.\n\nFirst up, the PowerBeats 2 Pro are fully compatible with both Apple and Android. In the case of Apple, all of the various PowerBeats extra features are handled at the OS level, so you can toggle things on/off as needed (like noise cancellation, heart rate, etc\u2026). Whereas on Android, you\u2019d use the Beats app to do the same thing.\n\nNow, before we dive down that rabbit hole, let\u2019s look at the tech. You\u2019ll see a small black sensor pod on the inside, just below the eartips. This has both a green light (technically 3 green lights) and a photodiode to measure said lights:\n\nIt shines this light into your ear and then reads that optically, determining your heart rate. The green light is very visible to all of those around you:\n\nIn daylight, you don\u2019t notice it very much. Though, in darker conditions it\u2019s very visible:\n\nThis is a separate space from where the music comes out, so there isn\u2019t (theoretically) any interference between these two sensors. For some tests I had music playing, and other tests not. Music playback didn\u2019t appear to make any difference in terms of accuracy.\n\nNow, transitioning to the heart rate software side, the PowerBeats 2 Pro supports two core standards-based protocols:\n\nA) Bluetooth Audio device\n\nB) Bluetooth Heart Rate profile\n\nIt does this on two distinct channels, theoretically allowing you to pair individually the heart rate side to one device (gym equipment), while the audio side stays connected to another device (like your phone, for music). Spoiler: This doesn\u2019t actually work.\n\nTo pair the music side on an iPhone, you\u2019ll open the case up with an Apple device nearby, and it\u2019ll magically pop up and start the pairing process. Clean and simple:\n\nIn the case of Apple, it\u2019ll sync this pairing across all your Apple devices (e.g. Mac, iPhone, etc\u2026).\n\nMeanwhile, on an Android device, you\u2019ll open the case lid and hold down the single button within it, to enable pairing mode. A moment or two later, it\u2019ll show up in your Bluetooth devices and you can confirm the pairing. Again, also straightforward and simple.\n\nNow on both Android and iOS, you can entirely disable heart rate monitoring (which is only enabled during workouts, not 24\u00d77/during music). So if you don\u2019t want it to ever enable, you can toggle that easily.\n\nMeanwhile, assuming you do care about that, then it\u2019s enabled by default. However, it\u2019s not measuring/broadcasting yet. To do that, you need to quickly short press followed by a long press on either of the two Beats buttons (left or ride side). You\u2019ll hear a chime, which then enables the heart rate sensor for pairing. At which point, you should be able to pair it to various apps/devices as a standard Bluetooth audio device.\n\nIn reality, this is a hot mess.\n\nI tried numerous apps on iPhone and Mac: Peloton, Zwift, Strava, and Wahoo Fitness. Plus, Garmin watches and bike computers. About half the time it\u2019d see the heart rate sensor, but then the subsequent pairing would fail. It\u2019d make a disconnecting sound in the headphones, and a short bit later the app/device would show a failed attempt:\n\nI\u2019ll save you a crapton of rebooting/updating/troubleshooting/powering on/off/etc\u2026 The solution, was to remove the Beats PowerBeats 2 Pro from my Apple account (since it syncs across multiple Apple devices), and try directly with Android. Oddly enough, this worked flawlessly. I was immediately able to get heart rate data on Android across numerous apps, without issue. Below, pairing within Strava (left), Wahoo Fitness app (middle), and mid-workout on Wahoo app (right):\n\nYou can see the pairing here on the Google Pixel (Android) phone, showing a heart rate of 171bpm from the PowerBeats 2 Pro (Zwift on the Mac, is paired to a Polar H10 chest strap):\n\nInterestingly, in my troubleshooting, if I left the pairing with my iPhone, the moment I unlocked my iPhone, it\u2019d steal both connections and break the heart rate connection to Android. Thus again, the only solution being to fully remove from Apple.\n\nLess you think this was just me, some 5,000 miles away, Des of DesFit (another YouTube fitness channel, and my co-host in the Fit File Podcast), was concurrently troubleshooting the exact same process for equally as long. Likewise for Shervin Shares (YouTube Fitness reviewer), as noted on Instagram, he was unable to get HR to work and also had to fail back to Android. Said differently: If we can\u2019t get this to work, y\u2019all are hosed.\n\nIn discussions with Apple, it appears a substantial limitation is that the Beats cannot actually work with gym equipment for heart rate, and your phone playing music at the same time. A Beats PR/media representative has confirmed this, saying: \u201cYou cannot listen to music with your iPhone while also paired with the gym equipment for heart rate.\u201d\n\nNote, Apple & Beats emphasize the gym equipment heart rate monitoring in their marketing of the PowerBeats 2 Pro, as well as the first few screens when you set up the PowerBeats 2 Pro on your iPhone:\n\nIn any event, with it working on Android, off I went to record some data and start accuracy testing.\n\nHeart Rate Accuracy:\n\nFor these accuracy tests, I\u2019m comparing heart rate data to multiple other trusted heart rate sensors. This includes a heart rate chest strap, two other watches, and optical heart rate bands. In the case of the Apple Watch Ultra 2, this was on a separate Apple account, and more importantly, the PowerBeats 2 Pro were fully removed from my Apple account. Else, Apple will automatically leverage Apple Watch data over PowerBeats 2 Pro data (a silly automatic configuration btw).\n\nLet\u2019s start with the first workout, an indoor trainer ride. This ride had some nasty-hard intervals in it, but was a great test to see how things worked. Here it is versus a Polar H10 chest strap, an Apple Watch Ultra 2 optical HR sensor, and a Garmin Forerunner 965 optical HR sensor (Gen 4):\n\n(Note: The purple FR965 track, I simply forgot to hit the start button, hence the delayed start there)\n\nAs you can see, at first glance it\u2019s actually pretty darn good. And indeed, on the whole it was. However, there are two parts that are somewhat hidden in here where the heart rate dropped out entirely as I hit harder intervals. Because of the fact that the graphing software connects the dots, it appears to follow the rising slope of the other units, when in reality, it just connected two dots after upwards of a minute of no heart rate value displayed. You can see this here on the phone displaying the PowerBeats data, showing no value for Heart Rate (BPM):\n\nHere\u2019s how I\u2019d rank the ride overall (reds are mostly dropouts):\n\nAgain, on the whole, if we set aside the higher-intensity dropouts, it\u2019s not too bad actually.\n\nNext, we\u2019ve got an interval run with hill repeats. I start off with a nice warm-up, though, getting the PowerBeats 2 Pro to the start line was a struggle bus of waiting for it to find HR lock, then it would lose it, and then find it, and over and over for minutes. Once I finally found it\u2026well\u2026it lost it immediately. In any case, here\u2019s that data set:\n\nIn fact, what we quickly realize is that Beats is very clearly prioritizing accurate data over inaccurate data. Which is to say, when it appears their confidence level is low, they cut-off all heart rate data entirely. Literally, transmitting nothing (no value). I could see the logic in that if it happened rarely, but in reality, it happens constantly.\n\nWhere we can see that. I tried various tweaks to fit during the first 10-12 minutes, and it didn\u2019t seem to matter any. In fact, the only thing that seemed to matter was actually running harder. Perhaps it was sweat, perhaps warming up, either way, this is by any definition a hot mess.\n\nSo, then we look at the actual accuracy, and here\u2019s how that handles (compared to the other HR sensors, which were all near identical, though, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 did struggle briefly on two intervals).\n\nAs you can see, it was not good.\n\nStill, I gave things another whirl for one last run the next morning. Perhaps it just needed to sleep on it. I also ensured the firmware was fully up to date, and that\u2026well\u2026that\u2019s it.\n\nSo, off I went, music inclusive this time (again on Android):\n\nDuring the run, I could already tell things were gonna be bad. Dropouts were frequent, and when it made sense, I would stop and let the heart rate try and fix itself, aligning to the other straps (something I\u2019d never really do). Note the double-dash on the middle row, indicating no HR values. Music continued to play without issue.\n\nOtherwise, I just kept running. As you can see, things aren\u2019t good:\n\nJust to make this a bit more clear, here are all the points the heart rate had dropped out:\n\nAnd, even when it wasn\u2019t dropped out, it was still bad-bad. While the year is still young, this is definitely in the running for the worst optical HR sensor in a long while.\n\nThe thing is, doing more tests is kinda pointless. It\u2019s clear that any movement (even on a stationary bike) quickly leads to either dropouts or inaccurate heart rate. And outdoors running, it\u2019s even worse. Ultimately, I don\u2019t see any value in the heart rate sensor in this product, because it\u2019s simply not good enough to be useful, even for casual use.\n\n(Note: All of the charts in these accuracy sections were created using the DCR Analyzer tool. Though, I manually overlaid the color blocks on some of the images above. It allows you to compare power meters/trainers, heart rate, cadence, speed/pace, GPS tracks, and plenty more. You can use it as well, more details here.)\n\nWrap-Up:\n\nI had high hopes for the PowerBeats 2 Pro, mainly because Apple has traditionally done very well with optical heart rate sensing technologies. My assumption was that Apple wouldn\u2019t have released a product with inaccurate data. And indeed, the company frequently touts how many hours of testing with athletes it\u2019s done (stated at 1,500 hours of testing on 1,000 athletes):\n\nHowever, I\u2019d actually argue the biggest issue with the PowerBeats 2 Pro isn\u2019t (somehow) the heart rate accuracy. It\u2019s simple getting the heart rate sensor data into Apple devices or 3rd party devices. It\u2019s darn-near impossible to do consistently (or even inconsistently), unless I use Android. I fail to understand how this got shipped, or how this passed any quality bar/tests. When it seems none of the fitness reviewers can make this work (and none of the mainstream tech reviewers covered it), that\u2019s a very legit problem. The limitation of being unable to use the heart rate data on gym equipment and play music is downright bizarre.\n\nNonetheless, if you\u2019re an Android user, and plan to use it wholly within the phone (meaning, playback of music on the same phone as recording heart rate), and if you do activities with minimal movement (not running outside, or Zumba), then, I guess I kinda works. For my indoor ride, accuracy was largely quite good, until I got to the tippy-top pain locker of some hard intervals where I was sprinting a bit (then it lost track of HR). Otherwise, it was fine. Of course, running it was a hot mess.\n\nLooking at comparisons, ultimately, the story here isn\u2019t actually much different than the Sennheiser Momentum Sport earbuds that came out a year ago. Except, I\u2019d actually argue those sounded better, though, that had even worse heart rate performance. Like, it made even the PowerBeats 2 Pro run look picture-perfect. I only managed a single salvageable workout on those. Though to its credit, at least it properly paired without any issues whatsoever (including to an iPhone).\n\nIf I look back over the course of the last decade of companies touting ear-based heart rate monitoring/sensors, all of them keep saying that it\u2019s \u201cthe best place\u201d to monitor heart rate. Yet, over the last decade, all of them clearly demonstrate that it\u2019s simply not. From tiny startups, to midsized companies, and of course the behemoth that is Apple themselves. Every product I\u2019ve tested simply isn\u2019t that good.2\n\nIn some ways, I now understand Apple\u2019s somewhat frustrating decision that forces Apple Watch users data stream to the Apple Watch\u2019s optical HR sensor over the PowerBeats 2 Pro: The Apple Watch HR sensor actually works. And thus, that team has our back and knows better.\n\nWith that \u2013 thanks for reading!\n\nFOUND THIS POST USEFUL? SUPPORT THE SITE!\n\nHopefully, you found this post useful.

            "content": "CNET\n\nApple Intelligence is still a nascent technology, but after several months of having it active on my iPhone, iPad and Mac, I'm definitely leaning into some tools and ignoring others.\n\nYou need an iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Pro (or their Plus and Max variants) running iOS 18.3. This latest update enables Apple Intelligence automatically.\n\nMore features will be added as time goes on -- and keep in mind that Apple Intelligence is still officially beta software -- but this is where Apple is starting its AI age.\n\nOn the other hand: Are you not impressed with Apple Intelligence or want to wait until the tools advance some more? You can easily turn off Apple Intelligence entirely or use a smaller subset of features.\n\nSummaries bring TL;DR to your correspondence\n\nIn an era when there are so many demands on our attention and seemingly less time to dig into longer topics\u2026 Sorry, what was I saying?\n\nOh, right: How often have you wanted a \"too long; didn't read\" version of not just long emails but the fire hose of communication that blasts your way? The ability to summarize notifications, Mail messages and web pages is perhaps the most pervasive and least intrusive feature of Apple Intelligence so far.\n\nWhen a notification arrives, such as a text from a friend or group in Messages, the iPhone creates a short, single-sentence summary.\n\nApple Intelligence summarized two text messages. Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nSometimes summaries are vague, and sometimes they're unintentionally funny, but so far I've found them to be more helpful than not. Summaries can also be generated from alerts by third-party apps like news or social media apps -- although I suspect that my outdoor security camera is picking up multiple passersby over time and not telling me that 10 people are stacked by the door.\n\nNobody told me there's a party at my house. Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nThat said, Apple Intelligence definitely doesn't understand sarcasm or colloquialisms -- you can turn summaries off if you prefer.\n\nYou can also generate a longer summary of emails in the Mail app: Tap the Summarize button at the top of a message to view a rundown of the contents in a few dozen words.\n\nIn Safari, when viewing a page where the Reader feature is available, tap the Page Menu button in the address bar, tap Show Reader and then tap the Summary button at the top of the page.\n\nSummarize long articles in Safari in the Reader interface. Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nSiri gets a glow-up and better interaction\n\nI was amused during the iOS 18 and the iPhone 16 releases that the main visual indicator of Apple Intelligence -- the full-screen, color-at-the-edges Siri animation -- was noticeably missing. Apple even lit up the edges of the massive glass cube of its Apple Fifth Avenue Store in New York City like a Siri search.\n\nInstead, iOS 18 used the same-old Siri sphere.\n\nNow, the modern Siri look has arrived as of iOS 18.1, but only on devices that support Apple Intelligence.\n\nSiri under Apple Intelligence looks like a multicolor halo around the edges. James Martin/CNET\n\nWith the new look are a few Siri interaction improvements: It's more forgiving if you stumble through a query, like saying the wrong word or interrupting yourself mid-thought. It's also better about listening after delivering results, so you can ask related followup questions.\n\nHowever, the ability to personalize answers based on what Apple Intelligence knows about you is still down the road. What did appear, as of iOS 18.2, was integration of ChatGPT, which you can now use as an alternate source of information. For some queries, if Siri doesn't have the answer right away, you're asked if you'd like to use ChatGPT instead. You don't need a ChatGPT account to take advantage of this (but if you do, you can sign in).\n\nInvoke Siri silently without triggering everyone else's devices\n\nSpeaking of Siri, perhaps my favorite new feature is the ability to bring up the assistant without saying the words \"Hey Siri\" out loud. In my house, where I have HomePods and my family members use their own iPhones and iPads, I never know which device is going to answer my call (even though they're supposed to be smart enough to work it out).\n\nPlus, honestly, even after all this time I'm not always comfortable talking to my phone -- especially in public. It's annoying enough when people carry on phone conversations on speaker, I don't want to add to the hubbub by making Siri requests.\n\nInstead, I turn to a new feature called Tap to Siri. Double-tap the bottom edge of the screen on the iPhone or iPad to bring up the Siri search bar and the onscreen keyboard.\n\nDouble-tap the bar at the bottom of the screen to bring up a voice-free Siri search. Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nOn a Mac, go to System Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri and choose a key combination under Keyboard shortcut, such as Press Either Command Key Twice.\n\nYes, this involves more typing work than just speaking conversationally, but I can enter more specific queries and not wonder if my robot friend is understanding what I'm saying.\n\nRemove distractions from your pictures using Clean Up in the Photos app\n\nUntil iOS 18.1, the Photos app on the iPhone and iPad has lacked a simple retouch feature. Dust on the camera lens? Litter on the ground? Sorry, you need to deal with those and other distractions in the Photos app on MacOS or using a third-party app.\n\nNow Apple Intelligence includes Clean Up, an AI-enhanced removal tool, in the Photos app. When you edit an image and tap the Clean Up button, the iPhone analyzes the photo and suggests potential items to remove by highlighting them. Tap one or draw a circle around an area -- the app erases those areas and uses generative AI to fill in plausible pixels.\n\nRemove distractions in the Photos app using Clean Up. Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nIn this first incarnation, Clean Up isn't perfect, and you'll often get better results in other dedicated image editors. But for quickly removing annoyances from photos, it's fine.\n\nStay on task with the AI-boosted Reduce Interruptions Focus mode\n\nFocus modes on the iPhone can be enormously helpful, such as turning on Do Not Disturb to insulate yourself from outside distractions. You can also create personalized Focus modes. For example, my Podcast Recording mode blocks outside notifications except from a handful of people during scheduled recording times.\n\nWith Apple Intelligence enabled, a new Reduce Interruptions Focus mode is available. When active, it becomes a smarter filter for what gets past the wall holding back superfluous notifications. Even things that are not specified in your criteria for allowed notifications, such as specific people, might pop up. On my iPhone, for instance, that can include weather alerts or texts from my bank when a large purchase or funds transfer has occurred.\n\nTo enable it, open Control Center, tap the Focus button and choose Reduce Interruptions.\n\nThe Reduce Interruptions Focus mode (left) intelligently filters possible distractions. Turn it on in Control Center (middle). When something comes in that might need your attention, it shows up as a notification marked Maybe Important (right).

The app also appeared available in the Apple store. CBS News has reached out to Apple and TikTok for comment.\n\nThe moves come after Bloomberg reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi notified Apple and Google that the new law would not be immediately enforced.\n\nThere was growing concern among lawmakers and national security officials that TikTok's Beijing-based parent company ByteDance could use the immensely popular short-form video app to spy on Americans or manipulate the content they see on the platform.\n\nA bipartisan bill was signed into law by former President Joe Biden in April 2024 gave TikTok until Jan. 19 to sever ties with ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S.\n\nTikTok and ByteDance challenged the law, but it was upheld by the Supreme Court days before it took effect, which cited risks to national security over the app's data collection practices.\n\nWhen the deadline came last month, TikTok briefly and voluntarily shut down service in the U.S. The app was also pulled from the Apple and Google Play stores, even though the Biden administration, in its waning hours, said it would be up to the Trump administration to enforce it.\n\nHowever, just one day later, on the same day as his inauguration, President Trump signed an executive order that called on the Justice Department not to enforce the law for a period of at least 75 days.\n\nTikTok had remained operational for those in the U.S. who had already downloaded the app, though updates were unavailable as long as it was inaccessible in the app stores.\n\nMr. Trump told reporters Thursday that there are many people interested in acquiring TikTok and he was hopeful that a deal could be made.\n\n\"We'll have to probably get approval from China to do it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think China will be interested, because it's to their benefit, too.\"",

They change together. They are affected by the environment together. And so for us to have the opportunity to look across a much broader swath of health was really exciting,\" MacRae said.\n\nData for the study will be collected via Apple devices \u2013 including iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods \u2013 and third-party devices.\n\nThe study will examine the connection between activity, menstrual health, circulatory health, cognition, cardiovascular health, aging, metabolic health, cognition, mobility, respiratory health, neurologic health, hearing, mental health, sleep and more.\n\nResearchers will be able to quantify how somebody exercises, for example, and use that exercise as the metadata for another set of parameters they are studying the association between.\n\n\"We've deliberately, and Apple has been very transparent about this, created a platform that allows very dynamic and adaptive approaches to how you answer questions and how you even take principled approaches to recruitment, to engagement,\" MacRae said.\n\nIn conjunction with the Apple team, the researchers are considering how to accelerate the insights generated from the data to give the results back to participants quickly.\n\n\"What we're really trying to do is say, 'OK, here's an initial signal. Let's follow that signal up in a very rapid fashion with the right number of individuals, get insight, and give it back to people in real time.' And our goal is to try and iterate in three- to six-month cycles,\" MacRae said.\n\n\"I can't give feedback on, let's say, an aging phenotype or a metabolic phenotype in that timeline,\" he said. \"On the other hand, I can give feedback on a sleep phenotype, a joint phenotype or an exercise phenotype much more quickly.\"\n\nMacRae emphasized that participants' data is fully tokenized, meaning the data is given a non-sensitive token or a unique identifier linking to the original data. Security and privacy are sacrosanct, and the data still belongs to the participant, he said.\n\n\"We're not just building insights that will apply inside the Apple ecosystem, but they will be relevant to everybody, and that's very powerful. If you have a platform that is secure enough and private enough that people trust it, that's the platform we want to do these types of studies, and so we're motivated to do exactly that,\" MacRae said.\n\nThe study will begin as a five-year endeavor but may expand beyond that time frame, and individuals living in the U.S. can enroll in the Apple Health Study through the Apple Research app in the App Store.\n\nTHE LARGER TREND\n\nApple worked with Brigham and Women's Health on its Apple Heart and Movement Study along with the American Heart Association. The ongoing study explores the connection between physical activity and heart health.\n\nApple's other health studies include the Apple Women's Health Study done with Harvard T.H.

            "content": "Apple\u2019s App Store and the Google Play store have restored TikTok for U.S. users as of Thursday, after the companies had removed it on Jan. 19.\n\nThe tech giants pulled TikTok from their U.S. stores because of a federal law effectively banning TikTok as of Jan. 19 because Chinese parent ByteDance had not divested its ownership of TikTok. Penalties for violating the law by hosting or distributing TikTok in the U.S. are $5,000 per user, or as much as $850 billion in penalties (given TikTok\u2019s claim it has 170 million U.S. users). As such, both Apple and Google had removed the app.\n\nOn Jan. 20, President Trump signed an executive order instructing the U.S. attorney general to abstain for a 75-day period from enforcing the TikTok ban. The order also instructed the AG \u201cto issue a letter to each [TikTok] provider stating that there has been no violation of the statute and that there is no liability for any conduct\u201d as of Jan. 19 and through the 75-day extension. According to a Bloomberg report, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent both Apple and Google letters Thursday to that effect.\n\nReps for TikTok, Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for information.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nOn its official U.S. blog, TikTok acknowledged the return of the app to the Apple and Google stores without additional explanation. \u201cThe TikTok app is now available for download from the App Store and Google Play. Our U.S. users can download the latest version of our app and continue to create, discover and share what they love on TikTok,\u201d the company said in a post.\n\nA now-deleted message on Apple\u2019s support site, posted Feb. 7, explained that TikTok and other ByteDance apps were not available in the U.S. The message said, \u201cApple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates. Pursuant to the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, apps developed by ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries \u2014 including TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and others \u2014 will no longer be available for download or updates on the App Store for users in the United States starting January 19, 2025.\u201d\n\nTikTok, after losing an appeal to the Supreme Court challenging the ban on First Amendment grounds, shut down the app in the U.S. on Jan. 18 ahead of the law\u2019s deadline but the company restored service to U.S. users the next day citing incoming Trump\u2019s pledge to not enforce the ban while he seeks to broker a solution keeping the app legal.\n\nTrump\u2019s arbitrary 75-day pause on the TikTok ban would expire April 5, 2025. It\u2019s not clear that Trump can successfully find a solution that will meet the requirements of the law.\n\nThe TikTok divest-or-ban law passed last year by Congress with strong bipartisan support and was signed by President Biden. Lawmakers have expressed deep concern over TikTok\u2019s Chinese ties, citing the risk that the Chinese Communist Party would be able to demand data on the app\u2019s U.S. users or push propaganda to American users.\n\nTrump has proposed ByteDance and TikTok\u2019s owners give the U.S. government a 50% ownership position in a TikTok joint venture. He\u2019s also suggested that Oracle founder Larry Ellison or tech mogul Elon Musk would be suitable buyers. But ByteDance has not indicated that it\u2019s willing to divest its ownership in TikTok as mandated by the U.S. law. ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by \u201cglobal institutional investors\u201d including Blackrock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna International Group, with 20% owned by its Chinese founders and 20% by employees (including U.S. employees).",

            "content": "TikTok is back on the Apple and Google app stores\n\ntoggle caption Ashley Landis/AP\n\nApple and Google have returned TikTok to mobile app stores in the U.S., ending a nearly month-long standoff between the tech giants and the video platform since a law banning the app took effect in January.\n\nBy restoring the viral video platform, Apple and Google are allowing the app to be downloaded on mobile devices. It also provides a way for TikTok to send millions of Americans software updates to debug the service and provide security fixes.\n\nThe tech firms yanked TikTok from app stores on Jan. 19, the date a law passed by Congress , and upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nUnder the law, businesses cannot support TikTok as long as it is controlled by ByteDance, a Beijing-based tech company.\n\nBut on Thursday, Apple and Google received a letter from Attorney General Pam Bondi informing the companies that the Trump administration will not prosecute them for supporting TikTok, according to sources familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly about it.\n\nThe assurance from Bondi that President Trump would not fine the companies was enough for Apple and Google to bring the app back.\n\nLegal experts say a letter from the Trump administration promising to not prosecute can still mean Apple and Google are in violation of U.S. law.\n\n\"You now have some of the biggest corporations in the world accepting the word of the Trump Justice Department that this statute won't be weaponized against them,\" said Georgetown University law professor Anupam Chander. \"This could help them stay on the good side of the Trump administration and address the financial hit they're taking by not hosting TikTok on app stores.\"\n\nRepresentatives from Apple, Google and TikTok declined to comment.\n\nLawmakers in Washington fear ByteDance is ultimately answerable to the Chinese government, which could make Americans' data and political views potentially vulnerable to a foreign adversary.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe move by Apple and Google carries risk.\n\nUnder the law, companies doing business with TikTok can face fines of $5,000 per user who is still able to access the app. The penalties could add up to hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nTrump issued an executive order on his first day in office seeking to provide legal protection to companies that work with TikTok. In practical terms, it instructed the Department of Justice to not hold any companies liable for violating the TikTok ban.\n\nYet legal experts say a president's order cannot override an act of Congress, and that doing business with TikTok is still, in theory, punishable with steep fines. That penalty has a statute of limitation of five years, so a year beyond Trump's term.\n\nThe law offers one way out of this impasse: It allows the president to undo the ban if he can show Congress that a deal has been made to sever TikTok from ByteDance, bringing TikTok into compliance with the law. President Trump has said that negotiations are underway, and that he would like the U.S. to have a 50% stake in the video app.\n\nNPR reported last month that Oracle, Microsoft and other American investors are putting together a bid to purchase TikTok's U.S. operation under the guidance of top White House officials. Under such a deal, ByteDance could retain a minority stake in the video service, according to two people with direct knowledge of the talks who were not authorized to speak publicly about the deliberations, which are still underway.\n\nOther bidders, including the content creator known as Mr. Beast and former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, have said they are interested buyers.\n\nSome tech companies were quick to reestablish service for TikTok. The morning after the app shut down, Trump posted a message on his social media network promising an executive order on his first day in office that would shield them from liability. Oracle, along with web infrastructure providers Amazon Web Services and Akamai, promptly returned service to TikTok.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIt was a symbolically potent gesture, signaling that Trump's intention to rescue the app from a federal ban was enough for the firms to restore the backbone of TikTok's web support.\n\n",

He also gave us a date. His X post says, \"Wednesday, February 19 #AppleLaunch,\" so at least we know exactly when the company plans to announce its new product.\n\nWe can only make some educated speculation, like everyone else, regarding what Apple plans to announce.\n\niPhone SE 4 expected with these upgrades\n\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman said that Apple would announce the iPhone SE 4 next week (which just so happens to have February 19), that could certainly be the direction Apple is going with this announcement, as the timing lines up perfectly.\n\nThe iPhone SE 4 is rumored to feature a bigger 6.1-inch OLED display, sharper 48MP camera and USB-C charging.

Apple has reportedly been hard at work on a new HomePod device. The logo featured in Tim Cook's video gives off a HomePod look and feel, but that could be just a coincidence.\n\nOur own Managing Editor, Kate Kozuch, said the colors of the logo give MacBook Air M4 vibes, which is another Apple product we've heard rumblings about launching in the near future.\n\nWhat we do know is that we don't know, and that's exciting. The three devices listed above make the most sense to me (I lean towards the iPhone SE 4 as the most likely announcement), and there could be a complete surprise dropped by Apple.\n\nIt's also possible that Apple will announce multiple products on February 19. Maybe all three of the products teased in recent rumors will get an unveiling. Thankfully, we only have to wait a few days to find out.",

The study spans a number of health and disease areas, including activity, aging, cardiovascular health, circulatory health, cognition, hearing, menstrual health, mental health, metabolic health, mobility, neurologic health, respiratory health, sleep, and more.\n\n\u201cResearch and validation are part of the foundation of all of our work in health, supporting the innovative features we bring to our users across devices,\u201d said Sumbul Desai, M.D., Apple\u2019s vice president of Health. \u201cThe valuable insights we\u2019ve gained since launching the Research app have allowed us to bring innovative new tools to our users \u2014 including the Vitals app on Apple Watch and Walking Steadiness on iPhone \u2014 and surface new insights in areas of health that have long been undervalued, like menstrual and hearing health. We\u2019re thrilled to bring forward the Apple Health Study, which will only accelerate our understanding of health and technology across the human body, both physically and mentally.\u201d\n\nThe Apple Health Study is designed to explore changes in health and how technology can help identify important insights for future product development. When one aspect of a person\u2019s health changes, their body can emit a signal, either physically or emotionally. Changes in health can affect one or more parts of the body, and others may affect wellbeing overall, so helping to identify these changes earlier can help offer a more proactive approach to health. For example, early detection of a change in hearing health could reduce the risk for cognitive decline.\n\nThe Apple Health Study is currently open for enrollment through the Research app for participants who live in the U.S., meet the minimum age requirements, and complete the informed consent process.\n\nThe Research app democratizes how medical research is conducted by bringing together academic medical institutions, healthcare organizations, and the Apple products users already make a part of their everyday life.1 Participation is voluntary, and participants choose which data types they\u2019d like to share with researchers, and are able to stop sharing at any time. Apple does not have access to identifying information, such as contact information that participants provide through the Research app. Participants can withdraw from any study at any time, ending future data collection.\n\nThe Apple Health Study is available in version 6.0 of the Research app, on iPhone models compatible with iOS 16 or later.\n\nPress Contacts\n\nZaina Khachadourian\n\nApple\n\nzkhachadourian@apple.com\n\nApple Media Helpline\n\nmedia.help@apple.com",

It\u2019s compatible with all Android devices including smartphones and tablets running Android 10 and later.\n\nAndroid users can subscribe to Apple TV+ ($9.99/month in the U.S.) and MLS Season Pass ($14.99/month or $99/season) using their Google Play account on Android mobile and Google TV devices. Those are the same prices for the services as through iOS.\n\nApple said its engineers built the Android version of the Apple TV app from the ground up to be optimized for the platform and \u201cto deliver Android users a familiar and intuitive interface.\u201d However, the initial version of Apple TV\u2019s Android app will not support casting from a mobile device to connected TVs.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why it took Apple until now to release a native Android app for Apple TV, which debuted in the U.S. in December 2016. There is a \u201cliving room\u201d version of the Apple TV app for Chromecast with Google TV (launched in January 2021) \u2014 which will be updated Wednesday to let users subscribe to Apple TV+ and MLS Season Pass. just as with the native Android app. Meanwhile, in November 2015, Apple released an Android version of the Apple Music streaming app.\n\nThe Apple TV app on Android, available in more than 100 markets worldwide, includes key features like Continue Watching to pick up where a user left off across all their devices, and Watchlist to keep track of everything they want to watch in the future. The app streams over Wi-Fi or cellular connections and includes the ability to download to watch content offline.\n\nThe native Android version of Apple TV joins the matrix of platforms the app supports. In addition to Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Apple Vision Pro and Mac), it\u2019s available on smart TVs from Samsung, LG, Sony, Vizio, TCL and others; Roku and Amazon Fire TV devices; Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox gaming consoles; and the web at tv.apple.com.\n\nUntil now, Apple TV+ users have been able to access the service on Android in a roundabout way: If they signed up for Apple TV+ through Amazon\u2019s Prime Video, a premium add-on that launched last October, they could stream programming through Prime Video\u2019s Android app.\n\nThe Apple TV app, in addition to providing access to Apple TV+, lets you buy or rent new movie releases and a catalog of more than 100,000 movies and shows. (If you have an existing Apple TV account, any purchases will be available through the Android app.) The app also lets you subscribe directly to Paramount+, Starz and AMC+ and allows you to search for shows and movies from over 100 video streaming apps, including Disney+, Hulu, Max, Prime Video and Peacock.\n\nApple TV+ is the company\u2019s streaming service stocked with dozens of original series, films, documentaries, and kids and family entertainment. Featured shows include \u201cSeverance,\u201d \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d \u201cSlow Horses,\u201d \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d \u201cPresumed Innocent,\u201d \u201cShrinking,\u201d \u201cHijack,\u201d \u201cLoot,\u201d \u201cPalm Royale\u201d and \u201cMasters of the Air.\u201d Apple original films include \u201cWolfs,\u201d \u201cThe Instigators,\u201d \u201cThe Family Plan,\u201d \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d and the Oscar-winning \u201cCODA.\u201d Apple TV+ is also the home of \u201cFriday Night Baseball,\u201d a weekly MLB double-header available in the U.S. and other countries with no local broadcast restrictions.\n\nMLS Season Pass, available separately through the Apple TV app, provides access to every live Major League Soccer regular-season match, the entire playoffs and Leagues Cup with no blackouts. The league\u2019s 30th season kicks off the weekend of Feb. 22.

Things appear to be looking up for the tech giant.\n\nAnd that\u2019s translated to a slight reprieve for the company\u2019s stock, which is up just more than 1% over the last five days compared to a decline of 6% year to date.\n\nBut at least one analyst isn\u2019t holding his breath. Jefferies equity research analyst Edison Lee says the market optimism surrounding the latest developments out of Cupertino is misplaced.\n\n\u201cWe reiterate our cautious view of [Apple], despite imminent launch of [the iPhone SE] and a potential AI deal with [Alibaba],\u201d Lee wrote in a note to investors Wednesday.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple will launch its latest iteration of the entry-level iPhone SE sometime next week. The phone is said to cost somewhere between $400 and $500 and feature a design similar to the iPhone 14, complete with Face ID facial recognition, a larger display, and a more powerful processor.\n\nBeyond its low price point, which is several hundred dollars less than the $799 iPhone 16, the iPhone SE\u2019s biggest feature will be the inclusion of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s generative AI platform. The service provides a number of AI capabilities including notification summaries, writing tools, and photo editing functionality. It also has a more advanced version of Siri that works alongside OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nBy offering Apple Intelligence on a lower-cost iPhone, the thinking goes, Apple will attract more users to the platform, driving greater interest among consumers. But whether that happens is difficult to know.\n\nApple Intelligence is the main attraction of Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 lineup but hasn\u2019t been the smash hit Wall Street was hoping it would be.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook told investors during the company\u2019s latest earnings call that iPhone sales were higher in areas where Apple Intelligence is available. Morgan Stanley Research analyst Erik Woodring, however, wrote in an investor note on Tuesday that the software only provided a small tailwind to iPhone sales during the quarter.\n\nInstead, Woodring said, sales were probably driven by \u201cUS consumers accelerating purchases of the discounted 1-year old iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max.\u201d Those phones, along with the iPhone 16 line, are the only ones that can use Apple Intelligence at the moment.\n\nApple's last generation iPhone SE. REUTERS/Mike Segar \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\n\nIn his note, Lee wrote he remains cautious of the iPhone SE\u2019s potential because it will reportedly only include a single rear camera. He also doesn't see Apple Intelligence as a major selling point yet and says smartphone sales in China are already falling following the Lunar New Year.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Apple is once again running ads on the social media platform X, after the company previously stopped all advertising on the website due to the presence of objectionable content on it.\n\nThe iPhone maker hasn't marketed its products and services on X, formerly known as Twitter, since November 2023, but all of that seemingly changed on Tuesday. New advertisements have appeared on the website, following a January 2025 report that indicated the company was looking to resume its marketing efforts on X, which turned out to be true.\n\nOne of the ads recently posted by Apple promotes the privacy features of the Safari web browser, emphasizing that it helps protect users against online trackers. \"A browser that's actually private,\" the advertisement reads.\n\nApple's initial decision to pause X advertising was made due to concerns regarding some of the statements and comments made by the platform's CEO, Elon Musk, particularly because he promoted and interacted with an arguably hateful post directed towards the Jewish community in the United States.\n\nNaturally, there was immediate pushback from the platform's users, who quickly turned to alternative websites and apps such as Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon. It's also why select tech companies, including Apple, ceased all advertising on X. In both instances, the fear was that their content would appear alongside posts with discriminatory, racist, homophobic, or otherwise objectionable content from self-proclaimed Neo-Nazis or alt-right accounts.\n\nMusk's apparent desire for \"free speech\" meant that the social media platform experienced an increase in right-wing and even discriminatory content ever since he took control. Under Musk's control, users are often able to post overtly sexist, racist, and extremist content, even expressing admiration for figures such as Hitler in some instances due to limited moderation.\n\nThe CEO himself has repeatedly made claims of alleged racism towards white people and believes that hordes of illegal immigrants are ruining the United States, among other things, making him a controversial figure at the very least.\n\nIn 2023, Apple was able to distance itself from Musk's comments by promptly shutting down all advertising on X. The situation has since changed dramatically, however, as Musk is now in charge of the so-called \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" which operates outside of the federal government but still reports to President Trump.\n\nThis means that Musk ultimately has much more influence, being more than the CEO of a social media platform, even though he is not an elected official.\n\nGiven Musk's apparent role under the Trump administration, it makes sense that Apple would attempt to reconcile in some way. Apple's CEO Tim Cook has attended dinners with President Trump, and even donated $1 million of his own money to the inauguration.\n\nMusk was reportedly present during some of these interactions, so it's possible that there were discussions of resuming advertising on X.\n\nApple is likely introducing X ads to appease Elon Musk because of his newfound political importance.\n\nTim Cook already has an established strategy for dealing with Donald Trump, where conversations typically focus on a singular issue that affects Apple. It seems that Apple now has to find ways of appeasing Elon Musk as well, presumably due to his newfound importance.\n\nThis is likely the only logical explanation as to why Tim Cook, an openly gay man, would choose to interact with someone like Musk, who has repeatedly shared anti-LGBT content on his platform.\n\nAdvertising on X, with the associated implications and consequences, is likely significant enough for Apple and Tim Cook to overlook some of Musk's arguably questionable antics. It's possibly all part of a larger move to gain the favor of the Trump administration, its allies, and Republican lawmakers.\n\nThe iPhone maker recently renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America in Apple Maps, following an executive order signed by President Trump on January 20, 2025.\n\nIt's not entirely clear if Apple's made a genuine commitment, though, or if the company is merely experimenting with X ads. The company's advertising posts have relatively low engagement levels, with the Safari advert only reaching around 129 thousand views \u2014 a minuscule amount compared to the millions of Apple users worldwide.\n\nThough Apple maintains a presence on X via its official accounts, and through the accounts of its executives, it remains to be seen whether or not the iPhone maker will increase or decrease its advertising efforts on the platform, or if it will revert to its previous position. Outside influences seem to be playing a part beyond simply wanting to show ads to users.",

I sobbed over One Day edits, reposted Bridgerton press junket clips, and fangirled over Nobody Wants This along with everyone else scrolling TikTok. So, when I started seeing interview snippets of Belle Gibson\u2014the basis of Netflix\u2019s new show Apple Cider Vinegar\u2014responding to claims she made up a fake cancer story and built a wellness empire on that lie, I immediately ran to Netflix.\n\nLike the viral Netflix shows before it, Apple Cider Vinegar has ruled my social media feed for days. I mean, how can it not? A true story about an influencer faking cancer and scamming her audience is just the kind of unbelievable true-crime internet tale we live for. But after binge-watching, what shocked me most wasn\u2019t Belle Gibson\u2019s outrageous lies or cruel actions\u2014it was the eerie similarities between Belle and her devoted audience and the wellness industry today. In an era where \u201cwellness influencer\u201d is synonymous with \u201cexpert,\u201d and TikToks are treated like scientific studies, Apple Cider Vinegar is a much-needed reminder that the wellness industry is just that: an industry designed to profit.\n\nWhat is Apple Cider Vinegar about?\n\nApple Cider Vinegar tells the true story of Australian influencer Belle Gibson, whose Instagram account chronicled her supposed journey of healing brain cancer with alternative medicine. After amassing a large following, Belle launched a successful app, Whole Pantry, which offered recipes claiming to cure cancer while funding her lavish lifestyle. Her advice influenced actual cancer patients to reject traditional treatments like chemotherapy in favor of her unproven holistic methods. But the truth? Belle never had cancer. She lied to grow an audience that trusted her as a credible source for medical advice. The series follows Belle\u2019s rise from obscurity to wellness \u201cexpert\u201d to her exposure as a fraud.\n\nThe similarities between Apple Cider Vinegar and today\u2019s wellness industry\n\nGoing into this series, I expected a wild, heartbreaking story. While I got that, I also left with a pit in my stomach thinking about how the wellness industry exploits consumers today, just like Belle did.\n\nWe prioritize influencer advice over medical professionals\n\nThe wellness industry is so pervasive that it\u2019s easy to overlook how much we rely on influencers to guide our everyday decisions\u2014whether it\u2019s the supplements we take, the powders we mix into our drinks, or the diets we follow. These posts offer medical advice, yet we often trust creators with no proven medical background to recommend them, just like how Belle\u2019s dedicated followers trusted her with something as serious as cancer treatment. It might seem harmless to try a trend. After all, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re letting a TikTok decide how you face a serious diagnosis, but that\u2019s not always the case.\n\nI saw this play out in my own life after I jumped on the mouth-taping bandwagon and sealed my mouth shut every night because I saw it online. When I mentioned this to an ENT during a visit for breathing issues, he told me to stop immediately due to airway blockages in my nose, explaining that mouth taping could have been dangerously restricting my ability to breathe at night. I didn\u2019t think twice about the risks when I saw so many people claiming it could help you sleep better, improve oral health, and even sharpen your jawline, much less consider consulting a doctor before. I simply clicked the link in the bio and purchased without a second thought.\n\n\u201cHer advice influenced actual cancer patients to reject traditional treatments like chemotherapy in favor of her unproven holistic methods. But the truth? Belle never had cancer. She lied to grow an audience that trusted her as a credible source for medical advice.\u201d\n\nBelieving every wellness influencer and the trends and items they claim to be \u201clife-changing\u201d or whatever other hyperbolic adjective assigned to it reveals a much larger issue\u2014as a society, we value these opinions over real doctors and experts. We all know that everything we see on the internet isn\u2019t true. You\u2019ve undoubtedly heard that social media is a highlight reel a thousand times, so why do we still put so much credit into unqualified content creators\u2019 advice when it can have real-world implications on our health?\n\nThere is money behind influencers\u2019 posts\n\nScrolling is often labeled as a \u201cmindless\u201d activity. We think of it as a way to decompress and relax, and, hey, if you get a good tip here or there, that\u2019s just a bonus. But the reality is that while we see influencers as entertainment or even friends, just looking out for us and giving us advice from the kindness of their hearts, that\u2019s not actually what is happening. What we perceive as genuine advice is usually a sales pitch. More often than not, there\u2019s a monetary value behind your view, behind your click, and especially behind your trust. In Apple Cider Vinegar, Belle made her money when people downloaded her app, bought her book, or donated to her fundraiser for charities (which she lined her own pockets with). Now, the sales tactics might not be as obvious. I\u2019m not saying your favorite wellness influencer is purposely lying and scamming you out of money, but is trusting wellness tips from someone profiting off the views to be completely truthful really that different from believing Belle\u2019s fabricated cancer story?\n\nWhile influencers earning money from affiliate links or partnerships isn\u2019t inherently unethical and doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t use and love a product, the lack of transparency about financial incentives on social media creates a gray area. This can be especially dangerous when dealing with the wellness industry and medical products. It\u2019s impossible to know if these recommendations are driven by a genuine belief in the product or by the promise of profit. The issue is only made worse by the power of parasocial relationships, where audiences feel a personal connection and trust these influencers more than traditional experts. This trust can be weaponized to sell products, blurring the line between genuine advice and marketing.\n\nWellness isn\u2019t cheap, either. The \u201csmall\u201d costs, $20 for a supplement here, $30 for a collagen powder there, add up quickly. So before you make a purchase, you should think twice about who is benefiting. Belle didn\u2019t have to convince her audience that her advice was a matter of life or death; they were fighting the disease she claimed to have themselves. They knew the stakes, and those stakes kept them reading. Social media figures in 2025 use similar tactics by fearmongering their audiences to keep them watching and clicking. When your health is on the line, it\u2019s easy for a product to turn from a \u201cwant\u201d to a \u201cneed.\u201d The reality is that a product sold on Amazon with an affiliate link will never be the magic cure-all that influencers claim.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that a product sold on Amazon with an affiliate link will never be the magic cure-all that influencers claim.\u201d\n\nFacts are secondary to a good story\n\nBelle Gibson thrived because people wanted to believe her story. When faced with the glamour of a success story versus the mundanity of clinical facts, many chose the former. Today, this plays out in TikToks touting miracle results from products or trends, often presented as lifestyle tips rather than ads. Personal anecdotes\u2014sincere or scripted\u2014are more compelling than dry data or complicated medical explanations. For example, the carnivore diet (AKA the animal diet) went viral after a flood of creators posted about it, saying it was the secret to healing your gut and getting toned. They urged their audiences to avoid fruits and vegetables in favor of meats and eggs, and a wave of people jumped on board even though cardiologists say the diet is incredibly unhealthy in the long run, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable people want a quick fix to their health problems rather than navigate insurance hurdles or advocate for themselves at appointments. Content creators also offer a sense of relatability and comfort you usually can\u2019t find in a doctor\u2019s office. They\u2019re struggling with the same things you are and have come out on the other side, but still, this trend of prioritizing a good story over evidence shows how much power influencers hold over our decisions.\n\nIntentions don\u2019t always matter\n\nApple Cider Vinegar also centers on Milla, a fictional character inspired by real wellness bloggers who genuinely believed their alternative treatments were effective. Diagnosed with cancer at 22, Milla rejected doctor-recommended amputation in favor of holistic remedies like juices and coffee enemas. She entered remission (though it\u2019s unclear if she ever had proper scans) and became a wellness advocate, urging others to reject chemotherapy. Her advice ultimately resulted in her mother\u2019s death after diagnosis and, later, her own. While Milla may have acted out of sincere belief, her influence shows how well-meaning misinformation can be as dangerous as outright deception.\n\nMilla\u2019s story is a more accurate representation of the creators we encounter today than Belle\u2019s. Mistrust in the medical system drives people to seek alternative solutions, and even with a lack of credentials, these influencers give people a new path and a sense of hope regarding their health. The content creators in these communities may genuinely believe in the advice they give and even follow it themselves. But pure intentions don\u2019t erase the harm caused by spreading misinformation. When an influencer with no medical training promotes raw milk or detox teas, the consequences\u2014misguided decisions, wasted money, or worse\u2014are real.\n\nHow can we learn from Apple Cider Vinegar?\n\nThe wellness industry thrives because we give people on social media our blind trust. To combat this, we need to practice media literacy. Ask yourself: What is this post trying to get me to do? How might the creator benefit?\n\nWhen in doubt, prioritize doctors and experts over influencers. Yes, the medical industry has its own flaws, from dismissing women\u2019s concerns to lack of access to affordable healthcare. However, finding a trustworthy medical professional is far more beneficial than placing your health in the hands of someone whose credentials are built on hashtags and affiliate links.\n\nThe wellness industry isn\u2019t going anywhere, but Apple Cider Vinegar reminds us that it\u2019s up to us to separate fact from fiction and to question who truly has our best interests at heart.",

But why not wear it elsewhere? I\u2019ve worn an Apple Watch on my ankle to keep it out of the way during kettlebell workouts, and that\u2019s also a common placement for people who walk while they work, or who have a job or hobby that isn\u2019t compatible with constant watch-wearing. So how do you do this, why might you do this, and is the data really just as accurate? Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nHow to wear your Apple Watch on your ankle\n\nLet\u2019s get the \u201chow\u201d out of the way first. If you have small feet (and ankles), you can just slip your regular wristband onto your ankle. I find that with a sport loop (the velcro band) I can fully loosen it, and just barely manage to slide it over my foot.\n\nWhat\u2019s easier, though, is detaching one end of the wristband from the watch. Wrap it around your ankle, and then fasten the band. You still need a bit of length on the band to be able to close the velcro, but this works for me (and is a lot easier than taking my shoe off).\n\nAll that said, there is an even simpler way: Buy yourself an extra-long strap that can easily fit your ankle . (You can also wear it on your bicep, if you prefer.)\n\nWhy people wear their Apple Watch on their ankle\n\nThere are two types of people in this world: those who hear about ankle straps and go \u201cwhy?\u201d (or \u201cdoesn\u2019t that look like an ankle monitor?\u201d which, no, it doesn\u2019t ) and those who go \u201cof course,\u201d because they either do it themselves or immediately see the utility. These are some of the most common reasons:\n\nTo count steps while your hands aren\u2019t moving , for example if you walk on a treadmill while you work or get in most of your steps while pushing a stroller or cart.\n\nTo keep your watch out of the way during activities like boxing (where you might wear wraps or gloves) or kettlebell workouts (where the weight often rests against your wrist).\n\nTo comply with rules about not wearing watches at work\u2014for example, surgeons or factory workers who need to keep their wrists unadorned.\n\nSure, you could solve some of these problems with a different device like a Whoop, but why pay the subscription fees when you could just get an ankle strap for the smartwatch you already have? For sports, I\u2019d argue it\u2019s best to use a chest strap to monitor your heart rate, but I\u2019m not the smartwatch police. You do what you like.\n\nHow well does the Apple Watch count steps when worn on your ankle?\n\nTo answer this question, I did some tests. I walked on a treadmill for three minutes per test, at 3.0 miles per hour (a normal walking pace). I had an Apple Watch Series 10 on either my left wrist or left ankle, and for comparison a Garmin Forerunner 265S on my right, paired to a chest strap.\n\nI counted steps the old fashioned way (\u201cone, two, three\u2026\u201d) and learned that I typically take 105-110 steps per minute at this pace. Here\u2019s what I got from my devices:\n\nWalking normally, hands swinging at my sides : 320 steps on Apple Watch, 322 on Garmin\n\nWalking with my hands resting on the treadmill handlebar in front of me : 318 steps on Apple Watch, 0(!) on Garmin\n\nApple Watch on the inside of my ankle : 326 steps on Apple Watch, 326 on Garmin (note: this position on my ankle was pretty uncomfortable.)\n\nApple Watch on the outside of my ankle: 315 steps on Apple Watch, 308 on Garmin\n\nThe Apple Watch got nearly the same step count for all of the tests, wrist and ankle, which surprised me. I was equally surprised that the Garmin counted none for the test where my hands were resting on the handlebar.\n\nWhile this is the result I got with a nice new Series 10 Apple Watch, it\u2019s possible that older models and other brands of watch may not pick up steps as well while your hands aren\u2019t moving, or that it may depend on exactly what you\u2019re doing\u2014typing versus just resting, for example.\n\nHow accurate is the Apple Watch for heart rate when worn on your ankle?\n\nApple watch on ankle, shown in purple; chest strap heart rate in blue. Credit: Beth Skwarecki\n\nFor heart rate, the story was a bit different. It seems to be hard for the sensor to get a good contact with skin when worn on a body part as lumpy and mobile as an ankle. I\u2019ve noticed this anecdotally\u2014it was an issue during those kettlebell workouts I did before I got a chest strap\u2014so I thought I\u2019d test it here as well.",

            "content": "AI is getting added to everything it seems, and sometimes, when you don't want it. The latest security updates from Apple not only include Apple Intelligence features (for devices that support them), but they're turned on by default. If you're just not interested, or you have valid reasons like the ones below for putting the brakes on AI in your device, keep reading to learn how to turn off Apple Intelligence or some individual features.\n\nEven if you did previously disable the tech, you may have found it back on again with the releases of the recent iOS 18.3.1, iPadOS 18.3.1 and MacOS Sequoia 15.3.1 updates. Before, the features were opt-in only, and then Apple enabled them for everyone who installed the last update. If you click Continue on the setup screen in the latest incremental update, you could find it back on again. (I say \"could\" because, in my testing, this behavior is not consistent. Apple Intelligence was turned back on for me on a Mac Mini and iPhone 16 Pro, but not a MacBook Air.)\n\nWhy turn off Apple Intelligence in the first place?\n\nSince the first Apple Intelligence features rolled out in iOS 18.1, some people have chosen to opt out of the new technology. Tools such as Image Playground, Genmoji and message summaries can use up to 7GB of your device's internal storage -- a sizable chunk, especially if you tend to run against the upper limit of its free space.\n\nEven if storage is not an issue, you just may not be interested in Apple's set of AI features. According to a new survey by SellCell, 73% of Apple users think AI adds little to no value to the experience. In a separate survey, CNET found that 25% of smartphone owners aren't interested at all.\n\nOr, honestly, you may not want to deal with features that are creating inaccurate summaries or that can be replicated without Apple Intelligence.\n\nThe trainer killed someone? Screenshot by Nelson Aguilar/CNET\n\nThe good news is that you can turn off Apple Intelligence entirely. Or if you'd prefer to pick and choose, you can selectively disable some of the features. Doing so also lets you reclaim the storage it's using.\n\nIs Apple Intelligence really ready to be on by default?\n\nI'm not an AI crank -- I appreciate features such as notification summaries and the Clean Up tool in the Photos app. And yet, Apple Intelligence is also a work in progress, an evolving set of features that Apple is heavily hyping while gradually developing. I wouldn't hold it against you if you wanted to not be distracted or feel like you're doing Apple's testing for them (that's what the developer and public betas are for).\n\nRemember that Apple Intelligence works only on the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro or M-series Macs and iPads (plus the newest iPad mini).\n\nHere's what you need to know about disabling it.\n\nWatch this: Does Apple Think We're Stupid? Apple Intelligence Ads Say Yes 06:15\n\nHow to see the amount of storage Apple Intelligence is using\n\nIf you're concerned about the storage requirements of Apple Intelligence, you can find out how much the system is using by going to Settings > General > iPhone (or iPad) Storage > iOS (or iPadOS).\n\nSee how much space Apple Intelligence is using in Settings. Screenshots by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nNote that even after turning off Apple Intelligence, that storage still shows up in the iOS Storage list. However, I was able to confirm that if the phone's storage fills up and the system needs that now-inactive space, iOS reclaims what it needs.\n\nOnce I filled my iPhone's storage, the inactive Apple Intelligence data was purged to accommodate the added files, dropping from 5.89GB to 2.87GB. Screenshots by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nHow to turn off Apple Intelligence entirely (iPhone, iPad and Mac)\n\nOpen Settings (iPhone or iPad) or System Settings (Mac) and choose Apple Intelligence & Siri. Then turn off the Apple Intelligence option. Confirm your choice in the dialog that appears by tapping Turn Off Apple Intelligence.\n\nTurn off Apple Intelligence entirely with one switch. Screenshots by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nHere's what you lose:\n\n(Curiously, the Clean Up tool in Photos sticks around even when Apple Intelligence is turned off, perhaps because the first time you use it the app downloads resources for it and holds onto them.)\n\nHow to turn off individual Apple Intelligence features\n\nMaybe you're finding some Apple Intelligence features helpful while others are annoying (or just highly amusing). You can turn off specific features in the settings for apps to which they apply.\n\nFor example, to disable text summaries in Messages notifications, go to Settings > Apps > Messages and switch off the Summarize Messages option.\n\nTurn off Messages summaries while still using other Apple Intelligence features. Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nSome features are not as app-specific. Writing Tools, which use Apple Intelligence to proof or rewrite text, appear as an option when you select text, regardless of the app. To turn that off, you need to disable Apple Intelligence system-wide.\n\nAlso note that nearly every app includes an Apple Intelligence & Siri option in Settings, with a Learn from this App option (turned on by default). That applies just to whether Apple Intelligence and Siri can monitor how you use it to make suggestions; it doesn't affect any particular Apple Intelligence features.\n\nHow to turn off Apple Intelligence features in Screen Time settings\n\nAnother option for restricting what Apple Intelligence can do is buried in the Screen Time settings. Screen Time is designed to control which apps and features can run on another device, such as the iPhone used by a child in your household. But it's also helpful for tracking how much time you're spending on the device and, in this case, turning off some components of Apple Intelligence.\n\nOpen the Settings app and go to Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions. Turn on the Content & Privacy Restrictions option if it's not already enabled. If this is the first time you're flipping this switch, don't worry -- everything is allowed by default. Tap Intelligence & Siri. Tap on the following three features and decide whether to allow or don't allow their use: Image Creation (such as Image Playground and Genmoji), Writing Tools and the ChatGPT Extension (which uses ChatGPT to process requests that are beyond the built-in Apple Intelligence capabilities).\n\nTurn off selected Apple Intelligence features in the Screen Time settings. Screenshots by Jeff Carlson/CNET\n\nFor more on iOS 18.3, see how the Mail app sorts messages into categories and if you haven't upgraded already, make a good backup first.",

When exploited, the vulnerability would allow an attacker to disable USB Restricted Mode on a locked device. The attack would require physical access to your device\n\nThe introduction of USB Restricted Mode feature came with iOS 11.4.1 in July 2018. The feature was designed to make it more difficult for attackers to unlock your iPhone. When USB Restricted Mode is active, your device\u2019s Lightning port (where you plug in the charging cable) will only allow charging after the device has been locked for more than an hour. This means that if someone tries to connect your locked iPhone to a computer or other device to access its data, they won\u2019t be able to do so unless they have your passcode.\n\nTo enhance data security, especially when traveling or in public places, it is recommended that you enable USB Restricted Mode in your device settings. If your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch is running iOS 11.4.1 or later, USB Restricted Mode is automatically on by default, but if you want to check and enable USB Restricted Mode, this can be done by going to Settings > Face ID & Passcode or Touch ID & Passcode > (USB) Accessories and toggling off (grey) the (USB) Accessories option. Enabling this setting adds an extra layer of protection against unauthorized data access.\n\nAccessories are safe now\n\nPlease note: toggling the option to green turns this feature off.\n\nVulnerabilities like these typically target specific individuals as deployed by commercial spyware vendors like Pegasus and Paragon. This means the average user does not need to fear attacks as long as the details are not published. But once they are, other cybercriminals will try to copy them.\n\nWe don\u2019t just report on phone security\u2014we provide it\n\nCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

This comes a mere day after Google made the same change to its own Maps app.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico within hours of his inauguration last month, proclaiming that it would henceforth be known as the Gulf of America. Yet while this changed the U.S. government's official position on the sea's name, Trump's order technically had no direct impact on corporations such as Google and Apple. The gulf is also not owned by any one country, being boarded by the U.S., Mexico, and Cuba. As such, the U.S. does not have the authority to completely unilaterally rename the entire body of water for everyone internationally.\n\nSEE ALSO: Google Maps has changed the Gulf of Mexico to America\n\nNevertheless, Google Maps made clear that it would adhere to Trump's renaming of the gulf, stating that it was following its \"longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.\" It made good on that promise earlier this week, with Google Maps adding the Gulf of Mexico's new Trump-mandated label in parenthesis when viewed from outside the U.S., and completely renaming it to the Gulf of America for those within it.\n\nIn contrast, Apple was more reticent on directly addressing the matter, having issued no statement on what it planned to do. Now it appears that Apple's approach to the gulf renaming issue is similar to Google's, renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America after U.S. Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) was officially updated.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

Bloomberg reports Apple has stated that while it's starting with the U.S., it will soon roll out the name change for all users globally. It isn't clear whether that will mean a complete relabelling of the gulf, or simply adding \"Gulf of America\" in parenthesis as Google has.\n\nMashable has reached out to Apple for comment.\n\nApple Maps' browser beta in Australia, showing the Gulf of Mexico labelled as such on both the map and sidebar. Credit: Mashable screenshot: Apple\n\nThis isn't the first time Apple has amended its map to appease a country's government. The tech giant previously caused outrage in Ukraine when it marked Crimea as Russian territory in 2019, albeit only for people who accessed Apple's Maps and Weather apps from within Russia. At the time, Russia's parliament stated that \"Apple [had] fulfilled its obligations and brought the applications on its devices in compliance with the requirements of the Russian legislation.\"\n\nTrump's executive order may not impose a legal requirement that Apple alter how it labels the Gulf of Mexico/America. Even so, following the new U.S. administration's official stance is more likely to help endear Apple to Trump. And with so many big tech companies and CEOs now fighting to gain the president's favour, Apple probably doesn't want to be left behind.",

Introduced in iOS 11.4.1, USB Restricted Mode prevents an Apple iOS and iPadOS device from communicating with a connected accessory if it has not been unlocked and connected to an accessory within the past hour.\n\nThe feature is seen as an attempt to prevent digital forensics tools like Cellebrite or GrayKey, which are mainly used by law enforcement agencies, from gaining unauthorized entry to a confiscated device and extracting sensitive data.\n\nIn line with advisories of this kind, no other details about the security flaw are currently available. The iPhone maker said the vulnerability was addressed with improved state management.\n\nHowever, Apple acknowledged that it's \"aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.\"\n\nSecurity researcher Bill Marczak of The Citizen Lab at The University of Toronto's Munk School has been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw.\n\nThe update is available for the following devices and operating systems -\n\niOS 18.3.1 and iPadOS 18.3.1 - iPhone XS and later, iPad Pro 13-inch, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 7th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later\n\n- iPhone XS and later, iPad Pro 13-inch, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 7th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later iPadOS 17.7.5 - iPad Pro 12.9-inch 2nd generation, iPad Pro 10.5-inch, and iPad 6th generation\n\nThe development comes weeks after Cupertino resolved another security flaw, a use-after-free bug in the Core Media component (CVE-2025-24085), that it revealed as having been exploited against versions of iOS before iOS 17.2.\n\nZero-days in Apple software have been primarily weaponized by commercial surveillanceware vendors to deploy sophisticated programs that can extract data from victim devices.\n\nWhile these tools, such as NSO Group's Pegasus, are marketed as \"technology that saves lives\" and to combat serious criminal activity as a way to get around the so-called \"Going Dark\" problem, they have also been misused to spy on members of the civil society.\n\nNSO Group, for its part, has reiterated that Pegasus is not a mass surveillance tool and that it's licensed to \"legitimate, vetted intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\"\n\nIn its transparency report for 2024, the Israeli company said it serves 54 customers in 31 countries, of which 23 are intelligence agencies and another 23 are law enforcement agencies.\n\nUpdate\n\nIn a new analysis published on February 14, 2025, Quarkslab said that accessibility-related features like Assistive Touch and Switch Control are designed to run the assistivetouchd daemon that contains code to disable USB Restricted Mode when connecting an MFi (Made for iPhone certified) device.\n\nThe French cybersecurity company theorized that an assistive technology tool plugged to an iPhone with Switch Control enabled may have caused a popup to appear that can disable USB restricted mode from the lock screen before iOS 18.3.1.",

Her strong connection to her audience came via a blog in which she told her followers about how, through clean eating, she had recovered from a cancer diagnosis that had given her \u201csix weeks to live, four months tops.\u201d Except, it was all a lie that Belle Gibson (a real person, btw) resolutely defended even after her beloved online community, investigative media and the courts turned against her.\n\nSame old, same old, right? It\u2019s fake heiress Anna Sorokin crossed with Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy victim Gypsy Rose Blanchard, sprinkled with a little Instagram writer Caroline Calloway pixie dust, due to lead actor Dever\u2019s tiny blond prettiness and the online startup culture backdrop. So why watch? Because the show\u2019s compelling mix of poppy style, powerful acting and underlying social commentary combine to make this show a slow-moving car crash of mentally and physically ill people trying to get better through desperate means. You can\u2019t stop cringing, but you can\u2019t look away.\n\nEach episode starts with a principal actor breaking the fourth wall and announcing that this story plays fast and loose with Belle Gibson\u2019s real story\u2014and that Gibson received no proceeds from the filmed drama. A jumbled timeline, bright online graphics and the sunny Australian setting, as well as an attractive cast, make this a fitting cancer drama for the Pinterest age. Belle\u2019s story is contrasted with two real cancer sufferers, a fan and another wellness blogger with arm lesions, both of whom adhere to the \u201cWestern medicine is run by pharma giants and male doctors who are immune to our concerns and only want to make money and boss us around\u201d online wellness chatter that\u2019s become increasingly popular and legitimized by powerful vaccine skeptics.",

But when iOS 18.1 came out back in October, it gave a few Apple Intelligence features to people outside the EU and China who have an iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, as well as any devices in the iPhone 16 lineup, and it also landed features like call recording on all iPhones.\n\nCNET\n\nRead more: Your iOS 18 Cheat Sheet\n\nHere are some iOS 18.1 features to look for on your iPhone.\n\nCall recording comes to your iPhone\n\nCall that number for a holiday surprise. Apple/Screenshot by CNET\n\nWith iOS 18.1, your iPhone can now record phone calls. Once you're on a call, you should see a symbol in the top left corner of your screen that looks like a sound bar. Tap this and you'll start recording your phone call. Once you do start recording a call, an automated voice will announce to you and the person on the other line that the call is being recorded after a 3-second delay. This feature works regardless of whether you're talking to another iPhone user or an Android user.\n\nAfter your call is finished or you stop recording, your iPhone will save the recording to your Notes app. You can then play the call back in Notes. Newer iPhones, like the iPhone 14 Pro, can also see transcripts of the call in Notes, but older iPhones, like the iPhone XR, can't.\n\nBefore you use this feature, please check with local law enforcement about the legality of call recording in your area, just in case.\n\nApple Intelligence features\n\nThe latest iOS update introduces a handful of Apple Intelligence features to some iPhones, like writing tools for messages, the Clean Up photo tool and an upgraded Siri. That means you can have your iPhone proofread and revise emails before you send them, remove distracting items from photos and more.\n\nBefore you use these features though, you have to join the Apple Intelligence waiting list. To do that, go to Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri > Join the Apple Intelligence Waitlist and tap Join Waitlist. Once you're approved, you'll get access to the above Apple Intelligence features.\n\nOn the left is my original message and on the right is the message rewritten with Apple Intelligence. I like my original better, but that's just me. Apple/Screenshot by CNET\n\nBut these aren't all the Apple Intelligence features coming to your iPhone. For example, Apple's AI-powered emoji generator Genmoji isn't included in this iOS update, so it'll be included in a future update.\n\nThese features are only available to people outside the EU and China and who have an iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, as well as the iPhone 16 lineup. If you have the base model iPhone 15 or below you won't be able to access these features at this time.\n\nUpdated RCS messaging support\n\nWhen Apple released iOS 18, it brought RCS messaging support to iPhones. With iOS 18.1, it expands this functionality to include Messages for Business. Before this update, Messages for Business was only available through iMessage, so this could make it easier for more businesses to communicate with iPhones.\n\nControl Center adjustments\n\nOne of the big changes iOS 18 brought to iPhones was a revamped Control Center, and Apple made a few adjustments to these changes in iOS 18.1.\n\nWith iOS 18.1, if you go into your Control Center and tap the Connectivity tile -- where you can find your Wi-Fi, Airplane Mode and similar settings -- you'll see a few controls are now tile-shaped rather than row-shaped. This is a small change, but it could be helpful by giving you easier control over your connectivity settings.\n\nApple/Screenshot by CNET\n\nYou can also add independent controls for Wi-Fi, VPN, AirDrop and Satellite to Control Center. Before, these controls would be present in the Connectivity tile, or on the Connectivity page in Control Center, but you couldn't add them as their own control. Apple previously let you add an independent Bluetooth control to Control Center.\n\nThere are also new Level and Measure controls you can add to your Control Center. Both Level and Measure can be helpful for renovations if you don't have a tape measure or bubble level on hand.\n\nIf you don't like how your Control Center is set up any longer, Apple added a way to reset your Control Center back to the default layout. Go to Settings > Control Center and tap Reset Control Center.\n\nChange primary Apple ID email address\n\nWith iOS 18.1, Apple now lets you change or add a new primary email address for your Apple ID. To do either, go into Settings > Apple ID > Sign-In & Security. From here you can tap the option to Add Email or Phone Number or you can tap an existing address and tap the toggle next to Primary Email. Once your primary email address is set, Apple will send messages to that address.\n\nTinted home screen widgets\n\nApple also adjusted the iOS 18 feature that lets you tint your home screen apps in iOS 18.1. Now, if you add a tint to your apps, it will also be applied to widgets on your home screen, like Clock, Battery and Calendar. Before this update, widgets wouldn't be affected by tint, only apps.\n\nApple/Screenshot by CNET\n\nSleep apnea detection\n\nApple announced in September that Apple WatchOS 11 would bring sleep apnea detection to compatible Apple Watches. The feature was then approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. And according to MacRumors, iOS 18.1 enables the feature on compatible Apple Watch models paired with an iPhone running the software.\n\nExpanded emoji keyboard\n\nAnother change in iOS 18.1 is the expansion of the emoji keyboard. Now if you go into your emoji keyboard and you swipe left, instead of seeing the section for Frequently Used stickers, you'll see a section for your custom stickers. If you swipe left again, you'll be in a new menu that gives you full access to your Memoji, allowing you to easily use them in place of other emoji.\n\nThe emoji in the emoji keyboard are also slightly larger than in iOS 18. It's not an earth-shattering change, but it's there.\n\nDrag and drop with iPhone mirroring\n\nAccording to MacRumors, if you have an iPhone running iOS 18.1 and a MacBook running MacOS Sequoia 15.1, you can now easily drag and drop files from one device to the other while mirroring your iPhone screen. This could make sharing files between your devices even more seamless than before.\n\nHere are Apple's full release notes for iOS 18.1:\n\nApple Intelligence (All iPhone 16 models, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max). Writing Tools Writing Tools are available nearly everywhere you type, allowing you to rewrite, proofread and summarize text right in the app you're working in.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffRewrite suggests different versions of your text so you can choose which combination of flow and wording you like best.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffProofread lets you view suggested improvements to what you're writing, like grammar fixes and language refinements.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffSummarize allows you to select text wherever you're writing and generate a high-quality summary.\n\nSiri A new look and feel includes a glowing light that wraps around the edge of your screen, animates responsively to the sound of your voice and lets you keep scrolling or typing while you talk to Siri.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffType to Siri when you don't want to speak a request out loud by double tapping at the bottom of the screen.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffRicher language understanding enables Siri to follow along if you stumble over your words or change your mind mid-sentence.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffConversational context is maintained over the course of a session, so you can refer more naturally to something you said in a recent request or something Siri mentioned in a recent response.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffProduct knowledge helps you get answers to thousands of questions about the features and settings on your Apple products.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffVoice enhancements make Siri sound more natural, expressive and clear. Photos Photos search lets you find photos and videos simply by describing what you're looking for.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffClean Up removes distractions in your photos.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffMemory movies can be created by describing the story you want to see. Notifications Notification summaries make it easy to catch up on your notifications with a glanceable summary of the most important information.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffReduce Interruptions is a new Focus that ensures the most urgent notifications get through to you while silencing potential distractions.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffSmart Reply in Mail and Messages helps you quickly respond to messages with suggested responses.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffPriority messages in Mail understands the content of your messages and prioritizes those that require your attention, displaying them at the top of your inbox.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffTranscription summaries in Notes give you an intelligently created summary of the transcript from your audio recording or call recording. Phone Call recordings and transcriptions let you record live calls and transcribe them in the Notes app, with an automatic announcement that the call is being recorded. Camera Camera Control can quickly switch to the front TrueDepth Camera (iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max).\n\nSpatial photo capture, along with spatial video capture, is available in a new Spatial camera mode (iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max). Airpods Hearing Test feature provides scientifically-validated hearing test results from the comfort of home (intended for users 18 years or older).\n\n\ufeff\ufeffHearing Aid feature provides personalized, clinical-grade assistance that is automatically applied to sounds in your environment as well as music, videos and calls (intended for users 18 years or older with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss).\n\n\ufeff\ufeffHearing Protection feature helps users minimize exposure to loud environmental noise across listening modes (available in the United States and Canada).\n\n\ufeff\ufeffFeatures require AirPods Pro 2 with firmware version 7B19 or later.\n\nAll features may not be available for all countries or regions, for more information visit: https://apple.com/airpods-pro/feature-availability/. This update also includes the following improvements and bug fixes: \ufeff\ufeffControl Center has new options to add connectivity controls individually and reset your configuration.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffRCS Business Messaging lets you connect with businesses over RCS (requires carrier support).\n\n\ufeff\ufeffApp Store search lets you use natural language to find what you're looking for more easily.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffGame Center friend invites can be sent directly from the Contacts app and Friend Suggestions, and receivers can see the invites in the inbox in Settings.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffFixes an issue in Podcasts where unplayed episodes are marked as played.\n\n\ufeff\ufeffFixes an issue where videos recorded at 4K 60 while the device is warm could experience stutter while scrubbing the video playback in Photos.\n\nFixes an issue where digital car keys may not unlock or start a vehicle with passive entry after restoring from a backup or transferring directly from another iPhone.\n\nFixes an issue where iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Pro models may unexpectedly restart. Some features may not be available for all regions or on all Apple devices.

Apple is also taking a 20% equity stake in the new connectivity constellation.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple is funding most of the costs to replenish Globalstar\u2019s existing L-band LEO network, which has supported emergency SOS services for iPhones when terrestrial networks are unavailable since 2022.\n\nMDA has a $327 million contract to provide 17 satellites for Globalstar\u2019s constellation refresh, with options for up to nine additional satellites at $11.4 million each. Rocket Lab is supplying the buses for these satellites, with deployments slated to begin before the end of the year.\n\nLaunches for Telesat\u2019s constellation of 198 750-kilogram satellites are scheduled to begin in mid-2026.\n\nMDA CEO Mike Greenley told SpaceNews the company is currently working on the design stage of Globalstar\u2019s Aurora program, with satellite production expected in 2026.\n\nGlobalstar\u2019s Aurora satellites would be built alongside Lightspeed at a high-volume manufacturing facility MDA began constructing in September in Quebec, Canada.\n\n\u201cWe are scaling up our capacity with the expansion of the Montreal facility,\u201d Greenley said via email.\n\n\u201cOnce that facility is operational, we expect to produce up to two satellites per day which translates to approximately 400 satellites per year, so we have capacity for more orders.\u201d\n\nThe companies have not revealed what enhancements Globalstar\u2019s Aurora satellites might introduce for iPhones.\n\nGlobalstar\u2019s current constellation of 31 satellites enables basic texting for iPhones beyond the reach of cell towers, but lacks the capacity for bandwidth-intensive services such as voice and broadband.\n\nApple recently enabled iPhones with a T-Mobile cellular plan to join beta tests for SpaceX\u2019s rival Starlink service in the United States. The move rattled investors, sending shares of Globalstar and other direct-to-smartphone connectivity providers lower.\n\nT-Mobile announced Feb. 9 that AT&T and Verizon subscribers can access the beta tests for free until the service launches in July, when it will cost non-T-Mobile customers $20 a month per line.\n\nStarlink\u2019s beta service is also currently limited to SOS and basic texting, with expanded capabilities dependent on constellation growth and regulatory approval for increased satellite power.\n\nGreenley discussed the burgeoning constellation market and MDA\u2019s plans for it in an episode of Commercial Space Transformers in November.",

Last year, Apple released another security feature that reboots devices if they are not unlocked for 72 hours, making it harder for law enforcement or criminals using forensic tools to access data on those devices.\n\nBased on its language used in its security update, Apple hints that the attacks were most likely carried out with physical control of a person\u2019s device, meaning whoever was abusing this flaw had to connect to the person\u2019s Apple devices with a forensics device like Cellebrite or Graykey, two systems that allow law enforcement to unlock and access data stored on iPhones and other devices.\n\nThe vulnerability was discovered by Bill Marczak, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, a University of Toronto group that investigates cyberattacks against civil society.\n\nContact Us Do you have more information about this flaw, or other iPhone zero-days and cyberattacks?

But there have been documented cases in the past where law enforcement agencies have used forensic tools, which usually abuse zero-day flaws in devices like the iPhone, to unlock the devices and access the data inside.\n\nIn December 2024, Amnesty International released a report documenting a series of attacks by Serbian authorities where they used Cellebrite to unlock the phones of activists and journalists in the country, and then install malware on them.\n\nSecurity researchers said that the Cellebrite forensic devices were likely used \u201cwidely\u201d on individuals in civil society, according to Amnesty.",

Details below in the original post.\n\nA couple weeks ago we saw $100 price drops finally make a return across Apple\u2019s latest iPad mini 7 lineup, and those deals are back again today. This is on par with the best prices we have tracked on the new A17 Pro-equipped miniature iPad lineup and today Amazon is giving folks another chance to score one at the lowest we have tracked since release back in October. Pricing kicks off at $399 shipped with $100 discounts across all storage capacities as well as the Wi-Fi + Cell models.\n\nAmazon is now offering the 128GB model at $399, the 256GB at $499, and the 512GB configuration at $699, down from the regular $499, $599, and $799 sticker prices, respectively.\n\nWhile I have made the argument in the past that, for some, the more affordable M2 iPad Air models are a more powerful iPad solution that, when on sale, get very closer in price to the MSRPs on the iPad mini 7. But pricing has jumped back up on most of the M2 Air configurations at this point, and the mini A17 Pro is now $100 under the previous sale prices.\n\nThat said, the mini is well, mini. Some folks love the more compact form-factor and would just prefer the more manageable, casual Apple tablet experience anyway.\n\nThis time around, the 7th generation minis features a 30% CPU boost and a 25% bump in graphics performance alongside the Apple Intelligence compatibility the A17 Pro chip provides. They also saw a nice little boost in RAM \u2013 they now start at 128GB instead of 64GB, and remain at relatively affordable prices tags, especially with deals like today\u2019s.\n\nDive into our roundup of our favorite iPad mini 7 cases and sleeves from $8.50 and then check out this iPad mini 7 vs 6 comparison feature piece for a closer look at what\u2019s new on the latest mini.\n\niPad mini 7 features:\n\niPad mini. Built for Apple Intelligence. It\u2019s incredibly portable and powerful, featuring the ultrafast A17 Pro chip, an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, plus superfast Wi-Fi 6E. And it works with Apple Pencil Pro, so you can study, work, play, and create from anywhere.

Lynch has been instrumental on a number of Apple initiatives, from the ill-fated \"Apple Car\" project to imbuing the Apple Watch with various health-tracking technology.\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg \"Power On \" newsletter on Sunday, the team is still seeking to hire more engineers with a robotics specialty, suggesting that development is intensifying on various home robotics initiatives. A new position for an iOS Robotics Engineer was posted as recently as January 23.\n\nOne idea allegedly being pursued includes home-based hardware that can move to where the user is, rather than the other way around. The group is said to be currently working on at least two robotics projects: a mobile device that could intelligently follow a user around, and a tabletop \"smart lamp\" that, at least at this stage, resembles Pixar's mascot Luxo Junior.\n\nApple is also rumored to be producing a \"smart home hub\" device for controlling various home systems, ranging from security to environmental control. A range of such devices and accessories might arrive as soon as later this year, according to rumors.\n\nOn a basic level, robotics in the home has already met with consumer acceptance. Intelligent environmental and security systems are now a common feature, while robot vacuums have also found an audience.\n\nApple's intention is to take existing smart-home technology to a further and more personable level.\n\nExpanding on household robots\n\nIn a promotional video from the robotics team, the smart lamp demonstrates not just responses to user gestures, but a general expressive demeanor that gives it more personal interactions than a typical robotic device. The video is intended as a proof of concept rather than a look at an actual future product.\n\nIn a segment of the video comparing an \"expressive\" robot lamp versus a \"functional\" robot lamp, a user gestures to indicate where the lamp should focus, and also uses vocal commands to aim it in different areas. The device responds to user gestures and vocal requests, demonstrating attentiveness.\n\nThe video also shows that the robotic lamp can answer questions using a Siri-like voice, and can notice where the user's hands are to focus light on what they are doing or holding. In response to a request, the lamp in the video also projects a tutorial video to assist the user in a project.\n\nThe video also makes clear that Apple's robotics team is exploring how a level of \"active engagement\" with the user enhances the experience of using the product. Earlier reports have suggested that a final product might resemble a HomePod with a robotic arm that has an iPad-like screen on the end.",

            "content": "It was reported last week that Apple is planning to launch the iPhone SE 4 next week, possibly alongside the new M4 MacBook Air and iPad Air lineup. There is now an update to the story from the same source claiming that the iPhone SE 4 could launch as soon as this week, with a new design and a higher price tag than the SE 3, albeit still below the $500 mark.\n\nApple to launch iPhone SE 4 \"this week\" with a new design and a price tag that will still put the competition to shame\n\nIn his latest Power On newsletter, prominent industry analyst Mark Gurman claims the iPhone SE 4 will launch \"this week.\" The analyst previously claimed that the iPhone SE 4 will launch next week. The latest report confirms the prior news and sticks to the launch time frame. Based on his words, Gurman is sure of the launch, and if the news has any haft to it, we might see a completely redesigned iPhone SE 4 as soon as this week, potentially in the middle of the week.\n\nApple has not sent out any event invites so far, which means that there is a possibility that the iPhone SE 4 will be announced via press release. Apple had previously launched the M4 MacBook Pro models via a press release, as the devices only come with internal upgrades, while the design of the devices remained the same. However, it would make sense for Apple to host a dedicated event for the iPhone SE 4 as it will come with a completely redesigned chassis. However, it is a familiar iPhone 16-like design, which could be why the company is opting for a press release rather than a dedicated event.\n\nThe iPhone SE 4 is expected to feature a design similar to that of the iPhone 14 or iPhone 16, depending on Apple's decision to either go with a small notch or the Dynamic Island. While the design and form factor are pretty familiar, it is worth noting that the internals would be on par with the latest iPhone 16 models. We have previously reported that the SE 4 could house the company's custom A18 chip, which is necessary for the company's Apple Intelligence features, coupled with 8GB of RAM. The device will also feature a 6.1-inch OLED display instead of an LCD, a USB-C port instead of Lightning, and an upgraded camera sensor at the back.\n\nGurman also shared that the iPhone SE 4 could be priced a little higher than the current SE 3. It makes sense for Apple to increase the price with the changes it is bringing to the lineup, but it has to keep it at bay if it wants the device to sell well. Currently, the price of the device starts at $429, but based on the latest information, the price could jump to as much as $499, which is still a great option considering the upgrades.\n\nIt remains to be seen when Apple will launch the new iPhone SE 4, but if Gurman's words are anything to go by, it will be here as soon as this week. We will be covering the details extensively, so be sure to stick around.",

I recently learned that this simple feature has more functionality than I realized, and instead of being excited, I\u2019m annoyed it\u2019s not implemented differently.\n\nDo you use your Apple Watch to ping your iPhone? 213 votes Yes, I use the ping 64 % Yes, I use the ping and flash 9 % No, I dont use this tool 27 %\n\nIf you don\u2019t own a newer Apple Watch, it might be hard to fathom how annoying my pinging habits are to others (and, frankly, to myself). I am the domestic version of a person in a parking lot repeatedly thumbing the panic button to find their car. Every time I use the ping, I am not only blaring a cringe-worthy tone from who knows where (literally, who knows where my phone is?), I am also audibly admitting that I am both forgetful and lazy. I could retrace my steps, but instead, I\u2019d rather play marco polo, and that\u2019s embarrassing.\n\nKaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority\n\nDespite going through this exercise more than daily, I only recently learned that if you hold the ping button, it will also strobe the flashlight on your paired iPhone. If you already know this, don\u2019t come after me; just pat yourself on the back. \u201cWhat a game changer,\u201d thought I. Finally, a way to find my phone without my partner hearing the tone that has become the calling card of my irresponsibility. Wrong. Apple failed to build in an option that silently sets off the mini rave lighting \u2014 you can only ping or ping and flash, but not just flash.\n\nI want Apple to add a silent option that strobes my phone's flashlight but doesn't initiate an obnoxious ring.\n\nI find this oversight especially annoying in the evening hours. The amount of time I spend as the only conscious member of my household is staggering. If I were a caped crusader fighting crime, it\u2019d be one thing, but I\u2019m typically fighting insomnia, not crime, and my activity never includes changing out of my slippers. Whether I\u2019m feeding a child, using the bathroom, or sneaking to the pantry, I usually have my phone in tow for lighting and entertainment.\n\nKaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority\n\nUnfortunately, I often carry my phone to alt locations and then forget it for the return trip. I crawl back into bed, and just as I settle in, I realize what I\u2019ve done and wonder where my much-needed alarm is now going to go off. In the kitchen, where I was just inhaling trail mix like a rabid trash panda? On the glider where I just watched 20 minutes worth of TikTok?\n\nAt 2:00 AM, when your child has finally, finally fallen back asleep after a night feed, the last thing you want to do is send a ping into the void. The option to initiate a flashing light sans alert tone would let me search for my phone in silence, hiding my shame and saving my family\u2019s Zs.\n\nThe only workaround I\u2019ve found so far is to use the Apple Watch\u2019s camera control options. If the lighting is right I can use the photo preview on my watch to figure out where my phone is lodged. This basically includes playing \u201cI Spy\u201d and determining the angle of the camera based on the photo. If it\u2019s too dark, I take a photo with the flash enabled and, as they say, follow the light. I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed this method\u2019s byproduct: a collection of very artistic photos of my ceiling, floor, and couch cushions. Obviously, the best solution would be to keep track of my phone, but I\u2019ve long resigned myself to losing that battle.\n\nYou might like",

            "content": "Apple\n\nIt was a little more than two years ago when Apple refreshed its entry-level, low-cost iPhone model, ideal for people who didn't need all of the bells and whistles but still wanted to be part of the Apple ecosystem -- the iPhone SE. After a two-year hiatus, the next big refresh has arrived.\n\nAlso: What does the 'e' in iPhone 16e stand for?\n\nOn Wednesday, Apple launched the iPhone 16e via an online press release rather than the usual product event. The iPhone 16e received several massive upgrades from its predecessor, including a refreshed design, support for Apple Intelligence, an A18 chipset, Face ID, an Apple modem, and more. Here's everything you need to know about the phone.\n\nApple\n\nThe upgrades\n\nCompared to the last iPhone SE, released in 2022, the new model features a more modernized, iPhone 14-esque design. It has a USB-C port at the bottom, Face ID (goodbye, Home Button), and a simple notch, which some people may prefer over the Dynamic Island.\n\nThe smartphone still has its small-device appeal, though not as small as its predecessor, fitting comfortably in the palm of your hand. By the numbers, we're looking at a 6.1-inch OLED display now, compared to the previous 4.7-inch screen. The glass exterior and aluminum frame come in two matte finishes: black and white.\n\nAlso: Best iPhones 2025: Which iPhone model should you buy?\n\nThe base storage capacity also received a boost, doubling from 64GB to 128GB, with added 256GB and 512GB options. Thanks to the improved power efficiency and larger battery capacity, new users should also experience improved battery performance (though Apple won't specify the exact value). For reference, the previous iPhone SE (2022) had a 1,624mAh battery, according to after-market tests.\n\nApple\n\nThe iPhone 16e features a 48MP wide camera on the back with an integrated 2x Telephoto, an upgrade from the previous model, and a 12MP front-facing camera. Therefore, despite the rest of the phone upgrades, the iPhone 16e may still not be for you if you are a photo enthusiast.\n\nArguably the biggest iPhone 16e upgrade is the inclusion of an A18 chipset. While it doesn't have as many GPU cores as other A18 variants found in the rest of the iPhone 16 lineup, it still gives the phone some notable capabiltiies. This upgrade, for example, was necessary to power Apple's suite of Apple Intelligence (AI) features, including Genmoji, Writing Tools, Notification summaries, Image Playground, and more.\n\nAlso: I revisited the iPhone SE in 2025 - and the 16e may be an even bigger hit\n\nFor something more subtle, the iPhone 16e also features Apple's first in-house 5G modem, the Apple C1, a step away from the traditional Qualcomm processor. By using its own wireless chip, Apple should be able to cut costs and, in turn, make the iPhone 16e more affordable for users. Having full control over the chip's integration with 5G networks could also lead to a more optimized cellular experience.\n\nSince this newer technology is still in development, it may not yet match Qualcomm's capabilities. Given the chip's nascency, we can likely expect upcoming, entry-level products like the iPads to adopt Apple's modem before the company incorporates it into flagship devices.\n\nAvailability\n\nThis year's hardware and software upgrades make the iPhone 16e a very competitive option for smartphone shoppers. While the iPhone 16e retails for more than its predecessor, it's still hundreds of dollars cheaper than the base iPhone 16 model, which starts at $799. You can pre-order the phone starting Friday, Feb. 21, and deliveries will begin a week after, on Feb. 28.\n\nAlso: The best Apple deals of February 2025: iPhones, Apple Watches, iPads, and more\n\nNotably, this price point places the iPhone 16e a little higher than competing entry-level phones from Google and Samsung, with the Google Pixel 8a and Samsung Galaxy A35 5G costing $499 and $399, respectively. By reintroducing a lower-cost option, Apple is positioning itself to reach a more generalized demographic of customers that its latest release may have missed.\n\nThe question now is whether or not the iPhone 16e will be just as successful as the last model, when the market is much more competitive this time around.",

            "content": "Apple has released a new app called Invites that is designed to make it easy to create custom invitations for events using an iPhone or on the web. Invites is Apple\u2019s version of Partiful, a popular invitation app that was crowned Google Play\u2019s Best App of 2024.\n\nInvites lets you create and share invitations, RSVP to events, contribute to Shared Albums, and curate event soundtracks.\n\nTo create an invitation, you need an iCloud+ subscription, which costs 99 cents per month. However, anyone can RSVP, regardless of whether they have an Apple Account or Apple device.\n\nIn this post, we\u2019ll walk you through the process of creating an event, adding a shared album or playlist, and sending out your invitation to guests.\n\nHow to create an event invite\n\nImage Credits:Apple\n\nYou can create an event in Apple Invites using the app on your iPhone or on the web at iCloud.com. Whichever route you choose, the process is essentially the same.\n\nIf you\u2019re on the app, you need to tap the plus sign in the upper-right corner to create an event. If you\u2019re on the web, you need to select \u201cNew Event\u201d in the upper-right corner.\n\nFrom here, tap the \u201cAdd Background\u201d option, then choose \u201cPhotos\u201d to select an image from your library. Or, tap the \u201cCamera\u201d option to take a new photo for the background. Apple also offers a selection of backgrounds for you to choose from.\n\nAlternatively, you can use Apple\u2019s Image Playground to produce original images for the background. To use the Image Playground integration in Invites, you will need an iPhone that is compatible with Apple Intelligence, which means you need an iPhone 15 Pro and up.\n\nOnce you have added a background image, tap \u201cEvent Title\u201d to enter the name of your event and then choose a font style.\n\nThen, tap \u201cDate and Time\u201d to choose the day and time the event starts and ends. You can also choose to set it as an all-day event. After you set a date, the weather forecast for that date will be added to the invitation.\n\nNext, tap \u201cLocation\u201d to search for a location or tap a suggested location. You have the option to enter a name for a location, such as \u201cEmily\u2019s House.\u201d When you set a location, Invites will automatically add Apple Maps information to the invitation.\n\nFinally, you can enter a description for the event, using Apple Intelligence\u2019s Writing Tools to help you write out the description, if you\u2019d like. Again, your device will need to be compatible with Apple Intelligence in order to use the feature.\n\nOnce you have created your event, you can tap the \u201cPreview\u201d option to see what it looks before sending it to your guests.\n\nHow to create a Shared Album or Playlist for your event invite\n\nImage Credits:Apple\n\nWhile the above steps cover the basics of creating an invite for an event, Apple offers two other features that can take your invitations to the next level.\n\nYou can create a \u201cShared Album\u201d where attendees can contribute photos and videos from within an invite. The idea behind the feature is to give attendees a way to save their memories and relive the event at a later time.\n\nTo do so, you need to tap the \u201cCreate Album\u201d option. The name of the Shared Album will be the name of the event, but you can change it if you\u2019d like.\n\nYou can also create an event soundtrack by selecting the \u201cAdd Playlist\u201d option. Attendees can then choose to add songs to the playlist before or during the event. It\u2019s worth noting that you need an Apple Music subscription to create a shared playlist. As with Shared Albums, your playlist will have the name of your event, but you can edit it.\n\nHow to invite guests to your event\n\nImage Credits:Apple\n\nThere are two ways to invite guests to your event. You can either share the invite as a public link or send it to specific people from your contact list.\n\nYou need to select \u201cInvite Guests\u201d to start sending out invitations. If you select the \u201cMessages\u201d or \u201cMail\u201d apps, you can send a public link directly through those apps. If you select \u201cShare Link,\u201d you can send the invite to guests through any app in your iOS share sheet. If you tap \u201cCopy Link,\u201d you can paste the link for your invitation anywhere.\n\nTo invite a contact, tap the \u201cChoose a Guest\u201d option, search for a name, or choose someone from your list of contacts, and then share the link with them.\n\nAfter you have created an event and invited guests, you can share a note that everyone on the guest list can see. For instance, you can let guests know if you have changed the location for the event, or you can send them a reminder to bring umbrellas if the forecast is calling for rain.\n\nTo do so, select your event and then tap \u201cSend a Note.\u201d Once you have written out your note, tap the \u201cSend Note\u201d button.",

            "content": "I stayed up late one night watching Wim Wenders' 2011 documentary Pina on the Apple Vision Pro, and it was magical. This beautiful 3D film, about the German dance theater pioneer Pina Bausch, made me feel like I was sitting in the theater with the performers.\n\nA year after its release, moments of magic keep popping up with Apple's Vision Pro, but I have to look for them. And most of the magic occurs when watching movies, or when I turn the headset into a giant curved monitor for my Mac. The rest of the Vision Pro's potential remains unfulfilled.\n\nApple's $3,500 spatial computer is hardly an overnight success, but at that price it was never going to be. The Vision Pro remains a bleeding-edge tech showcase and the most advanced standalone VR/AR headset in existence. It provides a fascinating taste of the unbounded visual experiences of the future. And for certain professional zones \u2013 anyone interested in simulation, a display for looking at high-res 3D models, or a flexible iPadOS-based platform to build out some ideas \u2013 the Vision Pro can be a powerful tool.\n\nIn my life, however, it's mostly a movie screen and a super-fancy wearable monitor.\n\nI do so much more \"VR stuff,\" from games to video chat to exercise routines, on other headsets. There just aren't that many interesting Vision Pro apps, either from developers or from Apple itself. And that's just one of the problems that bugs me about Vision Pro, even after a whole year of using it pretty regularly at home.\n\nThere are absolutely areas where Apple has succeeded, and even paved the way for where headsets and glasses could go next. But not enough of them. Without addressing some other big missing pieces, the Vision Pro will never feel like it's leapt up to become a successor, or even a key extension, to my phone or my Mac. Here's my take on the successes and the missed opportunities for Vision Pro over the last year.\n\nMy first demos with Vision Pro were early signs that the interface was mostly a big success. Apple\n\nSuccess: Hardware-free gesture controls and eye-tracking\n\nThe eye and hand tracking quality on Vision Pro, and the ways they work together, really do make a lot of basic navigation pretty effortless. I've gotten spoiled by the simple ways I glance and slightly pinch or swipe my fingers to open apps or scroll windows. Having no controller for Vision Pro is mostly no problem at all, which in retrospect feels as bold a move as shipping the first iPhone without a keyboard.\n\nApple has added extra gestures and improved the shortcuts since the Vision Pro came out. I love tapping my fingers and tilting my hand to check the time and adjust volume. Yes, sometimes I have to recalibrate eye-tracking because it'll drift from where my eyes look. And tapping and grabbing some edges of windows or apps can still be fiddly. I'd prefer having more precision, with an optional wearable or accessory like the ring and pointer on Sony's pro-focused XR headset, but Apple has mostly proved its point.\n\nSuccess: The best personal display and movie experience\n\nAs a big TV on my face, Vision Pro remains unbeaten. It's not perfect by any means: The field of view is still narrower than I'd want, and I see some reflective glare at times with prescription lenses inserted, but the experience with Apple's audio and video in Vision Pro makes me feel like I've got the best movie-screening device I've ever tried. It's my preferred way to see any movie or show if I know I can view it alone. Wicked in 3D? Stunning. I keep being wowed by it.\n\nIn the curved-screen monitor format, paired with a Mac, I feel like I have my own little wraparound work world. I'm using it right now. When I set it up, it's as satisfying for work as my personal cinema outings. The headset's awkward size has gotten better with improved straps from companies like Belkin and ResMed, too.\n\nApple's unique place here won't last forever. Other devices are getting micro OLED displays too. Samsung's Project Moohan, the first Android XR headset coming this year, looks very much like a Samsung/Google Vision Pro, and the display quality during a brief demo impressed me. Sony's headset also has micro OLED displays. And there are display glasses, including the Xreal One, that feature vivid (but smaller 1080p) displays that are good enough for watching movies, at a far lower price.\n\nRunning regular everyday apps in XR is boring but important. Stephen Beacham, Viva Tung\n\nSuccess: A way to fold XR into everyday apps\n\nApple made the Vision Pro feel like an iPad for your face, which was a big shift from previous AR and VR headsets that built up custom app stores and interfaces. This focus can make the Vision Pro seem a little pedestrian because a lot of its apps are things like Mail or Notes or Apple Music. On the other hand, that seamless flow between things I already use is what makes the whole thing feel like a natural computer. It's boring as hell, but it's a useful and previously missing part of the VR experience.\n\nMeta, by comparison, is still struggling to find enough truly everyday work apps that can run usefully on the Quest. Meta has games galore, but none of Horizon OS is naturally Android or iOS compatible. Google's Android XR is coming this year with full support for Google Play onboard, and Vision Pro can run tons of iOS apps. Meta's caught in the middle.\n\nMy app life in Vision Pro hasn't changed much from my experiences a year ago. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nMissing: Where are all the good new apps?\n\nIt's been a whole year and I still find myself browsing what feels like a random scattering of games, immersive experiences, occasional productivity apps and Apple's every-once-in-a-while drop of new Vision Pro immersive-format 3D short films. The immersive videos are well-made, and some \u2013 like The Weeknd's jaw-dropping music video, or Edward Berger's Submerged \u2013 are some of the best I've seen. But it's not enough, and the video releases don't come frequently enough to justify getting a Vision Pro.\n\nThere are lots of apps you can browse through on the Vision Pro but that doesn't mean there are many meaningful ones. On Meta's Quest headset, I feel like I can always find a new game or two to catch my eye. The Vision Pro doesn't make it easy to know what's good, or what I should be using it for. And Apple doesn't seem to have invested much into drawing big stunning experiences in, either. Even the Vision Pro games on Apple Arcade are largely ports or casual, simpler stuff.\n\nAnd why hasn't Apple itself made some of these killer apps? There are still tons of obvious missing pieces. Maps \u2013 an app that already showcases detailed 3D landscapes and cities \u2013 would have been an amazing Vision Pro showcase. (Google is already showing off its Maps app for Android XR.) GarageBand could have been adapted with spatial musical instruments, something third-party developers have already dabbled in. Apple has no spatial creative apps of its own \u2013 no Vision Pro-ified Final Cut, or drawing/sketching/sculpting apps. If you don't dream them up, they won't exist -- and the Vision Pro needs new dreams.\n\nFitness is still a missing piece of Apple's vision, even though working out has become my favorite thing to do on Meta's Quests. If the Vision Pro could double as a virtual Peloton, then maybe that would help absorb its price. But it doesn't, not yet. And the current Vision Pro's heavier design and dangling battery pack make it a weird fitness fit, although the Apple Arcade game Synth Riders shows off what Apple could do with active gaming on a lighter, more affordable headset.\n\nMissing: Working with iPhones, Apple Watch, iPad\n\nA huge missing piece, for me, is something I thought Apple would have had on day one of Vision Pro: An ability to work with iPhones, Apple Watches and iPads as well as Macs. The Vision Pro is standalone, but it still works with Macs to act as an extended monitor and feel like a connected part of the computer you already use. It should work that way with the iPhone, literally a device everyone has in their pocket. As a handheld controller, a way to extend connected apps, take calls, use the iPhone to camera to 3D scan things that could instantly be synced to Vision Pro, to help remote-control demos for friends trying your Vision Pro. I don't understand why it's not already set up to work.\n\nSimilarly, the Apple Watch could be used for gestures, as an input shortcut, for haptics, or to collect and sync health data into some apps (like heart rate for meditation and active games). And the iPad should be able to work as a portable keyboard/touchscreen part of Vision Pro, extending displays the same way Macs do.\n\nThe Vision Pro ($3,500) next to Xreal One's display glasses ($500). Completely different products, but Xreal's glasses at least do a good job as wearable displays at a fraction of the size and cost. Meta's hardware is also well under $1,000. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nMissing: A price cut after a year\n\nThe most obvious miss is the Vision Pro's price. Sure, it's really an early-adopter, developer kit type of computer. And, for the pros that might need it \u2013 say, for medical simulations \u2013 $3,500 isn't much more than previous business-targeted XR headsets like the Hololens 2 (and it's less expensive than industrial headsets like Varjo's XR-4).\n\nBut that price will never appeal to any regular person I know. It's hard enough to convince someone to get a $500 Quest 3. To make the Vision Pro feel remotely appealing, it needs to get into the range of what an iPhone or iPad Pro costs. Otherwise, Apple needs to work even harder to justify what else this high-end thing could be used for.\n\nThe Vision Pro has wowed me, and it still continues to wow me. But not enough, especially at $3,500. It feels like a first stab at a greater idea, but there's no second stab in sight. Apple apparently canceled plans for smaller AR glasses, but it could still make a smaller, lighter and easier to use Vision non-Pro in the next few years as another step toward, perhaps, glasses.\n\nGetting Vision on more faces for less with the capability of doing more with what you already own is a difficult bridge to cross. But with Google's Android XR and Meta's headsets -- and possibly other competition from Valve and elsewhere -- it's what Apple still needs to overcome as it figures out how the Vision Pro something that's not just\u2026 well, for pros.",

Experts fear, though, that the brief reprieve could be short-lived and may not be easy for defenders to sustain.\n\nAnd there's more. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn\u2019t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Friday that Apple has received a secret order from the UK office of the Home Secretary mandating the company to provide a way to access any user data protected by the company\u2019s Advanced Data Protection for iCloud. The feature, which debuted at the end of 2022, is designed with end-to-end encryption so only users themselves, not Apple, have access to their data. As a result, complying with the UK demand would require Apple to break the feature by building a backdoor into it. Sources told the Post that rather than install a backdoor, Apple is likely to withdraw support for Advanced Data Protection for iCloud in the UK. \u201cYet that concession would not fulfill the UK demand for backdoor access to the service in other countries, including the United States,\u201d the Post noted.\n\nThe order was issued under the UK\u2019s broad 2016 Investigatory Powers Act. UK law enforcement agencies, not to mention cops in the US and other countries, have championed encryption backdoors for years, and lawmakers have tried at various times to mandate backdoors. The Home Office told the Post in a statement, \u201cWe do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\u201d An Apple spokesperson declined to comment to the Post.\n\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave President Donald Trump a golden pager when the two met in Washington on Tuesday. The gift references a September attack in Lebanon against the militant group Hezbollah in which booby-trapped pagers (and walkie-talkies) detonated in coordinated explosions around the country. The operation killed at least 42 people, including some civilians, and injured at least 4,000 civilians, according to Lebanese officials. The attack has been widely attributed to Israel, but the country has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. At the meeting Trump apparently gave Netanyahu a signed photograph of the two of them, which he signed, \u201cTo Bibi, a great leader!\u201d\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise has been notifying dozens of users that their personal information was stolen during a 2023 breach. The company is attributing the attack to Russian state-backed hackers. The stolen data included Social Security numbers, driver\u2019s license information, and credit card numbers. The incident began as a system intrusion in May 2023 into HPE\u2019s email mailboxes and Microsoft SharePoint systems. HPE publicly disclosed the incident in January 2024.\n\nThe edtech giant PowerSchool says that at least 16,000 students in the United Kingdom had their data stolen as part of a massive December data breach that may have affected 62 million students and 9.5 million teachers, most of them in the US and Canada. Attackers used compromised credentials to infiltrate the company\u2019s customer support portal and then access user data.\n\nPowerSchool spokesperson Beth Keebler confirmed to TechCrunch in a statement that students at four UK schools were affected totaling \u201capproximately 16,000 students.\u201d It is not clear if this is the total number of UK victims. The compromised data includes students\u2019 dates of birth, contact information, some medical data, and \u201cother related information.\u201d",

But you can choose to opt out of them if needed.\n\nIf you are an iPhone user, you have been hearing a lot about the AI-powered \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d tools.\n\nAvailable on iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, macOS Sequoia 15.1 or later versions, including the recently-released iOS 18.3, the latest updates include ChatGPT integration, the \u201cImage Playground\u201d that creates images from your text descriptions, notification summaries of messages, and \u201cVisual Intelligence\u201d that lets you learn about objects and places by pointing your iPhone\u2019s camera at them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if you\u2019re not a fan of Apple Intelligence features, you may be in the majority. In a recent survey of 1,000 people by tech trade-in site SellCell, 73% of Apple Intelligence users said they found the features to be either \u201cnot very valuable\u201d or \u201cadd little to no value\u201d to their smartphone experience. (Ouch.)\n\nUnfortunately for the haters, Apple Intelligence is a growing part of the iPhone experience \u2015 and quite literally in the case of storage.\n\nIn December, Apple updated its website to note that Apple Intelligence now requires at least 7 gigabytes of storage to maintain the features, as opposed to the 4 gigabytes of storage the tools originally required to work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd soon, Apple Intelligence will be a default setting. Right now, Apple Intelligence is not turned on automatically. But 9to5Mac reported that starting with iOS 18.3, which is set to be released in the coming days, Apple will automatically enable Apple Intelligence in iPhones, according to Apple\u2019s beta release notes.\n\nIn other words, you will have to actively choose to opt out once you do this new update.\n\nFor many, that storage is valuable. Most of us don\u2019t want to delete photos or take the time to go through the thousands of screenshots we\u2019ve taken over the years. Or perhaps we don\u2019t want to off-load some of our favorite apps in favor of making room for new images or texts.\n\nIf you have already been using Apple Intelligence, you can see for yourself how much storage it takes up on your iPhone. Go to \u201csettings,\u201d then \u201cgeneral.\u201d Select \u201ciPhone storage,\u201d and then select \u201ciOS.\u201d From there, you can see how many gigabytes Apple Intelligence is eating up on your device.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you are dismayed by the number you see, you still have a way to opt out and free up your storage if you have an older iPhone where every gigabyte counts.\n\nTo turn off Apple Intelligence on your iOS devices:\n\n1. Go to \u201csettings\u201d on your iPhone or iPad, or \u201csystem settings\u201d on your Mac.\n\n2. Go to \u201cgeneral\u201d and select \u201cstorage.\u201d\n\n3. Toggle off Apple Intelligence.\n\niPhone / HuffPost You can toggle out of all Apple Intelligence features in \"settings.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow To Free Up Storage Without Disabling Apple Intelligence\n\nMaybe you do love those notification summaries and the \u201cClean Up\u201d tool and want to keep using them. There are other ways to get back storage on your iPhone without turning off Apple Intelligence. Here are two ways:\n\nBuy More Storage\n\nThis is not the free option, but buying an iPhone with more standard storage capabilities is one way to escape the headache of every iOS update taking up more valuable real estate on your device. The iPhone Pro models, for example, have the most storage space with 1 terabyte, which is helpful if you are a gamer or creator with video needs.\n\nAlso, if you already have an iPhone and want to keep more photos and files on your device, buying the iCloud+ premium subscription will expand your iCloud service and storage capabilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDelete Large Attachments\n\nThis is the free option if you want to clear up storage fast. Go to \u201csettings,\u201d then \u201cgeneral,\u201d then \u201ciPhone storage.\u201d There you will see exactly the percentage of storage that your applications, photos, music, messages and iOS take up.\n\nScroll down and see what your iPhone advises you do under \u201crecommendations.\u201d My own iPhone, for example, suggested that I review large attachments from videos so that I could save up to 45 gigabytes. Once I selected to view the attachments, I could quickly select \u201cedit\u201d to click which old videos I wanted to delete.\n\nUltimately, freeing up space on your device can be tedious, but the storage capabilities on your iPhone can be the difference between a phone that functions well and one that feels slower than ever.",

            "content": "Apple (AAPL -0.11%) and SiriusXM (SIRI -1.75%) aren't exactly peers. One is a technology behemoth with its hands in everything from artificial intelligence to smartphones and wearable tech. The other is solely betting on its streaming audio subscription services.\n\nSure, they both offer a music subscription service, but that's where the similarities end. So why compare the two? Because both stocks are getting a lot of attention from investors right now. It's worth taking a few minutes to size them up to see which one looks like the better buy today.\n\nWhat's happening with SiriusXM right now?\n\nOne of the most compelling angles for investing in SiriusXM is its dominance in satellite radio, specifically its vehicle-based music subscriptions. The company had 33 million subscribers at the end of 2024. That's a sizable customer base, but unfortunately, it has stagnated over the past few years.\n\nAt the end of 2021, SiriusXM had 32 million subscribers, which means it only added 1 million subscribers in four years. Most importantly, self-pay subscribers dropped from 34 million last year to their current level of 33 million.\n\nThat's not a great sign for the company. Music streaming is a competitive space, and with Apple and Spotify gobbling up most of the market, SiriusXM's retreating subscriber numbers should be troubling to potential investors. SiriusXM also brings in advertising revenue, but it was essentially flat from 2023 to 2024, at $1.8 billion.\n\nWhile we're focusing on SiriusXM's not-so-great news, the company's total sales decreased by 4% in 2024 to $6.6 billion, and average revenue per user fell by $0.35 to $15.21.\n\nWhat's happening with Apple right now?\n\nIn Apple's most recently reported quarter, about 56% of its revenue came from iPhone sales, but it still has a far more diversified business than SiriusXM, and its efforts to further diversify its sales are making progress. For example, just five years ago, about 14% of its revenue came from its services; now, services account for 21%.\n\nThere's been some uncertainty about how well Apple can grow in an increasingly competitive tech landscape, especially with such an intense focus on AI opportunities. So far, Apple is weathering all of this adequately. It partnered with OpenAI to offload more complex requests that Siri can't handle to ChatGPT, and also introduced its own AI offering, Apple Intelligence, on its devices.\n\nApple is also consistently growing. The company reported $124.3 billion in sales in its fiscal 2025 first quarter, (which ended Dec. 28), up 4% from the year-ago quarter, and diluted earnings per share jumped 10% to $2.40.\n\nThe less-than-impressive news from the quarter was that iPhone sales were stagnant compared to the year-ago quarter, and that sales in China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong were down 11%. The Trump administration's 10% tariffs on Chinese exports could also impact Apple, as a substantial share of its devices are manufactured in that country.\n\nSiriusXM is cheaper, but Apple is the better stock\n\nThere's a lot of excitement around SiriusXM right now for a couple of reasons. First, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway recently added more SiriusXM to its portfolio. Anything Berkshire Hathaway invests in is worth at least some consideration.\n\nPlus, SiriusXM stock is cheap, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 7.8.\n\nHowever, SiriusXM is facing an uphill battle in the music subscription space. Its subscriber numbers seem to have peaked and are now slowly retreating. How slow that fall will be or how long it can maintain its numbers is anyone's guess. But the trajectory doesn't look great.\n\nI'd much rather invest in a company with diversified revenue streams that continues to introduce new products and services to generate new sales. Apple may have its work cut out for itself as it tries to reinvigorate iPhone sales and weather a trade war. But at least it holds entrenched positions in services, smartphones, and wearables that give it more long-term opportunities.",

The company has been following this strategy a lot in recent years. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t get some kind of short video to show more details about the new iPhone.\n\nLast year, the company introduced the first M4 Macs in an \u201cexciting week of announcements,\u201d posting a 10-minute video each day to reveal a new Mac. The company may do this again with the new version of its more affordable iPhone.\n\niPhone SE 4 is expected to come with major upgrades compared to the current version.

            "content": "Last month, Apple offered up more insight into its consumer robotics work via a research paper that argues that traits like expressive movements are key to optimizing human-robot interaction. \u201cLike most animals,\u201d starts the report, \u201chumans are highly sensitive to motion and subtle changes in movement.\u201d\n\nTo illustrate its point, Apple pays homage to Pixar, another company founded with help from the late Steve Jobs. Since Pixar first debuted in an eponymous 1985 short film, the Luxo Jr. lamp has served as the animation studio\u2019s long-time mascot. For its research, Apple, too, chose a lamp for its own \u201cnon-anthropomorphic\u201d example. After all, lamps don\u2019t possess any obvious humanlike traits, but they can be made to behave in familiar ways.\n\nImage Credits:Apple\n\n\u201cFor robots to interact more naturally with humans,\u201d the paper notes, \u201crobot movement design should likewise integrate expressive qualities, such as intention, attention, and emotions, alongside traditional functional considerations like task fulfillment and time efficiency.\u201d\n\nA video released in conjunction with the paper showcases some of these movements. Unsurprisingly, they mostly echo those of Pixar\u2019s creation. That includes the same analogous parts, with the lampshade serving as the head, while the arm stands in for a neck.\n\nThe most intriguing part of the video, with regard to potential productization, comes as a user queries the robot. At its simplest, the unnamed lamp robot operates as a more kinetic version of a HomePod, Amazon Echo, or other smart speaker. The person facing the lamp asks a query and the robot responds in Siri\u2019s voice.\n\nImage Credits:Apple\n\nA split-screen video highlights the importance of expressive movements. Asked what the weather is like outside, one version simply states the answer. The other swivels its head to look out the window as if the view offers insight on which the robot can draw. It\u2019s a simple example, but one that drives home how even small movements tap into our lizard brain\u2019s pareidolia. The familiarity of expressive movements helps form a connection between human and object.\n\n\n\nScreenshot Image Credits:Apple\n\nApple\u2019s research arrives as the company is reportedly ramping up its consumer robotics efforts ahead of the planned release of a more advanced smart home system. It\u2019s clear how these learnings might be applied to make a robotic home hub more expressive. It\u2019s similar to the approach Amazon has taken with its Astro robot. However, the inclusion of a non-anthropomorphic form factor in the research implies that the robot may be even less humanoid than Amazon\u2019s.\n\nRumors surrounding the upcoming release have described the hub as \u201ca robot arm with an iPad attached.\u201d It\u2019s easy to see how the lamp form factor could be applied there. Of course, Apple\u2019s consumer robotics division appears to still be the research phase. Plenty can happen between now and then, from a major shift in form factor to a decision to pull the plug on the project prior to launch.",

In short, it\u2019s the internet\u2019s best attempt at putting into language that super strange chirpy rattle chatter thing that cats get up to whenever they\u2019re looking out the window and a bird suddenly comes into view. Instantly, their demeanor changes and they\u2019re locked in, powerless to deny their ancient instincts. Delightful. And birds aren\u2019t the only trigger for \u201cekking\u201d! My friend\u2019s cat \u2014 believe it or not \u2014 regularly makes the sound in response to loud sneezes? Go figure. Feline mysteries abound.\n\nIf, like me, you\u2019re less interested in figuring out why cats \u201cek\u201d and are more interested in watching them do it ad infinitum, I have just the recommendation for you: an Instagram page (with a million freaking followers) devoted to archiving \u201cek\u201ds from all over the world. There\u2019s a remarkable amount of variety. It\u2019s a great way to kill an hour.\n\n\u2013Daniel Grear SPACE APPLES: Cosmic Crisp is a home run. Credit: Matt Campbell\n\nCosmic Crisp Apples\n\nDespite my general belief that everything is getting worse all the time, I have to admit that we are living in a golden age of apples. Thanks to developments in apple science, your Fujis and Galas and Grannies Smith are as good as they\u2019ve ever been. (Red Delicious and its somehow-even-worse \u201cgolden\u201d cousin are still trash, but even apple science has its limits.)\n\nNo matter how good your pomme pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e might be these days, however, there is one apple that clears all of the others: the Cosmic Crisp.\n\nA hybrid varietal that crosses the much loved Honeycrisp with Enterprise apples, the Cosmic Crisp manages to outshine its more well known ancestor by a significant margin. To use a sports analogy, Cosmic Crisp is the Barry Bonds to Honeycrisp\u2019s Bobby Bonds, using modern science to achieve nearly perfect balance in all aspects of appledom. It is simultaneously sweet and tart, with crisp flesh and medium-thin skin that yield easily in a satisfying crunch. It is a fantastic baking apple, holding its shape and texture as good as any pie apple you\u2019ve seen and, despite being a very juicy apple, not releasing so much liquid that it impacts the quality of the finished pastry.\n\nThe best part of this? Now that the cosmic crisp has been on the market nationally for four or five years, you can generally get it from your favorite applemonger. I\u2019ve seen them at Sam\u2019s Club, Kroger, Natural Grocers, and even Edwards Food Giant in recent months. It might not fix [/gestures wildly at everything], but you\u2019d be surprised by how much a perfect apple can brighten a few minutes of your day, even in 2025.\n\nUPDATE: There\u2019s a new, interesting apple on the scene locally. Kind of hard to find, and not quite perfected yet. It\u2019s the Opal apple. Looks like a golden delicious, but tastes like a strange mix of apple, melon and a hint of banana. When the texture is right and they are cold, they\u2019re pretty amazing. Problem is, when they get even slightly overripe, they get mealy and depressing.\n\n-Matt Campbell Elon Musk at an AI event in the UK in 2023 Credit: Marcel Grabowski / UK Government\n\nEzra Klein\u2019s \u2018Don\u2019t Believe Him\u2019 and other essays\n\nIt\u2019s been three weeks since the inauguration, and the Trump administration has handed over the control panel of the federal government to squadron of 23 year old boys. What\u2019s real? What\u2019s fantasy? Is there any difference? The effect is so disorienting and overwhelming it\u2019s hard not to shut down and turn away.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a cognitive lifeline to grab onto, my utterly boring recommendation is to listen to Ezra Klein\u2019s recent run of interviews and audio essays for The New York Times. In the past, I personally never liked Klein all that much as a writer or speaker \u2014 he radiates the dull, self-serious excellence of the valedictorian, and his pronouncements too often seemed calibrated to satisfy mainstream liberal opinion.\n\nBut in this particular political moment, in which so many other journalists and commentators seem too disoriented and overwhelmed to have much of anything coherent to say at all, it feels like Klein is doing the work no one else is. He is cogent, careful and curious. He is clearly outraged by the self-evidently outrageous abuses of power, but he\u2019s also thoughtful about his critiques \u2014 and genuinely interested in understanding what\u2019s going on, rather than sputtering uselessly about the insanity of it all.\n\nKlein has been churning out material on Trump at a remarkable clip since the November election, and especially since Jan. 20. Start with his essay from last weekend, \u201cDon\u2019t Believe Him,\u201d in which he argues that Donald Trump\u2019s blitzkrieg of executive orders is actually masking a fundamental brittleness. A sample:\n\nThere is a reason Trump is doing all of this through executive orders rather than submitting these same directives as legislation to pass through Congress. A more powerful executive could persuade Congress to eliminate the spending he opposes or reform the civil service to give himself the powers of hiring and firing that he seeks. To write these changes into legislation would make them more durable and allow him to argue their merits in a more strategic way. Even if Trump\u2019s aim is to bring the civil service to heel \u2014 to rid it of his opponents and turn it to his own ends \u2014 he would be better off arguing that he is simply trying to bring the high-performance management culture of Silicon Valley to the federal government. You never want a power grab to look like a power grab. But Republicans have a three-seat edge in the House and a 53-seat majority in the Senate. Trump has done nothing to reach out to Democrats. If Trump tried to pass this agenda as legislation, it would most likely fail in the House, and it would certainly die before the filibuster in the Senate. And that would make Trump look weak. Trump does not want to look weak. He remembers John McCain humiliating him in his first term by casting the deciding vote against Obamacare repeal. That is the tension at the heart of Trump\u2019s whole strategy: Trump is acting like a king because he is too weak to govern like a president. He is trying to substitute perception for reality. He is hoping that perception then becomes reality. That can only happen if we believe him. The flurry of activity is meant to suggest the existence of a plan. The Trump team wants it known that they\u2019re ready this time. They will control events rather than be controlled by them. The closer you look, the less true that seems.\n\n-Benji Hardy \u2018LIKE, FOR WHAT?\u2019: Cher-isms abound in \u201cCher: The Memoir: Part One.\u201d\n\n\u201cCher: The Memoir (Part One)\u201d\n\nA friend recommended \u201cCher: The Memoir (Part One),\u201d the audiobook. I had just finished \u201cFrom Here to the Great Unknown,\u201d recommended by Arkansas Times editor Austin Gelder. I had never really been able to do audiobooks, but I think I found my new jam. Since the election, I\u2019ve had a hard time listening to NPR every morning on the way to the office. So, I queued up the books and started taking the long route to the office \u2014 and everywhere else.\n\nI grew up listening to Cher with my mom, blaring the cassette tapes in her black Mercury Cougar. I had no idea about half the shit that Cher went through (and this is just part one!) Her mom is from Arkansas. Never knew that. I found myself relistening to parts of chapters, thinking, \u201cWait, did she really just say that?!?\u201d Each day I find myself googling more and more photos of all the amazing clothes she talks about. And her houses! Really, if you have the slightest bit of interest in Cher, you should queue it up.\n\n-Mandy Keener VA VA VICAR: On \u201cGrantchester,\u201d a cozy British mystery from PBS. Credit: PBS\n\nTurn on, tune in, drop out\n\nMy fellow Gen Xers, annihilation is on our doorsteps at last! We\u2019ve been prepping for this our whole lives, but turns out, it\u2019s not all that fun to watch in real time. You know what is fun to watch? TV.\n\nTreat yourself to some PBS for cozy British mysteries and the most adorable li\u2019l murders you ever saw. My current fave is the Masterpiece Theater production \u201cGrantchester,\u201d about a chiseled ginger crime-solving vicar who viewers might find inspires impure thoughts. The good parishioners of Cambridgeshire village circa 1950 are dropping like flies, with a homicide rate that would easily meet, and possibly exceed, \u201cGang Wars: Bangin in Little Rock\u201d levels. It\u2019s OK, though, because dishy Anglican Sidney Chambers always gets his man.\n\nPublic television may well be on the way out, as our new president from South Africa unleashes his tween entourage to cut funding for everything except border walls and Space Force. So grab some snacks and make your way to the couch immediately.\n\n-Austin Gelder The gaming library at Caverns and Forests. Credit: Brian Chilson\n\nLive Trivia\n\nI spend a good amount of my spare time filling my brain with random, mostly useless, knowledge and factoids. Sifting through Wikipedia articles like a prospector looking for gold, or watching a 30-minute YouTube video about how safety features in space heaters work? Sounds like a great way to kill a few minutes.\n\nThe pursuit of knowledge has an intrinsic satisfaction, sure, but is that really better than scoring some free food and beer? Enter live trivia, one of my favorite ways to waste an evening.\n\nWith multiple games happening nearly every night of the week and dozens of Central Arkansas bars and restaurants participating, there has never been a better time to flex your knowledge about your niche interests. El Sur, Vino\u2019s and Caverns & Forests Board Game Cafe are three of my go-tos.\n\nIn my experience, first place typically nets you a $35 to $50 gift card, with smaller gift cards for second and third.\n\nThe local scene is active. I hear the same team names every week at different places and I\u2019ve started to remember which ones to look out for. (Little Rockers are pretty creative with their trivia-themed team names. \u201cQuiz in Your Face\u201d is a particularly memorable one.)\n\n\n\nChallenge Entertainment, the company behind Arkansas\u2019s trivia scene, has information about game schedules and venues online.\n\n-Milo Strain A BLOODY FAIRYTALE: Caroline Lindy\u2019s \u201cYour Monster.\u201d Credit: Vertical Entertainment\n\n\u201cYour Monster\u201d (2024)\n\nPlopped into the streamiverse rolodex with little fanfare after an appearance in Sundance\u2019s \u201cMidnight\u201d category and a dismal turnout at the box office, Caroline Lindy\u2019s fanciful little comedy \u201cYour Monster\u201d is an undersung delight. Released just before Halloween last year, Lindy\u2019s movie manages to riff cleverly on genre conventions without adhering to any particular genre itself, and plumbs the depths of major bummers like cancer and childhood trauma in a way that\u2019s, unfathomably, tons of fun. Is it a horror movie? A rom-com? A remake of Beauty and the Beast? Beats me, but the result is certainly a smart and satirical, if breezy, meet cute with a major twist and an ending that I thought about for days afterward. In Oscar season, where it can feel like only Deeply Moving Films of Heft and Gravity are deserving of our attention, this palate cleanser sings and dances and should absolutely be reason enough for Melissa Barrera to get cast in lots, lots more movies.\n\n-Stephanie Smittle",

            "content": "I had a strange experience recently. I reached for my MacBook Pro to start work at around 7 am one day (before my first coffee, even!) and discovered that the device, stowed in my bag since the day before, was alarmingly warm.\n\nNow, the machine is more than four years old and already a bit beat up. But I hadn\u2019t dropped it, nor was there any other reason to fear thermal runaway (aka \u201cimminent battery explosion\u201d). Maybe it was something to do with macOS 15.3, which I had already downloaded during the day? The computer might have tried to install the update overnight. But not when it\u2019s closed, you\u2019d think.\n\nThe suspicion turned out to be correct. When I opened up the Mac, its screen was completely black\u2026 apart from the film of dirt built up over the past four years, which really comes into its own when the machine is switched off. I plugged the Mac into a power supply. Nothing happened at first; fearing that the battery was almost flat, I had at least expected it to display the sad face screen once power was connected.\n\nMy MacBook Pro strangely decided to install a macOS update\u2014even though it was supposed to be asleep. Petter Ahrnstedt\n\nI then pressed the power button, and after a short time, the Apple logo appeared. Five minutes later, the familiar boot process, which fills several progress bars in a row after a system update, was complete and I was able to start working on a MacBook Pro that was now getting noticeably cooler.\n\nBack to business as usual, then. But I couldn\u2019t help worrying. Sure, a desktop Mac installs downloaded system updates during the night, even if you haven\u2019t shut it down in the evening but just put it to sleep. But surely a MacBook Pro that\u2019s closed and stowed away in a briefcase should sleep much deeper than a Mac mini, iMac, or Mac Studio?\n\nThat was the sort of common-sense approach that I trusted Apple to adopt. Now my trust has been shaken. Who can you trust these days? Your own experience and acquired knowledge, your own intuition? Institutions like the WHO? Or a company like Apple that feels like an institution to long-standing customers?\n\nOn balance, I have decided that yes, we can trust Apple, even if it seems to be doing a lot these days to squander that trust. On far more serious issues than those that result in a hot MacBook Pro.\n\nTesting our trust\n\nAt the end of January, we learned of a security gap in Apple silicon chips from M2 and A15 onwards that allows attackers to access sensitive data. According to the researcher who found the vulnerability, Apple has been aware of it for some time but has still not responded with a security update. iOS 18.3 and macOS 15.3 have closed some gaps and bolstered security, but the two vulnerabilities in SLAP and FLOP were not included. This is probably what prompted the Georgia Institute of Technology to go public.\n\nThe Apple Watch has come under criticism for the safety of its bands. Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry\n\nAt least the security researchers confirmed Apple\u2019s statement that there is no immediate danger. This makes us feel better about the issue not being addressed until iOS 18.3.1 or iOS 18.4. The release of the findings may have accelerated matters, of course.\n\nIn the same month, toxins were discovered in smartwatch bands. As Apple is not only the best-known brand in this sector, but also by far the market leader, a class-action lawsuit was only filed against the Cupertino-based company.\n\nApple put out a statement insisting that its wristbands do not pose any health risks, and we trust this statement. Apple explained years ago that it would ban toxic PFAS (polyfluoroalkyl substances) from its products, and that this was a long-term process. The company has repeatedly succeeded in removing environmental toxins from its products, often as a pioneer for the entire industry. PVC and brominated flame retardants have both been raised as concerns in the tech industry, and both are addressed in Apple\u2019s environmental FAQs.\n\nBut that\u2019s the thing about trust. It doesn\u2019t matter how hard you work to earn it; once you lose it, it\u2019s difficult to regain. One breach of trust could be one too many.\n\nOn thin ice\n\nI haven\u2019t lost my trust in Apple, and the answer to the question in the headline is yes. However, in these times when the ice of civilization is growing thinner and thinner, the smallest thing could be enough to break through and drown in the waters below.\n\nI hope Apple will prove itself more resistant to declarations about the Gulf of Mexico, tariffs, and, most of all, diversity and inclusion. Simply put, how can Cupertino make the best products if it can no longer hire the best minds in the world? And how can the company be trusted if it betrays its cherished principles? (To be fair, there have been some positive indications in this direction.) In the next pandemic, people around the world may need Apple (and Google) to prove themselves more trustworthy than the U.S. health authorities.\n\nI also have to trust that Tim Cook knew what he was doing when he donated $1M from his personal fortune for the presidential inauguration. Because there\u2019s a hell of a lot at stake, and in the end, trust is all you have.",

            "content": "Security officials in the United Kingdom have demanded that Apple create a back door allowing them to retrieve all the content any Apple user worldwide has uploaded to the cloud, people familiar with the matter told The Washington Post. The British government\u2019s undisclosed order, issued last month, requires blanket capability to view fully encrypted material, not merely assistance in cracking a specific account, and has no known precedent in major democracies. Its application would mark a significant defeat for tech companies in their decades-long battle to avoid being wielded as government tools against their users, the people said, speaking under the condition of anonymity to discuss legally and politically sensitive issues.\n\nRather than break the security promises it made to its users everywhere, Apple is likely to stop offering encrypted storage in the U.K., the people said. Yet that concession would not fulfill the U.K. demand for backdoor access to the service in other countries, including the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe office of the Home Secretary has served Apple with a document called a technical capability notice, ordering it to provide access under the sweeping U.K. Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which authorizes law enforcement to compel assistance from companies when needed to collect evidence, the people said.\n\nThe law, known by critics as the Snoopers\u2019 Charter, makes it a criminal offense to reveal that the government has even made such a demand. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.\n\nApple can appeal the U.K. capability notice to a secret technical panel, which would consider arguments about the expense of the requirement, and to a judge who would weigh whether the request was in proportion to the government\u2019s needs. But the law does not permit Apple to delay complying during an appeal.\n\nIn March, when the company was on notice that such a requirement might be coming, it told Parliament: \u201cThere is no reason why the U.K. [government] should have the authority to decide for citizens of the world whether they can avail themselves of the proven security benefits that flow from end-to-end encryption.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Home Office said Thursday that its policy was not to discuss any technical demands. \u201cWe do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nSenior national security officials in the Biden administration had been tracking the matter since the United Kingdom first told the company it might demand access and Apple said it would refuse. It could not be determined whether they raised objections to Britain. Trump White House and intelligence officials declined to comment.\n\nOne of the people briefed on the situation, a consultant advising the United States on encryption matters, said Apple would be barred from warning its users that its most advanced encryption no longer provided full security. The person deemed it shocking that the U.K. government was demanding Apple\u2019s help to spy on non-British users without their governments\u2019 knowledge. A former White House security adviser confirmed the existence of the British order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt issue is cloud storage that only the user, not Apple, can unlock. Apple started rolling out the option, which it calls Advanced Data Protection, in 2022. It had sought to offer it several years earlier but backed off after objections from the FBI during the first term of President Donald Trump, who pilloried the company for not aiding in the arrest of \u201ckillers, drug dealers and other violent criminal elements.\u201d The service is an available security option for Apple users in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nWhile most iPhone and Mac computer users do not go through the steps to enable it, the service offers enhanced protection from hacking and shuts down a routine method law enforcement uses to access photos, messages and other material. iCloud storage and backups are favored targets for U.S. search warrants, which can be served on Apple without the user knowing.\n\nTechnologists, some intelligence officers and political supporters of encryption reacted strongly to the revelation after this story first appeared.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (Oregon), a Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said it was important for the United States to dissuade Britain: \u201cTrump and American tech companies letting foreign governments secretly spy on Americans would be unconscionable and an unmitigated disaster for Americans\u2019 privacy and our national security.\u201d\n\nMeredith Whittaker, president of the nonprofit encrypted messenger Signal, said: \u201cUsing Technical Capability Notices to weaken encryption around the globe is a shocking move that will position the UK as a tech pariah, rather than a tech leader. If implemented, the directive will create a dangerous cybersecurity vulnerability in the nervous system of our global economy.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement authorities around the world have complained about increased use of encryption in communication modes beyond simple phone traffic, which in the United States can be monitored with a court\u2019s permission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.K. and FBI in particular have said that encryption lets terrorists and child abusers hide more easily. Tech companies have pushed back, stressing a right to privacy in personal communication and arguing that back doors for law enforcement are often exploited by criminals and can be abused by authoritarian regimes.\n\nMost electronic communication is encrypted to some degree as it passes through privately owned systems before reaching its destination. Usually such intermediaries as email providers and internet access companies can obtain the plain text if police ask.\n\nBut an increasing number of tech offerings are encrypted end to end, meaning that no intermediary has access to the digital keys that would unlock the content. That includes Signal messages, Meta\u2019s WhatsApp and Messenger texts, and Apple\u2019s iMessages and FaceTime calls. Often such content loses its end-to-end protection when it is backed up for storage in the cloud. That does not happen with Apple\u2019s Advanced Data Protection option.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple has made privacy a selling point for its phones for years, a stance that was enhanced in 2016 when it successfully fought a U.S. order to unlock the iPhone of a dead terrorist in San Bernardino, California. It has since sought to compromise, such as by developing a plan to scan user devices for illegal material. That initiative was shelved after heated criticism by privacy advocates and security experts, who said it would turn the technology against customers in unpredictable ways.\n\nGoogle would be a bigger target for U.K. officials, because it has made the backups for Android phones encrypted by default since 2018. Google spokesman Ed Fernandez declined to say whether any government had sought a back door, but implied none have been implemented. \u201cGoogle can\u2019t access Android end-to-end encrypted backup data, even with a legal order,\u201d he said.\n\nMeta also offers encrypted backups for WhatsApp. A spokesperson declined to comment on government requests but pointed to a transparency statement on its website saying that no back doors or weakened architecture would be implemented.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the U.K. secures access to the encrypted data, other countries that have allowed the encrypted storage, such as China, might be prompted to demand equal backdoor access, potentially prompting Apple to withdraw the service rather than comply.\n\nThe battle over storage privacy escalating in Britain is not entirely unexpected. In 2022 U.K. officials condemned Apple\u2019s plans to introduce strong encryption for storage. \u201cEnd-to-end encryption cannot be allowed to hamper efforts to catch perpetrators of the most serious crimes,\u201d a government spokesperson told the Guardian newspaper, referring specifically to child safety laws.\n\nAfter the Home Office gave Apple a draft of what would become the backdoor order, the company hinted to lawmakers and the public what might lie ahead.\n\nDuring a debate in Parliament over amendments to the Investigatory Powers Act, Apple warned in March that the law allowed the government to demand back doors that could apply around the world. \u201cThese provisions could be used to force a company like Apple, that would never build a back door into its products, to publicly withdraw critical security features from the UK market, depriving UK users of these protections,\u201d it said in a written submission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple argued then that wielding the act against strong encryption would conflict with a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that any law requiring companies to produce end-to-end encrypted communications \u201crisks amounting to a requirement that providers of such services weaken the encryption mechanism for all users\u201d and violates the European right to privacy.\n\nIn the United States, decades of complaints from law enforcement about encryption have recently been sidelined by massive hacks by suspected Chinese government agents, who breached the biggest communications companies and listened in on calls at will. In a joint December press briefing on the case with FBI leaders, a Department of Homeland Security official urged Americans not to rely on standard phone service for privacy and to use encrypted services when possible.\n\nAlso that month, the FBI, National Security Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency joined in recommending dozens of steps to counter the Chinese hacking spree, including \u201cEnsure that traffic is end-to-end encrypted to the maximum extent possible.\u201d",

            "content": "While many people still own Apple (AAPL -0.11%) stock, I think it's time to let it go. The stock has been a stellar performer over the past decade, but all of its recent gains have been due to investors bidding up the stock, rather than actual business performance.\n\nApple produced some very lackluster quarters for the past three years, and there's no indication of any growth on the horizon. As a result, it's only a matter of time before the market corrects itself and sends Apple to a more reasonable price level.\n\niPhone sales haven't really done much over the past five years\n\nApple needs no introduction. It's one of the most popular tech brands globally, but especially in the U.S. The product ecosystem it built is second to none and captured many users.\n\nHowever, Apple seems to be behind in one of the most important technological races yet: artificial intelligence. A large chunk of Apple's revenue comes from iPhones, and its AI feature, Apple Intelligence, leaves a lot to be desired compared to its Android competitors. This was evident in its first-quarter fiscal year 2025, which ended on Dec. 28, 2024. Apple's Q1 encompasses the all-important holiday quarter, when most iPhones are sold. If iPhone sales spiked in Q1, then it's clear that the latest launch was successful. If they stayed flat, then it's evident that the phone didn't bring anything new to the table.\n\nUsing this measure, it's safe to say Apple really hasn't moved the needle in some time.\n\nYear iPhone Revenue 2024 $69.1 billion 2023 $69.7 billion 2022 $65.8 billion 2021 $71.6 billion 2020 $65.6 billion\n\nOver a five-year span, Apple's iPhone revenue really hasn't gone anywhere. This gets even worse when you factor in inflation, as the $65.6 billion in iPhone sales during the holiday quarter in 2020 is equivalent to $79.5 billion in 2024 dollars.\n\nSo, on an inflation-adjusted basis, iPhone sales are down over the last five years. With iPhone sales making up 56% of sales, this isn't a good sign for Apple.\n\nOverall, Apple's revenue increased 4% year over year, but thanks to efficiency improvements, its earnings per share (EPS) rose 10%. This shows that even though Apple has no growth, management is doing a great job maximizing its profitability.\n\nHowever, that kind of growth is essentially market-average, so the stock should trade at around what the broader market does.\n\nApple's stock has a premium valuation\n\nWhile Apple's financial performance is essentially market-average, its stock is valued like that of the next biggest growth company.\n\nApple stock trades for a whopping 36 times trailing earnings and 31 times forward earnings.\n\nCompared to the S&P 500, which trades for 25.5 times trailing earnings and 22.3 times forward earnings, Apple has a premium of around 40% compared to the market.\n\nNow, I'll buy the notion that Apple should command a premium due to its incredible brand value, but 40% is far too high a premium for just brand value.\n\nThere are far more attractive investments than Apple, as multiple companies trade for a cheaper price tag and have stronger growth than Apple. Here are just a few:\n\nCompany Forward P/E Last Quarter Diluted EPS Growth Nvidia 26.2 111% Taiwan Semiconductor 22.2 54% Meta Platforms 27.6 52% Salesforce 30.2 35% Alphabet\n\n22.4 21% ASML\n\n29.4 30%\n\nAll of these are far more attractive investment options than Apple and represent growth at a reasonable price.\n\nAs a final closing point, if you own an S&P 500 index fund, then you already have nearly 7% of the fund in Apple stock. That's a significant weighting already, and further exposure to a company that's not putting up spectacular results isn't a wise investment strategy.\n\nThere are far too many other promising companies out there to waste time with Apple as an individual holding. As a result, I think it's time to move on from Apple stock and focus on more promising areas.",

Problem Solved\n\nA new Apple iOS update, with the intention of fixing security vulnerabilities, may be around the corner.\n\nTechnology websites MacRumors and 9to5Mac are predicting that an iOS 18.3.1 update will be released in a few weeks. The update would follow the late-January release of iOS 18.3, which included Apple Intelligence notifications and new Visual Intelligence options, like the ability to add an event to a device's calendar by scanning a poster.\n\nSince its release, iOS 18.3 has been making waves on social media, as users fear that Elon Musk's Starlink, which offers direct-to-cell capabilities, is automatically downloaded onto devices with the update. However, this is not true. When an Apple user downloads the iOS 18.3 update, Starlink is not added to one's device. The iOS 18.3 update just allows Apple users to download Starlink if they wish, with a T-Mobile account.\n\nWhen it comes to iOS 18.3.1 though, MacRumors suspects the update will be \"minor,\" largely addressing security bugs.\n\nHere's what we know about iOS 18.3.1.\n\nMore: Apple iOS 18.3 is here. What to know about top features.\n\nWhat will the iOS 18.3.1 update include?\n\nApple did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for information on Friday. Still tech reporters are speculating what iOS 18.3.1 may include.\n\nMacRumors suspects the update will address \"software bugs and/or security vulnerabilities\" that may have been created with the iOS 18.3 update.\n\nThe update could be similar to iOS 18.2.1 which contained the description, \"This update provides important bug fixes and is recommended for all users.\"\n\nApple Intelligence notifications, which were released with iOS 18.3 have been temporarily disabled due to inaccurate summaries. It is unclear if these notifications will be turned back on with iOS 18.3.1, MacRumors reported.\n\nWhen will iOS 18.3.1 be released?\n\nApple has not confirmed iOS 18.3.1, but MacRumors and 9to5Mac suspect it will be released in a few weeks.\n\nWhat's new in iOS 18.3?\n\nFor Apple users who haven't downloaded the latest software update, here's what to know about what's new with iOS 18.3.\n\nUsers with an iPhone 16, iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max will experience new Apple Intelligence notification summaries. The summaries feature italicized text, making them more distinguishable from other notifications.\n\nNotification summaries for News & Entertainment apps have been temporarily disabled. Users who opt-in to the notifications will see them again once they are available.\n\nThe update also features updated Visual Intelligence for all iPhone 16 models. This update allows users to add an event to the Apple Calendar from a poster or flyer and identify plants and animals.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to add new information.\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

That means all of the associated AI tools will be ready and waiting to help you as soon as you\u2019ve installed the updates and restarted your device.\n\nHowever, Apple isn\u2019t (yet) forcing you to use all of these features, and you can still turn off Apple Intelligence, if you\u2019d like to. Note that if you\u2019ve previously turned Apple Intelligence off on your device, the iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and macOS Sequoia 15.3 updates won\u2019t suddenly turn it back on\u2014your previous choice will be respected.\n\nYou can turn Apple Intelligence on or off entirely. Screenshot: Apple\n\nIf you\u2019re new to Apple Intelligence and want to know what you\u2019re dealing with, it\u2019s a suite of AI features covering just about every app on your phone. One of the most noticeable upgrades is a ChatGPT extension for Siri, which allows you to start conversations with the OpenAI chatbot when Siri can\u2019t give you all the answers you need.\n\nThere\u2019s also help with your writing, which pops up anywhere there\u2019s a text field. You can use Apple Intelligence to change the tone of what you\u2019ve written, or to shorten or expand on existing text, for example. You can also get your text summarized or proofread to check for mistakes.\n\nThe Image Playground app is part of Apple Intelligence. Screenshot: Apple\n\nApple Intelligence is also able to summarize webpages in Safari, prioritize your emails in Mail, and create customized emoji icons (known as Genmoji) in iMessage and other apps. It can identify what you\u2019re pointing your iPhone camera at, create new images from scratch in the Image Playground app, and apply a variety of tricks to existing images through the Photos app.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot, and there\u2019s more to come\u2014but maybe you don\u2019t want all of this AI interference. Maybe you\u2019re worried about the cost to the climate or the mistakes AI keeps on making. If that\u2019s the case you can turn some or all of these Apple Intelligence features.\n\nHow to turn off Apple Intelligence\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t available on every Apple device, because it needs certain hardware requirements. At the time of writing, you need a Mac or an iPad with an M1 chip or later, the A17 Pro iPad mini, or the iPhone 15 Pro, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, or any iPhone 16 model to run Apple Intelligence.\n\nAssuming your device is eligible for Apple Intelligence, the options for it aren\u2019t hard to find: From Settings on iPhones and iPads, or System Settings on Macs (accessible through the Apple menu), choose Apple Intelligence & Siri: Straight away you\u2019ll see a toggle switch for turning the AI on or off entirely. Disable Apple Intelligence and all its features will be hidden, and the necessary AI models will be removed from your device.\n\nSummaries are one of the AI features that can be toggled individually. Screenshot: Apple\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to switch everything off entirely, you can be more selective. Choose ChatGPT on the same screen, and you can disable the chatbot extension that\u2019s added to Siri\u2014leaving you with just the smarts built into Apple\u2019s own assistant. There\u2019s also the new Type to Siri feature, which you can disable by selecting Talk & Type to Siri on iOS or iPadOS (it\u2019s not an optional extra on macOS\u2014instead it turns on and off with the main Apple Intelligence setting).\n\nYou can find other Apple Intelligence features elsewhere on your device. From Settings or System Settings, pick Notifications > Summarize Notifications to prevent AI from summing up incoming notifications. In Mail, to escape the AI-powered priority view on iOS and iPadOS, tap the three dots in the top right corner, then pick List View and disable the Show Priority option. On macOS, open the View menu then disable Show Priority.\n\nWriting Tools and Image Creation can be turned off via Screen Time. Screenshot: Apple\n\nBoth the writing tools and image creation tools are handled through Screen Time, for some reason: From Settings or System Settings, choose Screen Time > Content & Privacy. Enable the Content & Privacy toggle switch, and you get an Intelligence & Siri option where Writing Tools and Image Creation can be disabled.\n\nSome of the features you can\u2019t turn off individually include the Clean Up tool in the Photos app, and the Intelligent Breakthrough feature for your Focus modes (for using AI to determine when an alert is important enough to disturb you with)\u2014these you\u2019ll just have to ignore, unless you disable Apple Intelligence entirely.",

            "content": "The Washington Post reported that the United Kingdom is demanding that Apple create an encryption backdoor to give the government access to end-to-end encrypted data in iCloud. Encryption is one of the best ways we have to reclaim our privacy and security in a digital world filled with cyberattacks and security breaches, and there\u2019s no way to weaken it in order to only provide access to the \u201cgood guys.\u201d We call on Apple to resist this attempt to undermine the right to private spaces and communications.\n\n\n\nAs reported, the British government\u2019s undisclosed order was issued last month, and requires the capability to view all encrypted material in iCloud. The core target is Apple\u2019s Advanced Data Protection, which is an optional feature that turns on end-to-end encryption for backups and other data stored in iCloud, making it so that even Apple cannot access that information. For a long time, iCloud backups were a loophole for law enforcement to gain access to data otherwise not available to them on iPhones with device encryption enabled. That loophole still exists for anyone who doesn\u2019t opt in to using Advanced Data Protection. If Apple does comply, users should consider disabling iCloud backups entirely. Perhaps most concerning, the U.K. is apparently seeking a backdoor into users\u2019 data regardless of where they are or what citizenship they have.\n\n\n\nThere is no technological compromise between strong encryption that protects the data and a mechanism to allow the government special access to this data. Any \u201cbackdoor\u201d built for the government puts everyone at greater risk of hacking, identity theft, and fraud. There is no world where, once built, these backdoors would only be used by open and democratic governments. These systems can be, and quickly will be, used by more repressive governments around the world to read protesters\u2019 and dissenters\u2019 communications. We\u2019ve seen and opposed these sorts of measures for years. Now is no different.\n\nPerhaps most concerning, the U.K. is apparently seeking a backdoor into users\u2019 data regardless of where they are or what citizenship they have.\n\nOf course, Apple is not the only company who uses end-to-end encryption. Some of Google\u2019s backup options employ similar protections, as do many chat apps, cloud backup services, and more. If the U.K. government secures access to the encrypted data of Apple users through a backdoor, every other secure file-sharing, communication, and backup tool is at risk.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the U.S., just last year we had a top U.S. cybersecurity chief declare that \u201cencryption is your friend,\u201d taking a welcome break from the messaging we\u2019ve seen over the years at EFF. Even the FBI, which has frequently pushed for easier access to data by law enforcement, issued the same recommendation.\n\n\n\nThere is no legal mechanism for the U.S. government to force this same sort of rule on Apple, and we\u2019d hope to see Apple continue to resist it as they have in the past. But what happens in the U.K. will still affect users around the world, especially as the U.K. order specifically stated that Apple would be prohibited from warning its users that its Advanced Data Protection measures no longer work as initially designed.\n\nWeakening encryption violates fundamental human rights and annihilates our right to private spaces. Apple has to continue fighting against this ruling to keep backdoors off users\u2019 devices.",

When a customer jumps, physical and digital triggers prompt EpicShot to capture footage and stills. Then, the content is automatically stitched together and ready within minutes for the customer to enjoy and share.\n\nAJ Hackett Bungy New Zealand uses iPhone to capture and share stunning images from five picturesque New Zealand locations with their customers.\n\nThe tech overhaul has paid off in a big way.

Apple is unlikely to hold a launch event for the device, opting to reveal it on its website instead, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private.\n\nThe debut will mark a major shift for an oft-overlooked smartphone, which Apple first introduced in 2016 as an entry-level model. The existing version \u2014 released in 2022 \u2014 has grown dated: It\u2019s the only iPhone that still has a home button and lacks Face ID. The new version will look more like the iPhone 14 and also include Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s AI software.\n\nThere are already telltale signs that the new phone is coming. Inventory of the current iPhone SE has dried up at Apple retail stores in many parts of the US, which typically happens before a refresh.\n\nApple retail employees at several stores say that inventory has been dwindling for weeks and customers who want to buy the device in certain configurations sometimes need to be turned away.\n\nThe phone remains available for purchase on Apple\u2019s online store but some configurations \u2014 including a red version with 256 gigabytes of storage \u2014 aren\u2019t shipping until March. Stockpiles of the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus also are running low.\n\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.\n\nApple already discontinued the current SE and iPhone 14 in the EU because the products don\u2019t comply with local laws requiring USB-C, a charging standard adopted by other iPhones in 2023. The next iPhone SE will get that same port, letting it return to the EU.\n\nThe current SE costs $429, which is hundreds less than the $799 regular iPhone 16. Given the new features and design of the updated model, Apple may increase that price. But it\u2019s likely to remain in the same general range as entry-level smartphones from Samsung Electronics Co. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone business could use a boost. Sales of the device declined 1% during the holiday quarter \u2014 a worse performance than expected \u2014 and Apple is banking on the new low-end phone to help restore growth.\n\nStory Continues",

Credit: Apple\n\nApple's got a new app. Launched seemingly out of nowhere earlier this week, Apple Invites is a free app, available on the App Store, that lets you create colorful invites to events that you can share with friends and family.\n\nThe app is very simple to use. Choose a background, set a title and location for your event, and you can start sending it to potential guests.\n\nYou can use your own photos, or choose from Apple's predefined backgrounds. Credit: Stan Schroeder / Mashable\n\nWhile the app is free to use and anyone can freely receive invites, one caveat is that you can only send invites if you have a paid iCloud+ account. This is a bummer, but it makes some sense as storing the invites in the cloud does consume storage space. Apple iCloud+ accounts start at $0.99 per month, and Apple now lists Invites as one of the benefits of subscribing to iCloud+ (others include Hide My Email, HomeKit Secure Video, and iCloud Private Relay, as well as more storage for your data).\n\nApple Invites: How it works\n\nTo create a new invite, hit the \"+\" button in the upper right corner of the Apple Invites app. Start with adding a background; Apple lets you choose from pre-defined options which include emoji-themed, photographic, and colorful backgrounds, but you can also use a photo from your iPhone's library or take a photo with your camera, using the buttons in the top left of the \"Add Background\" menu.\n\nNext, set a title for your event, choose date and time, and pick a location, which you can do by searching real world locations \u2014 and you can add an optional name for your location, which is useful if it's your house.\n\nYou can also add an event description with a 1,000 character limit, and the host's name. Finally, you can create a photo album, as well as an Apple Music playlist, and share it with participants.\n\nIt's not a real event. Please do not show up. Credit: Stan Schroeder / Mashable\n\nOnce you're done, you can invite guests by creating a shareable link. And if you need to send an update related to the event to your guests \u2014 such as detailed entry instructions or the fact that all the shrimp cocktails are sadly, already gone \u2014 you can do that via the \"Send a Note\" button.\n\nApple Invites: Tips and tricks\n\nAll of the above is pretty straightforward, and I'm sure you won't have any issues creating and sharing your event. But the app does have a couple of additional features that are easy to miss.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

Sign Me Up By clicking Sign Me Up, you confirm you are 16+ and agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy Thanks for signing up!\n\nFor example, tap on an existing event in the app, and then tap on the three dots menu in the upper right corner. From there, you can duplicate the event, which is handy when you're hosting repeating events, for example a Pok\u00e9mon-themed pub quiz in your basement every Wednesday.\n\nSome advanced options are hidden in Event Settings. Credit: Stan Schroeder / Mashable\n\nFor more options, hit Event Settings from the same menu. There, you can choose whether guests need your approval before they can join the event. You can also choose to only show the background image to guests after they've opened the invitation with a verified email address (maybe you don't just want anyone to see how great your basement is). For people who use a screen reader, you can provide a description of your invitation's background.\n\nFinally, you can also cancel and delete the event, as well as pause replies (for the last time, there won't be free beer, folks, and I will not entertain any further inquiries).\n\nThere are a few other, somewhat hidden privacy options in the app, too. For example, once there's a group of guests coming, you can grant some of them the ability to invite their own guests to the event. Handy.\n\nSorry folks, this event is not for everyone. Credit: Stan Schroeder / Mashable\n\nAlso, when you invite guests, you can create a public link that allows anyone to join the event, but you can also just invite individual people with one-off links.\n\nApple Invites: Customizing your notifications\n\nWhen you're hosting events \u2014 especially if they're big, and if you're hosting more than one \u2014 things can get messy fast. Apple Invites allows you to get push notifications about events, but fortunately, it also lets you be quite granular when it comes to choosing which types of notifications you want to see.\n\nYou might want to fine tune these. Credit: Stan Schroeder / Mashable\n\nTap on your profile image in the Invites app, and hit Push Notifications. From here, you can choose whether you only want to see notifications for events you're hosting, or events you're invited to.\n\nYou can also choose whether you want to see Apple's updates with recommendations, new features and tips, and offers related to the app.\n\nGo a step back, and you'll be able to set whether you want to receive email updates about events you're hosting, or are invited to. This is unrelated to push notifications, and you can have both on or off at the same time.\n\nApple Invites: How to get it\n\nThis one is simple. Apple Invites is a free download at Apple's App Store. It requires iOS 18 or later, and you do need an iCloud+ account in order to send invites.",

It has four distinct categories of partners from those who work only in procuring product to those who only specialize in services, the company said.\n\nThe Apple Business Partner category is designed for the traditional reseller with a business model that is weighted heavily towards delivering products and is light on services. They could be large or small, but the focus is on delivery and set up, Apple said.\n\nThe Apple Premium Business Partner category is for partners with an established services led model, and with a strong commitment to end-to-end customer life cycles. This includes those who build a full Apple practice.\n\nApple Premium Education Partners may look a lot like the Apple Premium Business Partner, but they specialize in serving customers with comprehensive technical, education-specific solutions and services in K-12 and higher education, Apple said.\n\nApple also tweaked its Apple Consultants Network. It now includes the categories Apple Technical Partner and Apple Premium Technical Partner, which are being introduced as part of a refresh. The partners found here focus purely on customers support and services without reselling, the company said.\n\nApple said its revamped program includes the Apple Professional Academy, a new online training and enablement site with self-paced videos and skills training, as well as the tools partners need to become technical advisors on the Apple platform.\n\nThe company told CRN it devoted significant time and resources to make sure partners are equipped to deliver the services that are critical to customer success.\n\nTo help customers find a solution provider, Apple\u2019s partner discovery tool will feature a rundown of the partner, their capabilities as well as reviews and contact information. The goal, Apple said, is for customers to quickly find a partner with the right services and give the partner a place to present their organization\u2019s skills.\n\nApple also said it will introduce a partner gateway so partners can contact Apple directly and collaborate with their counterparts around business planning tools, sales and marketing collateral.\n\nApple said if there are any gaps, it plans to help partners upskill with additional technical and digital enablement, as well as data and insights infrastructure to support partner growth.\n\nApple\u2019s installed base across all devices reached a record high last quarter with 2.3 billion products deployed worldwide, it announced during its first quarter 2025 earnings call Jan. 30.\n\nApple\u2019s PC lineup generated $8.9 billion in sales, growing 16 percent. The company\u2019s installed base of Macs also reached an all-time high, and it saw double-digit growth in upgrades and new customers. In the U.S., customer satisfaction was 94 percent, the company reported.\n\n\u201cThis incredible performance was broad-based with double-digit growth in every geographic segment,\u201d said Kevan Parekh, Apple\u2019s senior vice president and CFO, on the company\u2019s earnings call Jan. 30. \u201cWith our latest advances in Apple silicon, and our fastest Neural Engine ever customers are able to take advantage of the full capabilities of AI and Mac.\u201d\n\n[RELATED: Lenovo, HP And Dell Are Betting Big On A PC Refresh In 2025 (So Is The Channel)]\n\nReyna Thompson, president of North America for TD Synnex, said the distributor is looking forward to engaging with Apple around the new program.\n\n\u201cAs a longtime Apple partner, we\u2019re excited about the new Apple Partner Network,\u201d Thompson said in a prepared statement. \u201cWe believe this program, supported by our creative financing, deployment support, and trade-in services, will empower partners to drive growth and enhance capabilities to deliver exceptional value.\u201d\n\nApple accounted for 12 percent or about $7 billion of TD Synnex\u2019s total $58.5 billion sales in 2024.\n\nSuresh Reddy, CEO of Brilyant, an Irving, Texas-based global systems integrator and value-added reseller, said in a prepared statement that no vendor has supported his organization's growth as much as Apple.\n\n\"As a global systems integrator that started in 2014, we consider ourselves a young technology company that has made some big strides in a short period,\u201d Reddy said. \u201cNo other partner has influenced and supported us as much as Apple. Apple programs have been instrumental in shaping our best practices and powering our global expansion. Apple continues to support us with industry-leading programs aligned with our business needs today and creating opportunities for growth as we evolve.\"",

            "content": "Apple Gets Serious About Endurance Athletes\n\nKevin Mackinnon February 5, 2025\n\nA few years ago the PR folks at Apple reached out to me and wondered if I had any story ideas that might be pertinent to them. I did \u2013 I wanted to follow up on why the Apple Watch had suddenly become the go-to smartwatch for my wife and daughter. What was it that attracted them to the device, even though it didn\u2019t offer anywhere near the same features available on other watches?\n\nThe end result was a feature that outlined the training and safety capabilities available on the Apple Watch. The story began with an experience that highlighted the safety capabilities.\n\n\u201cDid you know that this watch would start talking to me?\u201d my wife asked after she had fallen during a hill workout in the trails \u2013 the watch registered the fall and asked her if she wanted it to reach out for help. That day one of the women who was running with my wife at the time went out and bought an Apple Watch for her elderly father \u2013 he steadfastly refused to wear any other alert device, but conceded to the watch.\n\nIn terms of training capabilities, even though it had limited battery life, the Apple Watch did a decent job of tracking distance and other data. It was more than enough for my not-so-data-driven wife. As long as she could track how far she went and for how long, she was happy. Her Garmin head unit provided all the power data she needed on the bike. The Apple Watch would keep track of her total meters in the pool, and a pace clock took care of the interval times. Add to that the smartwatch features that made it easy to sync life activities with her iPhone, and the stylish looks, and you had a watch she was happy to wear all day, including for her training.\n\nHere Comes the Ultra\n\nA trip with the new Ultra to the top of Mauna Kea in Hawaii.\n\nAbout a year later Apple announced some big changes to the Watch OS that, to me, signaled the company was getting a bit more serious about the training capabilities of the device. I called that out to my PR contact at the company. As is usual with Apple, I got no concrete info, but a few months later I got an invite to Cupertino. During that September\u2019s Apple Event, the Apple Watch Ultra was announced. My inclination had been right, but I was off in terms of the scale. The introduction of the Apple Watch Ultra signaled that Apple was getting very serious about those of us in the endurance training and racing world.\n\nSuddenly Apple was offering a rugged, sports-oriented watch that offered lots of battery life, extremely accurate GPS and HR data, and a lot more. There was a customizable \u201caction button\u201d that allowed you to easily take splits or do other functions to enhance your training, all while still providing all the smartwatch features we all like to have on our wrist.\n\nUntil the Ultra came along, doing a full-distance race using an Apple Watch to track your data wasn\u2019t remotely an option. In May, 2022, my wife won her age group at IRONMAN Lanzarote. I had to announce at the Challenge Championship in Samorin, Slovakia, the same day, so before I left her in Lanzarote (my daughter covered announcing duties for me and her husband served as my wife\u2019s race-day Sherpa) I gave her my Garmin Forerunner to wear on race day.\n\nShe either forgot or simply ignored me, and spent the last half of the bike and the entire run looking at a dead screen on her wrist. Fast forward to October, 2022, just a few weeks after I\u2019d been introduced to the Ultra, and I asked her if she wanted to give the Ultra a shot for the IRONMAN World Championship. My contacts at Apple gave me a hard time for encouraging my wife to try something new for such a big race, but she was happy to give it a shot. She had no problems figuring out how to use the Ultra on race day, and became the first IRONMAN World Champion to use Apple\u2019s latest watch. (The battery life exceeded all our expectations \u2013 there was lots of juice left after she finished!)\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled that so many people in your endurance world, people who love Apple, but simply haven\u2019t been able to wear an Apple Watch because it wouldn\u2019t have been able to accommodate them, they\u2019re not just going to be able to enjoy an endurance event, or an adventure,\u201d Jay Blahnik, Apple\u2019s Vice President of Fitness Technologies, said in an interview with me after my wife\u2019s big win in 2022. \u201cThe cool thing about Ultra is the same watch that can help you win a world championship is the same watch that can help you get to a meeting on time, or listen to music, or pay for the things you want to buy with Apple Pay or take an ECG for goodness sakes. I think that\u2019s what makes it so special, that Apple Watch is now more rugged than ever, for Apple Watch, but it\u2019s still quintessentially Apple Watch at its core, and does all the things that you would expect it to do during the day when you\u2019re not having an adventure or going to the depths of the sea or doing a long course triathlon.\u201d\n\nThe Ultra offered up the equivalent of an iPhone or MacBook Pro \u2013 a watch with a bigger screen, considerably longer battery life and the \u201caction\u201d button that allows for more options during training.\n\nA year later Apple updated the Ultra, taking things one step further with the addition of Bluetooth connectivity to power meters. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 extended the display while keeping the watch the same size, and provided up to 3,000 nits of brightness to make it even easier to track data in bright, sunny conditions. Battery life remained at the 36 hours (up to 72 hours in low power mode) the original Ultra enjoyed, despite the brighter screen and powerful S9 SiP chip that offered enough computing power to allow you to tap your fingers to activate different functions and provide on-device Siri processing.\n\nApple Watch Ultra 2 Stats\n\nCost: US$799/ C$1,099\n\nUS$799/ C$1,099 Material: Titanium Case\n\nTitanium Case Size and weight: 49 x 44 x 14.4 mm. 410 x 502 pixels. 61.4/ 61.8 g (natural/ black Ti)\n\n49 x 44 x 14.4 mm. 410 x 502 pixels. 61.4/ 61.8 g (natural/ black Ti) Hardware: 3 microphones, speaker, siren/ speaker, Digital Crown, customizable action button, side button, depth gauge/ water temperature sensor\n\n3 microphones, speaker, siren/ speaker, Digital Crown, customizable action button, side button, depth gauge/ water temperature sensor Controls: Action button, Digital Crown with haptic feedback, side button, double tap gesture, Siri with on-device processing\n\nAction button, Digital Crown with haptic feedback, side button, double tap gesture, Siri with on-device processing Chip: S9 SiP with 64-bit dual-core processor\n\nS9 SiP with 64-bit dual-core processor Sensors: Electrical heart sensor, third-generation optical heart sensor, temperature sensor, depth gauge, water temperature sensor, compass, always-on altimeter, high-g accelerometer, high dynamic range gyroscope, ambient light sensor\n\nElectrical heart sensor, third-generation optical heart sensor, temperature sensor, depth gauge, water temperature sensor, compass, always-on altimeter, high-g accelerometer, high dynamic range gyroscope, ambient light sensor Health tracking: Blood oxygen app, ECG app, cycle tracking app, heart rate app, high and low HR notifications, irregular rhythm notification, medications app, mindfulness app, noise app, sleep app, sleep apnea notification\n\nBlood oxygen app, ECG app, cycle tracking app, heart rate app, high and low HR notifications, irregular rhythm notification, medications app, mindfulness app, noise app, sleep app, sleep apnea notification Display: Always-On Retina OLED display, flat sapphire crystal display, up to 3,000 nits brightness, 326 pixels per inch, night mode\n\nAlways-On Retina OLED display, flat sapphire crystal display, up to 3,000 nits brightness, 326 pixels per inch, night mode Audio: Three microphone array, dual speakers, media playback\n\nThree microphone array, dual speakers, media playback Battery life: 36 hours (up to 72 hours in low power mode), fast-charge capable \u2013 up to 80% charge in one hour\n\nwatchOS 11\n\nIn terms of the OS, Apple kept upping the game to make its watches more functional for triathletes, adding Training Peaks functionality that enables athletes to load structured workouts to their watch. Last August Apple signalled they were adding even more fitness and health functionality to the watches with the watchOS 11.\n\nIncluded in the operating system update was a new training load feature and a new Vitals app so you could easily keep track of health stats. Just like other high-end training watches, the Training Load feature allows athletes to track just how hard they\u2019ve been working for a given period of time. That can help us \u201ctype-A love to overtrain\u201d types to know when to back things off a bit. The Workout App was also enhanced so that you can even load structured swim workouts (in addition to structured bike and run sessions) to the watch.\n\nThe Vitals App is another great way to monitor your training levels, offering a single view of your overnight stats including average heart rate, respiratory rate, wrist temperature, blood oxygen and sleep duration. (Thanks to a law suit in the US, devices sold after Jan. 18, 2024 don\u2019t support blood oxygen measurements, but that function is available in all other regions.)\n\nAll this was in addition to the numerous other features that draw people to the Apple Watch for other reasons \u2013 frequent travellers appreciate the new Translate App, you can save hike and walking routes to the Maps App and you can customize the watch face with a variety of Smart Stack offerings and personalized photos.\n\nApple Watch Series 10\n\nThere was no update to the Ultra 2 last year, but Apple really enhanced the training capabilities of the new Series 10. While it won\u2019t get you through an IRONMAN, the Series 10 will take care of pretty much anything else. For a lot less money you get a watch that provides pretty much all the functionality of the Ultra 2 (and, in some ways even more). My wife has been testing the Series 10 out for a few months now and is more than happy.\n\nPart of that is because the new Series 10 is the thinnest watch Apple has ever made, but it\u2019s also got the largest and most advanced display the company has come up with, too. For someone with a tiny wrist, the Series 10 feels a bit better than the Ultra. It\u2019s also lighter \u2013 for both the aluminum or titanium versions \u2013 than both the Ultra and the Series 9. The OLED display is easier to see from an angle, which is something you\u2019ll appreciate when you\u2019re making a quick glance down at the watch to track your effort. The speakers are also considerably better on the new Series 10. (Sure, you\u2019re not likely to listen to music through those speakers, but in a pinch they do pretty well for a call, especially since the watch offers improved voice isolation.\n\nYou get all the functionality the new watchOS11 has to offer, too. What you don\u2019t get is the battery life of the Ultra 2, or the action button on the left side of the watch, which can be a game changer for some. The Series 10 is rated for 18 hours of daily use, but it does charge very quickly. Thirty minutes will get you up to 80% battery life.\n\nOne thing we\u2019ve noticed during my wife\u2019s testing is the new chip offers improved accuracy in some instances \u2013 where the Ultra 2 will miss some of my distance during kicking sets in the water, the Series 10 has been bang on with swim distances. Our guess is that\u2019s a function of the faster chip in the newer watch.\n\nFor serious, long-distance triathletes, though, the Series 10 probably won\u2019t be an option because of the battery life. If you\u2019re racing a full-distance event, you\u2019re going to need a second watch to race with, so this likely isn\u2019t the watch for you. If you\u2019re not gearing up for something that long, though, the Series 10 is a more than viable option.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 Stats\n\nCost: US$399/ C$549\n\nMaterial: Aluminum (Jet Black, Rose Gold, Silver), Titanium (Slate, Gold, Natural)\n\nSize and weight: 46 x 39 x 9.7 mm, 36.4 g (Al), 41.7 g (Ti); 42 x 36 x 9.7 mm, 30 g (Al), 34.4 (Ti)\n\nHardware: Digital Crown, microphone with voice isolation, electrical heart sensor, speaker/ air vent, blood oxygen sensor and optical heart sensor\n\nControls: Digital Crown with haptic feedback, side button, double tap gesture, Siri with on-device processing\n\nDigital Crown with haptic feedback, side button, double tap gesture, Siri with on-device processing Chip: S10 SiP with 64-bit dual-core processor\n\nS10 SiP with 64-bit dual-core processor Sensors: Electrical heart sensor, third-generation optical heart sensor, temperature sensor, compass, always-on altimeter, high-g accelerometer, high dynamic range gyroscope, ambient light sensor, depth gauge, water temperature sensor\n\nElectrical heart sensor, third-generation optical heart sensor, temperature sensor, compass, always-on altimeter, high-g accelerometer, high dynamic range gyroscope, ambient light sensor, depth gauge, water temperature sensor Health tracking: Blood oxygen app, ECG app, cycle tracking app, heart rate app, high and low HR notifications, irregular rhythm notification, medications app, mindfulness app, noise app, sleep app, sleep apnea notification\n\nBlood oxygen app, ECG app, cycle tracking app, heart rate app, high and low HR notifications, irregular rhythm notification, medications app, mindfulness app, noise app, sleep app, sleep apnea notification Display: Always-On Retina wide-angle OLED display, Ion-X front glass (aluminum case), sapphire crystal (titanium case), up to 2,000 nits brightness, 326 pixels per inch\n\nAlways-On Retina wide-angle OLED display, Ion-X front glass (aluminum case), sapphire crystal (titanium case), up to 2,000 nits brightness, 326 pixels per inch Audio: Speaker, media playback\n\nSpeaker, media playback Battery life: 18 hours (up to 36 hours in low power mode), fast-charge capable \u2013 up to 80% charge in 30 mins\n\n10 Years of Apple Watch\n\nThe first Apple Watches were very much smartwatches, with very little to offer on the fitness tracking front. By the time Apple got to 10 years worth of Apple Watch development, though, things had very much moved on from fashion and smartwatch capabilities. Health capabilities have steadily expanded, and over the last few iterations of the watch, the fitness capabilities have dramatically expanded.\n\nIs the Apple Watch Ultra or Series 10 the best training watch on the market? I wouldn\u2019t want to even attempt to make that argument. Battery life alone makes that a tough call. The Garmin Fenix 7 I reviewed a few years ago literally got me through a seven-day training camp and my coverage of the Marathon des Sables in the Moroccan desert with weeks of battery life remaining. There are lots of GPS training watches from Wahoo, Garmin, Coros, Suunto and Polar available that offer excellent training functionality with decent smartwatch functionality.\n\nFor those who use an iPhone and really want all the functionality of a smartwatch that will pair with their Apple devices, the Ultra or the Series 10 do a pretty impressive job. Add to that the impressive health tracking capabilities the watches now provide, and you have a very nice set up. The Apple Watches won\u2019t get you through most ultramarathons or an Ultraman triathlon event, but for those of us who aren\u2019t racing that far, they more than get the job done.\n\nTags:",

For this pundit, the mighty tech titan still has plenty of prosperity in store -- and I agree.\n\nA bull stays the course\n\nA day after Apple unveiled those figures, Evercore ISI's Amit Daryanani reiterated his bullish view on the company's future. He maintained both his outperform recommendation (buy, in other words) and $260 per-share price target on the tech mainstay.\n\nApple's quarter was essentially in line with the expectations of analysts like Daryanani. Given the company's tendency for encouraging growth despite its size and its always lofty profit margins, that's a satisfying development. While revenue from products inched only 1% higher on a year-over-year basis during the period (to just under $98 billion), services revenue blasted 14% higher, hitting more than $26 billion.\n\nAccording to reports, Daryanani was encouraged by Apple's potential for offsetting weakened demand in China, a once-juicy market coping with slowing economic growth. He feels that emerging markets will be one of these \"offsets,\" as Apple's share in those countries is still relatively low. He's also bullish about sales of the budget model iPhone SE, which might be better than the company expects, and the potential for continued growth in services.\n\nSo will this investor\n\nAs an Apple shareholder, I'm concerned about that China dynamic and not entirely convinced sales in underserved regions and/or iPhone SEs will combine to drive product revenue notably higher. I think services is an indisputable bright spot, however, and Apple has many levers it can pull to keep the growth engine running in this category. I agree with this analyst; Apple continues to be a clear buy.",

            "content": "While the new Apple Invites app and service sounds easy to use, it joins together so many Apple Services that it takes several steps \u2014 and can confuse your invitees. Here's how to use it.\n\nApple Invites has been launched, though at time of writing it's still not rolled out worldwide. If an App Store search does not turn it up for you, try this direct link.\n\nThe app is so new that there is no Apple support documentation for it, which means there are certain points that are not yet clear. Specifically, it's not sure what Android users will or will not see when they have accepted an invitation from Apple Invites.\n\nApple Invites is a free iPhone app, but as the organizer of an event, you have to have a paid iCloud+ subscription in order to use it. Your invitees do not, and they do not have to have an Apple Account, so Android users should be able to sign up to your event.\n\nWhether your invitees are iPhone or Android though, what they see can be confusing. Ultimately, you are sending them a link, via Messages or email, and they get that plus a poster image \u2014 if you have chosen one.\n\nYou really must include some explanatory text, not least because of what happens next. When they tap on the link or the poster in Messages, they are taken to icloud.com in Safari and \u2014 if they are iPhone users \u2014 they are prompted to sign in.\n\nThere is a small X to close that sign in pane, but they'll have to look for it. It would be much better if Apple presented a bespoke sign-in making it clear that this is optional.\n\nAs well as using the standard iCloud sign-in form, Apple is also using the standard prompt for getting an app. So at the top of the screen you see an app you might not want, and in the middle you see a sign-in screen that you may be suspicious of.\n\nApple could also just point out that if you scroll down the webpage, you get the option to join the party with an email address instead of using the app. But then it should know the email address the invitation was sent to, so it's not clear why it doesn't just populate that email field so that you can simply tap yes or no.\n\nSetting up is easy for the organizer\n\nThat all said, creating an event itself, prior to sending out the invitation, is straightforward \u2014 if at times slow. To create your first-ever event:\n\nOpen Apple Invites Tap Create Event Optionally pick a photo of yours, choose from suggested backgrounds, or skip Add Background Type in the event title Enter the date and time Enter the location Write a description of up to 1,000 characters Optionally create a shared photo album for the event Optionally create a shared Apple Music playlist Tap Preview at top right to see how the invitation will look to your recipients Tap Next Choose how to invite people, and whether to accept them all or approve each one\n\nThere's good and bad in these steps. The best is perhaps the date and location picking, because those are well done.\n\nLocation is via an Apple Maps style search field. And with date, you get options to include an end time as well as a start.\n\nCreating a shared photo album is straightforward too, but the shared Apple Music one requires an extra step \u2014 and can prove to be slow.\n\nL-R starting to set up a new event\n\nYou can't share a playlist unless you have an Apple Music Profile. You may think you have one, since you're an Apple Music subscriber but no, this is different.\n\nAn Apple Music Profile tells people that you're up for sharing some or all of your playlists, and that for some unfathomable reason you're interested in theirs. To set up this profile:\n\nOpen Apple Music on iPhone Tap your icon (possibly just your initials) at top right on the Apple Music Home screen Choose Set up Profile Fill out a username Tap Continue to Find Contacts Click Follow if you want to follow a friend's playlists, then Next Choose whether you can be followed by Everyone or only People You Approve and tap Next Pick which, if any, of your playlists you're happy to share and tap Done\n\nIf you're not already regretting that you wanted a shared playlist for your event, you may do now. Because in AppleInsider testing, Apple Music hung at this point and had to be force quit.\n\nIgnoring that and going back to Apple Invites, you are next prompted to decide \"How do you want to share contacts?\" \u2014 and this is again not clear.\n\nThe reasoning is that people you invite to an event may need to contact each other, but Apple will never give out any private details. You have to make that decision, you have to decide what you want to do \u2014 and it appears that you cannot choose that you don't want to share anything.\n\nIt appears that you have to choose between allowing your invitees to see selected contacts that you will specify in a next step, or all of your contacts. In practice, Apple does only allow these two options at this point, but after you've decided on just Select Contacts, you can skip in fact adding any.\n\nOptionally and slowly adding Apple Music before sending an invitation\n\nYou don't appear to be able to say that you will only share, say, email addresses, and keep phone numbers or photos private.\n\nFinally sending the invitation\n\nAfter you've gone through fathoming out how happy you are to share people's contact details, you finally get a Choose a Guest option. Here there are two sorts of guests, either someone you allowed in the contact-sharing stage, or New Guest.\n\nIf you now tap on the name of the contact you previously allowed, you're now given the ability to send them a unique invitation link. You can send it via Messages, Mail, or copy the link to send around any other way you like.\n\nDepending on your choice, you now have to pick which phone number to text, or which email address to send to if the recipient has more than one.\n\nThe Message or email is shown to you as solely a link, specifically an iCloud link. You can enter some explanatory text, and you should.\n\nAfter the invitation is sent\n\nOnce you've done all of this and sent the invitation, and once the recipient has figured out that you haven't sent them a spam link, they can elect to join your little group. They can tap a Going, Not Going, or Maybe button, and be reminded of how Facebook does it the same way.\n\nWhen they have made their choice, you are notified as the event organizer.\n\nThis is where the real benefit of Apple Invites will come. You could always have sent out invitations by Messages yourself, but managing the replies would have been hard.\n\nApple Invites lets you see at a glance who has said they're coming. They may still not turn up, you know what people are like, but at least you will have an idea of numbers.\n\nAnd any of those people who are coming will, at least if they are iPhone users with the Apple Invites app, be able to contribute photos and music to the party.\n\nA mish-mash of services\n\nSo far in setting up a first event, Apple Invites has leveraged Apple Maps, Apple Music, Photos, Contacts, and Messages and/or Mail. Much of this has required entering or confirming permissions, turning a simple procedure into a chore.\n\nBut then there is one more Apple service that can optionally be used \u2014 and it's the one solitary service you would think would be automatic.\n\nCalendar.\n\nYou go through this whole process and nothing at all ends up in your Calendar, or at least not automatically. You're not even prompted to add the event to your Calendar as you're making or editing it.\n\nInstead, you have to choose to go find and tap the Calendar icon at top right of the invitation to create an event.\n\nAnd of course the first thing it does is ask permission for Apple Invites to access the calendar.\n\nAll of this does take far less time to do than to describe, and overall it is a clever way of benefitting from there being so many Apple services. But each step does feel like a barrier, when you're setting up your first event.\n\nThe second and subsequent events get to skip certain steps. For some reason, there isn't the same confusing going through of contacts to share, for instance.\n\nInstead, you get the option to create a general link you send to anyone, or you can choose a specific guest.\n\nExcept by default, that specific guest can only be one you allowed contact details to be shared for. Tap on Choose a Guest and you are offered their name or names, and a Settings button for you to add more.\n\nSo Apple Invites definitely looks good, it does definitely offer a good service in how it manages RSVPs. But there are enough rough edges that maybe it should have gone through in-house user testing as was expected.",

            "content": "Apple (AAPL -0.11%) started 2025 on a downbeat note as shares of the technology giant headed south for most of January, but the fiscal 2025 first-quarter results it released on Jan. 30 could help turn its fortunes around.\n\nFor the period, which ended Dec. 28, 2024, Apple's revenue increased 4% year over year, while its earnings exceeded analysts' expectations with a 10% jump. Apple delivered those improvements despite a 1% decline in revenue from sales of iPhones. More importantly, the tech giant's outlook and management's comments regarding the adoption of its artificial intelligence-enabled devices point toward a better year.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the key takeaways from the company's latest report and consider if its catalysts are solid enough to push the stock higher over the next three years.\n\nThe rollout of Apple Intelligence could drive stronger sales growth\n\nApple Intelligence, the company's suite of artificial intelligence (AI) features for iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks, was announced in June last year. However, the rollout of Apple Intelligence has been gradual. Also, those features are only supported on newer devices such as iPhone 15 Pro models, the latest iPhone 16 models, iPads running A17 Pro or M1 chips and later, and MacBooks with M1 chips and later.\n\nThe company will continue to roll out Apple Intelligence features throughout the year in different languages. What's more, Apple is reportedly planning to make Siri more conversational with the help of large language models (LLMs). The good part for investors is that the rollout of AI features is having a positive impact on Apple's sales. Responding to an analyst's query on the latest earnings conference call, CEO Tim Cook remarked:\n\nWe did see that the markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those where Apple Intelligence was not available.\n\nIt is worth noting that revenue from both iPads and MacBooks increased 15% year over year. That can be attributed to the wider availability of Apple Intelligence features across these devices. A similar scenario could unfold in iPhones as well once Apple Intelligence is more widely available across the company's flagship product line.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives is forecasting a multiyear iPhone upgrade cycle thanks to AI. He estimates that there are around 300 million iPhones in use that are more than four years old. Their users will have a reason to upgrade once Apple Intelligence is available in their region, or the company makes more enticing features available for its new models.\n\nThis is probably the reason why the company's revenue guidance for the current quarter is consistent with the growth it delivered in the just-concluded quarter (which coincided with the traditionally strong holiday season). CFO Kevan Parekh is expecting revenue to increase in the \"low- to mid-single digits year over year\" in fiscal Q2. However, he adds that \"the year-over-year growth rate would be comparable to that of the December quarter\" if the negative impact of foreign exchange headwinds is discounted.\n\nThe guidance is better than expectations, suggesting that the company could be on its way to reporting stronger growth this year as its AI rollout gains momentum. Additionally, investors shouldn't forget that Apple is among the leading vendors in the smartphone and personal computer (PC) markets, both of which are expected to get a nice lift from generative AI.\n\nApple was the top player in the global smartphone market last year with a share of 18.7%, according to IDC. Meanwhile, the company occupied fourth place in PCs with a market share of 8.7%. Counterpoint Research estimates the shipments of generative AI smartphones will quadruple by 2027. Meanwhile, sales of generative AI-capable PCs are expected to more than triple between 2024 and 2027.\n\nAs such, Apple could be at the beginning of a nice growth curve for the next three years, and that could lead to healthy gains for its stock price.\n\nStronger earnings growth could send the stock higher\n\nAnalysts are expecting Apple's earnings to increase by 9% in the current fiscal year. However, they are forecasting accelerations in Apple's bottom-line growth for the next couple of years.\n\nIf Apple's earnings indeed hit $9.17 per share in fiscal 2027 and it trades at 33.5 times earnings at that time, in line with the current ratio for the Nasdaq-100 (using that tech-heavy index as a proxy for tech stocks), its stock price would be $307 -- a jump of 30% from current levels. Apple, however, is currently trading at about 37 times earnings.\n\nIt may be able to keep commanding a premium valuation if its growth accelerates thanks to AI. Also, the tech giant could move to directly monetize its AI services, which could drive even stronger earnings growth and result in a stronger upside for shareholders.",

But now it's 2025, and despite being only a few weeks into the new year, things are changing and changing rapidly.\n\nTariffs and trade wars\n\nThe biggest elephant in the room right now is tariffs. While the trade war between the US, Canada, and Mexico has been put on hiatus (keeping in mind that Canada ranks fourth in Apple markets by revenue share, behind the United States, Japan, and China), it is ongoing with China.\n\nAlso: Is this the end of multi-year AppleCare+ plans? What's replacing them and why\n\nWhen asked about any potential tariff impacts during the earnings call a few days ago, Apple CEO Tim Cook had this to say: \"We are monitoring the situation and don't have anything more to add than that.\"\n\nIt's unclear what effect this will have on prices (both overall and specific to Apple), but since the smart money is betting, costs are unlikely to fall, given the uncertainty. If you're planning Apple purchases, it might be better to do them now rather than later.\n\nFuture Apple product launches (near and far)\n\nNew iPhone SE\n\nPlenty of rumors suggested that the iPhone SE 4 would land last year. Now, it's supposedly just around the corner, and it's expected to end Touch ID and finalize the Face ID rollout to the iPhone line. It's also expected to be powered by the A18 chip and, obviously, support Apple Intelligence.\n\nAlso: Is this the new iPhone SE? Leaked images reveal major changes coming in 2025\n\nWith iPhone sales accounting for half of Apple's record revenue during the last quarter, keeping the iPhone line strong will be a priority for the company, especially if uncertainties dent consumer confidence.\n\nAirTag update\n\nThe new AirTags are expected to use a new Ultra Wideband chip, bringing improved range and accuracy, and apparently, the speaker is going to be more difficult to disable, a countermeasure to prevent tags from being used to stalk people. Given how trivial it is to modify AirTags, and how you can even buy them already modified, this will be a welcomed change.\n\nHypertension Detection for Apple Watch\n\nThe Apple Watch can already do a lot, uncovering hidden medical conditions such as atrial fibrillation and sleep apnea. Adding the ability to detect high blood pressure would reinforce its place as a personal, wrist-mounted physician.\n\nAlso: Your next Apple Watch or smart ring could have a feature that transforms healthcare\n\nNow let's look at Apple tech that you might want to wait on.\n\nThe 'Naughty' list\n\nGive these Apple devices a hard pass:\n\nThe standard iPad : With the iPad Pro, Air, and Mini all being quite fresh, it's easy to forget the old-school iPad.

I'd hold out and see what Apple has planned.\n\nThe 'Nice' list\n\n1. Apple iMac\n\n2024 iMac Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET\n\nThe iMac got a refresh to bring it up to speed with Apple Intelligence. With specs ranging from 8 CPU and GPU cores, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage priced at $1,299, all the way up to 10 CPU and GPU cores, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $1,899, there's an iMac to suit most workloads and budgets.\n\n2. Apple Mac Mini\n\nJason Hiner/ZDNET\n\nApple smallest Mac got an upgrade to the M4 and M4 Pro processors. And it's also the cheapest Mac you can buy, as a Mac Mini with the 10-Core CPU and GPU model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage costing only $599.\n\n3. Apple iPad Mini\n\n2024 iPad Mini Prakhar Khanna/ZDNET\n\nThe all-new 2024 iPad Mini replaced the three-year-old model with one powered by an A17 Pro chip that's Apple Intelligence ready, and comes in a range of colors (blue, purple, starlight, and space grey) and storage capacities (128GB, 256GB, and 512GB) to suit everyone. Prices range from $499 to $799.\n\n4. Apple iPhone 16\n\niPhone 16 Kerry Wan/ZDNET\n\nFrom a Camera Control button, an Action button, and the new A18 chipset, the iPhone 16 has been built from the ground up to handle AI workloads.\n\n5. Apple Watch Series 10\n\nApple Watch Series 10 Kerry Wan/ZDNET\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 starts at $399 for GPS and $499 for cellular. It comes in three colors: jet black, rose gold, and silver aluminum. The new black Apple Watch Ultra 2 starts at $799.\n\n6. Apple M4 MacBook Pro\n\nApple MacBook Pro M4 Kerry Wan/ZDNET\n\nNeed a Mac that combines portability with power? You need a MacBook Pro.\n\nAlso: Is your iPhone rebooting after being inactive? It's a feature, not a bug\n\nBut it's less a case of how fast a laptop you need and more a case of how much do you want to spend. With prices for the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro starting at $1,599, and the 16-inch version starting at $900 more (and going all the way up to a whopping $7,349 for the 40-core, 128GB RAM, 8TB storage behemoth) these systems represent some serious processing power, but power that comes at a price.\n\n7. 2nd-gen AirPods Pro (now with USB-C)\n\n\n\nJada Jones/ZDNET\n\nThe AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) offers a major upgrade over the previous model, giving Apple's premium buds a massive lead over the competition. Apple has now refreshed the charging case to use USB-C rather than Lightning -- great if you have a new iPhone, but yet another cable or dongle to carry if not. Here are the highlights:\n\nActive Noise Cancellation reduces unwanted background noise.\n\nAdaptive Transparency lets outside sounds in while reducing loud environmental noise.\n\nPersonalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking places the sound all around you.\n\nMultiple ear tips are included (XS, S, M, L).\n\nTouch control lets you swipe to adjust volume, press to direct media playback, answer or end calls, and press and hold to switch between listening modes.\n\nSweat- and water-resistant for AirPods Pro and charging case.\n\nMagSafe Charging Case has a speaker and a lanyard loop.\n\nUSB-C charging.\n\nAlso: Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) review: Two major upgrades, tamed by one familiar flaw\n\nAnd now with the release of iOS 18.1, your AirPods Pro earbuds can function as clinical-grade hearing aids, bringing better hearing to tens of millions of people, and disrupting the lucrative hearing aids market.\n\n8. Apple AirTag\n\n\n\nKayla Solino/ZDNET\n\nApple's AirTags are the perfect gift for someone who constantly loses things. You can add them to your luggage, attach them to your bike, your remote, or even your moving boxes -- the possibilities are endless.\n\nAlso: How to find out if an AirTag is tracking you\n\nWell-made, robust, and with a replaceable battery, these will make misplaced keys or lost wallet things of the past.\n\nFAQs What is Apple Intelligence? Apple Intelligence -- technology that leverages the processing power of Apple silicon to understand and generate language, providing personalized assistance and insights -- has been driving the latest wave of Apple hardware upgrades, with the new iMac and new Mac Mini joining the new iPad Mini, the iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Pro being promoted as the hardware to buy if you want access to Apple's vision for AI. Older hardware offers access to some of the features, but the experience will be somewhat patchy. What's happening with Vision Pro? It's been a year since the release of the Vision Pro, and it's not been the success that Apple -- and many pundits -- expected it to be. While the hardware itself has benefitted from numerous software updates, sales have been lackluster. After all, it doesn't matter how high-tech and sci-fi something is; a three-and-a-half thousand dollar price tag is an impossible barrier for most. Apple has allegedly discontinued production of Vision Pro headsets because they're piling up and not selling. That's not a great sign for the product's future. Apple is still selling them, but it's now hard to recommend someone spend thousands of dollars on a product that is on the ropes. Also: Apple Vision Pro's killer feature is finally here - and made my $3,500 investment more worth it This is in addition to the rumors suggesting that a cheaper unit -- with a more modest $2,000 price tag -- would land towards the end of this year, but indications now suggest this has been pushed back to 2027. But the Vision Pro rumors don't end there. There are whispers that suggest the Vision Pro will be superseded by the Vision Pro 2, a new headset -- sorry, Apple calls it a spatial computer -- powered by the M4 chip and Apple Intelligence support.

            "content": "Credit: Lifehacker\n\nOn Tuesday, Apple announced Apple Invites, a new app for iPhones that creates custom event invitations \"for any occasion.\" If that sounds a lot like popular party planning apps like Partiful, that's because, well, it is\u2014only, this app integrates with the greater iOS experience, which is likely bad news for third-party competitors.\n\nThis isn't a surprise to anyone follow Apple rumors closely. As reported by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple has been working on an invite system for iOS, internally referred to as \"Confetti.\" It wasn't clear whether those plans would manifest as a standalone app, or rather as options built-into existing apps like Calendar and iMessage. Of course, we now know it's the latter.\n\nIf you've used an event-planning app before, Apple Invites is probably going to be straightforward. When you start an event, you have a series of customizable options: You can add a custom background for the event, similar to iOS's wallpaper selector (although, here, Apple is pushing Apple Intelligence to generate the background images); give the event a name; and set a date, time, and location for your event. These are pretty standard features for an app like this.\n\nWhat gives Apple Invites an interesting spin is the Apple-centric features. You can create a shared album for this event, so that all partygoers can add the pictures and videos they took in one centralized location\u2014eliminating the need for someone to coordinated a shared album with all the guests during or after the fact. In addition, you can create a shared playlist for the party, if you trust your guests to add their music to your event.\n\nWhen your invitation is finished, you have your choice in how to send it out. You can simply send out a public link to the invite via any channel you wish, or you can send invites to a specific list of guests. You can choose whether you want to approve each guests' RSVP, or whether you're happy to automatically add anyone to the guest list who says they're going, as well as whether invitees are allowed additional guests\u2014from plus ones all the way to plus fives. There's a lot of control here, but there is a catch: You need to be subscribed to iCloud+. If you pay for extra iCloud storage, you're already subscribed, but otherwise, you won't be able to create invitations.\n\nYou don't need iCloud+ to RSVP, though. Anyone can accept or reject an event invitation from Apple Invites through the site\u2014no iCloud or Apple Account needed.\n\nWhile I don't care for the AI-generated backgrounds, I do like the overall presentation here. Built-in shared albums and playlists are what's really selling it to me, though, and I imagine they're going to appeal to a lot of party-planning people. Whether that's enough to overtake popular options like Partiful, we'll have to wait and see.\n\nYou can try Apple Invites right now, either from the App Store or from icloud.com/invites.",

Google named Partiful its \"best app\" of 2024.\n\nThere's also a multimedia element to Apple Invites thanks to the integration of Apple Music and Shared Albums for attendees to collaborate on.\n\nApple's latest app could also help drive its recurring revenue, as a subscription to iCloud+ is required to unlock the full feature set. While subscribers can create events on the platform, those who don't pay for iCloud+ can only RSVP \u2014 not host their own parties. Non-iPhone owners can still RSVP to Apple Invites.\n\nApple Invites launched on Tuesday. Apple\n\nApple's iCloud+ plans start at $0.99 a month and go up to $59. Apple's Services category, which includes subscriptions, has been a big talking point in earnings calls for the tech giant and has grown considerably under Tim Cook's tenure as CEO.\n\nApple's Services revenue most recently grew 14% year over year to reach a record $26.3 billion in the holiday quarter.",

            "content": "Something to know about me before reading this review is that I wear an Apple Watch daily for two main reasons: fitness tracking and wellness data. I am not a notification hound \u2014 I do not take calls or control my music from my Apple Watch (though it can handle both of those tasks easily).\n\nFor my specific needs, the Apple Watch has always felt a little disjointed. It can track loads of useful health, sleep and fitness data. But something that has always made me apprehensive is that, outside of running stats, I\u2019ve never truly felt empowered by all that data \u2014 what am I supposed to do with the fact that my sleeping respiratory rate is between 13 and 26 breaths per minute?\n\nUsing the Apple Watch Series 10 for over two months, all that data is now presented in a more holistic way thanks to some key new features. New software plus key hardware upgrades like faster charging make this Apple Watch the most compelling yet \u2014 the Series 10 may have even convinced me to consistently wear my Apple Watch to bed.\n\nSKIP AHEAD How I tried the Apple Watch Series 10 | My experience with the Apple Watch Series 10 | Who is the Apple Watch Series 10 for? | Why trust NBC Select?\n\nWant more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\n\nWhat is the Apple Watch Series 10\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 ($399.00) is the latest version of the brand\u2019s signature smartwatch. While it may look extremely similar to last year\u2019s Apple Watch Series 9, it has a new design that is thinner and lighter than before.\n\nExternally, most of the changes are to the screen. It\u2019s bigger, reaching further into the edges of the case, giving you more screen real estate than prior models. It\u2019s brighter when viewed at off-angles, making it easier to check the time or a notification without having to look at the watch head-on. And on new watch faces, the second-hand ticks even in low-power mode when the watch is facing away from you \u2014 just like a regular watch would.\n\nInternally, charging is much faster \u2014 the Series 10 can get up to 80% battery in 30 minutes of fast charging, up from 45 minutes on the Series 9. It also has new swim sensors like a depth gauge up to six meters and a water temperature sensor.\n\nMost of the other changes come from the latest WatchOS 11 software, which you\u2019ll find below. (WatchOS 11 is available for most Apple Watches released in the last five years, including older models like the Apple Watch Series 6 and Apple Watch SE (2nd generation).)\n\nThe Series 10 comes in 42 millimeter and 46 millimeter sizes in an aluminum or titanium case, with dozens of watch band options to choose from.\n\nDisplay: 42mm, 46mm touchscreen | Battery life: up to 18 hours with always-on display | Built-in GPS: yes | Sleep tracking: yes | Heart-rate monitor: yes, with EKG | Water resistance: yes, up to 50 meters | Compatible with: iPhone\n\nHow I tried the Apple Watch Series 10\n\nFor the first week, I compared the comfort and feel of the Series 10 (center) to other Apple Watch models like the Apple Watch SE (left) and Apple Watch Ultra 2 (right). Courtesy of Harry Rabinowitz\n\nI tested the Apple Watch Series 10 for over two months after the brand sent a sample for review.\n\nI wore it almost all the time to get the most workout, health and sleep data possible, charging it every morning before getting ready for the day. For the first week, I compared the fit and feel of the Series 10 to the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch SE by alternating between the three watches for exercise, sleep and daily wear.\n\nMy experience with the Apple Watch Series 10\n\nThe Apple Watch 10 has a few notable but subtle upgrades compared to the Series 9, which has made it my favorite model yet. The improved screen, faster charging and new software features like Vitals and training load make it feel more comfortable to use as a holistic wellness tracker.\n\nWhat I like\n\nEasier to see from all angles\n\nWhen I need to glance at the time or a notification, I am doing just that: glancing. The Series 10\u2019s new wide-angle OLED display makes it easier to glimpse at my watch and see what I need to see, without having to turn the whole thing towards me.\n\nThe new display is subtle on its own, but noticeable when you compare it to older displays on other models like the Apple Watch SE and Apple Watch Ultra 2.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to capture, but the Apple Watch Series 10 (left) is noticeably brighter than the Apple Watch Ultra 2 (right) when viewed at odd angles. Courtesy of Harry Rabinowitz\n\nImproved fitness tracking with training load\n\nFitness tracking is the main reason I wear an Apple Watch \u2014 it is a great running companion with accurate live distance, pace and heart rate tracking. But it has lacked more holistic training features like recovery time and training load, features that have convinced friends of mine to buy a Garmin watch instead.\n\nWatchOS 11 brings some much needed improvements to fitness tracking, namely training load. At the end of every workout, you can rate your effort on a scale of one to 10 (the Watch will try to guess an effort rating for you, which you can adjust to your liking). All of your workouts and effort scores are combined into a 7-day load and 28-day load.\n\nThe 7-day training load is the colorful dotted line while the 28-day training load is the smaller white line. Recent workouts are listed below. Courtesy of Harry Rabinowitz\n\nTraining load is informative and motivating, in my experience. Logging my effort for each workout let me better remember which day or how recently I had challenged myself, and helped me plan accordingly. Seeing a visual approximation of my workout activity also acted as a motivator \u2014 seeing my dotted 7-day load line go down motivated me to do a workout to bring it back up.\n\nLiving in New York City, I do find that logging each and every one of my walks pushes my training load up. Which is funny, because I don\u2019t consider my random miles of walking to work, lunch or the grocery store \u201cworking out.\u201d But I could always stop logging outdoor walks to omit them from my training load, if I wanted to.\n\nUnrelated to training load: you can now pause activity rings, finally. Having my Apple Watch encourage me to close my activity rings and keep my streak alive while I am sick in bed always felt like a low blow.\n\nImproved sleep tracking with Vitals\n\nA similarly-visual improvement to health tracking is the new Vitals app, which shows you your overnight heart rate, respiratory rate, wrist temperature and sleep duration. The watch also tells you whether any of these metrics were outside of your typical range.\n\nI got the flu over the course of testing, and both the Oura Ring 4 ($349) and the Apple Watch Series 10 notified me that my vitals (heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, sleep) were well-outside my normal levels. While I already knew this (I could tell I was sick), not everyone I know acknowledges illness as readily as I do \u2014 if an Apple Watch notification can convince them to take a sick day, I am all for it.\n\nYou can view the Vitals app directly on the Series 10 or through the Health app on your iPhone. Courtesy of Harry Rabinowitz\n\nPotential drawbacks to keep in mind\n\nCharging is fast, but battery life is limited\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 charges very quickly. But it does need to be charged often, daily for most users. Charging is relatively painless, but it is something you have to build a habit around because it is something you have to do daily. While testing other wearables like the Garmin Venu 3 ($449), Garmin Forerunner 165 ($249) or FitBit Charge 6 ($159), I did not have to think or build habits around charging because battery life lasted days or weeks, not hours.\n\nTo be fair, the Series 10\u2019s most direct competitors, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 ($299) and Google Pixel Watch 3 ($349), don\u2019t have weeks of battery life either, but both are a little better than the Series 10, in my experience. Do I dream of an Apple Watch with 10 days of battery life? Absolutely. Will that ever happen? Maybe, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it will be anytime soon.\n\nSome features are opt-in or hard to find\n\nApple doesn\u2019t typically force changes on its users as it adds new software features \u2014 the brand seems to prefer to add new features quietly, then let users discover them for themselves. This makes updates feel seamless, but does lead to occasional friction. For example, I had to manually turn on both Vitals and training load on the Apple Watch Series 10. Training load in particular is a few menus deep in the Fitness app \u2014 I now have a training load card added to the front of the Fitness app, but I am not sure tech-averse users will find this easy to set up without clear directions.\n\nWho is the Apple Watch Series 10 for?\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 is an incremental but noticeable quality of life upgrade from last year\u2019s model. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth rushing to purchase if you already own an Apple Watch Series 9 or Series 8. But for anyone with an older model, or anyone looking to get their very first Apple Watch, it is an easy to use yet robust smartwatch that can track and visualize a ton of fitness and health metrics, and can be as simple or as complex as you make it.\n\nWhy trust NBC Select?\n\nI am a reporter at NBC Select who covers technology and fitness including recent stories on smartwatches, running shoes, workout earbuds and more. For this piece, I wore the Apple Watch Series 10 daily for over two months after the brand sent me one to try. I tracked my daily stats, sleep and exercise and compared the fit and feel of the Series 10 to other Apple Watch models.\n\nCatch up on NBC Select\u2019s in-depth coverage of tech and tools, wellness and more, and follow us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok to stay up to date.",

The whole idea here is to get a broad sense of sentiment\u2014the \u201cvibe in the room\u201d\u2014regarding the past year. (And by looking at previous survey results, we can even see how that sentiment has drifted over the course of an entire decade.)\n\nThis is the tenth year that I\u2019ve presented this survey to my hand-selected group. They were prompted with 14 different Apple-related subjects, and asked to rate them on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best) and optionally provide text commentary per category.\n\nAs is only fitting for the survery\u2019s tenth year, I\u2019ve made a few adjustments to the questions I asked:\n\nI\u2019ve grouped Apple Watch and the new Vision Pro category under the pre-existing Wearables category, and asked panelists to submit votes for all three (but only gave them a single box to write overall commentary about Apple\u2019s wearables efforts).\n\nand the new category under the pre-existing category, and asked panelists to submit votes for all three (but only gave them a single box to write overall commentary about Apple\u2019s wearables efforts). I\u2019ve broken the former Software quality category into two separate, connected categories: Apple OS quality and Apple app quality . I felt that the old category tended to cause OS releases to swamp anything else that Apple did during the year in the realm of the many apps it develops alongside its platforms.\n\nFinally, the old Environmental/Social impact category has been renamed World impact. In my mind, this category represents an opportunity to judge how Apple\u2019s deeds live up to its philosophical words about making the world a better place. Panelists are free to define it however they\u2019d like\u2026 and, believe me, they always do.\n\nI received 59 replies (a 75 percent response rate), with the average results as shown below:\n\nSince most of the survey categories are the same as in previous years, I was able to track the change in my panel\u2019s consensus opinion. The net changes between 2023 and 2024 are displayed below:\n\nRead on for category-by-category grades, trends, and select commentary from the panelists. (You can also read the entirety of panelist commentary\u2014all 32,000 words\u2014if you like.)\n\nMac\n\nGrade: A- (average score: 4.2, median score 4, last year: 4.2)\n\nThe panel was very positive about the Mac, with many praising Apple\u2019s continued hardware advancements in the Apple Silicon era, nost notably the M4 chip and the redesigned Mac mini. The move to 16GB of RAM as the new baseline for entry-level models was widely welcomed. However, there are lingering concerns about the lack of updates for high-end machines like the Mac Studio and Mac Pro.\n\nM4 and more:\n\n\u201cThe M4 chip series is the best since the M1. The single-core performance and power efficiency are both great.\u201d \u2014 John Siracusa\n\n\u201cThe move to Apple silicon continues to pay dividends. Probably the smartest thing Apple\u2019s done in years.\u201d \u2014 Philip Michaels\n\n\u201cThe Mac lineup seemed to find a groove and stick to it in 2024.\u201d \u2014 Jeff Carlson\n\n\u201cThe M4 was a really nice continued advancement of the power behind the Mac line.\u201d \u2014 Myke Hurley\n\n\u201cI am borderline ecstatic regarding the new nano-texture display option on MacBook Pros.\u201d \u2014 John Gruber\n\nThe Mac mini:\n\n\u201cThe Mac mini got its long-deserved time in the sun with a nice update and chassis redesign.\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Mayo\n\n\u201cThe cheapest ticket to the Mac lineup is a perfect introduction to everything Apple does well.\u201d \u2014 Andy Ihnatko\n\n\u201cWho would have thought the Mac mini would be the lead in the excitement for 2024?\u201d \u2014 Allison Sheridan\n\n\u201cThe base model M4 Mac mini is one of the most compelling and best value Apple products we\u2019ve seen.\u201d \u2014 Christina Warren\n\nHigh-end Mac frustration:\n\n\u201cThe long wait for the Mac Studio with the latest Apple silicon continues to feel illogical.\u201d \u2014 Brian Mattucci\n\n\u201cThe uncertainty surrounding the \u2018big\u2019 desktop Macs and the chips that will power them continues to be a problem.\u201d \u2014 John Siracusa\n\n\u201cThe only hitch in the lineup: The Mac Studio and Mac Pro remain unchanged since 2023, when the M2 models debuted.\u201d \u2014 John Gruber\n\n\u201cThe Mac Studio and the Mac Pro are the unloved children.\u201d \u2014 Christina Warren\n\nApple Intelligence:\n\n\u201cOne wonders what Apple could have been doing instead of spending person-hours on AI stuff that doesn\u2019t seem particularly good or useful.\u201d \u2014 Jessica Dennis\n\n\u201cApple Intelligence might be a bust, but it forced Apple to finally give every Mac 16GB of RAM.\u201d \u2014 Christina Warren\n\n\u201cI have not found the Apple Intelligence features very useful.\u201d \u2014 Michael Tsai\n\n\u201cMacOS is in a point of confusion. The introduction of Apple Intelligence in waves and without tentpole features that solve problems is mystifying.\u201d \u2014 Glenn Fleishman\n\nGive the people RAM:\n\n\u201cGood riddance, 8GB RAM. You simply don\u2019t have enough memory to be missed.\u201d \u2014 Zac Hall\n\n\u201cCall it the Apple Intelligence Dividend, but I was happy to see the base RAM in Macs increase to 16GB this year.\u201d \u2014 John Siracusa\n\n\u201cApple finally acknowledges that perhaps 8GB of RAM isn\u2019t enough for users.\u201d \u2014 Michael Gartenberg\n\n\u201cEvery Mac sold by Apple now has a (long-overdue) baseline of 16 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage.\u201d \u2014 Nick Heer\n\nSomething may be missing:\n\n\u201cApple still insists on not making touchscreen Macs or more interesting and weird form factors.\u201d \u2014 Federico Viticci\n\n\u201cThe iMac is way overdue for a 27-inch model.\u201d \u2014 Glenn Fleishman\n\n\u201cWe need new external display options. It\u2019s time, Apple.\u201d \u2014 Chance Miller\n\n\u201cThe lack of an upgrade to the Studio Display is a bit surprising.\u201d \u2014 Kirk McElhearn\n\niPhone\n\nGrade: B (average score: 3.7, median score 4, last year: 4.1)\n\nFeelings about the iPhone lineup were mixed. Many panelists praised the incremental hardware improvements, but there was also disappointment in Apple Intelligence and the new Camera Control feature. The rolling down of previously higher-end features\u2014the Action Button to the lower-end iPhones, 5X zoom to the smaller iPhone Pro\u2014were well received. However, there were still complaints about the lack of a smaller phone option, lackluster color choices for Pro models, and software features that feel rushed or unfinished.\n\nApple Intelligence:\n\n\u201cThe software promises Apple is making around Apple Intelligence aren\u2019t compelling, and Apple didn\u2019t deliver on them in 2024.\u201d \u2014 Joe Rosensteel\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s focus on Apple Intelligence is disappointing, and sucked a lot of the air out of the room when it came to actual feature improvements.\u201d \u2014 Dan Moren\n\n\u201cMost of these features are as squirrelly as everybody should have expected; no more, no less.\u201d \u2014 Andy Ihnatko\n\n\u201c2024 was all about the slow trickle of Apple Intelligence features of uncertain value.\u201d \u2014 Brian Mattucci\n\n\u201cAI features that actually do something are far behind Google and Samsung.\u201d \u2014 Michael Gartenberg\n\nCamera Control:\n\n\u201cThe Camera Control is possibly the worst Apple UI device since the hockey puck mouse.\u201d \u2014 Dr. Drang\n\n\u201cThe sheer number of settings to change its behavior is laughable, and perhaps speaks to a need for Apple to give it a second look.\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Mayo\n\n\u201cI\u2019d actually pay more to get a 16 Pro that didn\u2019t have the Camera Control button, because it\u2019s turned into a button that I exclusively use on accident and never on purpose.\u201d \u2014 Matt Birchler\n\n\u201cThe button itself is fine, but third-party case makers accommodated it by cutting a huge hole in the side of their cases, which I find awkward and uncomfortable.\u201d \u2014 John Siracusa\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too finicky and often doesn\u2019t do what you expect it to do.\u201d \u2014 Jeff Carlson\n\n\u201cI tried really hard to use the Camera Control to its full potential\u2026 the reality is it\u2019s most useful as a way to launch the Camera app and take a picture. Nothing more.\u201d \u2014 Chance Miller\n\niPhone size:\n\n\u201cI field non-stop complaints from people who want a smaller iPhone and aren\u2019t upgrading from the iPhone SE because of that.\u201d \u2014 Adam Engst\n\n\u201cI miss the iPhone Mini\u2026 so much.\u201d \u2014 Jessica Dennis\n\n\u201cI do wish Apple would have continued the mini for folks who prefer something smaller.\u201d \u2014 David Sparks\n\nA lack of color:\n\n\u201cApple, it won\u2019t take away from the other Pro models to have fun colors. Offer the boring ones of today, as well as some fun ones\u2026 PLEASE!\u201d \u2014 Casey Liss\n\n\u201cI love the colors on this year\u2019s standard iPhones, but I continue to hope for some better options on the Pro side.\u201d \u2014 Eric Slivka\n\nThe incrementality of iPhone updates:\n\n\u201cThis iPhone 16 lineup doesn\u2019t seem to be much of an improvement over previous models.\u201d \u2014 Adam Engst\n\n\u201cPhones are becoming commodities, and Apple Intelligence ain\u2019t it right now.\u201d \u2014 Philip Michaels\n\n\u201cThis is one of those years where the new iPhones seem fine, but I feel no urgency to upgrade.\u201d \u2014 Michael Tsai\n\niPad\n\nGrade: B- (average score: 3.5, median score 2, last year: 2.4)\n\nAfter a completely quiet year in 2023, the iPad came roaring back with major updates in 2024, and our panel responded favorably. The M4 iPad Pro was praised for its thin design, OLED display, and performance. The iPad Air\u2019s solid update was also praised. But many panelists remain disappointed about iPadOS, which limits the potential of the excellent hardware. Several panelists raised complaints about a confusingly complex iPad lineup.\n\nGive a little, take a little:\n\n\u201cApple finally updated the iPad lineup, and it has all of the strengths and weaknesses it has always had: great hardware with amazing computational power that\u2019s almost impossible to utilize because of software limitations.\u201d \u2014 Marco Arment\n\n\u201cThe iPad\u2019s frustrations are eternal: the hardware is fantastic. The software feels increasingly left behind, limited, and at times downright clunky.\u201d \u2014 Dan Moren\n\n\u201cGoing into its 15th year, the iPad continues to be incredible hardware let down by a lackluster operating system that is neither as intuitive as iOS nor as advanced or flexible as macOS.\u201d \u2014 Federico Viticci\n\nThe M4 iPad Pro:\n\n\u201cThe M4 iPad Pro is a marvel.\u201d \u2014 Rich Mogull\n\n\u201cThe thinness and compactness of the design is remarkable, and it leaves a lasting impression.\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Mayo\n\n\u201cThe M4 is a great iPad chip, but the highlight of the year for me was the Tandem OLED display on the new iPad Pro.\u201d \u2014 John Siracusa\n\n\u201cAn even thinner design and optional nanotexture define this generation for me.\u201d \u2014 Zac Hall\n\n\u201cI use the 11-inch as my main device at home and I love everything about it. The OLED screen is fantastic, and it is so incredibly thin and light \u2013 it\u2019s a joy to use.\u201d \u2014 Myke Hurley\n\nCompexity of the product lineup:\n\n\u201cThe fact that Apple\u2019s iPad keyboard page has a huge dropdown for a user to pick which iPad they have so the website can show them compatible models is not great.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Hackett\n\n\u201cI still find the iPad-and-accessories lineup confusing, but it is in much better shape this year than last.\u201d \u2014 Nick Heer\n\n\u201cI am not surprised that Regular People suffer from Apple Pencil confusion \u2014 even I had to go back and check which one(s) would work with my new iPad.\u201d \u2014 Jessica Dennis\n\nOther iPad updates:\n\n\u201cThe iPad Air got a modest improvement going to M2 and remains a solid choice.\u201d \u2014 Allison Sheridan\n\n\u201cThe new iPad Mini is\u2026 well\u2026 maybe next time.\u201d \u2014 Rich Mogull\n\n\u201cI bought the new iPad Mini, and I like that it\u2019s purple.\u201d \u2014 Jessica Dennis\n\n\u201cThe Mini was my iPad of choice for many years, but for me, it\u2019s been squeezed out by the combination of my phone getting ever-larger and the incredible utility the Magic Keyboard brings to my iPad Pro.\u201d \u2014 Casey Liss\n\niPadOS limitations:\n\n\u201cI still want to run macOS on an iPad.\u201d \u2014 Craig Hockenberry\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably time they let us run macOS or at the very least virtualize it.\u201d \u2014 Dan Moren\n\n\u201cThe fact that after all these years the iPad is still using the exact same foundations as iOS, including its multitasking model, is just baffling.\u201d \u2014 Gui Rambo\n\n\u201cIf they want to sell more devices, they\u2019re going to have to make the iPad more useful.\u201d \u2014 Shahid Kamal Ahmad\n\n\u201cThe promise of iPad\u2019s modularity still doesn\u2019t pay off.\u201d \u2014 Alex Cox\n\n\u201cIt seems like the rest of the world is not as excited as I am about the new iPad Pro. That may have something to do with the (continuing) limited and confusing nature of iPadOS.\u201d \u2014 John Siracusa\n\n\u201cWith iPadOS, Apple seems like it is just throwing ideas against the wall to see what sticks, and sadly, not much is sticking.\u201d \u2014 Eric Linder\n\nWearables, Apple Watch, and Vision Pro\n\nGrade: B (average score: 3.6, median score 4, last year: 3.5)\n\nApple Watch specifically: Grade: B (average score: 3.7, median score 3, last year: 3.4)\n\nVision Pro specifically: Grade: D (average score: 2.4, median score 3)\n\nIt was a pretty notable year for Apple\u2019s wearables, with major AirPods updates, Apple Watch improvements, and the arrival of the Vision Pro. The new hearing aid features for AirPods Pro 2 were widely celebrated as one of Apple\u2019s most impactful innovations. The Apple Watch Series 10 and Ultra 2 updates were seen as incremental, with some frustration over the lack of significant redesigns. However, the Apple Vision Pro dominated the conversation, with reactions split between awe at its technological advancements and disappointment over its price, usability, and lack of compelling software.\n\nHearing aid features:\n\n\u201cThe AirPods Pro 2\u2019s Hearing Aid feature is probably the biggest announcement in all of Apple\u2019s wearables lines this year.\u201d \u2014 Dan Moren\n\n\u201cThe hearing features added to AirPods Pro 2 are a huge game-changer in my world.\u201d \u2014 Dave Hamilton\n\n\u201cThe addition of medical-grade hearing aid functionality to the AirPods Pro is Apple at its best.\u201d \u2014 Casey Liss\n\n\u201cUsing AirPods as a way to take a hearing test or have your hearing augmented means millions of people who didn\u2019t even know they had hearing loss will enjoy more moments with their loved ones in conversation.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Hackett\n\nApple Watch:\n\n\u201cApple Watch remains good. There isn\u2019t much in the way of new features that I\u2019m excited about, but it remains good.\u201d \u2014 Lex Friedman\n\n\u201cI feel like this was a miss year for the Apple Watch from a hardware perspective \u2013 thinner is great, but I want to see more design change!\u201d \u2014 Myke Hurley\n\n\u201cApple Watch is turning more into a fitness tracker that happens to show the time, and away from serving as a proper watch.\u201d \u2014 John Gruber\n\n\u201cThe Apple Watch Ultra is getting really close to being a true sports watch, but once you hit that category, Garmin still wins out.\u201d \u2014 Rich Mogull\n\nNew AirPods 4 and \u201cnew\u201d AirPods Max:\n\n\u201cAirPods 4 with ANC are a terrific update.\u201d \u2014 John Gruber\n\n\u201cThe new AirPods 4 are great for those of us who don\u2019t want our headphones to be shoved into our ear canals.\u201d \u2014 John Siracusa\n\n\u201cI regret to inform the world that I bought the USB-C AirPods Max. No one else should do the same.\u201d \u2014 Christina Warren\n\n\u201cAirPods Max simply adopting USB-C and some new colors with no other changes is so sad that it\u2019s hilarious.\u201d \u2014 Eric Slivka\n\nVision Pro:\n\n\u201cThe Vision Pro is an incredible feat of engineering. Just holding the thing feels nice, and the years of work that went into it shows. The high price of the device has surely limited its adoption from both the user and developer perspectives.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Hackett\n\n\u201cApple Vision Pro was the most disappointing launch I\u2019ve seen from Apple in recent memory.\u201d \u2014 Marco Arment\n\n\u201cThe Vision Pro is a fantastically impressive technological achievement that no normal person should actually buy.\u201d \u2014 James Thomson\n\n\u201cI think it requires a lot of a person to understand how to wear AVP comfortably, and people simply aren\u2019t used to it.\u201d \u2014 Brian Mattucci\n\n\u201cThe Vision Pro has been a calamity. What it needed was content, and what it also needed was app support. Apple hasn\u2019t done the first and alienated developers so badly in other areas that it didn\u2019t get the second.\u201d \u2014 Charles Arthur\n\n\u201cUntil there\u2019s developer access to more APIs and more accessibility to dev kits, I don\u2019t think there will be anything interesting made for AVP.\u201d \u2014 Alex Cox\n\n\u201cThe lack of apps, let alone a killer app, outside of watching movies alone, is an indictment of Apple\u2019s developer relations problems as much as it is an indictment of the AVP itself.\u201d \u2014 Christina Warren\n\n\u201cAt best, the Vision Pro seems like a first step on a long journey. It will require many years of dedication, and perhaps some significant pivots, to turn this platform into a success.\u201d \u2014 John Siracusa\n\n\u201cThe Vision Pro deserves better than its current reputation as a pundit punching bag. While everyone\u2019s busy dunking on Apple\u2019s spatial computing experiment, I\u2019m regularly strapping it on and using it for work and entertainment.\u201d \u2014 David Sparks\n\n\u201cAm I predicting that the Vision platform will have as bright and essential a future ahead of it as the Macintosh did in 1984? No. But I suspect it has a bright and essential future ahead of it.\u201d \u2014 John Gruber\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad they released the Vision Pro, but it still feels like a solution to a problem that doesn\u2019t exist (for most people).\u201d \u2014 Aleen Simms\n\nHome\n\nGrade: D+ (average score: 2.7, median score 3, last year: 2.8)\n\nApple\u2019s smart home strategy in 2024 continued to frustrate our panelists, with many complaining that HomeKit remains unreliable, the Home app is unintuitive, and Apple has largely neglected the space. There were some minor improvements, such as improved integration with Control Center and some Matter enhancements. There\u2019s some hope that 2025 may be a banner year for Apple in the smart home, but for now, the platform feels stagnant.\n\nHome app frustration:\n\n\u201cThe Home app is ugly. Home app integrations in Control Center are useful but inflexible.\u201d \u2014 Lex Friedman\n\n\u201cMake the Home app better. It\u2019s still awful.\u201d \u2014 Shelly Brisbin\n\n\u201cThe Home app is a dreadful piece of software. I\u2019m fairly technical, but still find it confusing, and the layout and home screen design is just abysmal.\u201d \u2014 Rob Griffiths\n\n\u201cScenes vs. Automations continue to break my brain. \u2018One of your devices didn\u2019t respond\u2019 is a message that could use a slight improvement; WHICH ONE???\u201d \u2014 Allison Sheridan\n\nHomeKit:\n\n\u201cHomeKit is unreliable, and doesn\u2019t work with enough devices.\u201d \u2014 Casey Liss\n\n\u201cI have experienced many bugs with Home. Even after I switched to the new home architecture, the tvOS 18.0 beta broke which Apple TVs could be used as a home hub for a few months.\u201d \u2014 Joe Rosensteel\n\n\u201cHomeKit continues to mostly work, but the promised world of Matter has still not materialized, the HomePod remains a buggy mess, and it\u2019s hard to see any signs of effort on either front.\u201d \u2014 Marco Arment\n\n\u201cDoes Apple have a Home strategy? Does it really Matter?\u201d \u2014 Peter Cohen\n\nA feeling of drift:\n\n\u201cDid anything happen in 2024?\u201d \u2014 Adam Engst\n\n\u201cApple kinda skipped this year as far as the smart home is concerned.\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Mayo\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t name one improvement to HomeKit or anything Home-related in 2024, and this is a platform sorely in need of many improvements.\u201d \u2014 John Gruber\n\n\u201c2025 is sounding like it might be the year of the home for Apple, so 2024 didn\u2019t see very much.\u201d \u2014 Eric Slivka\n\nDoes Matter matter?:\n\n\u201cMatter seems to be a total nothingburger.\u201d \u2014 Casey Liss\n\n\u201cI expected a bigger upgrade to the Home app and HomeKit ecosystem in 2024 with the continued rollout of Matter. That didn\u2019t happen.\u201d \u2014 Chance Miller\n\n\u201cLast year, everyone was stoked to tell me they had added Matter support to their various widgets. This year, it was mentioned as an afterthought.\u201d \u2014 Dave Hamilton\n\n\u201cI was pleased to find that Matter all \u2018just worked,\u2019 though the automation options are a bit limited, and I still don\u2019t like the Home app.\u201d \u2014 Michael Tsai\n\nSiri and HomePod:\n\n\u201cSiri continues to be a boat anchor weighing down the HomePod and other HomeKit accessories.\u201d \u2014 John Siracusa\n\n\u201cMy HomePod continues to not work well for Siri or music.\u201d \u2014 Michael Tsai\n\n\u201cI like my new HomePods mini, but Siri still hampers their value.\u201d \u2014 Dr. Drang\n\n\u201cI was disappointed by the lack of any Apple Intelligence strategy for the HomePod.\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Mayo\n\nHope for the future:\n\n\u201cRumors are swirling about Apple entering new markets, with cameras, locks, and even smart screens a possibility for 2025 or later.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Hackett\n\n\u201cI\u2019m intrigued by the idea of Apple finally waking up and making a HomePod with a screen that could potentially serve as a flexible, interactive home hub.\u201d \u2014 Federico Viticci\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s Home efforts have been saved for me this year by the new Control Center actions I can add. Outside of that, I am not sure of anything else I could focus on. I have hopes for a 5/5 next year though\u2026\u201d \u2014 Myke Hurley\n\n\u201cIf Matter ever really arrives, which ecosystem a particular product supports will become a moot question.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Hackett\n\nApple TV\n\nGrade: C+ (average score: 3.2, median score 3, last year: 3.0)\n\n\n\n\n\nApple TV remains a solid, reliable streaming device, but 2024 was another year of minimal change, both in hardware and software. There remains considerable appreciation for the ad-free, privacy-focused experience\u2014especially compared to competitors. New features such as automatic subtitles and Enhance Dialogue also received praise. But the product remains much more expensive than the competition, and 2024 did little to change the overall perception that Apple TV is in maintenance mode rather than active development.\n\nStatic hardware, but still the best:\n\n\u201cNo new Apple TV hardware for the second year in a row, and only minor tvOS updates leave us wanting as we await the home revolution of 2025.\u201d \u2014 Eric Slivka\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see some new hardware here.\u201d \u2014 Paul Kafasis\n\n\u201cThe Apple TV box is laughably over-engineered for what it mainly does: stream content.\u201d \u2014 Steven Aquino\n\n\u201cThe hardware feels as uninspired as ever, but the Apple TV is still the best streaming set-top box out there.\u201d \u2014 Chance Miller\n\n\u201cHardware not updated since 2022, software feels like it barely changes each year, and yet still the best streaming device to buy.\u201d \u2014 James Thomson\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of the Apple TV. I\u2019m willing to pay a premium over other hardware to get an ad-free, upscale experience.\u201d \u2014 Paul Kafasis\n\n\u201cThere is not a single other privacy-preserving device for the streaming age. Not one.\u201d \u2014 Rich Mogull\n\n\u201cApple TV still doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s changed a whole lot, but I still swear by it because it\u2019s not the crapware that every other vendor creates.\u201d \u2014 Jeff Carlson\n\ntvOS feels stagnant:\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really had any noteworthy changes to tvOS in\u2026 years?\u201d \u2014 Casey Liss\n\n\u201cApple really isn\u2019t making any progress on tvOS.\u201d \u2014 Joe Rosensteel\n\n\u201cWhat exactly improved or changed in 2024? Anything?\u201d \u2014 John Gruber\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still holding my breath for tvOS to have its iOS 7 moment.\u201d \u2014 Steven Aquino\n\n\u201cAfter a few years of tvOS updates making the platform more annoying and more clearly an advertising platform, it was nice for tvOS not to move further down this road in 2024.\u201d \u2014 Matt Birchler\n\n\u201cI continue to be frustrated with the poor quality of many of the streaming video apps I use on Apple TV.\u201d \u2014 John Siracusa\n\n\u201cThe only thing I hate about Apple TV is how every damn service has its own weird user interface.\u201d \u2014 Craig Hockenberry\n\nSmall touches:\n\n\u201ctvOS 18 did include a handful of niceties, like automatic subtitles and a much better Enhance Dialogue algorithm.\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Mayo\n\n\u201cNothing much happened this year, though I like the new feature of automatically showing subtitles when you rewind a bit.\u201d \u2014 Michael Tsai\n\n\u201cI\u2019m giving it a 4 because of the new Snoopy screensavers.\u201d \u2014 Andy Ihnatko\n\nNot an Apple priority:\n\n\u201cApple obviously cares a lot about Apple TV+. It seems to care a lot less about tvOS and the Apple TV hardware.\u201d \u2014 Christina Warren\n\n\u201cApple TV continues to be a product in Apple\u2019s lineup.\u201d \u2014 Marco Arment\n\n\u201cIt feels like Apple TV has not only gone back to being a hobby but a hobby that you started, invested a lot of money in, and then got bored.\u201d \u2014 Michael Gartenberg\n\nServices\n\nGrade: B- (average score: 3.5, median score 3, last year: 3.3)\n\nPanelists praised Apple TV+ for its high-quality content, though its film lineup still lags behind its strong TV series. Apple Music saw improvements, but panelists felt frustration with the macOS Music app and Siri integration. The biggest recurring complaint remains iCloud storage, with Apple\u2019s 5GB free tier seen as inadequate and outdated. Apple\u2019s services ecosystem benefits from deep integration with its hardware, but few of its offerings are considered best in class, and many panelists felt people are paying more for convenience than for excellence.\n\nApple TV+:\n\n\u201cApple TV+ continues to stand out as the shining beacon of excellence in an otherwise neglected lineup of services.\u201d \u2014 Quinn Nelson\n\n\u201cTV+ is far from the biggest streaming service, but I\u2019d argue adamantly that it has by far the highest batting average for quality content.\u201d \u2014 John Gruber\n\n\u201cThere are always Apple TV+ shows on my favorites of the year, and this one was no different. Slow Horses, Bad Monkey. Great work.\u201d \u2014 Myke Hurley\n\n\u201cTV+ has been disappointing. Slow Horses is the standout series. Most else is indifferent and uninteresting.\u201d \u2014 Charles Arthur\n\niCloud storage:\n\n\u201cStill only 5GB free storage for iCloud, which means a lot of people don\u2019t back up their iPhones. This is unconscionable these days.\u201d \u2014 Kirk McElhearn\n\n\u201cWe. Still. Get. 5GB. Of. Storage. For. Free. On. iCloud.\u201d \u2014 Casey Liss\n\n\u201cI guess I should stop waiting for Apple to increase the free base storage amount.\u201d \u2014 Roman Loyola\n\n\u201cThe free iCloud tier should be genuinely useful for backing up a modern iPhone. And paid Plus tiers should now offer more storage than they do.\u201d \u2014 John Gruber\n\nApple Music:\n\n\u201cApple didn\u2019t make a big deal about the personalized \u2018New\u2019 tab in Apple Music, but it makes a big difference. The app feels a lot more vibrant and alive.\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Mayo\n\n\u201cThe Music app on macOS is in desperate need of some love.\u201d \u2014 John Siracusa\n\n\u201cSiri and Apple Music\u2019s default for \u2018play this song\u2019 to be the most recent release version in my library needs to be stopped.\u201d \u2014 Andrew Laurence\n\n\u201cApple Music is pretty good, but annoying issues with the app on all platforms wear me down. Any time music just doesn\u2019t play \u2014 without any sort of error messaging, naturally \u2014 I get just a bit more frustrated.\u201d \u2014 Casey Liss\n\nThe value of Apple\u2019s services:\n\n\u201cMy continued line about Apple Services is that they are not best in class in any area. But the ubiquity and the way they work with Apple products keeps me paying.\u201d \u2014 Christina Warren\n\n\u201cI know services are printing money for Apple, but the value-for-money for consumers is bad and getting worse. Every time I see a NEARLY FORTY DOLLAR bill for Apple One I die a little inside. Which means I\u2019m dying a little inside twelve times a year.\u201d \u2014 Casey Liss\n\n\u201cAs Apple\u2019s services business grows, it begins to do things that feel uncharacteristic but are increasingly commonplace. Partnering with Taboola is one example.\u201d \u2014 Nick Heer\n\n\u201cI understand how important services are to Apple and Wall Street. I simultaneously fear how much building services revenue now enters the equation for new products.\u201d \u2014 David Sparks\n\nOther services:\n\n\u201cApple Fitness+ continues to add new workouts and the interface improvements make it easier to get to your saved workouts.\u201d \u2014 Allison Sheridan\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found myself opening Apple News on a surprisingly regular basis. In particular, the election coverage in the Apple News app was top notch.\u201d \u2014 Chance Miller\n\n\u201cDevelopers can now confidently include iCloud syncing in their apps, making a seamless and delightful experience for users.\u201d \u2014 Allison Sheridan\n\n\u201cPasswords and Keychain sync are borderline disruptive.\u201d \u2014 Rich Mogull\n\nA sense of stagnation:\n\n\u201cMost of the services are somewhat stagnant, which is why we see all sorts of bundles that bring services into users\u2019 hands they wouldn\u2019t necessarily buy, like Apple News.\u201d \u2014 Michael Gartenberg\n\n\u201cMuch like the home category, I am struggling to think of anything notable Apple did in services this year.\u201d \u2014 Matt Birchler\n\n\u201cApple really needs to give some attention to the client apps for its \u2018lesser\u2019 services on its \u2018lesser\u2019 platforms.\u201d \u2014 John Siracusa\n\n\u201cBarely noticed any improvements, didn\u2019t notice any regressions.\u201d \u2014 Matt Deatherage\n\nHardware reliability\n\nGrade: A+ (average score: 4.6, median score 5, last year: 4.6)\n\nThe top-scoring category in our survey remained exceptionally strong, with very few complaints or major issues reported. Many panelists noted that they had no significant hardware problems, and some praised Apple\u2019s consistency in delivering high-quality devices year after year. The transition to Apple Silicon has continued to pay off for the Mac, with users appreciating the improved performance and durability compared to older Intel-based models. While a few minor concerns were raised, such as Touch ID inconsistencies and the non-replaceability of certain components, the general consensus is that Apple is in a \u201cgolden era of hardware reliability.\u201d\n\nSolid stuff:\n\n\u201cStellar year as far as reliability goes. I can\u2019t recall any scandal at all, which is perhaps a first.\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Mayo\n\n\u201cNo news remains great news in this category.\u201d \u2014 John Gruber\n\n\u201cAnother year without any major complaints in this category is a victory for everyone.\u201d \u2014 Chance Miller\n\n\u201cI was reminded of just how bad Apple\u2019s laptops were six years ago. Butterfly keyboards from hell. Chips that required loud fans to cool if they were in thin chassis. Performance that frankly peaked in 2015. The work Apple has done since 2020 or 2021 to re-earn trust is remarkable.\u201d \u2014 Christina Warren\n\n\u201cThe iPhone is made at a scale basically no other product in the world matches, and it still releases on time and at very high quality without fail.\u201d \u2014 Matt Birchler\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one area where Apple is leagues ahead of its competition, I think it\u2019s hardware manufacturing and overall experience.\u201d \u2014 Federico Viticci\n\n\u201cApple has long been a leader in hardware reliability. Now, with the company publishing repair guides and making parts available to end-users and small shops, users have more options than ever when something goes wrong.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Hackett\n\n\u201cWe live in a golden era of Apple hardware reliability that\u2019s so good that it\u2019s easily taken for granted. No other consumer-tech company executes at this level of hardware reliability.\u201d \u2014 Marco Arment\n\nApple\u2019s operating systems and apps\n\nOperating Systems specifically: Grade: B- (average score: 3.4, median score 4)\n\nApps specifically: Grade: B- (average score: 3.5, median score 4)\n\nWe\u2019ve split the Apple software category in two, allowing commentary about both Apple\u2019s apps and its operating systems. The arrival of Apple Intelligence was the banner topic in this category, with many panelists feeling it was overhyped, underdelivered, and introduced new problems while failing to justify the trade-offs. There were also some fears that Apple\u2019s software design is trending toward unnecessary complexity. Many users wish Apple would focus more on stability and polish rather than pushing new features annually.\n\nApple Intelligence:\n\n\u201cApple Intelligence has really hurt Apple\u2019s reputation, on both the oversell and the underdeliver sides.\u201d \u2014 Dr. Drang\n\n\u201cApple Intelligence to date not only doesn\u2019t live up to its potential, it doesn\u2019t live up to commercials Apple has aired.\u201d \u2014 Matt Deatherage\n\n\u201cApple lowered the bar for software quality in its race to ship Apple Intelligence features.\u201d \u2014 Chance Miller\n\n\u201cNever has Apple spent more time on features that seem important strategically but actually feel mostly like things people don\u2019t care about or won\u2019t use.\u201d \u2014 Dan Moren\n\nSlipping reliability:\n\n\u201cCan Apple get off the annual OS update cycle yet?\u201d \u2014 Paul Kafasis\n\n\u201cNew shiny continues to trump reliability. It\u2019s not awful, but it\u2019s not great.\u201d \u2014 Casey Liss\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s computers are lots of things but, ultimately, they are tools. I would like them to feel more confidence-inspiring.\u201d \u2014 Nick Heer\n\n\u201cThe software quality slide continues. The same old bugs are still there.\u201d \u2014 Michael Tsai\n\n\u201cPlease, Apple, take a year off from flooding us with new features and fix bugs across all the operating systems.\u201d \u2014 Kirk McElhearn\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a trend towards complexity in Apple software. The recent changes in Mail categorization made no sense to me\u2014and they were enabled by default!\u201d \u2014 Craig Hockenberry\n\n\u201cBoth [macOS and iOS] are just sort of \u2018meh.\u2019 Nothing earth-shattering, long-standing bugs remain, and the Mac continues its horrendous slide towards the iOS UI.\u201d \u2014 Rob Griffiths\n\n\u201cApple really needs to shift the balance between new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.\u201d \u2014 John Siracusa\n\n\u201cI have concerns and complaints about aspects of the direction Apple\u2019s software design is headed, but their software reliability has been very good for me.\u201d \u2014 John Gruber\n\n\u201cStuff mostly works. But nothing\u2019s perfect.\u201d \u2014 Michael E. Cohen\n\nSome welcomed new items:\n\n\u201cThe Sports app is entirely new this year, and I think it is a pretty novel approach to a sports scores interface.\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Mayo\n\n\u201cThe new icon tinting and Home Screen customization options in iOS 18 are great.\u201d \u2014 Chance Miller\n\n\u201cSafari is the true favorite child, with features added every cycle.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Hackett\n\nDeveloper relations\n\nGrade: D (average score: 2.4, median score 3, last year: 3.0)\n\nThe vibes are bad out there, folks. This is the lowest score this category has received since the very first year of the survey. Apple\u2019s aggressive responses to regulatory pressure, particularly in the EU, were widely criticized as hostile, manipulative, and profit-driven rather than user- or developer-focused. The rollout of third-party app stores and alternative payment options was seen as an exercise in \u201cmalicious compliance\u201d designed to discourage participation rather than actually foster openness. Additionally, Vision Pro\u2019s weak app ecosystem highlighted the declining trust developers have in Apple\u2019s new platforms.\n\nIt\u2019s not going well:\n\n\u201cApple is blowing it with developers. Full stop.\u201d \u2014 Craig Hockenberry\n\n\u201cDeveloper relations remain needlessly strained. Antagonistic positions and greedy policies from Apple\u2019s executives continue to burn developer goodwill.\u201d \u2014 Marco Arment\n\n\u201cApple is doing a lot of taking these days and not giving back to the developer community that has helped make its products thrive.\u201d \u2014 Craig Hockenberry\n\n\u201cIf Apple treated all of its customers the same way they treated developers, we\u2019d all still be waiting for cut, copy, and paste on the iPhone.\u201d \u2014 Andy Ihnatko\n\nResponding to regulation:\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s response to legislation is ridiculous. Using notarization as a way to stop apps from existing, the Core Technology Fee, and countless more dark spots.\u201d \u2014 Myke Hurley\n\n\u201cApple should compete on merit, not threats.\u201d \u2014 James Thomson\n\n\u201cThey know what\u2019s right, and they refuse to do it, because they want to protect every possible revenue source they have.\u201d \u2014 Paul Kafasis\n\n\u201cThe new App Store structures are designed by lawyers and accountants, not folks who create software.\u201d \u2014 Craig Hockenberry\n\n\u201cThey might be doing it by kicking and screaming, but the regulatory pressure is making the developer ecosystem better.\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Mayo\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s pushback to the DMA makes the company look petty and recalcitrant.\u201d \u2014 Dan Moren\n\n\u201cI have nothing constructive\u2014I just don\u2019t like watching friends getting fucked over for making things people love.\u201d \u2014 Alex Cox\n\n\u201cThe situation is largely unchanged, but stagnation is catching up to Apple. More of the same is making matters worse.\u201d \u2014 John Gruber\n\nVision Pro is a warning sign:\n\n\u201cVision Pro, even more than Apple Watch, shows that developers aren\u2019t just going to show up and build apps for Apple\u2019s new platforms anymore. And I can\u2019t blame them.\u201d \u2014 Christina Warren\n\n\u201cThe relative dearth of native app support for Vision Pro is a warning sign.\u201d \u2014 John Gruber\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think developers embraced Apple Vision Pro with open arms like Apple had anticipated they would.\u201d \u2014 Chance Miller\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been hilarious watching the Vision Pro App Store colossally fail. Apple is now reaping what it sows.\u201d \u2014 Casey Liss\n\nApp Store issues:\n\n\u201cThe App Store monopoly continues in most of the world, and, where it doesn\u2019t, Apple is still being an enormous prick.\u201d \u2014 Brent Simmons\n\n\u201cFrustrations with the App Store review process seem unresolved. More of the same is making matters worse.\u201d \u2014 John Gruber\n\n\u201cI wish Apple would focus more on reliability and less on changing features that we\u2019ve just gotten integrated into our workflows.\u201d \u2014 Dave Hamilton\n\nWorld impact\n\nGrade: C (average score: 3.1, median score 4, last year: 3.8)\n\nFormerly \u201cEnvironmental/Social,\u201d this category asks panelists to consider anything they deem appropriate about how Apple lives up to its stated high ideals. Those can include education and environmental initiatives, commitment to accessibility and diversity, treatment of Apple\u2019s workforce, and other political and policy stances. The results were complex and mixed\u2014as usual. Apple continues to lead in environmental sustainability, accessibility, and privacy, earning praise for carbon-neutral products and meaningful accessibility advancements. But Tim Cook\u2019s $1 million donation to the Trump inauguration sparked outrage and disappointment among some.

            "content": "The dulcet sounds of Bing Crosby\u2019s \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d could be heard around the city, but it wasn\u2019t to mark the approaching holiday season, it was the American code signaling the start of Operation Frequent Wind \u2014 the evacuation of Saigon.\n\nBeginning on April 29, 1975, Armed Forces Radio jarringly blasted the Christmas song throughout the bombarded city as increasingly panicked American and South Vietnamese clamored to reach the safety of the U.S. Embassy and its evacuating helicopters.\n\nFor two days helicopters landed on the embassy\u2019s roof every 10 minutes, moving more than 7,000 people out of Saigon, with the American UH-1 \u201cHuey\u201d helicopter becoming the iconic symbol of the American evacuation of Vietnam.\n\nNow, as the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon approaches, Apple TV+ has delivered a six-part series that offers up a personal, unparalleled look into the decades-long conflict.\n\nNarrated by actor Ethan Hawke, \u201cVietnam: The War That Changed America,\u201d pulls over 1,100 hours of archival footage that places the interviewees \u2014 journalists and soldiers alike \u2014 back into some of the war\u2019s most consequential events.\n\nMilitary Times spoke to Caroline Marsden, one of the producers of the series, who spoke candidly about the difficulties of taking on such an expansive project and the \u201cmoments where people, in the face of the awfulness of war, do these extraordinary things.\u201d\n\nVietnam represents a fracture in American society and politics, giving way to something new entirely. How much of a challenge was it to piece together such a splintered narrative?\n\nIt was difficult in the sense that you have 10 years, right? So, at that point, it was America\u2019s longest war, longest running war, and you have, for the first time \u2014 and last time, really \u2014 documentary crews and news crews given unparalleled access to go and film. It meant that for us we had an incredible amount of material to go through. So, in that sense it was difficult, but also what an amazing problem to have.\n\nAll that filming that went on also added to the feeling of, \u2018Well, what do we want to focus on, really?\u2019 But that became much clearer as soon as we started speaking with people. Most people were out there for a year for their tour of duty, so you could kind of, over the 10 years, just track this change in the war and the people who went through it.\n\nYou pulled over 1,100 hours of archival footage for this project. What was that like in juxtaposition to interviewing the men and women today?\n\nThat was amazing. How we approached it is that we\u2019d look at footage and see if we could find people in the archive, which is very difficult. But it was also very surreal because you have these scenes with people fighting, they\u2019re shooting over walls, someone shooting at them, and then they have microphones put in their face and they would say their name and that sort of thing. We could track them down sometimes.\n\nI remember in Episode Six, we have one of the Marines who was the last one at the embassy during the fall of Saigon, and we had footage, tons of footage, of the embassy. We were just showing him that, and he was like, \u2018Look, there\u2019s me!\u2019 We actually found him a few times, and he was very moved by it.\n\nThese are major things that happened to them, that they took part in. Seeing this footage was very moving for them. It was nice to be able to show that because you don\u2019t always know how people are going to react. We always said to them, \u2018We\u2019re going to show you something only if you want.\u2019 They always had the option not to look at it, because it can be triggering. But most of them, all of them, wanted to see it.\n\nSeveral bloody and bandaged soldiers ride on top of a tank used as a make-shift ambulance after the Battle of Hue in the Vietnam War, February 15, 1968. (John Olson/Getty Images)\n\nIn Episode Four, we interviewed a man called Bill Boyles, and he talked about how he was at university, right? And he\u2019s watching all the footage from Hu\u1ebf, and he sees exactly that \u2014 he says he sees this [American soldier] behind a wall shooting at the enemy and then someone puts a mic in his face, and he says something like \u2018I just want to go home and go to school.\u2019\n\nBoyles talks about watching that on his TV, and then deciding in that moment, \u2018Why should I be out of it? Why should I be allowed to be free of this when guys like him have to go and fight?\u2019 So, he decides that he too will go out and he will fight.\n\nWe were able to find in the archives that exact TV clip. It was exciting to have found exactly what he had watched on TV.\n\nYou anchor many of the episodes around iconic moments many Americans will know. Are there specific stories that have stuck with you personally?\n\nPeople are sort of more familiar with certain battles like Hamburger Hill, for example. But people won\u2019t necessarily know what it meant. Our approach to that was to make it personal. In Episode Four we have a nurse who was at Hamburger Hill.\n\nHer father fought in World War II, and she couldn\u2019t stand the protests happening on college campuses. She really felt that they were looking down on the boys that she grew up with who were being drafted and sent out to Vietnam, and that these college students were sort of shirking their duty. And she\u2019s so angry about it, she signs up.\n\nShe talks about going down to the draft board and saying, \u2018I\u2019m a nurse, and I want to go.\u2019 They couldn\u2019t sign her up fast enough. Initially she\u2019s thrilled to be out there but then she gets there and she\u2019s seeing injuries like she\u2019s never seen before. She talks about this slow change in her view of the war and how Hamburger Hill is happening around that time. You have all these hill battles and men are coming in with unbelievable life-changing injuries. They\u2019re sort of patching them up, sending them back out.\n\nAnd then she\u2019s sort of going, \u2018Well, what did you do? We took a hill, right?\u2019 Then a week later, a bunch of guys coming back in saying, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re fighting at this hill.\u2019 And she\u2019s going, \u2018But you already took that hill.\u2019\n\nAnd they\u2019re going, \u2018Well, we lost it.\u2019 And she\u2019s thinking, \u2018What is the point?\u2019 Young men are being injured. They will never be the same. Lots of them are dying. So, we tell the story from that time in the war through her personal perspective.\n\nFrom the beginning in the documentary you can see the shift between the men who are serving in 1965-66 to the end of the war. It\u2019s a very different perspective.\n\nExactly. In the first episode, we\u2019ve got [Col. (Ret.) Ramon] \u201cTony\u201d Nadal and he\u2019s fighting the North Vietnamese Army in what is almost a traditional battle, right? And then at the same time, we meet the Tunnel Rats, the guys who are discovering that there\u2019s a whole other guerrilla force in the South sympathetic to the communists in the North.\n\nThis is a whole new, different type of warfare, different battle strategies. You\u2019re hearing a first-person account of someone who\u2019s a bit like, \u2018Holy shit, I have to go in there.\u2019\n\nThere have been connections made between the fall of Saigon and the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. After interviewing and viewing extensive archival film, would you consider that accurate?\n\nI have yet to do a documentary about [Afghanistan], so I\u2019ll have to get back to you on that! But on its face, it does seem to have the same sort of similarly wild scenes.\n\nIn the series, journalist Hilary Brown talks about how all the journalists are taking bets on how quickly this [fall] will happen. And, wow, it happened very quickly.\n\nThere are these sorts of wild escapes at the last minute, but also the sort of extraordinary decisions that were made at that time. I think those are one of the things we focus on in the series, these small shards of light \u2014 moments where people, in the face of the awfulness of war, do these extraordinary things.\n\nI do think it\u2019s worth clinging on to those moments as examples of what we can do as human beings.\n\n\u201cVietnam: The War That Changed America\u201d is available to stream on Apple TV+.\n\nClaire Barrett is the Strategic Operations Editor for Sightline Media and a World War II researcher with an unparalleled affinity for Sir Winston Churchill and Michigan football.",

            "content": "Apple\u2019s Services is an increasingly important segment for the company, bringing in more and more revenue each year. It\u2019s a great alternative for growth for Apple that might help compensate for iPhone sale fluctuations, especially in certain markets.\n\nImproving Services should also be a key priority for Apple, as that\u2019s one way to keep iPhone buyers loyal to the company. I say that as a longtime iPhone user who keeps using Apple products for the various software products that come preloaded, and Services is a part of that.\n\nApple is reportedly about to release a new iCloud product this week, which is an important product of Services itself. Called Confetti unofficially, the new iCloud feature should be available in iOS 18.3 or later. Conetti will let you manage events and meetings in a hopefully way than what Calendar already offers in iCloud.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman mentioned Confetti in his Power On newsletter on Sunday.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nAs the festive code name implies, the service offers a new way to invite people to parties, functions, and meetings. For years, Apple has been seeking to revamp its calendar app \u2014 and this new initiative could be the beginning of a broader effort.\n\nThe Confetti release is tied to iOS 18.3, which started rolling out just last week. According to Gurman, Apple could release Confetti as soon as this week.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Conetti will come as a standalone app, but since Gurman says it\u2019ll be a new iCloud-based service, I\u2019d expect it to have its own iPhone app and Calendar integration. Also, let\u2019s not forget that Gurman isn\u2019t the only source indicating a Confetti iCloud feature is coming soon.\n\nAccording to a 9to5Mac report last month, Confetti is a new functionality the blog discovered in the code of iOS 18.3 beta releases. At the time, the unreleased app was called \u201cApple Invites.\u201d\n\nConfetti would integrate with iCloud and feature a web version on iCloud.com. But 9to5Mac also noted that it wasn\u2019t clear whether the feature would get a standalone app or be included in other services.\n\nEssentially, the app will show you a list of the people invited to that event and who has already confirmed their attendance. It\u2019s unclear whether Invites will actually be a standalone app or whether Apple has plans to integrate it with other parts of the system (such as a mini iMessage app). Presumably, the app will have a more fun interface than what the Calendar app currently provides for inviting someone to an event.\n\nI\u2019d expect the app to be deeply integrated with other Apple services to make managing invites to events much easier than what Calendar offers. We\u2019ll have to wait for Apple to explain how everything works.\n\nOnce the app is released, we might have to update our iPhones to an iOS 18.3.1 release that brings over the new app or download the Confetti app from the App Store. If Confetti will be integrated into Calendar, an iOS 18 update should enable the functionality.",

            "content": "The Apple Music app on macOS is plagued by issues like a messy UI, random song interruptions, erratic warnings, and AirPlay failures.\n\nThese issues don't seem to be an issue on the iPhone or iPad versions of Apple Music, which suggests Apple needs to put some serious work into bringing the Mac app up to scratch\n\nI'd rather see Apple work on the app and improve the service over time than jump ship to a rival like Spotify, which has its own issues.\n\nI stream Apple Music all day, every day on my Mac. In doing so, I\u2019ve become hyperaware of both the idiosyncracies and glaring issues that Apple needs to address.\n\nThe UI Is a Mess\n\nThe native macOS Apple Music app is, at best, unpredictable. I feel like I\u2019m constantly having to coax it into doing what I want, as the interface works against me. This is not the experience I have when I\u2019m using the service on my iPhone (even when interacting via CarPlay).\n\nAt the heart of the problem is a \u201ctwo libraries\u201d approach that feels like two sides of the app working against one another. You\u2019ve got your library or all the music you\u2019ve added to your collection, and the broader Apple Music library. Which one shows up when you click on an artist\u2019s name feels like rolling a dice.\n\nRecently Played and 1990s sections on the Apple Music Home screen.\n\nLet\u2019s say I pick an album recommended to me on the \u201cHome\u201d tab from a section titled \u201c1990s\u201d and, in order to see more releases from that artist, I click on the artist\u2019s name. I get taken to the wider Apple Music page, with all of the artist\u2019s available releases listed (which is exactly what I think should happen).\n\nArtist page for Tortoise on Apple Music.\n\nBut let\u2019s say I use the \u201cRecently Played\u201d section of the same \u201cHome\u201d tab to pick an album I listened to earlier in the day. I click on the artist\u2019s name to see more but this time I\u2019m taken to my own personal library. There are no new releases or playlists to choose from, only the albums I have already added.\n\nLibrary page for the artist Yin Yin on Apple Music for Mac.\n\nFrom here I have to click the \u201c\u2026\u201d ellipse button next to the artist name and choose \u201cShow in Apple Music\u201d to find things not in my library. This might sound trivial, but it\u2019s frustrating. On the iPhone, the exact same operation takes me to the main artist Apple Music catalog.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, this leads to me trying to \u201chead off\u201d this behavior by relying way too much on the right-click (Control+click) context menu. Even there, you have three options: Show in Apple Music, Show in Library, and Show in iTunes Store. It feels clumsy and unintuitive.\n\nMusic Spontaneously Goes Silent\n\nI\u2019ve been experiencing a weird bug where music randomly drops out and goes silent for a few years now, but it only happens on my Mac. The problem seems to be well documented with Reddit threads describing the issue that go back to 2022.\n\nThis can happen without warning in the middle of a track, but more likely happens when the track changes. It\u2019s not related to an external output, since it affects both AirPlay devices and my MacBook\u2019s internal speakers.\n\nMost frustrating of all, the track keeps playing. The playhead moves as if everything is working fine, which means you\u2019re \u201clistening\u201d to music you can\u2019t actually hear. This is particularly egregious with long tracks since you can miss a lot of the action while you\u2019re distracted.\n\nPlaying a long track by artist Bell Witch on Apple Music.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fix is surprisingly simple. I just click to move the play head to another part of the track, and the music will play again as if nothing is wrong. Though some reports point to this happening on iOS or when using CarPlay, for me it\u2019s an issue that\u2019s limited to the macOS client.\n\nRandom Errors Abound\n\nOn top of surprise silences, I also get a lot of pop-ups relating to music playing in other locations. This is perplexing, as I\u2019m the only one with access to my Apple Music subscription. Sometimes, I\u2019ll get a random pop-up while I\u2019m listening to music on my Mac, like this:\n\nRandom errors while listening to music on Apple Music.\n\nBut mostly, it\u2019s two or three pop-ups telling me that a song couldn\u2019t be played when I wake my Mac up in the morning. This occurs after I\u2019ve been listening to Apple Music in the gym or the car, while my MacBook is asleep with the lid closed.\n\nThis kind of software gore cheapens the experience of using a premium service. I\u2019ve even gotten into the habit of force-quitting the app to dismiss all of the pop-ups at once (because just quitting the app isn\u2019t enough, apparently).\n\nI Ended Up Building a Shortcut to Fix AirPlay\n\nApple Music is the only way you can play output audio from your Mac to multiple AirPlay devices (and your internal speakers) without paying for additional third-party software like Airfoil.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe feature is a marvel, allowing you to get a much fuller listening experience by playing music from the excellent speakers in a MacBook, iMac, or Apple-branded display as well as other HomePod or AirPlay-enabled speakers around the home. At least, it is when it works.\n\nQuitting the AirPlayXPCHelper process in Activity Monitor on macOS.\n\nThe failure rate of this feature is so high that I built a Shortcut that kills the AirPlayXPCHelper service responsible for it. I now run the Shortcut instinctively when I sit down and start working.\n\nI must say that things have been more stable since I upgraded to macOS 15.3 (the latest release at the time of writing), but my shortcut still sees regular use.\n\nWe Need a Better Apple Music App\n\nWhen Apple ditched iTunes for Mac in 2019 with the release of macOS Catalina, I was excited for what was to come. I thought we might get a brand-new app that showcased all the positive aspects of Apple Music.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, it feels like we\u2019ve just been left with iTunes Lite. Why Apple has let Apple Music linger on macOS for so long is puzzling. I can only assume that the platform doesn\u2019t drive enough people to subscribe to Apple Music in the first place. Even so, a bit of consistency wouldn\u2019t go amiss.\n\nAt this stage, I\u2019d download the iOS version of Apple Music and use that on my Mac if I could (since you can run iPhone and iPad apps on your Mac, natively). Of course, Apple doesn\u2019t allow that.\n\nThere are third-party Apple Music apps I could turn to, but I\u2019m not sure I trust Apple not to break these with updates to the back-end. I\u2019m also not in a rush to shell out for a premium app to fix a service I\u2019m already paying for each month.\n\nNo, I Won't Switch to Spotify\n\nBelieve it or not, I\u2019m quite happy with Apple Music overall. While music discovery is a bit lackluster, the library in general keeps me entertained. Lossless audio is nice to have, and I have no huge complaints about the experience on the iPhone.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nI use Apple Music perks like TuneIn Radio integration and the yearly Replay feature, and even the lyric integration has its uses. I really can\u2019t be bothered with the hassle of moving to a service like Spotify, which lacks features like versatile AirPlay casting and has its own UI headaches.\n\nI just want Apple Music to work properly on the Mac.",

As it turns out, Tim Cook & Co. may have the last laugh after all.\n\nThe implications of DeepSeek\n\nWhile there is still some controversy as to the amount of money DeepSeek actually spent on its model, whether it \"distilled\" its model from OpenAI's o1, or whether it has access to more GPUs than it lets on, the optimizations published as part of its research paper revealed real, novel ideas on how to lower the cost of training frontier models.\n\nThere are a few consequences investors can anticipate from this. First, look for those ideas to get incorporated into all the major AI competitors quickly. This will further lower the cost of AI models across the industry.\n\nSecond, DeepSeek is partially open-source, which means its weights and technology optimizations are publicly available to developers to use and augment. Of the American tech giants, only Meta Platforms' (META -1.62%) Llama models are also open-source.\n\nHaving a major American and Chinese company disclosing their model optimizations publicly should lead to more open-source evangelism, which could even further speed up the proficiency of large, open models.\n\nWhile OpenAI is still thought to have an overall technology lead, the time gap between it and its open-source competitors has closed to just a few months. For his part, Meta CEO Market Zuckerberg just said on last week's conference call with analysts he believes Meta's upcoming Llama 4 models will surpass OpenAI and lead the market this year.\n\nIncreased open-sourcing and further algorithm-based cost reductions should eventually lead to more commoditization. Commoditization means prices and margins for AI models should come down, benefiting the customers of those models at the expense of the builders.\n\nApple was prescient\n\nAs the AI races heated up over the past two years, basically all major technology companies dramatically increased their capital expenditures buying high-priced Nvidia (NVDA -4.05%) GPUs and data center infrastructure. But one major tech company with the deep pockets to participate in the spending spree chose not to do so: Apple.\n\nAll major tech companies grew their capital expenditures between 73% and 182% over the past three years, except for Amazon. But Amazon is a bit different, as it was coming off a major spending spree in its e-commerce infrastructure after the pandemic. So its data center spending for Amazon Web Services has probably climbed much more than its 9% overall growth.\n\nThat leaves Apple alone as having surprisingly decreased its capital expenditures over the past two years -- a sharp contrast to its rivals.\n\nIf a resource becomes commoditized and abundant, you would want to be a user of that resource, not a producer of it. This is why Apple's approach to focus on using AI for its core customers, all while eschewing the buildout of a massive Nvidia-based infrastructure, was smart.\n\nApple is still investing in AI\n\nThis is not to say Apple isn't investing in its own proprietary models. It is. And actually, its approach looks a lot like DeepSeek's in some ways.\n\nAt last June's Apple Intelligence event, Apple unveiled its own models, with two big caveats: One, each model was distilled and optimized for specific use cases on the iPhone or Mac. On its recent conference call with analysts, CEO Tim Cook highlighted some of the features most used on Apple devices since the rollout of Apple Intelligence last October.\n\n[Apple Intelligence users] can use Writing Tools to help find just the right words, create fun and unique images with Image Playground and Genmoji, handle daily tasks and seek out information with a more natural and conversational Siri, create movies of their memories with a simple prompt, and touch up their photos with Clean Up. We introduce visual intelligence with camera control to help users instantly learn about their surroundings.\n\nAside from focusing on specific Apple customer use cases rather than generalized large language models, Apple's approach also seemed prescient in other ways. Apple Intelligence's base model was built on an open-source framework called Apple's AXLearn. And since it's open-source, Apple also eschewed Nvidia chips and the proprietary CUDA software stack wherever it could, as Apple knew from the start it didn't want to get locked into Nvidia's expensive ecosystem.\n\nWhile the AI software framework Apple uses is open-source for its base model, Apple has a seemingly contradictory approach when it comes to data. Apple uses only licensed data, with publishers having the opportunity to opt out. Apple also scrapes the internet for publicly available data with its proprietary web crawler. The company turns proprietary again for post-training filtering algorithms and optimization, which are geared for specific tasks on Apple products.\n\nBy using open-source software that can run on non-Nvidia chips for the base model, including Apple's own proprietary data center chips, then using proprietary algorithms at the filtering and optimization level for known use cases, Apple can produce smaller yet highly useful models for specific tasks at a very reasonable cost.\n\nApple's discipline makes it a long-term winner\n\nFollowing Nvidia's decline after the DeepSeek news, Apple has actually regained the crown as the largest company in the world.\n\nDespite its being the biggest company in the world today, remember, Apple has never pioneered a new technology innovation on its own. It wasn't the first to invent the PC, portable music player, smartphone, or wireless headphones. What Apple did is take those inventions and then innovate on top of them, making them all especially intuitive and useful for users, while consistently optimizing for cost afterwards.\n\nThat discipline and lack of urgency to spend huge amounts on uncertain new inventions makes for a very derisked business model. Given that large language models are now set to become lower-cost and more accessible, Apple's discipline has showed why it was Warren Buffett's preferred technology stock over the past 10 years.",

But one of the styles is named \"Jackpot.\" Now one might know that I've owned a studio in Portland named \"Jackpot!\" since 1997. And I've recorded many well-known \"indie rock\" records there. It also appears our virtual \"Drummer\" Aiden plays \"indie rock beats.\"\n\nI'm totally pissed off. I've spent my life serving the musicians of the Northwest and beyond with an affordable studio and great results. If a mega-huge corporation like APPLE Inc. wishes to create virtual drum beats for people to use, they can start thinking about making up their own names or licensing names that they think may give them a cachet. If my studio was named \"Abbey Road\" I can guarantee you that APPLE would never try and steal that name for their own products. Once again, I'm pissed. APPLE is using a name that they think sounds \"cool\" with no regard to what it may imply.\n\nI dropped my lawyer a line. It looks like no matter what, it would just cost me money to get them to cease and desist. It's certainly doubtful they would ever make reparations on this. It's bad enough that the tech sector has opened the gateway to hell and has destroyed independent labels, record stores and the like. Now they're happy to steal the \"idea\" of your hard work and your identity and sell it to the world. Your whole life can be sold off like some \"cool\" commodity. Great.

            "content": "If you've just got a new iPhone 16, then you probably won't need to worry about your battery for some time. But those of you with older iPhones -- or older Android phones -- may well find that your battery has started to age and no longer gives you the same battery life it once did. But having an old, worn-out battery doesn't mean getting rid of your whole phone; it's surprisingly simple to just replace the battery.\n\nApple has its own do-it-yourself repair program, but even if you don't use that, you can actually replace your iPhone's battery yourself at home. With affordable third-party components and various tools available to buy, you can open up your iPhone and swap out that old, wasted battery -- or replace a cracked screen -- often for less money than having a company do it for you.\n\nI did exactly that, replacing the old battery of a well-used iPhone 6 to give it a new lease on life. I was pleased to find the phone on eBay for only \u00a375 (about $100 or AU$140) back in 2020. That's a huge savings over a new iPhone 16 Pro, but the battery had aged to the point where the software had to artificially throttle the performance to stop it from shutting down. Instead of casting off the phone and getting buyer's remorse, I decided to purchase a replacement battery and tools from iFixit and have a go at changing out the battery myself.\n\nRead more: Best phone for 2025\n\nIt took a little over an hour, but I was able to safely swap out the battery and get the iPhone 6 running perfectly again. I'm not giving step-by-step instructions here -- head to iFixit and grab a kit if that's what you're after -- but I do want to describe my experience, including how easy the process was, and hopefully answer some of the questions you may have if you also need a new battery.\n\nIf you have a more recent model (an iPhone 12 or newer), then make sure to first check Apple's new repair options and see if you'd be able to put in a replacement with parts directly from the company.\n\nNote that any maintenance you do on your own devices is entirely at your own risk.\n\n1. Why would you need to replace an iPhone battery?\n\nBatteries age over time, and considering that the iPhone 6 was released 10 years ago, it's no surprise that the one I bought wasn't running in prime condition. One time, the phone unexpectedly restarted while in use, and it flashed a warning that read, \"This iPhone has experienced an unexpected shutdown because the battery was unable to deliver the necessary peak power. Performance management has been applied to help prevent this from happening again.\" Even the phone itself knew it had a bum battery.\n\nIn short, a phone's performance can be throttled if it can no longer cope with power demands. There is the option to turn throttling off, but this will result in more frequent crashes. Neither situation is ideal, so a battery replacement seemed like a smart way forward for me, since it wasn't my main phone and I was willing to take the risks.\n\nOpening up my iPhone 6. Andrew Hoyle/CNET\n\n2. How much does a replacement iPhone battery cost?\n\nThe problem with my situation specifically was that I bought the phone for so little in the first place that spending more money on a battery replacement service negated some of those initial savings. Apple's replacement service costs \u00a349 ($49), which is more than half what I paid for the iPhone 6 I bought. As I was in the middle of a coronavirus lockdown when I attempted this, I wasn't able to get to an Apple store to take it in, and sending it in through the mail would bring the total cost to around \u00a356 (about $75 or AU$105).\n\niFixit, however, sells a DIY replacement pack for \u00a335 (including postage to my home in Scotland). It costs $30 in the US, and with shipping costs that comes to about $38. It's not a huge saving over Apple's replacement, but every little bit helps. It also means you will still have the tools you need should you want to do this again in the future. All you'd need to buy next time is the battery.\n\n3. What comes in the iFixit battery fix kit?\n\niFixit's kit comes with a third-party replacement battery that is not from Apple, since Apple does not sell its parts separately for phones older than the iPhone 12. It also has all the tools needed to open the phone and remove the old battery. The only additional thing I needed was a hair dryer to heat up and remove the glue.\n\n4. Does replacing a battery void your phone warranty?\n\nOpening up an iPhone will void the warranty, but if your battery is old enough to need replacing, odds are you're already out of the 12-month warranty period.\n\nPrying the old battery out was tricky, and I wasn't always sure I was doing it safely. Andrew Hoyle/CNET\n\n5. Is it safe to replace your iPhone battery yourself?\n\nThis one isn't so straightforward to answer. iFixit's guide gives very detailed instructions on the steps involved, but there were a couple of points that made me nervous. One step involved heating up the back of the phone with a hair dryer in order to loosen the glue holding the old battery in place.\n\nSpecifically, it said to heat it to \"slightly too warm to touch comfortably,\" which I found a little vague. Especially since that section also warned that \"overheating the iPhone may ignite the battery.\" But how hot is too hot? What signs would I see if it was overheating? I couldn't find this information, and as such wasn't sure how close to overheating it I might be.\n\nShortly after, while trying to pry out the old battery, I accidentally ripped into what looked like the black wrapping around that battery. I was pretty sure that the battery itself wasn't punctured -- there was no smoke or hissing -- but I'd have felt a lot more comfortable if I had \"emergency\" instructions on hand about what to do if the battery did ignite.\n\n6. Can I replace my iPhone battery myself?\n\nUp to a point I found I could, and I'm not the best at DIY. iFixit's instructions were easy to follow, and there were only seven internal screws to remove, which were easy to replace.\n\nThe iPhone 6, old battery removed and all traces of the glue cleaned off. Andrew Hoyle/CNET\n\nOne thing I found confusing was that the instructions on iFixit's website end at the point where you remove the old battery. The only instruction in the conclusion was to follow the previous steps in reverse order. Admittedly, that wasn't particularly difficult, but I would have appreciated more guidance at that point.\n\nI ran into one other issue in the process: When I removed the screen, I cracked the screen protector that was in place. I noticed the hairline cracks and was worried that I'd damaged the display itself, but thankfully that was unharmed.\n\nWith its new battery, this iPhone 6 should be running at optimal level again. Andrew Hoyle/CNET\n\n7. Is it worth replacing an iPhone battery?\n\nIt depends on the age and value of your phone. If, like me, you bought a cheap used iPhone and just want to get it back up to speed, then it could be a great way to breathe new life into old tech without spending a fortune. Bear in mind, though, that this wasn't going to be my main phone, nor did I buy it with my own money. For me, the risk was low. If I'd made a mistake and ruined the phone, it wouldn't have been a big problem. You'll need to consider whether you really can manage without the phone, and weigh your tolerance for other risks.\n\nIf you're using a more recent device, like an iPhone 14 or 15, for example, I'd just take it directly to Apple. The savings you'll get from doing it yourself aren't so great as to justify the potential cost of damaging a more valuable phone.\n\nWatch this: Apple announces DIY repairs for iPhones and Macs 05:41",

However, we\u2019re approaching the spring time, and Apple has five relatively major products in the pipeline.\n\niPhone SE 4\n\nPerhaps the biggest announcement for the spring will be Apple\u2019s most affordable new iPhone: the iPhone SE. This is expected to be the biggest upgrade to the iPhone SE since it debuted in 2016, bringing it up to date with the modern iPhone lineup.\n\nIt\u2019s expected to finally be dropping the home button, with a new form factor similar to the iPhone 14. iPhone SE 4 will also be Apple\u2019s first iPhone to integrate an in-house modem, transitioning away from Qualcomm. It\u2019ll also adopt the USB-C connector. Apple may also drop the iPhone SE name in favor of \u201ciPhone 16E\u201d, according to one rumor.\n\nTo learn more about the iPhone SE 4, you can read about it in our dedicated guide:\n\niPad 11\n\nApple\u2019s cheapest iPad is likely going to get its first update in over 2 years this spring, with the main focus being Apple Intelligence support. The last iPad refresh brought the first redesign to the base iPad since Apple started making budget iPads, so there likely won\u2019t be any design changes.\n\nRumors currently say that we should expect the A17 Pro chip to arrive in this model, similar to the iPad mini. This chip originally debuted in iPhone 15 Pro in 2023.\n\nMacBook Air with M4\n\nAlthough this is going to be a smaller refresh (especially now that Apple added 16GB of RAM to the existing M2 and M3 MacBook Air models), Apple will still be adopting the new M4 chip in the MacBook Air this spring. It\u2019s also possible that this MacBook Air launches even sooner than the spring time, as Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman has previously mentioned that this product is on an earlier timeline.\n\nWe don\u2019t expect any changes outside of the chip upgrade, though it would be cool to get the new Center Stage camera that the latest MacBook Pros have. You can learn more in our dedicated guide:\n\nM3 iPad Air\n\nThis is also going to be a small refresh, but the iPad Air will likely get an update next spring, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman. It\u2019ll likely be equipped with an M3 chip, as well as an all new Magic Keyboard just for iPad Air.\n\nRead more:\n\nSmart home display\n\nApple\u2019s first smart home product with a display is also on track to be introduced as soon as next month, marking Apple\u2019s first HomePod (of sorts) to support Apple Intelligence. It\u2019s expected to be a cheaper display that\u2019s both wall mountable and attachable to speakers. It\u2019ll have a roughly 7-inch square display.\n\nLearn more about Apple\u2019s next big product:\n\nWrap up\n\nApple is also expected to release an updated AirTag model, likely with a newer ultra wide band chipset. Other than that, it\u2019s unclear what\u2019ll change. As for products like the Mac Studio and Mac Pro, those aren\u2019t expected until around mid 2025.\n\nAnd of course, iOS 18.4 is also expected around the spring time, which should provide the final suite of initial Apple Intelligence features announced at WWDC24, including the revamped Siri.\n\nAre you excited for Apple\u2019s upcoming spring releases?

            "content": "Generally, iPhones are considered more secure than Android devices.\n\nApple\u2019s closed ecosystem and strict App Store policies limit the risk of malware, and its centralized software updates ensure better security. In contrast, Android\u2019s openness allows users to install apps from various sources, and updates are often rolled out at different times, making it more vulnerable to attacks.\n\nHowever, iPhones aren\u2019t immune to security flaws. Hackers occasionally find ways to exploit them, as seen in Apple\u2019s latest advisory. The company recently discovered that a vulnerability in iOS had been exploited for over a year. While a fix has now been released, reports suggest that hackers may have already targeted high-value individuals.\n\nGET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS \u2014 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER \u2014 THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nApple has uncovered hackers exploiting a vulnerability in iOS that appears to have been lingering for more than a year. The vulnerability is a \"zero-day\" flaw, meaning criminals may have already exploited it, according to the latest security advisory from the company. Zero-day flaws like this are especially dangerous because they are exploited before developers can issue fixes. Apple confirmed this marks its first zero-day patch of 2025. The vulnerability affects iPhones dating back to 2018\u2019s XS model, as well as newer iPads, Macs, and even the Vision Pro headset.\n\nThe vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24085, resides in Apple\u2019s Core Media framework, a software layer responsible for processing multimedia files. A \"use after free\" memory corruption error enabled hackers to manipulate the system into executing unstable code, granting them elevated privileges to bypass security protocols. Apple\u2019s advisory suggests hackers weaponized the flaw through malicious apps disguised as legitimate media players. These apps likely abused the Core Media framework by triggering corrupted files, enabling attackers to infiltrate devices.\n\nThe attacks reportedly targeted iOS versions predating 17.2, released in December 2023, meaning the vulnerability may have been active since late 2022. Security experts speculate that hackers focused on high-value individuals \u2014 such as activists, executives or journalists \u2014 to avoid detection. The prolonged stealth of the campaign underscores the challenges of identifying sophisticated, narrowly tailored exploits.\n\nThis underscores the critical need for you to update your devices to iOS 17.2 or later, as these versions include essential fixes to safeguard against this actively exploited vulnerability.\n\nHOW TO PROTECT YOUR IPHONE & IPAD FROM MALWARE\n\nApple\u2019s response to the vulnerability\n\nIn response, Apple has released fixes across its ecosystem, including iOS 18.3, macOS Sequoia, watchOS, tvOS and VisionOS. You should update your devices as soon as possible to stay protected. To install the update on your iPhone or iPad:\n\nGo to Settings.\n\nTap General.\n\nClick Software Update.\n\nClick Update Now or Update Tonight.\n\nPro Tip: I recommend you click Update Now and also turn on Automatic Updates to stay covered in the future.\n\nWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?\n\nWhile Apple has patched this issue, it\u2019s a reminder that staying on top of updates is key. Hackers are always looking for security gaps, so keeping your software up to date is one of the best ways to stay safe.\n\nSCAMMERS FOUND A SNEAKY WAY TO BYPASS YOUR IPHONE'S SAFETY FEATURES\n\n7 ways to keep your iPhone safe\n\nProtecting your iPhone requires proactive security measures. By following these seven essential steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of cyber threats and keep your personal information secure.\n\n1. Keep your iPhone updated: I can\u2019t say this enough. Updating your iPhone regularly is one of the most effective ways to protect it from security threats. Apple frequently releases updates that fix vulnerabilities, including critical zero-day flaws.\n\n2. Download apps only from the App Store: To minimize the risk of installing malware, only download apps from the official App Store. Apple\u2019s strict app review process helps prevent malicious apps from being published, but some threats can still slip through. Always verify app details, check reviews and be cautious about app permissions before installation.\n\n3. Enable lockdown mode for extra protection: For those of you who may be at higher risk, such as journalists or executives, Lockdown Mode provides an additional layer of security. This feature limits certain device functionalities to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks. It can be turned on via Settings > Privacy & Security > Lockdown Mode and is especially useful for those concerned about targeted threats.\n\n4. Enable message filtering: Use your device's built-in filtering options to sort messages from unknown senders. This feature allows you to automatically sort messages from unknown senders, easily filter unread messages and manage your message inbox more efficiently. Here are steps:\n\nOpen Settings.\n\nScroll down and click Apps.\n\nTap Messages.\n\nTurn on Filter Unknown Senders\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n5. Stay cautious of phishing attacks and install strong antivirus software: Phishing remains one of the most common tactics used by hackers. Be cautious when receiving unsolicited messages or emails on your iPhone, especially those with suspicious links or attachments. Always verify the sender before opening anything. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices .\n\n6. Review your security and privacy settings: Regularly reviewing your iPhone\u2019s security settings can help you maintain strong protection. You should also review app permissions in Settings > Privacy & Security to restrict access to sensitive data, such as location or contacts. Enable Face ID or Touch ID for secure access and turn on two-factor authentication ( 2FA ) for Apple ID and other accounts. 2FA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message or authentication app, in addition to your password. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if your password is compromised.\n\n7. Invest in personal data removal services: By reducing your online footprint, you make it harder for cybercriminals to obtain your contact information, potentially preventing them from sending you deceptive phishing texts and emails in the first place. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.\n\nKurt\u2019s key takeaway\n\nThis iOS vulnerability is a serious reminder of the importance of staying up to date with software updates. If you\u2019re using an iPhone from 2018 or later, make sure you\u2019ve updated to iOS 17.2 or later as soon as possible. Hackers exploited a hidden flaw for over a year, using fake media apps to gain access to devices. While Apple has now patched the issue, the fact that it remained undetected for so long is concerning.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDo you think companies like Apple are doing enough to protect you from cyber threats?

This is a regularly $599 configuration seeing a straight up $99 price drop to come within $1 of the best we have tracked in the last few months outside of a brief one-day offer at Best Buy for $30 less with limited color options.\n\nAt this point and considering the historical deal pricing on the M2 Air lineup since its debut in May of 2024, the $50 drops that you might catch on Amazon on a regular basis aren\u2019t really worth jumping on. But something closer to $100 off is the range of the best prices yet \u2013 similar deals are also available on most 11- and 13-inch models with the upgraded storage options below.\n\nWhile for some the newer iPad mini 7 that debuted much later in the year might be a more enticing proposition, the M2 iPad Air is a much more powerful machine. Now you might just favor the smaller form-factor on the mini over the M2 power on the Air, and that\u2019s entirely understandable.

            "content": "As iPhones get new capabilities like Starlink, there's one recently added feature that you may have missed -- but it has huge implications for Apple's push into home technology. The feature found in new iPhones is Thread radio support, and if you don't recognize what that means, it's all about the massive switch in standards slowly coming to home devices -- and Apple's role in it.\n\nDuring a multifaceted interview about the Matter smart home standard with The Verge, Vividh Siddha, a director at Apple and president of smart-device organization the Thread Group talked about this Thread update, what it does and what that means for Apple's ultimate home tech plans. We broke down what everyone should know.\n\nApple and Thread get cozy\n\nThe Thread and Matter standards often go hand in hand, with Thread acting as a special, high-security connection for lower-power smart home devices and Matter being the \"language\" that passes through Thread. The problem is that most control devices (like phones, tablets or computers) can't yet connect to Thread directly and instead have to jump through Wi-Fi hoops.\n\nApple's recent iPhone changes -- changes Google is also making to its devices -- enable Thread radio frequency support. That allows iPhones, and presumably iPads and so on, to connect to smart home devices with a built-in Thread border router directly. If you have a newer iPhone. It can already do it.\n\nThread compatibility is the first step in extra easy smart home setup and control. Apple\n\nWhat Thread Radio means for Apple's home plans\n\nWhile this Thread support may sound a little puzzling, it enables four very important advantages for the modern smart home and Apple users:\n\nWith Thread-enabled devices, you won't need any extra hub or even a Wi-Fi router to connect with smart home sensors, lights, locks, etc. That's both simpler and time saving. Thread includes a variety of security protections that make it safer to use than routing commands through Wi-Fi. When Thread and Matter have to get \"translated\" through a Wi-Fi router or similar gadget, their devices can lose functionality. That can include specific features, automations and home routine choices from apps like Apple Home. With a direct Thread connection, more automations and features are enabled. As long as your smart home devices have power from batteries and so on, you can still control them through a Thread connection. So if your power goes out and your Wi-Fi doesn't work, you can still open compatible smart locks and whatnot, as long as you have your iPhone with you.\n\nApple Home app with many devices, shown on an iPad. Apple\n\nShould I get ready for Apple smart home devices?\n\nSort of. You should definitely get ready for Matter- and Thread-enabled smart devices, which will hopefully come much farther in 2025 and should have this Apple Home compatibility. But Apple has far more in store \u2014 you'll just have to wait a little.\n\nThis year, as early as the spring, expect Apple to release its first smart display, essentially a HomePod with a touch screen, designed to compete with Echo Shows and Nest Hubs as a way to control a variety of smart home devices. There are also rumors a wall-mounted smart home display will be available.\n\nLater in 2025, reports suggest, Apple will be releasing other devices to unite its smart home ecosystem, including a HomePod Mini 2 and an upgraded Apple TV.\n\nNext year, watch for Apple's jump into home security with its own Apple security camera. Also note that Matter compatibility has grown common on smart locks from Schlage, Lockly, Aqara and other brands, so the Apple Home app will likely be able to connect directly to the latest Thread-supported devices from those brands by this time.\n\nThe bottom line? In the coming couple of years, Apple is going to come for your smart home. It's already laid the groundwork with small changes like these, and now the company is starting to be more open about its plans for direct, simpler control from everyday devices like iPhones. We're ready to see how it plays out.",

            "content": "In the greater scheme of things, iOS 18.3 will go down as a relatively uneventful update, mostly introducing fixes and refinements to existing features as opposed to rolling out new capabilities to your iPhone. But if you're following the introduction of Apple Intelligence, iOS 18.3 took a pretty big step forward in the evolution of Apple's suite of AI-powered tools\n\nWhen Apple Intelligence debuted with the iOS 18.1 update back in October, owners of supported iPhones needed to opt in to the new set of features by heading into settings and toggling on a switch. That's not the case anymore \u2014 starting with iOs 18.3, Apple Intelligence features will be turned on by default.\n\nOn the surface, one might look at this development as Apple dusting off its hands and declaring \"Mission Accomplished.\" It is anything but \u2014 even after iOS 18.3, Apple Intelligence remains a work in progress. While some of the AI features have integrated themselves quite nicely into the iPhone experience, others need more polish, and some promised improvements have yet to launch \u2014 something Apple itself would readily acknowledge.\n\nWhy Apple Intelligence isn't fully ready just yet\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nWhile iOS 18.3 enabling Apple Intelligence by default grabs everyone's attention, there are other signs within the software update that indicate a lot of work is ahead of Apple on the AI front. For starters, you can still turn off Apple Intelligence from the Apple Intelligence & Siri section of the Settings app, so opting in isn't mandatory.\n\nFor another thing, a lot of the fixes in iOS 18.3 I mentioned at the start of this article have to do with fine-tuning Apple Intelligence. One of the more noteworthy aspects of the update involves notifications for news and entertainment apps. Apple has temporarily turned these off because many of the AI-powered summaries proved to be wildly inaccurate.\n\nThat's not ideal for the makers of news apps watching their articles mischaracterized by Apple's AI nor does it generate a lot of confidence in the other summary tools included in Apple Intelligence. Apple's wisely taking that feature back to the drawing board, but it's an indicator of how some artificial intelligence needs better training before it's ready to go out into the wild.\n\nOn a more positive note, iOS 18.3 also contains updates to existing AI features that make them better. Other AI-generated summaries that appear on your lock screen \u2014 like for text messages, just as an example \u2014 will now appear in italicized text, making them easier to spot at a glance. If you've got an iPhone 16 model, the Visual Intelligence feature can now add events to the Calendar app when you point your camera at a flyer or poster; the feature also can identify plants and animals.\n\nThese are positive improvements, not unlike the addition of the Describe Your Change feature to Writing Tools in last year's iOS 18.2 update. Describe Your Change provides a lot better control over the way in which Apple's AI feature tweaks your text, adding some muscle to what had been some pretty flaccid writing tools.\n\nThat's the positive aspect of treating Apple Intelligence as an ongoing rollout. Apple may introduce new AI features, but it's not done with them once they land on your phone. There's a willingness to go back and fix what's not working or expand on what is.\n\nSiri changes still pending\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nThe biggest missing piece in the Apple Intelligence rollout remains Siri. Apple's personal assistant has seen some improvements in the initial updates to iOS 18. but the most anticipated improvement is still to come.\n\nSpecifically, conversations with Siri have become a little more natural since Apple Intelligence launched with the digital assistant able to field follow-up questions while understanding the context of what you're asking about. Sometimes, that's with mixed levels of success, but you can see where Apple is making improvements.\n\nThere are other changes to Siri, like a new animation that flashes across the entire iPhone screen to indicate the assistant is all ears, and there's a Type to Siri feature as well. You can also interrupt the assistant when it's rattling back an answer to you if you want to ask follow-up questions, and Siri isn't flummoxed when you correct yourself mid-request.\n\nCertainly, these are welcome improvements, but Apple has promised more. To that end, Siri is supposed to pick up on-screen awareness, so that it can make suggestions and provide answers based on what's displayed on your iPhone screen. Siri is also supposed to learn your personal context, so that its recommendations are better tailored to you. And finally, Siri should be able to interact with other apps on your phone as well.\n\nThe good news is these changes are rumored to be arriving in the iOS 18.4 update later this spring, which means those of us with the public beta of iOS 18 installed should soon be able to try them out. But on the downside, the absence of these features has been keenly felt ever since the Galaxy S25 launch delivered new Galaxy AI capabilities that have beaten Apple to the punch.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\nFor instance, you can tap into the Gemini assistant on a Galaxy S25 and perform cross-app actions with any app from Google or Samsung, plus Whatsapp and Spotify. Thanks to that improvement, you can even give a command that interacts with multiple apps at once, looking up information online and adding it to a note as an example.\n\nAdditionally, the new One UI 7 software running on the Galaxy S25 features a Now Brief screen that's eventually going to be populated with personalized information and contextually appropriate data like upcoming appointments, traffic conditions for your daily commute and other information based on your past activities and preferences. In early testing, the Now Brief screen looks pretty bare bones, but it figures to get smarter over time as it learns more about you.\n\nIt doesn't necessarily matter that Samsung got to these features ahead of Apple. But it very much raises the bar that Apple has to implement them better than Samsung has. And we're still waiting to see how that will pan out.\n\nApple Intelligence outlook\n\nClearly, Apple Intelligence has generated some interest among Apple users. When reporting Apple's first quarter earnings last week, CEO Tim Cook noted that iPhone sales were better in regions where the AI features are already available compared to where Apple Intelligence has yet to get support. With addition language support for Apple Intelligence coming in April, there figures to be a lot more users ready to see what all the AI fuss is about.\n\nThat's another reason why work on Apple Intelligence is far from over, even if the AI tools are now enabled by default with Apple's latest iPhone software. There's some big features yet to come and new markets left to conquer.",

Apple denies any wrongdoing but is offering the $20 million settlement to avoid the hassle of court proceedings.\n\nThis comes just weeks after Apple announced a $95 million settlement related to privacy issues with Siri.\n\nHow to check if you're included in the settlement\n\nApple has a record of who owned a watch that is part of this lawsuit and who reported issues to customer service, so you don't need to take any action to receive payment, unlike other lawsuits. However, you do need to make sure your information is updated at www.watchsettlement.com, including your address, email address, and how you'd like to receive the payment (you can choose a physical check, e-check, ACH transfer, or a prepaid virtual MasterCard or Visa).\n\nIf you're unsure whether you're included in this settlement, you can call 1-844-933-4042.\n\nHow much you can get from the settlement\n\nThe exact payment amount depends on how many people are part of the class action suit, but it should be between $20 and $50 per watch, according to Apple. If you owned multiple watches, you can receive multiple payments. You do not need to still have the watches.\n\nAlso: The smartwatch I'm most excited for in 2025 isn't an Apple Watch or Google Pixel\n\nWhen you will get your claim\n\nThe deadline to update your information and choose your payment method is April 10, 2025. If you don't take any action, Apple will send the payment to the information on file when you registered the watch.\n\nIf the court approves the settlement after the final hearing on April 10, there will be time for an appeal process. If there is no appeal, Apple will make payments shortly after that date.",

            "content": "Over the past years, the iPhone mostly stayed the same, and the Cupertino tech giant only brought slight changes to its design and functionality, but that is about to change according to Apple CEO Tim Cook. In the latest teaser by the executive, Apple's iPhone roadmap holds massive surprises for the world, and it features significant innovations to eh beloved flagship smartphone of the company.\n\nApple iPhone Roadmap Teased by Tim Cook, Coming Soon\n\nApple made a killing in the last quarter of 2024, with over $124 billion revenue seen in the period of the last three months making it their largest in history, but the company is not resting as they have a lot more in store for the world. This is because Apple's CEO teased the iPhone's roadmap and what it has to bring in the future, saying that massive innovations are making its way soon.\n\nIt was reported by 9to5Mac that Cook did not dive into specifics of what the roadmap holds for the public, but the CEO shared that he is feeling 'optimistic' about the iPhone's future and what the company plans for it.\n\nThe iPhone has remained stagnant over the years, and while yes, it features the latest chip, offering Apple Intelligence, improving its cameras, and sharing new experiences like the Capture button from the iPhone 15, it mostly stayed with its renowned design, layout, and more.\n\nWhat Does iPhone Have to Offer in Future Releases?\n\nWhile Tim Cook did not reveal anything from the iPhone roadmap in his teaser, his enthusiasm for its future are already being related to rumors behind the upcoming smartphones from Cupertino. The foldable iPhone has been long debated in the industry, particularly as it was revealed that the iPhone 17 will help in making it a reality, as it is ushering in the 'Air' variant that is crucial to the folding devices.\n\nThe Expected iPhones of 2025\n\nThe year 2025 has been expected to be a massive year for Apple, particularly as since the iPhone 14's release, there have been rumors that the next big change to the lineup will arrive three years later with the iPhone 17. First off, the entire lineup would feature a more advanced display that can deliver up to 120Hz refresh rate, alongside the A19 chip series that still focuses on Apple Intelligence, among many more features.\n\nNot to mention the expected arrival of the iPhone 17 Air which is set to make way for massive innovations in the future, as while it would deliver the thinnest iPhone yet, it will also serve as the framework for its foldable aspirations.\n\nOn the other hand, there is also the iPhone SE 4 which is expected this year, and it would be among the firsts from Cupertino to debut for 2025, featuring the iPhone 14-based smartphone that drops the iPhone 8 chassis, given the A18 chip for Apple Intelligence access, and significant improvements to its camera and performance.\n\nThe question now only centers on when Apple would unveil these latest devices for the year, as in its history, the iPhone SE lineup typically launches around the Spring season or March, and the mainline iPhones are set for a Fall event at around September to October. That being said, Apple has a lot in store for fans this 2025 and for the years to come, with Tim Cook confirming this in his latest teaser of the roadmap.",

            "content": "In late September, I upgraded to the iPhone 16 from my dependable iPhone 14 Pro. This was my first non-Pro phone and my first Plus-sized iPhone. I wanted a larger display than the usual 6.1-inch screen I\u2019ve been using, and I didn\u2019t feel the need to go Pro.\n\nHowever, I returned the iPhone 16 Plus after almost two months. My main problem with it was the size. The iPhone 16 Plus is too big. While I love the larger display, the phone is too thick for my taste. Also, the Camera Control wasn\u2019t as easy or comfortable to use as I thought it would be, and I didn\u2019t have access to any Apple Intelligence features. I still don\u2019t, as the EU has to wait a few more months to get Apple\u2019s AI.\n\nI did start missing a few iPhone 16 Plus features as soon as I returned it. The display and battery life are the clear highlights. I also missed the ability to start the camera from any screen with the Camera Control button and the weight. I went back to the iPhone 14 Pro, which is heavier than the 16 Plus.\n\nFast-forward to late January, I decided to buy the iPhone 16 Pro Max. That might be strange, given that I had just given up the iPhone 16 Plus and blamed it mainly on the footprint. But I just realized that if I don\u2019t do it now, the chances are I\u2019ll never get my hands on a Pro Max flavor for daily use ever again.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nI\u2019ve been telling you for months that I\u2019m dying to get my hands on the iPhone 17 Air that will replace the Plus version in Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 lineup.\n\nThe Air should be slightly smaller than the Plus, featuring a 6.6-inch screen. But it\u2019ll be much thinner. Rumors say it\u2019ll be only 5.5mm thick, which is more than 2mm thinner than the Plus (7.80) and Pro Max (8.25) sizes.\n\nWhile I\u2019m ready for compromises from the iPhone 17 Air, I\u2019ll probably stick around with future Air models afterward. The only thing that could derail me from that path is Apple\u2019s first foldable iPhone. Rumors say Apple has settled on the Fold-type design that turns a phone into a small tablet rather than going for a clamshell iPhone.\n\nI like Samsung\u2019s Flip phones more than the Fold, but I would consider an iPhone Fold in the future. That future might come as soon as 2026.\n\nWith all that in mind, it looks like I\u2019ll transition to an iPhone Air/Fold experience very soon. I\u2019ll have plenty of time to decide which one I want, assuming the rumors pan out and Apple releases the first iPhone Air model this year and the first Fold next year.\n\nTherefore, the iPhone 16 Pro Max might be the last time I seriously consider a large-screen display that\u2019s neither thin nor foldable.\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro still works great after more than two years. But I didn\u2019t like going back to the smaller screen, and I miss charging the Plus every other day. The iPhone 16 Pro Max should deliver even better battery life, as it features a larger battery than all its siblings and a slightly larger, better display.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max also comes with ProMotion and Always-on display support, features that I have long disabled. But I can use them if I want to.\n\niPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max side by side. Image source: Christian de Looper for BGR\n\nThe Camera Control is also back into my iPhone experience, and I got a case that actually makes the button more accessible. Surprisingly, the iPhone 16 Pro Max size makes it easier to use the button when holding it with my left hand.\n\nBetween the smaller width (77.6mm vs. 77.8mm for the Plus) and the larger depth (8.25mm vs. 7.80mm for the Plus), I can comfortably rest my middle finger on the button to turn on the camera and take photos. This should come in handy during my next marathon races, which involve some traveling and sightseeing.\n\nSpeaking of cameras, the iPhone 16 Pros models will give me access to the best camera experience Apple can offer right now. I already liked the iPhone 16 Plus camera over the 14 Pro, so the 16 Pro Max should do even better. As a reminder, the iPhone 16 Pros pack a 48-megapixel ultra-wide lens for the first time and a telephoto lens with more optical zoom options.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s Apple Intelligence, which is still not available. I want to try Apple\u2019s AI in iOS 18 as soon as it comes to Europe. That might mean having to wait until the iOS 18.4 is released. Access to an iPhone 16 will hopefully give me access to Apple Intelligence in iOS 19 beta this summer. And yes, I know Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t the AI experience we all want it to be right now.\n\nI didn\u2019t say I would keep the iPhone 16 Pro Max for the long run. If I do, however, it will be a better trade-in value for the iPhone 17 Air or go to someone in my family.",

Oppenheimer also downgraded shares on Wednesday, citing slower iPhone growth.\n\nFor the quarter, Apple reported earnings per share of $2.40 on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts were looking for EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.1 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone segment brought in $69.1 billion versus expectations of $71 billion, down slightly from the $69.7 billion the company reported for the segment in the last year. The company's Services business generated $26.3 billion in revenue, in line with Wall Street's expectations. Greater China sales topped out at $18.5 billion.

In April, Apple Intelligence will be made available in additional languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, simplified Chinese, and localized English in Singapore and India.\n\nApple shares were up nearly 1% to around $240 in recent trading. The stock has gained 30% over the past 12 months, slightly outpacing the S&P 500 over that period.\n\nBelow, we break down the technicals on Apple\u2019s weekly chart and identify crucial post-earnings price levels that investors may be monitoring.\n\nRising Wedge Pattern in Focus\n\nApple shares have trended higher within an 18-month rising wedge, with the stock\u2019s price recently finding buying interest near the pattern\u2019s lower trendline ahead of the company\u2019s quarterly report.\n\nThis move coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) reclaiming the 50 threshold earlier this month, indicating a positive shift in price momentum.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at Apple\u2019s chart to identify crucial overhead areas to watch and also point out two major support levels that could come into play during pullbacks.\n\nCrucial Overhead Areas to Watch\n\nAmid earnings-driven buying, investors should initially keep an eye on the $260 area. The shares face a confluence of resistance in this region near the stock\u2019s all-time high (ATH) and rising wedge pattern\u2019s upper trendline.\n\nTo forecast where Apple shares may be headed upon a breakout above the ATH, we can apply bars pattern analysis. This technique works by taking the price bars comprising the stock\u2019s trend higher from April to December and repositioning them from this week\u2019s low. The study indicates a potential high of $350 before a consolidation phase if price action rhymes.\n\nWe selected this prior trending move as it commenced from the rising wedge\u2019s lower trendline, similar to how the stock\u2019s pre-earnings rally started.\n\nMajor Support Levels to Monitor During Pullbacks\n\nDuring pullbacks, investors should initially keep track of the $235 level. The shares may encounter support in this area near the rising wedge pattern\u2019s lower trendline and the upper range of a consolidation period that formed on the chart between July and October last year.\n\nFinally, selling below this level could see Apple shares retrace to around $218, a region where buyers may look for entry points near the lower range of the consolidation period mentioned above, which also sits in close proximity to the rising 50-week moving average.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

            "content": "Apple apparently no longer sees the future through augmented reality-tinted glasses. According to a report from Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, the company is ditching a project to build AR lenses that would have competed with Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban smart glasses, putting the company at risk of falling far behind its rivals following the commercial failure of the Apple Vision Pro headset.\n\nThe glasses project, codenamed N107, was never made public, but Bloomberg reports that the plan was to build tech-equipped glasses that looked like any other pair but offered augmented reality features that could display information visible only to the person wearing the frames. An initial version of the product would have connected to an iPhone, but that was scrapped once it turned out the processing power needs of the glasses stressed out the handset and rapidly drained its battery. Apple shifted gears to pairing the glasses to Mac devices, but it continued to fall short of expectations in testing. Reportedly, the company threw in the towel on the project altogether earlier this week.\n\nBy ditching the augmented reality glasses, Apple is tacitly admitting that it just cannot crack the VR/AR space. The Apple Vision Pro, introduced in 2023, is a technically impressive device with next to no use cases and an extremely cost-prohibitive price tag, retailing for $3,499. Apple spent most of 2024 revising its projected sales figures lower and lower, ultimately settling on an estimated 500,000 units sold, with little momentum to suggest the floodgates are just about to open.\n\nMeta, meanwhile, seems to have cracked the code for AR glasses\u2014at least when it comes to sales. The company\u2019s Smart Glasses, a collaborative effort with Ray-Ban, sold over one million units in 2024, per details relayed in an all-hands call that was reported by The Verge. The fact that the glasses start at $300 likely helps, as it makes them much more accessible to consumers, though it seems likely Meta might be subsidizing the cost in order to boost sales. Reality Labs, Meta\u2019s AR/VR division, lost $5 billion during the fourth quarter of 2024 while generating only $1.1 billion in sales during that same time, even with the glasses becoming a mild hit.\n\nStill, Meta is going all-in on the wearables. CEO Mark Zuckerberg floated the idea that the company could sell \u201cbillions of AI glasses\u201d in the future, which\u2026sure if we\u2019re just saying stuff, why not aim high? Whether it\u2019ll ever hit that figure, it\u2019s going to try. Meta is reportedly working on a pair of Oakley-style AR glasses for athletes and a Ray-Ban follow-up called Hypernova that will feature a heads-up display.\n\nApple, meanwhile, seems like it\u2019s going to go back to the drawing board. The company has Vision Pro follow-up concepts in the works and an AirPods model equipped with cameras, per Bloomberg. But that sounds less like a company with a vision and more like one that is just throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks.",

The team up between Apple and SpaceX brings Starlink satellite access to the latest iOS 18.3 iPhone update where compatibility with the network has been secretly added.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2018s Mark Gurman revealed, \u201cApple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company\u2019s in-house satellite-communication service.\u201d Gurman describes this link up to be an \u201cunder-the-radar move\u201d that has also been described as a \u201cgame changer\u201d by Mario Nawfal, founder of IBC Group. Taking to X, Nawfal added, \u201cApple just opened iPhone doors to Starlink\u2019s satellite network, giving users an alternative to their Globalstar service for off-grid communication. The key difference? No more pointing your phone at the sky \u2013 Starlink works right from your pocket. T-Mobile to beta testers: \u2018You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere.\u2019 While it\u2019s text-only for now, SpaceX and T-Mobile plan to add voice calls and data in the future. The race for space-based cellular just got interesting.\u201d Musk responded to Nawfal clarifying to the public, \u201cMedium resolution images, music & audio podcasts should work with the current generation Starlink direct-to-phone constellation. Next generation constellation will do medium resolution video.\u201d\n\nPartnering with T-Mobile, a small numbers of iPhones on the network have received messages that have enabled phones for beta testing. The message reads, \u201cYou\u2019re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.\u201d Gurman has also noted that, \u201cUsers in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.\u201d While the first version is just for texting, SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that it looks to expand its data connections to voice calls later on. As of now, only iPhones in the U.S. have access to the Starlink connectivity and it is said to only be applied to iPhone 14s and onwards.",

At first, Apple had wanted the glasses to pair with the iPhone, but hit a roadblock over how much processing power the smartphone could offer.\n\nInstead, Apple looked to its computers, with their faster processor and larger batteries. However, this version performed poorly in reviews with executives. The project was finally cancelled this week.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Apple has walked away from a big technological effort. Last year, the company finally put the brakes on a years-long effort to create a self-driving vehicle.\n\nIn November \u2014 around the time word of the smart glasses project first surfaced \u2014 Apple warned its investors that its newest product lines might not measure up to the success of its iPhones.\n\n\u201cNew products, services and technologies may replace or supersede existing offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit margins, which can materially adversely impact the company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition,\u201d Apple wrote in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing.\n\nIn other augmented reality news, PYMNTS wrote last month about the implications of extended reality (XR) \u2014 an umbrella term encompassing virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) \u2014 for the payments sector.\n\n\u201cOn a fundamental level, the XR landscape presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity for payments innovation,\u201d that report said, as XR applications in fields like gaming, eCommerce, healthcare and education will demand smoother payment solutions in line with the promise of these technologies.\n\n\u201cAs XR grows, payments are likely to no longer be a mere utility but a critical enabler of its success,\u201d that report added. \u201cBy addressing the unique needs of immersive environments, payment providers can enable new business models, build trust with users and redefine the boundaries of commerce in virtual and augmented realities.\u201d",

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Apple on Thursday disclosed its iPhone sales dipped slightly during the holiday-season quarter, signaling a sluggish start to the trendsetting company\u2019s effort to catch up to the rest of Big Tech in the race to bring artificial intelligence to the masses.\n\nThe iPhone\u2019s roughly 1% drop in revenue from the previous year\u2019s October-December period wasn\u2019t entirely unexpected, given the first software update enabling the device\u2019s AI features didn\u2019t arrive until just before Halloween, and the technology still isn\u2019t available in many markets outside the U.S.\n\nThe countries still awaiting Apple\u2019s AI suite include China, a key market where the company continued to lose ground. Although he didn\u2019t mention China, Apple CEO Tim Cook told investors on a conference call that a software upgrade enabling the AI features in more European markets, as well as Japan and Korea will be rolling out in April.\n\nBut in the past quarter Apple also was only able to eke out a modest revenue gain across its entire business, although the results came in ahead of the analyst projections that guide investors. The Cupertino, California, company earned $36.3 billion, or $2.40 per share, a 7% increase from the previous year. Revenue edged up from the previous year by 4% to $124.3 billion.\n\nThose numbers included iPhone revenue of $69.1 billion. In China, Apple\u2019s total revenue registered $18.5 billion, an 11% decrease from the previous year.\n\nPart of that erosion in China reflected the iPhone\u2019s shrinking market share in that country, where homegrown companies have been making more headway. Apple\u2019s iPhone year-over-year shipments in China declined nearly 10% in the most recent quarter, while native companies Huawei and Xiaomi posted year-over-year increases of more than 20%, according to the research firm International Data Corp.\n\n\u201cWhile China is a potential risk, we think the appeal of Apple products as a luxury product and the potential of AI innovations will keep demand steady in the country,\u201d Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk wrote in a research note assessing the company\u2019s quarterly report.\n\nThe holiday-season results served to confirm bringing AI to the iPhone and Apple\u2019s other products may not boost the company\u2019s recently lackluster growth as much as investors initially thought it might after Cook unveiled the technology before a rapt crowd last June.\n\nThe anticipation that an AI-infused iPhone would prod hordes of consumers to ditch their current devices and splurge on an upgrade is the main reason Apple\u2019s stock price surged by 30% last year. But the sinking realization that an uptick in demand may take longer than expected has caused Apple\u2019s shares to backtrack by 5% during the first month of the new year. The stock initially slipped slightly in extended trading after the numbers came out, but later reversed course and rose by more than 3% after Cook said Apple is seeing a record number of people upgrading their iPhones.\n\n\u201cI could not feel more optimistic about our product pipeline,\u201d Cook said during the conference call. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s a lot of a lot of innovation left on the smartphone.\u201d\n\nA management forecast calling for revenue that will at least match or exceed analyst projections for the January-March quarter also seemed to bolster investor confidence in the company.\n\nThe concerns hovering around Apple\u2019s weakening iPhone sales come against broader worries about whether AI will be as lucrative for U.S. tech companies as once envisioned after Chinese startup DeepSeek released a version of the technology that was built at a far lower cost than had been previously thought possible.\n\nUnlike tech peers such as Microsoft, Google corporate parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook corporate parent Meta Platforms, Apple hasn\u2019t been investing as heavily in AI \u2013 one of the reasons it has been seen as an industry laggard. But that restraint could work to its advantage if DeepSeek\u2019s early breakthroughs in driving down AI costs gains momentum.\n\nApple\u2019s services division remained the company\u2019s biggest moneymaker outside the iPhone, with revenue of $26.3 billion in the past quarter, a 14% increase from the previous year. Although the services division has been thriving for years, it generates more than $20 billion annually by locking in Google as the automatic search engine on the iPhone and other products. That deal is now under threat of being banned as part of the proposed punishment for Google\u2019s search engine being declared an illegal monopoly.",

The growth in those products has offset a slowdown in sales of the iPhone and a saturation in the global smartphone market.\n\nThe \"services business in general in aggregate is accretive to the overall company margin,\" Apple CFO Kevan Parekh said on the earnings call after the report.\n\nIn the current quarter, Apple said its gross margin will be between 46.5% and 47.5%.\n\nIPhone sales slipped almost 1% in the latest quarter from a year earlier, as the company reported weakness in Greater China. Total revenue rose almost 4% to $124.3 billion.\n\nServices revenue rose about 4% to $26.34 billion, beating analysts' estimates. The business now accounts for roughly 21% of Apple's overall revenue. Last quarter, Apple announced that its services unit had turned into a $100 billion a year business.\n\n\"We were thrilled to bring customers our best-ever lineup of products and services during the holiday season,\" CEO Tim Cook said in the press release.\n\nCook's emphasis on services has transformed Wall Street's view of a company that's been defined over the decades by its iconic devices. For many years in the iPhone era, Apple's gross margin would predictably come in at between 38% and 39%, reflecting the company's tight grip over its supply chain and its pricing power in the market.\n\nBut with iPhone growth slowing in recent years, Apple's move into services has changed the equation. The company hit a 40% gross margin in 2021 and has continued to expand it.\n\nBecause of Wall Street's love of profit, Apple's been able to keep delivering for investors. The stock rose 31% last year, outperforming the Nasdaq, and the company's market cap has climbed to $3.6 trillion.\n\n\"We believe Apple deserves to trade at premiums to its historical comparable valuation, as it sets itself further apart as a provider of premium electronic consumer devices and high-margined digital services, and notably as the age of on-device generative AI gets underway,\" analysts at Argus wrote in a report earlier this month. They recommend buying the stock.\n\nApple shares rose more than 3% in extended trading after Thursday's report.\n\nWATCH: Apple's AI integration going to be very important moving forward",

            "content": "January 2025 feels like it's lasted about 27 years, but there's an entire year left, somehow. As usual, Apple is sure to make the rest of the year busy with a flurry of new product releases.\n\nThere will be new iPhones, of course, but we'll get to those later because they're just the tip of the iceberg. According to various rumors and reports, Apple is going to refresh most of the devices in its portfolio, with new Macs, iPads, Apple Watches, and other devices supposedly launching in 2025.\n\nWithout wasting any more time, here's everything we expect to see emerge from Cupertino before 2026 rolls around.\n\nMacs: M4 MacBook Air, Mac Studio, MacBook Pro\n\nLet's start with Mac computers, considering those are what made Apple into the company we know today.\n\nReporters like Bloomberg's Mark Gurman have said that they expect Apple to release a new M4 MacBook Air in the early portion of the year, likely in the spring. These could be some of the first new Apple products of 2025, in other words. A recent macOS update kinda sorta accidentally tipped off the existence of new 13-inch and 15-inch models, which are expected to be mostly incremental upgrades over previous models. They'll have new chips inside of them and perhaps some smaller hardware changes like an improved port selection, but nothing is certain on that front yet.\n\nGurman has also said that Apple could introduce a new M4 Ultra-powered Mac Studio in the first half of 2025. It would theoretically be the first device with the new M4 Ultra chip, and could possibly be, at least for a time, the most powerful Mac on the market. We could also see a new M4 Mac Pro this year, seeing as both Mac Studio and Mac Pro are currently stuck with older M2 chips. Apple might announce one or both of these devices at WWDC in the summertime, but that's not set in stone.\n\nLastly, it's expected that Apple will ship new MacBook Pro laptops with new M5 chips sometime this year, likely closer to the end of 2025 than the start of it. Another Gurman report indicated that Apple is planning big design changes for the MacBook Pro line starting in 2026, so don't expect much to be different about this year's new model aside from the chip powering it.\n\niPads: iPad Pro, iPad Air, entry-level iPad\n\nApple's tablet business is still zooming along, so naturally, there will be some new iPads this year.\n\nGurman reported back in October that Apple is planning to release a new entry-level iPad (which would technically be the iPad 11) sometime this spring. It'll use the same basic design as the last model, which was released in 2022. While it will almost certainly feature an updated chipset with improved performance, it's not certain what exactly will be powering this new iPad just yet.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

However, Gurman suggested this device could wait until 2026 to launch, so this one's a \"maybe\" for now.\n\nFor those who prefer to keep things light, reports also suggest we'll see a new iPad Air in 2025. Prominent leaker Evan Blass (via 9to5Mac) recently teased new 11-inch and 13-inch models powered by M3 chips. These devices could theoretically launch in the earlier portion of the year, but as always, that's not certain yet.\n\nApple Watches: Apple Watch Ultra 3, Series 11, SE\n\nLast year, Apple strangely didn't announce a third Apple Watch Ultra model, instead refreshing the Apple Watch Ultra 2 with a new color option in September. According to various reports, we'll most likely see the Ultra 3 in 2025. The new model could feature a new low-power OLED display and advanced blood pressure monitoring, which is the kind of thing that can actually save lives. It's also expected to have satellite connectivity like recent iPhone models.\n\nFor what it's worth, some of those same features, like the new display and blood pressure monitoring, are expected to come to the Apple Watch Series 11, as well. There aren't a ton of substantive reports about that device yet, though it would be fairly shocking if we didn't see it in the second half of the year, like we usually do.\n\nIn yet another Mark Gurman report, he said Apple will launch a redesigned Apple Watch SE for more budget-minded customers in 2025, as well. Apple hasn't updated the physical look of the Apple Watch SE since the first model, which was based on the Series 6. Considering that we're talking about a possible Series 11 coming later this year, that means it's probably time for a refresh with thinner bezels.\n\niPhones: iPhone SE\n\nApple has become pretty predictable with new iPhone releases. They get announced every September, and that's almost certainly going to be true again in 2025.\n\nThat said, expect the lineup to be shaken up a bit this year. Aside from the usual iPhone 17/Pro/Pro Max variants we've come to expect from Apple, rumor has it that Apple is working on a thinner iPhone 17 Air model that could actually be the most expensive iPhone 17 variant. At around 5 to 6mm of thickness, it would be the thinnest iPhone ever, with a possible 6.6-inch display. Interestingly, this focus on thinness will come with compromises, such as a potentially shorter battery life and only one rear camera lens, per reports.\n\nIt's been a few years since Apple updated the budget-friendly iPhone SE, but that should change in 2025. Apple is expected to release a new iPhone SE this year that is based on the form factor of the iPhone 14. Touch ID will finally be phased out of the SE lineup and replaced by Face ID, and it'll apparently also be capable of using Apple Intelligence features. Interestingly, it sounds like Apple is sticking with the notch rather than giving the SE the Dynamic Island treatment, per display analyst Ross Young. According to reports, expect the new iPhone SE to launch this spring.\n\nOther devices we might see\n\nIt's not often that Apple introduces a truly new device, rather than just an iteration on an older one. 2025 could technically buck that trend with the launch of a new HomePod that, unlike older models, comes with a smart display. It'll apparently have a 6 or 7-inch display with Apple Intelligence support, making it a pretty substantial upgrade over older HomePods.\n\nApple first released AirTags in 2021, and has yet to refresh the tracking device. That might change this year. According to Mark Gurman, Apple is set to launch a revamped AirTag device in 2025. It'll supposedly have better range, more precise tracking, and a new battery.\n\nAnother Bloomberg report (listen, Gurman's a busy guy) said Apple will launch the third generation of AirPods Pro this year. They'll allegedly feature basic upgrades like improved sound quality and active noise cancellation capabilities, as well as heart rate monitoring for the first time.\n\nAnd finally, at the end of this meandering journey through Apple's 2025 lineup, we have a couple of potential new smart home devices. Reports indicate Apple will refresh the Apple TV and HomePod Mini products in 2025. They'll both feature new chips for improved performance, naturally. The new Apple TV is said to use a new Apple-designed Wi-Fi chip with support for WiFi 6E, while the new HomePod Mini will allegedly have new colors and better sound quality.",

But it wasn\u2019t until 2023 that his passion became deeply personal. A close family member passed away unexpectedly from cardiac arrest, leaving Michael devastated. He felt helpless and longed for a way to channel his grief into something that could help the world around him and honor his loved one\u2019s memory. He created an iOS app called Pink with the goal of making life-saving knowledge accessible and appealing to children who might need it in a time of crisis. It\u2019s designed to gamify how to teach CPR to students \u2014 helping young people learn the critical skill through interactive and engaging methods. To build Pink, he used Swift Playgrounds and AVFoundation, a toolkit that lets apps handle and process audio and video for Apple devices, on Mac. He also created custom illustrations with Notability on iPad.\n\nI think CPR is something that everyone, especially children, should know how to do. I wanted these essential concepts to reach a younger audience in an interactive, lighthearted manner.\n\nMichael has been using Apple developer tools for programming ever since he learned how to code. He feels that they provided an effortless path into the fundamentals of coding. \u201cIt was very simple to get up and running on a MacBook and Xcode. Everything\u2019s intuitive, and it\u2019s just standard across the industry,\u201d says Michael. While the Apple ecosystem laid the groundwork, it was an invitation to a hackathon that further ignited his passion for app development, turning his curiosity into a driving force. There, he created innovative projects while connecting with like-minded people.\n\nYou spend a weekend coding up a project and it\u2019s a great way to dive into something where you\u2019re actually applying what you\u2019ve learned.\n\nIn the hackathon community, Michael found a safe space to apply his Apple development skills and collaborate with others. Despite not coming from a technology background, he transformed from intimidated newcomer to confident app developer. After years of seeing the Swift Student Challenge spotlighted in coding communities and online, Michael decided to enter the competition with his app, Pink, in 2024. His goal was to showcase an iOS app that was not only technically proficient but also personally meaningful.\n\nHe not only won the Swift Student Challenge but was also recognized as one of 50 Distinguished Winners and attended Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developer Conference \u2014 one of his goals since he began coding. Now studying for his master\u2019s degree in computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, he hopes to continue creating tools that improve lives and inspire others in the tech community.",

            "content": "Apple is reportedly expected to report muted revenue growth this week amid AI hiccups and competition in China.\n\nAs Reuters reported Wednesday (Jan. 29), Apple and its competitors Samsung and Google have been counting on artificial intelligence (AI) features to boost smartphone sales. However, Apple\u2019s latest iPhone lacked those features when it debuted, while some AI services have yet to debut in some regions.\n\nThe report notes that Apple\u2019s AI issues were spotlighted earlier this month when news outlets such as the BBC began complaining that the company\u2019s AI summary tool was generating inaccurate headlines. Apple later removed the feature from its operating system.\n\nAs part of that update, Apple has switched on Apple Intelligence by default on iPhones, iPads and Macs. Before that, users with devices that support the AI capabilities were prompted to activate it during setup, a process that involved downloading software.\n\n\u201cAI is the new technology innovation, the fact that Apple\u2019s handsets are lagging behind on capabilities is a key reason why their competitive positioning has weakened and the company has lost market share,\u201d Jane Hepburne Scott, investment manager at Aegon Asset Management, which owns shares in the tech giant, told Reuters.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple has seen its share of the global smartphone market shrink to 23% for the closing quarter of 2024 due to pressure from rivals like Huawei and other Chinese smartphone makers. That figure had been at 25% a year earlier, Reuters said, citing IDC data.\n\nThat data also shows a sharper drop in China \u2014 Apple\u2019s third-largest market \u2014 where the company\u2019s market share declined by 10 percentage points, to 17%.\n\nWhile the Chinese government has offered subsidies to smartphone purchasers to heighten domestic consumption, these subsidies are aimed at low- to mid-tier phones that sell for under $800, excluding high-end iPhones, Barclays analysts said in a note, per Reuters.\n\nApple has not been able to add AI features to iPhone 16s in China due to government restrictions that mandate generative AI operators to secure permission before they can launch a product. That\u2019s left Apple trying to land partnerships with Chinese companies to roll out its AI feature.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple has faced hurdles in another major smartphone market, with Indonesia banning the iPhone due to that nation\u2019s content restrictions. Apple had proposed making a $1 billion investment in local manufacturing, but Indonesia\u2019s government said that wasn\u2019t enough to meet a regulation requiring 40% of all content in devices to be home-grown. However, reports this week suggest the two sides are close to reaching a deal.",

This was because of the latter's partnership with Globalstar, which allows customers to send texts and contact emergency responders when there's no cellular service available.\n\nApple even took a 20 percent ownership stake in satellite company Globalstar in an equity deal worth around $400 million in November 2024.\n\nBut this week, it's emerged that T-Mobile's Starlink beta has a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta.

Bloomberg reported T-Mobile activated a limited number of iPhones as part of a beta test, as well as extending it to select users with Android 15, Google\u2019s latest operating system.\n\nThe partnership comes after T-Mobile previously stated Starlink compatibility only applies for certain Samsung smartphones.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple\u2019s current satellite connectivity set-up through partner Globalstar already offers users the option to send texts and reach emergency responders when unable to access mobile connectivity.\n\nSpaceX-owner Elon Musk responded to the news on X, stating that Starlink\u2019s technology supports images, music, and audio podcasts, with future upgrades set to enable video streaming.\n\nWith the latest update, iPhones using T-Mobile that are enrolled in the beta will automatically attempt to connect to SpaceX\u2019s Starlink satellites if mobile connectivity is lost.\n\nUsers can also manually enable texting or reach emergency services through Apple\u2019s existing Globalstar feature.\n\nHowever, while Apple\u2019s existing satellite service requires users to point their iPhone toward the sky for satellite connectivity, Starlink coverage apparently connects the device automatically.\n\nStarlink\u2019s services are currently restricted to the US, while Apple\u2019s Globalstar offering operates in multiple countries including the UK, Ireland and Canada. However, SpaceX is looking to expand its satellite connectivity to other carriers worldwide, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThere have been suggestions that Apple and SpaceX could team for some time. For example, Musk said in 2022 that the companies had engaged in \u201cpromising conversations\u201d about the integration of Starlink connectivity with Apple\u2019s devices.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission gave SpaceX conditional approval to use its satellites to enhance T-Mobile\u2019s cellular network late last year.",

Chief among them are new Visual Intelligence features, which use Apple\u2019s AI to tell you about the world around you.\n\nFor example, if you have an iPhone 16, you can use its camera and Camera Control button to identify specific plants, animals, and insects. You can also use the same method for event flyers and posters, which will automatically add those events to your iPhone\u2019s Calendar app.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Note: only iPhone 16 models \u2014 not the iPhone 15 Pro/Max \u2014 support Visual Intelligence features, as the iPhone needs to have the new Camera Control button.)\n\niOS 18.3 is out now and turns on Apple Intelligence by default. - Credit: Photo by Tucker Bowe for Gear Patrol\n\nA new default setting\n\nBut iOS 18.3 also changed an iPhone setting. In the past, iPhone 16 and iPhone 15 Pro/Max owners have had to manually turn on Apple Intelligence if they wanted to access those features. But with iOS 18.3, it turns Apple Intelligence on by default.\n\nThis means that if you have one of the newest iPhones (or last year\u2019s Pros) and you download the latest software, 7GB of data \u2014 the amount needed to support all Apple Intelligence\u2019s various features \u2014 will eat into your iPhone\u2019s storage.\n\nAdditionally, Apple Intelligence will take up 7GB of storage on any device that it\u2019s turned on for, such as a compatible iPad (with A17 Pro or M1 chips and later) or Mac (M1 chip or later). So, if you have one of those devices and don\u2019t use any Apple Intelligence features, there\u2019s a real case for turning it off.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdmittedly, if you have one of the newest iPhones, you\u2019re probably not worried about storage (at least, not just yet). But it\u2019s a little annoying \u2014 especially if you don\u2019t use any Apple Intelligence features (and there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re not).\n\niPhone 16 Pro running iOS 18.3\n\nHow to turn off Apple Intelligence\n\nThe good news is that you can quickly and easily turn off Apple Intelligence and take back the 7GB of storage that it eats. Here\u2019s how:\n\nOpen the Settings app on your iPhone. Scroll down and select Apple Intelligence & Siri. Toggle off Apple Intelligence. Confirm \u201cTurn Off Apple Intelligence\u201d when prompted.\n\nWith Apple Intelligence turned off, it disables all Apple Intelligence features, including its advanced writing and photo editing tools, Notification Summaries, and Type to Siri.\n\nReminder: Only the newest iPhones, specifically all iPhone 16 models and the iPhone 15 Pro/Max support Apple Intelligence.",

            "content": "A team of security researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology and Ruhr University Bochum has demonstrated two new side-channel attacks targeting Apple silicon that could be exploited to leak sensitive information from web browsers like Safari and Google Chrome.\n\nThe attacks have been codenamed Data Speculation Attacks via Load Address Prediction on Apple Silicon (SLAP) and Breaking the Apple M3 CPU via False Load Output Predictions (FLOP). Apple was notified of the issues in May and September 2024, respectively.\n\nThe vulnerabilities, like the previously disclosed iLeakage attack, build on Spectre, arising when speculative execution \"backfires,\" leaving traces of mispredictions in the CPU's microarchitectural state and the cache.\n\nSpeculative execution refers to a performance optimization mechanism in modern processors that are aimed at predicting the control flow the CPU should take and execute instructions along the branch beforehand.\n\nIn the event of a misprediction, the results of the transient instructions are discarded and revert all changes made to the state following the prediction.\n\nThese attacks leverage the fact that speculative execution leaves traces to force a CPU to make a misprediction and execute a series of transient instructions, whose value could then be inferred through a side-channel even after the CPU rolls back all the changes to the state due to the misprediction.\n\n\"In SLAP and FLOP, we demonstrate that recent Apple CPUs go beyond this, not only predicting the control flow the CPU should take, but also the data flow the CPU should operate on if data are not readily available from the memory subsystem,\" the researchers said.\n\n\"Unlike Spectre, mispredictions on data flow do not directly result in the CPU speculatively executing the wrong instructions. Instead, they result in the CPU executing arbitrary instructions on the wrong data. However, we show this can be combined with indirection techniques to execute wrong instructions.\"\n\nSLAP, which affects M2, A15, and newer chips, targets what's called a Load Address Predictor (LAP) that Apple chips use to guess the next memory address the CPU will retrieve data from based on prior memory access patterns.\n\nHowever, if the LAP predicts a wrong memory address, it can cause the processor to perform arbitrary computations on out-of-bounds data under speculative execution, thereby opening the door to an attack scenario where an adversary can recover email content from a logged-in user and browsing behavior from the Safari browser.\n\nOn the other hand, FLOP impacts M3, M4, and A17 chips, and takes aim at another feature called Load Value Predictor (LVP) that's designed to improve data dependency performance by \"guessing the data value that will be returned by the memory subsystem on the next access by the CPU core.\"\n\nFLOP causes \"critical checks in program logic for memory safety to be bypassed, opening attack surfaces for leaking secrets stored in memory,\" the researchers noted, adding it could be weaponized against both Safari and Chrome browsers to pull off various arbitrary memory read primitives, such as recovering location history, calendar events, and credit card information.\n\nThe disclosure comes nearly two months after researchers from Korea University detailed SysBumps, which they described as the first kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR) break attack on macOS for Apple silicon.\n\n\"By using Spectre-type gadgets in system calls, an unprivileged attacker can cause translations of the attacker's chosen kernel addresses, causing the TLB to change according to the validity of the address,\" Hyerean Jang, Taehun Kim, and Youngjoo Shin said. \"This allows the construction of an attack primitive that breaks KASLR bypassing kernel isolation.\"\n\nSeparately, new academic research has also uncovered an approach to \"combine multiple side-channels to overcome limitations when attacking the kernel,\" finding that address space tagging, \"the very same feature that makes mitigation of side-channels efficient, opens up a new attack surface.\"\n\nThis includes a practical attack dubbed TagBleed, which abuses tagged translation lookaside buffers (TLBs), which makes separating kernel and user address spaces efficient, and residual translation information to break KASLR even in the face of state-of-the-art mitigations\" on modern architectures.\n\n\"This leakage is enough to fully derandomize KASLR when used in combination with a secondary side-channel attack that uses the kernel as a confused deputy to leak additional information about its address space,\" VUSec researcher Jakob Koschel said.",

            "content": "A coalition of tech companies that represent giants Apple and Google want to stop the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from regulating their digital wallets in the same way it regulates payment companies.\n\nDigital wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay do not directly pay for goods and services and should therefore not be subject to an interpretive rule the CFPB finalized last November, TechNet and NetChoice \u2014 organizations that advocate for tech firms \u2014 said in a lawsuit filed Jan. 16.\n\nThe bureau\u2019s interpretive rule \u2014 which went into effect Jan. 9 \u2014 said that providers of digital wallets and payments apps that involve at least 50 million transactions annually are subject to the agency\u2019s supervision. The rule gives the bureau the right to supervise tech companies\u2019 use of consumer data, monitor how they handle fraud and complaints, and scrutinize account shutdowns.\n\n\u201cThere are fundamental differences between the regulatory standards implicated by funds transfer functionalities and wallet functionalities, given that the latter commonly do not store funds and merely transmit payment credentials (such as a consumer\u2019s credit card information) to facilitate a purchase from a merchant,\u201d the complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said.\n\nThe suit is intended in part to rein in some of the agency\u2019s authority, acknowledged Chris Marchese, director of the NetChoice litigation center. He argues the bureau overstepped its bounds.\n\n\u201cOur argument is that the CFPB lacks the authority to promulgate the rule,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nThe bureau misclassified digital wallets, the suit alleges, because it isn\u2019t Google Pay or Apple Pay making the payment, but rather a credit card stored on one of those apps.\n\nBy grouping those things together, \u201cthe agency is regulating outside the bounds of the law,\u201d Marchese said.\n\nA consumer advocate, on the other hand, said the case is a thinly veiled effort to help tech companies sidestep regulation. \u201cComplaints of a distinction should be recognized as efforts to evade responsibility through semantics,\u201d said Adam Rust, director of financial services for the Consumer Federation of America.\n\nThe tech industry\u2019s argument about digital wallets has some merit, said Ramnath Chellappa, a professor of Information Systems & Operations Management at Emory University\u2019s Goizueta Business School. But he stressed that a digital wallet is not the same as a physical wallet \u2014 a company that makes a physical wallet, for example, can\u2019t shut you out of your account. Apple and Google have some obligation to the consumer if their payment apps are vulnerable to hacking, he added.\n\n\u201cEven if this particular law doesn\u2019t make sense, that doesn\u2019t mean there shouldn\u2019t be any regulation,\u201d Chellappa said. \u201cThe tech companies have some responsibility in this.\u201d\n\nSpokespeople for Apple and Google did not respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit.\n\nThe CFPB, for its part, argues that technology companies have the same obligation under consumer protection laws as their payments industry counterparts.\n\n\u201cConsumers can face serious harms when they lose access to their app without notice or when their ability to make or receive payments is disrupted,\u201d the bureau said in a Nov. 21 news release when it finalized the rule.\n\nThe agency has always had the authority to regulate tech companies, but the interpretive rule gives the bureau the power to proactively investigate those companies to ensure compliance, the release said.\n\n\u201cSupervision is an important tool for the CFPB to assess risks that can emerge rapidly in this market,\u201d the release said.\n\nAn agency spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.\n\nTechNet and NetChoice consider the rule an overly broad effort to oversee the technology companies that they say CFPB Director Rohit Chopra has had in his crosshairs for years.\n\n\u201cDirector Chopra has made clear that the purpose of the Final Rule is to \u2018crack down\u2019 on \u2018large technology firms,\u2019 and is the culmination of his efforts throughout his tenure at the Bureau to do just that,\u201d the complaint filed on Jan. 16 said.\n\n\u201cThere is no agency at the federal level that is dedicated solely to supervising digital services, and so I think [Chopra] saw an opportunity with the broad language and to do what Congress has yet to pass into law, which is to create a regulator of digital tech,\u201d Marchese said.\n\nRust disagreed with TechNet and NetChoice\u2019s take on the CFPB\u2019s rule.\n\n\u201cConsumers are using payment apps and digital wallets to make electronic funds transfers, and they rely on them to handle their funds safely,\u201d he said. \u201cEnforcement actions taken by the CFPB show that consumers have had trouble receiving prompt and reasonable responses from them when they try to resolve problems.\u201d\n\nThe risk of consumers losing funds if their accounts are closed is real, Rust added.\n\nThe CFPB supported that notion in the Nov. 21 news release. \u201cConsumers have reported concerns to the CFPB about disruptions to their lives due to closures or freezes,\u201d the release said.",

Apple has consistently led Wall Street higher for years -- and its success is no accident.\n\nFor starters, the iPhone is the premier smartphone domestically. Since rolling out the first 5G-capable iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020, Apple's share of domestic smartphone sales has been 50% or higher. The ongoing upgrade of wireless networks to support 5G download speeds has led to relatively consistent demand for the company's iPhone.\n\nApple's innovation has also played a key role in sending its market cap to north of $3 trillion. This innovation includes physical products, such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, as well as its ongoing transformation into a platforms company.\n\nFor years, CEO Tim Cook has overseen the push to promote subscription services. By focusing on subscriptions, Apple has an opportunity to lift its operating margin, improve its already impressive customer loyalty, and smooth out the revenue peaks and valleys that often accompany major iPhone upgrade cycles. Apple's Services segment has been consistently growing by a double-digit percentage and now accounts for around a quarter of the company's net sales.\n\nLike most tech stocks, Apple is betting big on AI to power its top-and-bottom-line growth. Last year, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, which is its AI-driven personal intelligence model for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Apple Intelligence can do everything from write and summarize text to create images for users.\n\nLastly, Apple's balance sheet is cash rich, which allows it to aggressively invest in its future.\n\nThis $725 billion investment has been crucial to Apple's profit growth\n\nWhile this confluence of factors has helped Apple become the company it is today, arguably the greatest driver of Apple's growth in earnings per share (EPS) hasn't been mentioned yet. I'm talking about Apple's single greatest investment: stock repurchases.\n\nIn 2013, Apple's board kicked off a share buyback program that quickly became the envy of the investing word. Here's a breakdown of Apple's repurchasing activity in each of its last 11 fiscal years (its fiscal year typically ends in late September):\n\n2013 : $22.95 billion in buybacks\n\n: $22.95 billion in buybacks 2014 : $45 billion\n\n: $45 billion 2015 : $35.253 billion\n\n: $35.253 billion 2016 : $29.722 billion\n\n: $29.722 billion 2017 : $32.9 billion\n\n: $32.9 billion 2018 : $72.738 billion\n\n: $72.738 billion 2019 : $66.897 billion\n\n: $66.897 billion 2020 : $72.358 billion\n\n: $72.358 billion 2021 : $85.971 billion\n\n: $85.971 billion 2022 : $89.402 billion\n\n: $89.402 billion 2023 : $77.55 billion\n\n: $77.55 billion 2024: $94.949 billion\n\nCollectively, Apple has bought back $725.69 billion of its shares spanning 11 years and reduced its outstanding share count by almost 43% in the process. To put this into some context, the $6.08 in EPS Apple reported in fiscal 2024 would have equated to just $3.47 in EPS if the board hadn't authorized any share buybacks.\n\nAn ongoing share repurchase program serves a number of purposes for Apple. For one, as noted, it reduces the company's outstanding share count, which can increase EPS and make the company's stock more fundamentally attractive to investors.\n\nSecondly, buyback programs tend to incentivize long-term investing. When a company's outstanding share count declines by a considerable amount over time, it incrementally increases the ownership stakes of investors. When investors buy and hold, it typically reduces share price volatility, which can also make a stock more attractive to investors.\n\nAnd third, buybacks intimate that Apple's insiders (the board and management team) believe shares of their company remain attractively valued.\n\nNot even Apple's world-leading buyback program can mask these issues\n\nWith more cash than Apple knows what to do with on its balance sheet (and generated from its operations), there's no end in sight to this world-leading buyback program.\n\nBut just because Apple is buying back its shares at a breakneck pace, it doesn't necessarily mean its stock is a good value. Billionaire Warren Buffett has sold 67% of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in its top holding, Apple, over the trailing year (ended Sept. 30) -- and there are two good reasons why this selling is likely taking place.\n\nFirst off, Apple's physical product sales have stalled out for two years. Even though iPhone remains the top-selling smartphone in the U.S., stagnant sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac, and other wearables suggest consumers aren't being wowed by the company's physical products in the same way they have in the past. Though it's possible the incorporation of Apple Intelligence into iPhone, iPad, and Mac will turn these fortunes around, not even historically high inflation helped Apple grow sales of its physical product lines in fiscal 2023.\n\nThe other prominent concern with Apple is that its stock is historically pricey. Despite its aggressive share buybacks, Apple recently hit a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of more than 42, which is a level that hasn't been witnessed in 17 years. The stock market is itself pushing the envelope on the valuation front, and Apple's premium is even more pronounced.\n\nThough Apple's share repurchases are bound to continue, there's a lot of work to be done with the company's physical products before its current valuation makes sense.",

            "content": "Apple's foldable iPhone has been floating around the rumor mill for years at this point. We'd tentatively hoped to see it launch during September's iPhone 16 event, but we were left disappointed. The rumors persist though and it's likely Apple will want to get in on the folding phone game at some point. Having tested, reviewed and photographed almost every foldable phone available since Samsung launched its first Z Fold back in 2019, I have some thoughts -- and words of caution -- for Apple as it gets closer to potentially unveiling an iPhone Flip.\n\nI've written before about why foldable phones have disappointed me and how Apple could be the company to give the category a boost. Because foldables really do need a boost. We've seen new foldables from Samsung, Google, Motorola, OnePlus and Xiaomi, but none of them have managed to get me especially excited. All those companies' new launches were just iterations of what they already had.\n\nFoldables are decent on the surface, but beyond the novelty of the bending display, they don't offer anything truly unique. The more Android companies that join the folding fray, the more concerned I've become that Apple could run into the same problem, with the iPhone Flip being a generic, redundant novelty.\n\nWatch this: When Is the iPhone Flip Going to Come Out? 08:04\n\nA foldable iPhone needs to be more than just a regular iPhone with a screen that can bend.\n\nHere's what Apple needs to do.\n\nFocus on software\n\nUnfortunately, the foldable Android devices we've seen so far -- including the new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 -- are essentially just regular Android phones with flexible displays. The hardware is impressive, sure, but once you get over the novelty of a phone that bends in half it just becomes like any other phone. Except one you've paid a huge amount of money for.\n\nThe problem is that while the folding hardware works well, the software is basically the same that you'd find on the non-folding versions of the phones. There are few adjustments for the larger displays in the core Android software and most third-party apps don't really take advantage of the format. As a result, I'm still waiting for that \"oh wow\" moment that makes me see the true value of a folding phone.\n\nThe hardware on Samsung's Z Fold 6 has certainly evolved since the first Z Fold, but the software remains pretty underwhelming. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nI had hoped that Google, as the maker of Android, would develop more software features that would make full use of the folding format with its Pixel Fold range. I do like the most recent Pixel 9 Pro Fold and think it's probably one of the best foldables out there. But there's no question that it still feels more like an exercise in keeping pace with the competition rather than a genuine attempt to innovate.\n\nApple's deep developer relationships will hopefully play right into its hands here, with productivity, entertainment and gaming app producers likely poised and ready to create killer apps that show why foldable phones truly are the next step in our phone's evolution.\n\nStand out from the crowd\n\nEven on the hardware side of things we're already seeing duplication in designs and form factors. Motorola's new Razr Plus is essentially the same as Samsung's Z Flip 6 and there's little to choose between the OnePlus Open, Google Pixel Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 6 beyond a few minor touches.\n\nMost of the foldables we've seen so far tend to look alike. John Kim/CNET\n\nApple needs to avoid a folding iPhone that just looks like a clone of existing Android foldables. It needs to stand out and reinforce why Apple is the champion when it comes to product engineering. Let's not forget that Apple didn't invent the mobile phone, but its top-class designers and engineers created a product with the first iPhone that completely revolutionized what a phone could be.\n\nApple has time on its side here; by being late to the party and not rushing in with a \"me too!\" product, it's been able to see the progression of foldables from Samsung's first Z Fold, through to the more advanced models we have today. It's given the company an opportunity to bide its time and learn from others' mistakes and hopefully put that same spark that made the original iPhone so transformative into its first foldable.\n\nDon't skimp on the specs -- and then do\n\nA folding iPhone, if we ever get one, should be the showcase for what Apple can achieve with a phone. It needs to not just be cutting edge in terms of its design but also be packed with the latest, greatest tech the company has to offer elsewhere. That means it needs to be able to keep pace with the Pro models, not be a cut-down version that just happens to fold.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 6 is a nice bit of kit, but its hardware doesn't compete with Samsung's regular phones. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nWe've seen this with many other foldables, including Samsung, which typically packs its folding phones -- especially the Z Flip line -- with lesser specs than you'd get from its top-end non-folding models. The result is that you're forced to pay top dollar for the bendable phone but still end up with lower performance than your friend who has a much cheaper phone than you.\n\nIt's especially true with the cameras, with even Samsung's most expensive Z Fold 6 packing a camera setup that doesn't compete with the S24 Ultra. So you're left having to decide between the best camera performance or the best folding tech. Either way, you're having to make a compromise and that's not okay when you're spending well into four figures for the privilege.\n\nAn Apple foldable needs to pack the same triple camera setup from the Pro line, along with ProRaw imaging and ProRes video capture. It needs to have the latest processor capable of handling anything you'll throw at it and it needs to be able to run Apple's new AI skills (Apple Intelligence) at least as well as any other phone the company makes.\n\nUntil we get a real folding iPhone, we'll have to make do with my awful Photoshopped version. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nSuch a device will cost a fortune, so Apple also needs a more affordable option that's aimed more towards those who simply want the fun of the hinge without all the bells and whistles. Why? Because it needs mass market appeal to get developers on board. A hyper-expensive elite iPhone Fold will have too few adopters early on, and so why would developers waste time dreaming up and producing apps for so few potential customers? On the other hand, just going for the cheap and fun model will make it seem like a toy. A gimmick that gets some headlines but isn't really for serious users.\n\nTo truly dominate the market with developers on board, Apple will need to tackle both sides of the value equation.",

Inspired by the rhythm of humanity, the collection includes a special-edition Apple Watch Black Unity Sport Loop, a matching watch face, and iPhone and iPad wallpapers.\n\nAs part of the launch, Apple is supporting several global organisations whose work focuses on elements of rhythm, creativity and community. This includes grants to the Ellis Marsalis Center for Music in New Orleans; Battersea Arts Centre in London; Music Forward Foundation in Los Angeles; Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney; and The National Museum of African American Music in Nashville, Tennessee. Apple\u2019s support for these organisations builds upon the company\u2019s longstanding commitment to advancing economic, educational and creative opportunities in communities around the world.\n\nBlack creatives and allies at Apple collaborated on the design of the new collection. The collection, Unity Rhythm, weaves together the colours of the Pan-African flag: black, green and red. The Black Unity Sport Loop is woven in a custom pattern of raised and recessed loops that creates a lenticular effect, revealing green on one side of each loop, and red on the other. When the band is worn, the colours appear dynamic, shifting from green to red as a user moves their wrist, and the colour yellow appears in the transition, as if by magic.\n\nThe matching Unity Rhythm watch face features custom numerals formed by intertwined threads of red, green and yellow. The watch face reacts to the gyroscope, so when a user raises their wrist to check the time, the strands coalesce from a series of abstract brush strokes into digits. When using the Unity Rhythm watch face, distinctive, rhythmic chimes mark every hour and half hour.\n\nThe Unity Rhythm iPhone and iPad wallpapers feature the same custom lettering writing the word \u201cUnity\u201d, which changes orientation when the device is unlocked and locked.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe Black Unity Sport Loop is available for order on the Apple Store online today, and will be available in Apple Store locations beginning this week, for RRP A$69 inc. GST.\n\n\n\nThe Black Unity Sport Loop is available in 42-mm and 46-mm sizes, and is compatible with Apple Watch Series 4 or newer, Apple Watch SE, and Apple Watch Ultra and Apple Watch Ultra 2 (46-mm band only).\n\nThe Unity Rhythm watch face will be available in an upcoming software update, and requires Apple Watch Series 6 or later, and iPhone Xs or later.\n\nThe Unity Rhythm iPhone and iPad wallpapers will also be available in an upcoming software update, and require iPhone Xs or later, and iPad Pro (M4), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (3rd generation and later), 11-inch iPad Pro (1st generation and later), iPad Air (M2), iPad Air (3rd generation and later), iPad (7th generation and later) or iPad mini (5th generation and later).\n\nPress Contacts\n\nLoren Helmrich\n\nApple\n\nlhelmrich@apple.com",

This is on par with the best prices we have tracked on the new A17 Pro-equipped miniature iPad lineup and today Amazon is giving folks another chance to score one at the lowest we have tracked since release back in October. Pricing kicks off at $399 shipped with $100 discounts across all storage capacities as well as the Wi-Fi + Cell models.\n\nAmazon is now offering the 128GB model at $399, the 256GB at $499, and the 512GB configuration at $699, down from the regular $499, $599, and $799 sticker prices, respectively.\n\nThe deals also carry over to the Wi-Fi + Cell variants in all three storage capacities as well, but you will of course be looking at a bit more of a premium on the always-connected options:\n\nWhile I have made the argument in the past that, for some, the more affordable M2 iPad Air models are a more powerful iPad solution that, when on sale, get very closer in price to the MSRPs on the iPad mini 7. But pricing has jumped back up on most of the M2 Air configurations at this point, and the mini A17 Pro is now $100 under the previous sale prices.\n\nThat said, the mini is well, mini. Some folks love the more compact form-factor and would just prefer the more manageable, casual Apple tablet experience anyway.\n\nThis time around, the 7th generation minis features a 30% CPU boost and a 25% bump in graphics performance alongside the Apple Intelligence compatibility the A17 Pro chip provides. They also saw a nice little boost in RAM \u2013 they now start at 128GB instead of 64GB, and remain at relatively affordable prices tags, especially with deals like today\u2019s.\n\nDive into our roundup of our favorite iPad mini 7 cases and sleeves from $8.50 and then check out this iPad mini 7 vs 6 comparison feature piece for a closer look at what\u2019s new on the latest mini.\n\niPad mini 7 features:\n\niPad mini.

DeepSeek is free to use on the web and as a smartphone app, and the company charges a lot less for API access than OpenAI does for its most advanced reasoning AI model. Numerous threads on social networks popped up over the weekend with examples of people running DeepSeek on fairly modest hardware or using it to perform complex tasks.\n\nThe result? DeepSeek is now the top app on Apple's App Store, and the 20th most popular app on Google Play.\n\nThe launch and sudden popularity of DeepSeek could also impact the U.S. stock market, where Nvidia currently reigns supreme as the largest company by market cap. There are indications that DeepSeek has been built and trained for far less than competing U.S.-based models such as Meta's Llama and OpenAI's ChatGPT models. This, in turn, could mean a weaker demand for Nvidia hardware, which is commonly used for high-end AI applications.

            "content": "Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET\n\nApple has kicked off iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and MacOS 15.3 with one significant change affecting AI. Since its debut, Apple Intelligence has required the extra step of actually turning it on or opting in. But with the new versions, Apple's AI feature is enabled by default for eliglble devices.\n\nEnabled automatically for new and upgrading users\n\nThe release notes for the new OS versions released on Monday state that Apple Intelligence will be enabled automatically for new and upgrading users, giving them immediate access to its AI-powered capabilities. Anyone who doesn't want to use the AI will have to manually turn it off.\n\nAlso: I bought an iPhone 16 for its AI features, but I haven't used them even once - here's why\n\nEligible devices that can run Apple Intelligence\n\nOnly eligible devices can take advantage of Apple Intelligence. These include any iPhone 16, the iPhone 15 Pro, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, any iPad Pro or iPad Air with an M1 chip or later, the iPad mini with the A17 Pro chip, and Macs with an M1 chip or later.\n\nApple Intelligence now chews up around 7GB of storage, up from 4GB initially. Turning off the technology doesn't automatically recover that space, at least not right away. But if you don't plan to use the AI at all, you can certainly disable it. To do so, go to Settings, select Apple Intelligence & Siri, and then turn off the switch for Apple Intelligence.\n\nWhat else has been updated?\n\nThe latest OS updates kick in a few more changes. Following issues with AI-generated summaries, Apple will now more clearly indicate when a summary has been cooked up through AI by italicizing the notice. On the downside, Apple has temporarily disabled notification summaries for news items following complaints that the summaries weren't accurate or reliable.\n\nAlso: Why you shouldn't buy the iPhone 16 for Apple Intelligence\n\nDesigned for the iPhone 16, the visual intelligence option lets you dig up details on people, places, and things that you capture with the Camera control. With iOS 18.3, you can now use visual intelligence to add an event to your calendar from a poster or flyer and identify plants and animals.\n\nWith MacOS 15.3, Apple has added Genmoji to the Mac, so you can create your own custom Genmoji based on text descriptions and people from your photo library. Plus, Apple has fixed a bug that prevented you from generating a Genmoji without selecting a different person from your library.\n\nThe latest versions also add several security patches. Within iOS/iPadOS 18.3 and macOS Sequoia 15.3 are 26 bug fixes covering such features as AirPlay, Passkeys, and Safari.\n\nAlso: What is Apple Intelligence? Everything to know\n\nOtherwise, the new updates are relatively minor. More significant changes are expected with iOS/iPadOS 18.4 and MacOS 15.4 sometime this spring, most likely in late March or early April. Those will reportedly enhance Siri by adding on-screen awareness and integration with third-party apps.",

Amazon has just dropped the price of the current generation Apple iPad Pro tablets: the 11\" model starts at $849 after $150 in discounts and the 13\" model starts at $1299 after $200 in discounts. These prices match the best deals we saw during Black Friday. The new iPad Pro was released on May 15, 2024, and boasts significant upgrades over its predecessor including a powerful M4 chip and, for the first time, a gorgeous tandem OLED display.\n\nUp to $200 Off 2024 Apple iPad M4\n\nIn our 2024 iPad Pro M4 review, Jacqueline Thomas wrote, \"For creative professionals, the 2024 iPad Pro is the most powerful tablet on the market and is going to shine if your work revolves around a touchscreen. For the rest of us, though, the iPad Pro is simply the most beautiful display you'll find in a tablet, with hardware that's powerful enough to be a top-end device for years to come.\"\n\nThe 2024 iPad Pro is the best tablet on the market, iOS or otherwise, thanks to the new M4 processor which is both powerful and power efficient. Compared to the previous generation iPad M2, it performs about 20% better. However, the biggest update of the iPad Pro is not the M4 chip, but instead the tandem OLED panel which hadn't previously been seen on an Apple product. Tandem OLED is better than traditional OLED in two ways: 1) it's far brighter, and 2) it's less prone to burn-in. If you're wondering why this technology hasn't found its way into TVs, the answer is simply because it's not cost-effective at larger sizes. The iPad can get away with it because the 11\" screen is much smaller, but that's also a major reason why the iPad Pro is priced considerably higher than the other iPads in Apple's 2024 lineup.\n\nLooking for more iPad resources?\n\nIf you're not sure which iPad is best for you, we have an iPad guide which details which iPad is ideal for which use case.

            "content": "It's been a while since we've heard substantial rumors about the Apple Glasses, meaning the long-rumored augmented reality smart glasses are likely far away from launching.\n\nBut while it's looking like we will still have a couple of years to wait before they are revealed, the new Apple Vision Pro headset gives us a hint at what tech and form the Apple Glasses could eventually take. Expect augmented reality, eye-scanning features, and clever rendering to be employed, as well as advanced lenses and materials.\n\nFor now, it'll take a lot for us to wear Apple Glasses. But until we know more, here's everything we know about Apple Glasses, including the potential release date, price, design and specs.\n\nApple Glass latest news and rumors Updated January 27\n\n\u2022 Apple could release AirPods with infrared cameras, and they could be a big benefit to Apple Glasses\n\n\u2022 Apple Glasses could come with a custom version of visionOS\n\n\u2022 Samsung Securities believes Apple's AR glasses will launch in 2027 at the earliest.\n\n\u2022 We may see Apple Glasses, or at least a cheaper version of the Vision Pro headset, appear at the end of 2025.\n\n(Image credit: Martin Hajek/iDropnews)\n\nWe would not expect the Apple Glasses release date to be anytime soon. While we've now got the Apple Vision Pro headset, its hefty $3,499 price tag and goggle-like design would suggest Apple has some way to go before it can create truly advanced AR glasses.\n\nAnalyst Ming-Chi Kuo has tipped the Glasses to arrive in 2026. That's because Kuo has the belief that the metalenses the glasses will likely be based on only started being produced in 2024. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman is a bit more optimistic, claiming the headset could appear at the end of 2025 instead. Samsung Securities meanwhile has the Glasses pegged for a 2027 release at the earliest, which matches up with new rumors of a custom glasses-centric version of visionOS.\n\nA Bloomberg report also corroborated a delay, noting technical challenges involved in making Apple Glasses a reality. In fact, these challenges may be so significant that the expectation is that Apple Glasses are \"at least four years away.\" There's now some buzz that they may never see the light of day. Apple may now be prioritizing a cheaper version of its mixed reality headset instead, with a possible 2024 or 2025 launch.\n\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman doubled down, citing that Apple needed three to five years to release the smart glasses. The company needs to make a small device with a respectable battery life, which is no small ask.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

That is a fairly low entry point, especially compared to competing augmented reality headsets like the Microsoft Hololens 2 or Apple's own Vision Pro, which both cost $3,500.\n\nBut a big part of its cost comes from having all the electronics needed to run the AR experience built into the headset. Apple Glass, rather, will rely on a companion iPhone for processing, so it will have significantly fewer parts and complexity than Hololens. It'll work more like the Vuzix Blade smart glasses, which have a built-in camera and Alexa integration.\n\nStill, Vuzix Blade starts at $799. Apple's entry point is significantly more accessible, costing as much as some of it's top-specced smartwatches.\n\nApple Glasses features: What they'll actually do\n\n(Image credit: Techweartrend)\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, the Apple AR Glasses will bring information from your phone directly to your eyes. Specifically, the eyewear \"are expected to synchronize with a wearer\u2019s iPhone to display things such as texts, emails, maps, and games over the user\u2019s field of vision.\"\n\nRecent reports suggest that this could be powered by a custom version of visionOS, which originally debuted on Apple Vision Pro. That suggests that there will be some level of spatial computing involved. Presumably it would also offer some of the same apps as the Vision Pro.\n\nMostly though, we have no real idea of what these glasses are capable of. Fortunately, there are a number of patents that Apple's filed that could help uncover more potential features\n\nFor instance, a patent granted to Apple has further fuelled the rumor that Apple Glass won\u2019t need prescription lenses as the smartglasses will automatically adjust for people with poor eyesight using an \u201coptical subassembly\u201d. However, this patent could be for a standalone smartphone-powered VR headset or a second-generation pair of Apple smartglasses.\n\n(Image credit: Apple/USPTO)\n\nA more recent patent also suggests that Apple may employ a projection-based system that beams images directly into the user's eye. This way Apple would skip the need for any sort of transparent display.\n\n(Image credit: Apple patent)\n\nOne Apple Glass patent points to how it could let you view parts of the world you want to see, similar to Google's Street View. The difference is that this view would be projected directly onto the Apple Glass lenses. And you could digitally teleport to different locations.\n\nApple has a similar feature in the Apple Maps app now called Look Around, but this would be much more immersive on Apple Glass.\n\nOne of the more out there Apple patents suggest that Apple Glass could help you see better in the dark, via depth sensors that provide a greater look at the world around you.\n\n(Image credit: Apple/USPTO)\n\nApple Glasses may also be able to track your finger and hand movements more accurately thanks to some smart rings Apple has patented. Not only will that negate the need for many (if any) external sensors, the system may be more accurate this way.\n\nFurther patent wins for Apple have supported this theory that they will use wearables for a range of features, including support for finger gestures. There's been some speculation that Apple may ditch these extra accessories in favor of AirPods with infrared cameras inside. The idea behind those cameras isn't to take pictures, but to track gestures and movement \u2014 which could help control other devices like Apple Glasses.\n\nPlus the rings can detect what a user is holding in their hands, so the Apple Glasses can act accordingly. So if you're holding an Apple Pencil, the glasses will track your movements and translate them into handwritten text.\n\n(Image credit: USPTO)\n\nAnother recent Apple patent makes mention of \u201cprivacy eyewear,\u201d which would hint at a form of smart glasses, possibly the Apple Glasses, and how they could be used to keep what's on an iPhone's display private.\n\nThe idea here is that an iPhone's display would be blurred and only clearly visible through the pair of Apple smart glasses; see the patent image above.\n\nAs for the privacy of people on the other side of the glasses, a patent spotted by Patently Apple explores a number of ways in which Apple Glass recording can be made obvious to bystanders who would prefer not to be caught on camera.\n\nOne option explored by Apple is making the camera module removable. \u201cThe modular accessory would also make it possible for venues such as bars and theaters to ban the modular accessory while still allowing the HMD frame (without the accessory) into the venues,\u201d the patent reads.\n\nApple Glasses design\n\n(Image credit: idropnews/Martin Hajek)\n\nThe most current Apple Glass prototype reportedly looks like an \u201cun-intimidating\u201d pair of plastic glasses, while marketing materials suggest a Clark Kent-esque design.\n\nIt has a LiDAR scanner on the right temple, but no other cameras for privacy reasons (although that could change.) The glasses also come with a plastic stand with wireless chargers.\n\nBeing an accessory to the iPhone will definitely has implications on the Apple Glass design. Though the glasses won't be lightweight as your Ray-Ban aviators, they could be light enough and comfortable enough to work as everyday glasses.\n\nThere are no plans for the first generation of Apple Glass to come in a tinted variety. For the near future, you're stuck using your regular 'ole sun blockers. But if Apple Glass takes off, perhaps the company would consider expanding its offerings.\n\nApple Glass might also have a modular trick up its sleeve. The rumored pair of mixed reality glasses could feature swappable arms that each supply a distinct purpose or carry out a different function.\n\nAs for the Apple Glass displays, the headset may use Sony OLED displays for AR, according to display analyst Ross Young. Samsung Securities goes a step further as suggests these will be 1.4-inch MicroOLED or MicroLED panels.\n\nApple Glasses specs\n\nThere\u2019s no known specs about the Apple Glass yet, but we can speculate based on what we know about the current tech. For example, it will at least have the same field of view (52-degrees) and resolution (47 ppi) as the Hololens 2.\n\nIf Apple aims to create a true augmented reality solution \u2014 as opposed to a heads-up display that shows 2D floating notifications or maps, like Google Glass \u2014 it\u2019s reasonable to expect the Apple Glasses to connect directly to the iPhone on a dedicated Wi-Fi connection.\n\n(Image credit: Martin Hajek/iDropNews)\n\nIf the iPhone has to process all the video captured by the glasses\u2019 cameras and send back the 3D imagery to the glasses at a very high frame per second rate (a bare minimum of 60Hz, with a 120Hz refresh being optimal), it will require a much higher bandwidth than what Bluetooth can provide.\n\nAs for battery life, we can also expect a minimum of three hours if Apple wants to be competitive although we can assume that people will be more forgiving about this \u2014 especially if Apple provides with some kind of wireless charging glasses case that can extend its operative time through the day like with the Apple AirPods.\n\nApple Glasses wish list: What we want\n\n(Image credit: Martin Hajek/iDropnews)\n\nGlasses that look like glasses: We would like some natural looking glasses, like the ones in the concepts that you see on this page. I\u2019m sure that Apple wants the same thing. No one wants AR glasses that look like geek-wear.\n\nAR in full 3D: Some people would like just a heads-up display, but the true power of AR comes from full 3D integration. For Apple Glasses to be successful, you should be able to run any iOS AR app that currently works on the iPhone through the wearable device.\n\nAt least 8 hours of battery life: Assuming you're not running 3D AR apps all of the time and are periodically looking at notifications and 2D apps in between, Apple should be able to find a way to make Apple Glasses last through an average workday, though it may not happen in the first generation.\n\nHere's everything else it'll take for me to wear Apple Glasses.\n\nWe will keep updating this page as more Apple Glasses rumors and leaks come out.

            "content": "Let's get this up front: I don't hate the Apple Intelligence-powered summaries that pop up on my iPhone's lock screen. It's just that the feature isn't all that good yet.\n\nThese AI notification summaries, which Apple introduced with iOS 18, are supposed to provide a quick way to glance at important information from your apps. If you have multiple notifications from an app like Apple News, the notification summaries feature recaps of all your notifications into a short sentence or two, so that you don't have to read each individual notification.\n\nThese summaries, however, produce some truly absurd and inaccurate content. And because of that, Apple has made a few changes to the AI feature with the release of iOS 18.3.\n\nIn iOS 18.3, you'll now notice that all notification summaries are italicized, so that you can quickly and easily identify them as AI-summaries and not actual news headlines. Another big change to notification summaries is that the feature is temporarily disabled for all news apps, including Apple News and CNET, because of poorly summarized headlines. Lastly, you can now easily disable notification summaries for a specific app from your lock screen, in case you don't want to completely disable the feature but you're not happy with how it works with certain apps.\n\nHowever you feel about the notification summaries, it's important to know how to disable the feature. Even with the latest updates, you still might not be happy with how notification summaries work, so here's what you need to know.\n\nRead more: iOS 18.3 Is Here: Change These 8 iPhone Settings First\n\nWatch this: Apple's Monster iPhone Update: How Apple Intelligence Works on iOS 18.1 07:53\n\nI know Apple Intelligence is trying to help, but...\n\nThe notification summary feature on Apple Intelligence uses AI to \"intelligently\" summarize your notifications, so you can quickly scan through key details from your busiest apps. And while the feature works pretty well for summarizing long emails into succinct points, it doesn't always make sense with text messages.\n\nApple Intelligence takes things too literally sometimes.\n\nThe other day, I received several text messages about how bad a hike was and how that person felt \"dead\" (tired) after, along with some other sparse details. This is how Apple Intelligence summarized those few messages for me:\n\nNot the greatest message to wake up to. Nelson Aguilar/CNET\n\nThis is a text about how a trainer \"killed\" my friend with a particular tough workout.\n\nThe trainer killed my friend? Or the other way round? Nelson Aguilar/CNET\n\nApple Intelligence, and more specifically the notification summaries feature, just doesn't do well with sarcasm, exaggerations, jokes and slang. And that's a problem, especially with how informal text messaging can be. There's even a subreddit with a ton of terrible notification summaries that people have received from Apple Intelligence. It takes everything at face value, which can lead to some pretty horrifying, incorrect or simply annoying summaries for text messages.\n\nHow to turn off notification summaries for text messages\n\nInstead of stressing each time a disturbing summary appears, I disabled notification summaries for text messages. If you want to do the same, it's easy:\n\nLaunch the Settings application Go to Notifications > Summarize Previews Toggle off Messages\n\nYou can disable notification summaries for any app on your iPhone. Nelson Aguilar/CNET\n\nIn place of receiving condensed summaries of multiple text messages, you'll see every individual text message on your lock screen or notification center like usual. You could completely disable notification summaries (turn off Summarize Previews) for every single app on your phone, but as I mentioned earlier, it works pretty well for emails and third-party apps.\n\nYou can now turn off notification summaries from your lock screen\n\nAs long as you're on iOS 18.3, you can disable notification summaries on a per-app basis straight from your lock screen, without having to go into your settings. If you're unhappy with how the notification summaries feature is summarizing for a certain app, simply swipe left on the notification summary on your lock screen, hit Options and then tap on Turn Off \"App\" Summaries.\n\nYou can see that notification summaries are italicized on iOS 18.3. Nelson Aguilar/CNET\n\nThis will disable notification summaries for that app only, whether it's X, Amazon or Gmail.",

            "content": "For some time, if someone was to ask me how to get the best image and sound quality when watching the best streaming services, I would direct them to the Apple TV 4K without hesitation. I\u2019m not saying that the streaming box has built-in speakers, but listening and watching the same content via the built-in apps on my LG C4 OLED TV \u2013 one of the best TVs \u2013 connected to a home theater system revealed some serious differences. Before I go on, though, let me give you some context.\n\nThe Apple TV 4K has been the media streaming device of choice in my household for a long while thanks to its clutter-free home screen and Siri integration, which makes voice search as easy can be (and still to this day the voice search feature I\u2019m willing to use). I had it connected to my LG TV and a Sonos setup, comprising an Arc soundbar, Era 300 rear speakers and a Sub Gen 3. Everything worked as expected and my home cinema nights were taken care of with gusto.\n\nThat was until I moved the Apple TV into the second room at home to use for my XGIMI Aura 2 review. Whilst it was set up in the secondary room, my partner and I had to resort to using the built-in streaming apps on the TV. Until this moment, I can\u2019t remember having ever really used native TV apps as I assumed they wouldn\u2019t be able to match the picture and sound quality of a dedicated media streamer. It turns out I was wrong, as we both immediately noticed a difference in sound quality coming out of our home theater system, one that was positive and which took me by surprise.\n\nLoud and clear\n\n(Image credit: Future / Max Langridge)\n\nThe most immediate difference we noticed was how naturally louder the sound was. Because all audio was coming via our Sonos system, the actual indicated volume level within the Sonos app remained the same. But, when watching content via built-in Netflix, Disney+, Stan and Binge (two streaming services available only in Australia where I\u2019m based), it all came through with seemingly greater impact and scale as compared to what we experienced via Apple\u2019s streaming box.\n\nWe also agreed that some of the movies we watched had clearer dialogue when listening via the LG TV\u2019s built-in streaming applications. Challengers on Prime Video is a good example of this. The opening sequence at the tennis match brings in Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor\u2019s excellent soundtrack, pulsing synth beats and all. With the volume set the same for both versions of the app, the soundtrack had much deeper bass and a more spacious soundfield when playing via the TV.\n\nThe calls from the umpire of the match were also clearer. Their voice sounds a little subdued naturally, but the LG\u2019s Prime Video app was able to convey it with clearer definition. A short while later, one of the main characters, Art, is walking down a hallway while an announcement is being made. When watching on the Apple streaming box, I could only just about hear this announcement but couldn\u2019t discern the words, yet when switching to the LG\u2019s app, it was much more audible and clear.\n\nNot always the last word\n\nWhile my TV won out in terms of the sound output, the ball was definitely in Apple\u2019s court when it came to picture quality. I switched between both the LG\u2019s Netflix app and the version on the Apple TV 4K while watching the recently released action thriller Carry-on. I skipped ahead to the scene where Elena Cole is traveling down a freeway in a car with who she believed to be Agent Alcott, only to receive news that the man she\u2019s actually with is an imposter. What follows is a sensational, high-octane fight in the car\u2019s cockpit.\n\nWhen I switched between the two apps, the image delivered via the Apple TV 4K was clearly the better of the two. It was naturally brighter and exhibited greater color and contrast. Soon after the two start grappling with each other, a truck in front of their car has its tyre shot out causing it to flip. The rear lights of the truck have greater pop and the green/blue color of the truck bed is more visible when viewed on the Apple TV. The LG\u2019s Netflix app, by contrast, is dimmer.\n\n(Image credit: Future / Max Langridge)\n\nIt was the same with the aforementioned Challengers. The Apple TV 4K picked up that the movie was available in HDR10+, whereas the native LG app didn\u2019t as LG TVs don\u2019t support the format. Interestingly, the LG displayed \u2018Dolby Vision\u2019 in the top right corner (which I can only assume means it picked up the HDR data but outputted it in Dolby Vision because it knew the LG TV didn\u2019t support it). I was also able to access Dolby Vision picture modes within the LG\u2019s picture settings, options that weren\u2019t there when watching via the native TV app. These picture settings had the positive effect of delivering a more natural-looking picture compared to the \u2018standard\u2019 Filmmaker Mode on the LG TV.\n\nWithout having the opportunity to check for any differences, I would have said LG\u2019s reproduction was perfectly fine and in many ways, it is. But having the ability to easily compare the two devices does indeed reveal there are differences to be found.\n\nI don\u2019t have access to other external media streaming devices such as the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K or Google Chromecast 4K, so I can\u2019t personally comment on their audio and visual qualities compared to the LG\u2019s built-in streaming apps. I would ultimately expect them to at least deliver better image quality, as they\u2019re built with a single purpose in mind: to stream video content. Media streaming devices have a dedicated function to focus on and so should be more accomplished when faced with the same task.\n\nWhile TVs have built-in streaming apps, they\u2019ve got a plethora of other functions to carry out all at the same time and so can\u2019t focus all of their efforts on reproducing the absolute best quality available.\n\nEye opener\n\nHaving been someone who automatically discarded the idea of using a TV\u2019s applications, and using the Apple TV 4K for a couple of years, this realization was certainly surprising.\n\nThe differences in audio aren\u2019t so great as to be able to say Apple\u2019s media streamer is \u2018bad\u2019, not by any stretch. But I think the comparison does at least imply we shouldn\u2019t immediately put our faith in a dedicated streamer and assume whatever our TV is able to muster isn\u2019t worth the light of day.\n\nAnd considering my tests revealed one to be better with sound, while the other performed better with regards to picture, then I need to decide which is most important to me. My initial reaction would be to side with better sound quality, as that\u2019s what I deem to deliver a more immersive home cinema experience.\n\nIf you\u2019re able to attempt the same test, then I encourage you to do so. You may well think there isn\u2019t much difference, if any at all. Conversely, you may be surprised to find out the oft-forgotten native TV apps deserve to be given a chance. Ultimately, if you like the sound of something rather than the look, then that\u2019s all that matters. Or vice versa as the case may be.",

I\u2019m also a longtime Apple Watch user, and the Series 10 is almost the best possible wearable for my needs.\n\nLong-distance running should go hand in hand with a device like the Apple Watch, though some runners will always disagree. After finishing my second marathon in November, I praised the Apple Watch Series 10. Battery life continued to blow my mind, especially under real stress like a long race.\n\nHowever, the Apple Watch Series 10 has a serious workout problem that I\u2019ve kept experiencing time and again. The Watch will stop recording heart rate readings at several points during a workout. It happens to me during runs and walk sessions. BGR\u2019s editor Zach Epstein deals with the same heart rate reading issues during regular fitness sessions at home.\n\nIt\u2019s so bad that we routinely joke about dying while exercising. I\u2019ve been experiencing it for months to the point where I started questioning whether the Apple Watch Series 10 is misleading me when it comes to other heart rate readings. I use the Watch to monitor health parameters for 23 hours of the day. If the workout heart rate readings are off, who is to say that the rest and sleep readings are accurate?\n\nTech. Entertainment.

I\u2019ve reached a point where I regret replacing my Apple Watch SE 2 with Apple\u2019s newest wearable. Maybe I should have stuck with the mid-range model, even if that meant getting a replacement battery or an entirely new device.\n\nYou see, I\u2019ve found an algorithm issue that can ruin training sessions for runners with even bigger ambitions than mine, which boil down to getting out of the house more and moving my body. Never in a million years did I expect to see such nonsense in the Fitness app of my iPhone, but I did, and I\u2019m going to show you what happened. And yes, I suspect the heart rate readings issue plays into the error you\u2019re about to see.\n\nThe new problem\n\nWhile most of my runs are rather boring, as I look to safely increase my mileage every week, I also incorporate faster runs to remind my body to actually make an effort. These include speed runs, which should help me improve my personal record (PR) across various distances.\n\nOne of the exercises I do is run strides every now and then. I should do it every week, but it doesn\u2019t always happen. The current exercise I\u2019m on is something I set up on the Apple Watch SE 2 this summer, and I complained about how annoying it is to set up on the tiny screen.\n\nIt involves running a total of 10km, of which the Warmup and Cooldown account for 3km each. The 4km in the middle is split into 10 sessions. These are the strides where I run fast for 100m, then walk 300m.\n\nIn what follows, I\u2019ll compare a session in August with the Apple Watch SE to one with the Apple Watch Series 10 from Saturday.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick summary of each session. The first thing you\u2019ll notice is the big heart rate discrepancies. The Apple Watch SE 2 perfectly captured the heart\u2019s rhythmicity during the strong effort strides. The Apple Watch Series 10 makes it look like there\u2019s something wrong with my heart. Also, notice that the Apple Watch Series 10 misses heartbeats in several workout segments.\n\nNext, I\u2019ll give you a look at the intervals in the workout. In the August session, you\u2019ll notice it recorded everything perfectly. We\u2019re looking at the final seven Work/Recovery pairs in the screenshot and the Cooldown session. But move to the Apple Watch Series 10, and you\u2019ll notice the big problems.\n\nThe wearable missed a Recovery session. Well, what the Watch did was to combine a Work and Recovery session and give it a mind-boggling time. If that\u2019s not enough, the Apple Watch Series 10 missed the entire Cooldown session, which amounts to 3km of heart rate data.\n\nI blame it on the heart sensor\n\nStrangely enough, when looking at the splits, the Apple Watch Series 10 recorded times for the final 3km and gave me heart rate data. How can that even be?\n\nMy heart rate shouldn\u2019t have been that high, as I was cooling down, so I was running at a much lower pace. I caught the Apple Watch Series 10\u2019s heart rate sensor not showing a reading towards the end of my Cooldown segment.\n\nBut if the heart rate was up because I was running too fast, why didn\u2019t the Watch correctly register the Cooldown segment? It should have had all the information to do so.\n\nHere\u2019s another comparison between the heart rate recordings for the August and January sessions. Notice how the Apple Watch Series 10 doesn\u2019t register post-workout heart rate correctly, which is another big issue with the wearable.\n\nI\u2019ll also point out that I would have never encountered this Workout algorithm issue if it weren\u2019t for the heart rate readings problem. I know they\u2019re there, so I always check my heart rate readings after any fitness session.\n\nWith all this in mind, I feel like I can\u2019t trust the Apple Watch Series 10 to keep track of my health and fitness data accurately. The wearable\u2019s inability to measure heart rate readings is mind-boggling. But I never expected it to mess up a custom run like it happened on Saturday.\n\nNothing else has changed\n\nI\u2019ll add that this wasn\u2019t my first strides session with the Apple Watch Series 10. I haven\u2019t encountered the Work/Recovery problem above before. I went back in time via the Fitness app to check.\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve been on watchOS 11 beta on both wearables. I have the same type of watchband, and the Apple Watch Series 10 sits just as snuggly on my wrist as the Watch SE 2. I wear the same running clothes, and I enable the Water Lock when I have long sleeves to prevent accidental touches. Yes, it happens on the Series 10 and it happened on the SE 2.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 health sensors Image source: Christian de Looper for BGR\n\nAll I can hope is Apple fixes these issues with software updates. If not, I\u2019ll always question the data the Series 10 can offer and its ability to help me improve my running game. I\u2019ll have a good reason to ditch the Series 10 as soon as the Series 11 comes along.\n\nI might even consider a downgrade to the Apple Watch SE 3 that\u2019s reportedly coming this year. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d say that when I first experienced the Series 10.",

            "content": "If a thief ever steals an iPhone out of your bag or even snatches it from your grasp, panic sets in immediately. You also may have a lot more to worry about beyond just the cost of replacing the phone. What if they saw me enter the passcode and now have easy access to all of my messages, photos, and sensitive information? While it definitely sucks to have your smartphone nabbed, turning on Apple\u2019s Stolen Device protection can immediately cut thieves\u2019 access to your smartphone data. This feature is not automatically enabled and needs to be activated before the crime occurs.\n\nFirst released as part of iOS 17.3, Stolen Device Protection essentially adds an extra layer of security to your smartphone whenever the device is somewhere you don\u2019t regularly visit. Here\u2019s a quick guide to what the software feature does and what steps are necessary to turn it on.\n\nFor a deeper dive into Apple\u2019s anti-theft software, check out WIRED security reporter Matt Burgess\u2019s article about the feature from last year. If you have an Android phone, read my guide to using Android's theft detection features.\n\nWhat Does Stolen Device Protection Do?\n\nThe feature is specifically designed for situations where a criminal not only takes your iPhone but also knows your passcode and can unlock the device. When they physically take your phone away from you and bring it to a location you don\u2019t frequently visit, then the Stolen Device Protection security measures begin to kick in.\n\nThe main thing the feature triggers is it starts requiring your Face ID biometrics to access any sensitive features on the phone, like using your Keychain passwords, seeing your stored payment information in Safari, and disabling Lost Mode. Even if the thieves know your passcode, it will no longer work as a backup option; Face ID becomes required for full access. This also prevents thieves from easily wiping all your data off the phone so they can sell it, as that procedure requires FaceID as well.\n\nIn addition to forcing biometric authentication, Stolen Device Protection adds a security delay period for changes to safety features on the phone. If the thief wants to sign out of your Apple ID or turn off Find My iPhone, for example, they can\u2019t just hold up the phone in front of your face for a few seconds as they flee the scene of the crime. With the feature\u2019s automatic security delay, you have to wait an hour to make major safety changes to the device, and you have to confirm your biometrics at the beginning as well as at the end of this process.\n\nHow Do I Turn It On?\n\nBefore you\u2019re able to turn on Stolen Device Protection, you first need to set up a few other basic features on your smartphone. You probably already have Face ID and a passcode enabled on your Apple device\u2014both of these are necessary for the feature to work.\n\nNext, you\u2019ll need to check whether two-factor authentication is enabled for your Apple ID, which is a good idea even if you aren\u2019t using Stolen Device Protection. Check to see if you\u2019re already using this by going to Settings, tapping on your name at the top, and then choosing the Sign-In & Security tab. You should see whether 2FA for your Apple ID is on or off in the middle of this screen.\n\nThe last software feature you need to activate on the iPhone is Significant Locations. This keeps track of places you regularly visit, so your phone can detect whether it\u2019s in a familiar or unfamiliar place. According to Apple, the data is end-to-end encrypted and is not read by the company. Significant Locations is a bit buried in the menus\u2014find it by opening Settings, then Privacy & Security, and Location Services. After that, scroll all the way down until you see the System Services tab. Select Significant Locations, and you\u2019ll likely be prompted to unlock it with Face ID. On the next page, move the toggle to the right to finish enabling the feature.\n\nPhew! OK, now you\u2019re ready to start using Stolen Device Protection. And, lucky for you, after all of that prep work, the last step is a breeze. Open Settings one more time, then Face ID & Passcode, and fill out your passcode. Scroll about halfway down on the page, choose the Stolen Device Protection tab, and move that toggle to the right.",

That device is far from the end goal for Apple, with the ultimate aim being the introduction of smart glasses.\n\nIt's been a long road so far, but there's still a lot more distance for Apple to travel in order to get to that goal.\n\nApple is still keen to get there, despite seeing its competitors face difficult hurdles and the prospect of spending even more on a project that's still years away from realization.\n\nA continued push\n\nIn Sunday's newsletter, Bloombergwrites that Apple is still working on the technologies behind the concept, but knowing full well it's years away from release.\n\nWithin Apple's offices, it is reportedly conducting user studies to determine the appeal of various features and interfaces that the glasses could use. This also reportedly included creating a version of visionOS meant for use with the glasses.\n\nApple's use of in-house testing for head-mounted technologies has been going on for quite some time already, though it has taken extraordinary circumstances for that secretive work to come to light.\n\nIn 2017, it was revealed in a leaked report from an Apple Environment Health and Safety contractor that a person required \"medical treatment beyond first aid\" after testing a prototype. Eye discomfort was reported, after they saw a laser flash multiple times.\n\nThat work continues to be handled today by a secretive facility in Santa Clara, down the road from Cupertino. Those offices are handling the development of the AR screens, among other important technologies.\n\nThe location has fewer staff than usual, as there were layoffs at the facility in 2024. The decision to kill off in-house smartwatch display development may have impacted Apple's research into smart glasses displays as a byproduct of the layoffs.\n\nWhile smart glasses are the obvious thing for Apple to be working on, it's still looking into other items in the wearables space. There's talk of a rival to the Meta Ray-Ban spectacles and possibly camera-equipped AirPods.\n\nOff-road vision\n\nApple's development of its wearable augmented reality (AR) technology was born from its self-driving car work. Originally meant as a display embedded into the windshield, the concept was considered too expensive to implement in a normal vehicle.\n\nThe idea was scaled down a lot more, despite coming up with a working prototype. Instead, it was envisioned that everyone would wear headsets, which could provide all of the data but in a smaller and more manageable package.\n\nWhile this was a non-starter, the vehicle group still worked on AR technology. It also used VR headsets to demonstrate the capabilities of the in-development car project.\n\nAt the time CEO Tim Cook believed that AR was the way forward, superimposing images on a real-world view, not in an isolating way as with VR goggles.\n\nExecutive Mike Rockwell pulled the AR and VR work out of the car project and into what is now the Apple Vision Pro division. That team then spent two years making a headset prototype that used a pass-through system with external cameras, which Apple uses today in the Vision Pro.\n\nDespite spending billions on the VR headset, Apple continued to work on producing the technology to create the proper AR smart glasses that it wanted as a follow-up.\n\nA shared challenge\n\nLike the creation of its headset, producing smart glasses with AR features is a technical nightmare. It's a hard set of problems to solve, ranging from creating the image in front of the user's eyes to producing something light enough to be like regular spectacles.\n\nAll while dealing with other long-term issues like handling processing and communications, and somehow hiding a battery on the frame.\n\nHowever, Apple is far from the only company to be working on smart glasses.\n\nMeta Orion\n\nMeta's Orion AR glasses prototype is expected to arrive as a product in 2027, making it a very early release in the field.\n\nThen there is Google, which is producing the Android XR operating system intended for next-gen headsets and smart glasses. Gurman writes that Google demonstrated the operating system to him in December using various glasses, including some with displays.\n\nThose prototypes were considered to be quite polished, but unlikely to reach the open market until the harder challenges like battery life are solved.\n\nBatteries are a massive problem for VR headsets now, let alone lightweight spectacles. It's a weight that must be minimized and carefully placed so the glasses don't feel heavy to wear, which is extremely hard for a purposefully lightweight item like spectacles.\n\nApple certainly has to come up with a better answer than the current tethered battery on the Apple Vision Pro. But, short of magically making batteries as light as air, it's a difficult problem to solve.\n\nThat said, tethering to an iPhone or another device could help further, by handling processing for the glasses. This offloads another set of components and reduces the power draw, but it still means it'll be connected to another piece of kit.\n\nApple's rivals are also coming up with more immediate product releases too, which Apple has to consider. Meta's making not only the Quest 4 VR headset, but a follow-up to the Quest Pro. Samsung also demonstrated its own \"Moohan\" mixed reality headset during the January Unpacked event.\n\nBoth Google and Samsung have made noises that their efforts will be cheaper than the Apple Vision Pro, with release dates later in 2025.\n\nThese are immediate issues that could cause problems for the Apple Vision Pro, but then again, the headset has struggled to gain much traction since launch.\n\nThe competitors benefit from getting more time sharing newer products with consumers, with a shorter iteration time from the immediate consumer feedback, rather than seriously damaging Apple.\n\nThe ultimate test will be within a few years, when Apple is ready to come to market with smart glasses, with an intention to replace the smartphone. By then, its rivals could've released multiple headset and glasses iterations and gleaned that all-important feedback, making it very hard for Apple to make a splash in the right way.",

But in 2021, the iPhone-maker made it possible for Android and PC owners to join FaceTime calls. This was one of the initial steps Apple took to make its ecosystem more accessible, though these changes are still quite limited.\n\nFor example, while iMessage remains exclusive to iOS, Apple announced RCS support as part of iOS 18 at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Rich Communication Services is used widely on Android phones for texting and Apple's adoption should improve the messaging experience between iPhone users and those on Android devices. This doesn't mean the end of blue and green bubbles, though. The announcement is another sign that Apple sees value in giving Android users access to some of its most well-known features, albeit on its own terms.\n\nWhen Apple announced it was expanding FaceTime access, many were under the impression that Apple had made FaceTime for Android, when in reality the company had made it possible for people to join a FaceTime call from a web browser. This means Android and PC users can participate in FaceTime conversations, but there's a catch: they can't initiate calls directly, they can only join when invited. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to initiate FaceTime calls to Android users if you're an iPhone user, and how to receive FaceTime calls if you use an Android phone.\n\nFaceTime: How to video chat on Android or a PC\n\nLike with any call, someone has to initiate it. And if you're on an Android phone or using a PC, that person is going to have to be someone with an iPhone, iPad or Mac.\n\nHere's how to initiate a FaceTime call as an iOS user:\n\nOpen the FaceTime app on your iPhone or iPad. Tap Create Link. A screen will slide up from the bottom that says FaceTime Link. Click Add Name to enter a name for your chat. On the same screen, you'll see options to share the FaceTime link via Messages, Mail, Calendar or other apps on your iPhone or iPad. You can also choose to copy and paste the link yourself.\n\nThe process is nearly identical to generating a FaceTime video call link from a Mac.\n\nFirst, you must create the FaceTime link on an Apple device (left) and then you can share it with an Android user, which they can then open in their web browser (right). Screenshots by Nelson Aguilar/CNET\n\nIf you're an Android user, here's how to join a FaceTime call:\n\nClick the FaceTime call link sent by an iOS user. The link will open in your browser (you'll need the latest version of Chrome or Edge). Enter your name, and tap Continue. Wait for the iOS host to let you in. Enjoy your cross-platform FaceTime conversation.\n\nIf you're on a PC, this process works as well.\n\nRemember, Android alternatives including Google Meet, Zoom and Microsoft Teams allow Android users to initiate video calls, and remain great options for video calls between Android and iOS devices.",

            "content": "Apple\u2019s latest offering, the Advanced Commerce API, unveiled on January 23, 2025, provides developers with a powerful new tool for managing complex in-app purchase systems. The API is particularly beneficial for apps with extensive content catalogs, creator-driven platforms, and customizable subscription options with add-ons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe App Store facilitates billions of transactions annually to help developers grow their businesses and provide a world-class customer experience. Developers can use the Advanced Commerce API to more easily support exceptionally large content catalogs, creator experiences, and subscriptions with optional add-ons offered within their apps. These purchases leverage the power of the trusted App Store commerce system, including end-to-end payment processing, tax support, customer service, and more.\u201d \u2014 Apple Announcement\n\nApple\u2019s move aims to support the growing trend of diverse subscription models, including those with multiple creators or optional add-ons. These models can now leverage Apple\u2019s trusted in-app purchase infrastructure, including payment processing, tax support, and customer service integration.\n\nApple highlighted how video streaming apps could benefit by offering more bundled subscription options for users. Instead of relying on third-party payment processors and listing every subscription option for each content creator or channel, developers can now offer subscriptions as digital goods through in-app purchases, streamlining the process and providing more flexibility for users. Another example is gaming users, who will no longer be required to use digital currencies to acquire in-game items. Instead, they will have the option to purchase items or power-ups directly through in-app purchases, eliminating the need for an in-game currency system.\n\nDevelopers eligible for the new API will be able to manage subscriptions that offer content from multiple creators or provide additional add-ons, such as premium channels or exclusive content. Apps with large libraries of content, such as audiobooks or courses, will also benefit from this system, ensuring they can handle frequent updates efficiently.\n\nImportantly, Apple\u2019s new API does not alter the commission structure for developers but instead gives them more control over the management and flexibility of in-app purchases. This allows developers to bypass the need for external systems or virtual currency models.\n\nINSIDER TAKE\n\nThis new API is a game changer for app developers, particularly those with subscription-based business models or large, dynamic content libraries. It allows for greater flexibility in managing subscriptions with optional add-ons and creator content, addressing the needs of developers without forcing them into cumbersome workarounds.\n\nThe move signals Apple\u2019s recognition of the evolving needs of its developer ecosystem. By providing these enhanced tools, Apple is striving to retain developers within its platform despite growing regulatory pressures, particularly in the European Union, which has pushed for alternative payment processing options and third-party app stores.\n\nHowever, while the API provides developers with more control, it still requires adherence to Apple\u2019s ecosystem. Developers must meet strict eligibility criteria, and access to the API is not guaranteed. This exclusivity could limit broader adoption, as only developers meeting Apple\u2019s specific requirements will benefit in the short term.\n\nThe broader impact could be significant, especially for subscription services that have struggled with App Store limitations. With more flexible subscription models and easier integration of optional content add-ons, developers may find new ways to enhance the user experience, ultimately driving engagement and revenue growth.\n\nNonetheless, developers must balance the benefits of these advanced features with the continued reliance on Apple\u2019s payment infrastructure and commission structure. It remains to be seen how the API will affect the long-term relationship between developers and Apple, particularly in the context of growing competition and regulatory scrutiny.",

Even after using it every day, going to the gym, running outdoors, playing basketball, and occasionally dropping it from the charger, this Apple Watch still feels unbreakable.\n\nImage source: Jos\u00e9 Adorno for BGR\n\nMade of aerospace-grade titanium, sapphire crystal, and other materials, this Apple Watch feels lightweight, rugged, and resistant to corrosion\u2014something I couldn\u2019t say about aluminum Apple Watch models.\n\nTech.

This is why when I upgraded to a new color version, I decided not to add Apple Care+. After all, a year wasn\u2019t enough to make this device look worn out.\n\nThat said, I can\u2019t wait for this year\u2019s Apple Watch Ultra 3.

            "content": "Steven Cohen runs Point72 Asset Management, a hedge fund that has earned $38 billion in profits since its inception in 1992. That makes him the 12th-most successful hedge fund manager in history, according to LCH Investments.\n\nIn the third quarter, Cohen sold his entire stake in Apple (AAPL -0.11%), formerly his second-largest holding excluding options. He also started a small position in Axon Enterprise (AXON -5.28%), an artificial intelligence (AI) stock up 500% in the last 30 months. The new position is relatively small, but it still means Cohen was more comfortable owning Axon than Apple.\n\nImportantly, Cohen is an excellent source of inspiration, given his track record, but those trades took place in the third quarter, and the fourth-quarter update isn't due for a few weeks. So, here is a more current look at Apple and Axon.\n\nApple: The stock Cohen sold in the third quarter\n\nApple has cultivated immense brand authority through engineering expertise. The company enjoys a strong presence in several consumer electronics markets, including a leadership position in smartphones in terms of revenue. Consumer loyalty has also helped Apple grow its services business. But the company is beset by headwinds that threaten to drag on profitability in the coming years.\n\nApple's iPhone has lost significant market share in China. The company has yet to announce financial results for the December quarter, but Counterpoint Research says iPhone sales declined more than 18% in that period. Consequently, after leading the China market in smartphone sales in 2023, Apple failed to rank among the top three sellers in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Apple could lose $20 billion in annual services revenue if federal judge Amit Mehta prohibits Alphabet's Google from paying for default search placement in the Safari browser. His decision is expected in August 2025, and a long appeals process may follow, but analysts estimate Apple could lose 4% to 6% of its profits if the deal is prohibited.\n\nAdditionally, many analysts anticipated a historic iPhone upgrade cycle following the introduction of AI features (called Apple Intelligence) in October, but that has yet to materialized. Indeed, Craig Moffett at MoffettNathanson recently wrote, \"Not only have we not seen any sign of an upgrade cycle, but we have seen growing evidence that consumers are unmoved by AI functionality.\"\n\nFinally, Wall Street expects Apple's earnings to increase 9% over the next year. That consensus makes the current valuation of 33 times earnings look expensive. Moreover, while Apple stock has returned 72% in the last two years, its price-to-earnings ratio has also increased 72% over that period. That means shares moved higher on multiple expansion alone, not earnings growth.\n\nInvestors should avoid this stock.\n\nAxon Enterprise: The stock Cohen bought in the third quarter\n\nAxon is a public safety company that works with U.S. law enforcement, the federal government, commercial enterprises, and certain international governments. While Axon is best known for conducted energy devices sold under the Taser brand, the company also provides body cameras and other sensors that integrate with software for digital evidence management, reporting, and real-time situational awareness.\n\nImportantly, Axon has added a number of artificial intelligence features to its software products, such as automatic transcription and redaction of video evidence, as well as automated license plate reading. Its latest AI product, Draft One, uses body camera recordings to draft off police reports. Draft One achieved a $100 million revenue pipeline faster than any product in company history.\n\nAxon reported solid financial results in the third quarter. Revenue increased 32% to $544 million on strong sales growth in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings increased 19% to $1.45 per diluted share. The company also raised its full-year outlook, such that revenue is projected to increase 32% in 2024. Axon is well positioned to maintain its growth trajectory.\n\nThe company is the market leader in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software, and it has momentum in drones and robotics. CEO Rick Smith recently said, \"We are positioning ourselves as the indisputable leader in delivering the power of AI in practical, usable applications.\" Yet Axon has captured less than 3% of its $77 billion addressable market, leaving a long runway for growth.\n\nUnfortunately, valuation is somewhat concerning. Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 22% annually through 2025. That estimate makes the current multiple of 120 times adjusted earnings look very expensive. Having said that, Axon reported earnings above the consensus in the last 12 quarters, and it beat the consensus by an average of 34% in the last six quarters.\n\nIf that pattern continues, the stock may appear reasonably valued in hindsight. So, risk-tolerant investors with a time horizon of at least three to five years should consider buying a very small position today.",

            "content": "Apple released iOS 18.2 in December, more than a month after the tech company released iOS 18.1. The latest update brings a handful of new features to all iPhones, like a redesigned Mail app and the ability to share AirTag information with airline workers. It also introduces more Apple Intelligence features to the iPhone 16 lineup, as well as the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. And if you have one of those iPhones, image creation gets easier with a new app called Image Playground.\n\nRead more: Your iOS 18 Cheat Sheet\n\nThis app uses Apple Intelligence to generate custom images on your device. You can choose from a list of suggested prompts, or you can enter your own description of an image and your iPhone will create the image.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Image Playground on iOS 18.2. Note that before you use Apple Intelligence, you have to request it for your iPhone. To do so, go to Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri and tap Get Apple Intelligence.\n\nWhere is Image Playground on my iPhone?\n\nApple/Screenshot by CNET\n\nIf you have a compatible iPhone with iOS 18.2, Image Playground will be a new app on your home screen. The icon looks like a kitten in a soap bubble.\n\nYou can also access Image Playground in Messages. Here's how.\n\n1. Open Messages.\n\n2. Tap into a chat.\n\n3. Tap the plus (+) symbol next to your text box.\n\n4. Tap Image Playground.\n\nHow does Image Playground work?\n\nImage Playground uses Apple Intelligence on your iPhone and works like other AI image generators. Once you open the app, you can type a description of the image you want to create into the text box, or you can choose suggestions. (Check out CNET's guide to expert image prompting.)\n\nBut you can't use too many suggested prompts or descriptors. You can only use up to six suggestions and descriptors at once. If you try to use more, Image Playground starts replacing older suggestions with newer ones. If you have too many suggestions or descriptors, you might get a message that says, \"Try fewer concepts.\" You can add or remove these suggested prompts and descriptors at any time in the creation process as well.\n\nApple/Screenshot by CNET\n\nYou can also create an image based on a photo in your Library. Tap the plus (+) symbol in the bottom right-hand corner of the app and then choose Choose Photo. This will let you use one of your own images as inspiration for Image Playground. You can also take a photo by tapping Take Photo and your new pic will be used.\n\nIf you tap the plus (+) symbol in the bottom right-hand corner of the app, you can also choose the style your image will be generated in. There are two styles to choose from: the default, Animation, which is like a 3D image; and Illustration, which is more flat and cartoony. Apple might add more styles in the future.\n\nThere's also an option to insert a generated person into these images. Tap the silhouette of a person in the bottom-right corner of Image Playground, tap Appearance twice, and you can generate people to insert into your images.\n\nOnce you're happy with the image, tap Done in the top-right corner of the app and the image will save to the app.\n\nThe next time you open Image Playground, you'll see all your saved images in one place. Tap the plus (+) symbol across the bottom of the screen to create a new image.\n\nCan I use my own pictures in Image Playground?\n\nYou can use your own pictures as a basis for an AI generated image, yes. When you're creating a new image in Image Playground, tap the plus (+) symbol in the bottom right-hand corner of the page then tap Choose Photo to select a photo from your Library or Take Photo to use your Camera to take a new picture. Then you can describe the image or select a prompt. You can swipe through the generated images until you find one you like, then tap Done in the top-right corner of the app and the image will save to the app.\n\nCan I edit generated images in Image Playground after they're saved?\n\nAfter you've created an image in the app, you can go back and edit it further. Open the app and tap the generated image you want to edit, and tap Edit in the bottom-right corner of your screen. You can choose more suggestions, enter another descriptor or change the art style.\n\nWill Image Playground always make an image?\n\nIn a very technical sense, yes, it will always make an image. Whether it's what you're looking for is another story. I entered the prompts \"chef,\" \"bowtie\" and \"volcano\" and got an image of a kitchen that had grown a volcano on its countertop. Sadly, there was no chef or bowtie in sight -- maybe the volcano got them?\n\nApple/Screenshot by CNET\n\nApple will likely continue to make improvements to Image Playground in the future so hopefully images will more closely match your descriptors. In the meantime, we have kitchen volcanoes.\n\nFor more on iOS 18, here's what to know about iOS 18.2, how to create custom emoji with Genmoji and what to know about Mail Categories.

One of the most notable companies to collapse when the late-\u201990s tech bubble burst, Sun sold computers, components, services and software. (It created the Java programming language and the Solaris operating system.)\n\nFounded in 1982, Sun Microsystems became a big player in Silicon Valley before eventually being acquired by Oracle in 2009. Today, its iconic former campus is the main HQ of Facebook. (And, as seen in this video, Sun\u2019s logo remains on the reverse of Facebook\u2019s sign! It\u2019s all about motivation.)\n\nSun made workstations and crossed over with Apple in various ways. As a result, people talked about a merger of the two companies as far back as 1988. As Owen Linzmayer notes in his tremendous (and in great need of an update) book, Apple Confidential 2.0, the deal almost happened by the fall of 1990. The idea was that Sun CEO Scott McNealy would become COO of both companies. But Apple backed out at the last minute.\n\nThe possibility of Apple and Sun merging arose again in December 1995, prompted by fear of a post-Windows 95 Microsoft. With Microsoft still years away from hitting its zenith, both Sun and Apple had good reason to be afraid for their futures.\n\nApple\u2019s missteps encourage Sun Microsystems deal\n\nEven without Microsoft, Apple was doing plenty to hurt itself. The company put out digital cameras and games consoles instead of focusing on core products. Cupertino also made a disastrous clone Mac deal that cost the company money and watered down its brand.\n\nMcNealy met with Apple\u2019s board at The St. Regis hotel in New York City to begin working out details of a stock swap that would, as with the previous deal, put the Sun CEO in charge. Ultimately, negotiations fell apart as Apple announced massive losses of $69 million.\n\nBy the end of 1996, everything had changed. Steve Jobs was back at Apple, then-CEO Gil Amelio was on the rocks, and Apple was primed for a comeback. But things could have been very, very different.",

Request your EXTENDED TRIAL today and understand why Mosyle is everything you need to work with Apple.\n\nWith so many organizations looking to deploy the Mac, they might want to know the best path for migration. Apple\u2019s Mac Adoption Blueprint answers that question with data-backed information and easy-to-follow steps for IT technicians and internal IT decision-makers. This guide also highlights how significant cost savings are made by switching. The included research from Forrester claims that companies can save $843 per computer over three years compared to Windows. These savings are gained from lower software costs, reduced IT support needs, and higher Mac trade in value (the latter is absolutely critical). Let\u2019s look deeper at the report.\n\nSome of my favorite gear Aqara Smart Lock U50 Upgrade your doors with Apple Home Key and the Aqara U50.\n\nAbout Apple @ Work: Bradley Chambers managed an enterprise IT network from 2009 to 2021. Through his experience deploying and managing firewalls, switches, a mobile device management system, enterprise grade Wi-Fi, 1000s of Macs, and 1000s of iPads, Bradley will highlight ways in which Apple IT managers deploy Apple devices, build networks to support them, train users, stories from the trenches of IT management, and ways Apple could improve its products for IT departments.\n\nBeyond cost, the report also shows how the Mac delivers on employee experience. With great hardware (reliable) and a software experience that delights users, employees who use a Mac are happier and deliver better outcomes at work.\n\nBuilding a supportive foundation\n\nIn the report/guide, Apple higlights the importance of starting with leadership alignment before switching. Companies need executive sponsors/champions across functional teams, including IT, front-line managers, and excited employees. This collaboration ensures the program is well-rounded and ready to address any challenge vs nitpicking problems.\n\nAccording to Apple, surveys are another key tool for IT teams to consider. They suggest asking employees about their technology preferences and current pain points to tailor the rollout to their needs. These insights guide the program\u2019s goals and make the switch easier for everyone involved.\n\nSome of my favorite gear eufyCam 2C Upgrade your home security with wireless cameras that includes HomeKit compatibility.\n\nModern deployment for the modern workplace\n\nOne standout feature in the guide is zero-touch deployment (something that I still think is mind-blowing in that it works). With Apple Business Manager/School Manager and device management tools, Macs arrive ready to use, requiring no manual setup from IT. Employees can unbox a shrink-wrapped Mac, and it automatically configures itself. For companies already managing iPhones or iPads, integrating Macs is straightforward, as they share the same overall management frameworks.\n\nMacs have enterprise-grade protections like encryption, secure boot, and built-in antivirus/malware software (XProtect). These ensure that IT teams and employees can trust the devices immediately, but that\u2019s not all.\n\nKeeping Macs secure with built-in EDR\n\nSecurity is one area where Apple does not compromise, and the Mac Adoption Blueprint clarifies it. It highlights how Macs come equipped with a robust endpoint security framework that supports advanced detection and response capabilities. This framework allows IT to stay on top of threats using tools that run securely in user space so they don\u2019t interfere with macOS performance. When CrowdStrike caused a Windows outage last summer, the benefits of Apple\u2019s design were praised\n\nApple\u2019s guide points to third-party EDR solutions that integrate smoothly with Apple\u2019s security framework. Whether you\u2019re monitoring threats or responding to incidents, it\u2019s all about giving IT teams the tools they need to protect employees without slowing them down. Apple clarifies that security is built into every Mac, not bolted on as an afterthought. I remember when Apple moved the entire security industry to its new framework. It wasn\u2019t easy, but doing what\u2019s right for long-term security is never easy.\n\nSome of my favorite gear Abode Home Security System Abode is the best home security system and includes compatibility with HomeKit.\n\nApp compatibility is generally a solved problem\n\nSwitching to Mac doesn\u2019t mean starting over with your tools; Apple clarifies that in the Mac Adoption Blueprint. Most daily business apps your team uses\u2014like Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Zoom, and Salesforce\u2014are fully compatible with macOS. The guide positions this as an opportunity, not a hurdle, encouraging businesses to audit their apps and trim down to what matters. Easy workarounds exist for those few legacy systems that might not be Mac-ready. Apple recommends solutions like Parallels or VMware to keep things running smoothly during the transition.\n\nI\u2019ve long said that Apple\u2019s move to SaaS-based cloud tools in the enterprise has been a big part of its growth as a dominant endpoint in the enterprise.\n\nWrap up\n\nThe Mac Adoption Blueprint is an excellent resource for building a workplace built on macOS. If you want to modernize your technology stack, this resource provides a great way to start planning.

We recently discovered that the upcoming tvOS 18.3 update for the Apple TV has a new UNITY25 reference hidden within its code, which suggests that the Black Unity campaign may continue in 2025. If so, it is likely that Apple will make an announcement about it next week.\n\n\n\nIt is unclear if there will be any other product announcements next week beyond a new Black Unity band. Apple is expected to announce updated MacBook Air models with the M4 chip in early 2025, and Powerbeats Pro 2 are also coming soon, but Gurman did not mention anything beyond a potential Black Unity band in his social media post today.\n\nApple is expected to release iOS 18.3, macOS 15.3, and other software updates next week, following more than a month of beta testing.\n\nCross your fingers that the merchandise updates means that Apple will have a busy week ahead, but keep your expectations tempered.",

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best bear market stocks to invest in now.\n\nAs of January 2025, the prevailing sentiment among US economic experts leans towards cautious optimism regarding the stock market\u2019s trajectory. While concerns about potential downturns exist, explicit predictions of a bear market in 2025 are not prominent. For example, economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal have adjusted their forecasts, anticipating higher inflation and interest rates in the coming years. They note that inflation has been higher than expected, with the consumer-price index rising 2.9% in December, leading to projections of continued inflation momentum into 2025. Despite these concerns, the US economy has demonstrated resilience, driven by strong consumer spending and a declining unemployment rate, which fell to 4.1% in December. Consequently, economists estimate a 22% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, marking the lowest probability in three years.\n\nJeremy Siegel, a renowned economist from the Wharton School, suggests that the stock market could experience a cooling-off period in 2025, particularly within the technology sector, amid concerns over the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. He also anticipates that interest rates might decline, which could influence market dynamics. Additionally, MarketWatch reports that foreign retail investors have been purchasing US stocks at unprecedented rates, with $76.5 billion acquired in the last three months. Historically, such surges in foreign investment have preceded market downturns, as observed before the 1987 crash, the 2000 dot-com bubble burst, and the 2008 financial crisis. This pattern suggests that increased foreign investment may serve as a contrary indicator, signaling potential market peaks.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nSeveral economic experts also predict a bear market in 2025. For example, Cem Karsan, a volatility trader and founder of Kai Volatility, foresees a possible stock market decline of up to 40% within the next year, per a report by MarketWatch. He emphasizes that the Federal Reserve\u2019s management of rate cuts and market expectations will be crucial. Karsan predicts that the 10-year Treasury yield could surpass 6% by the third quarter, which would exert additional pressure on stocks. He suggests that the Fed\u2019s approach can either delay or accelerate the decline; a dovish stance might prolong the market rally but lead to a harder drop, whereas a hawkish stance could cause an earlier slide.\n\nStory Continues",

She\u2019ll be a top deputy to AI chief John Giannandrea, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the change hasn\u2019t been announced publicly.\n\nThe move helps bolster a team that\u2019s racing to make Apple a leader in AI \u2014 an area where it\u2019s fallen behind technology peers. The company has struggled to match the capabilities of OpenAI, Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. And its Apple Intelligence platform has suffered from a slow and bumpy rollout.\n\nThe Siri digital assistant, groundbreaking when it was unveiled in 2011, has come to symbolize Apple\u2019s shortcomings in AI. Upstarts like OpenAI have created their own, more versatile chatbots, and smartphone rival Samsung Electronics Co. has been faster to weave artificial intelligence features into its software. Amazon.com Inc. also is adapting its Alexa platform for the AI world.\n\nVorrath, who has spent 36 years at Apple, is known for managing the development of tough software projects. She\u2019s also put procedures in place that can catch and fix bugs. Vorrath joins the new team from Apple\u2019s hardware engineering division, where she helped launch the Vision Pro headset.\n\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment on the move.\n\nOver the years, Vorrath has had a hand in several of Apple\u2019s biggest endeavors. In the mid-2000s, she was chosen to lead project management for the original iPhone software group and get the iconic device ready for consumers. Until 2019, she oversaw project management for the iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems, before taking on the Vision Pro software. Haley Allen will replace Vorrath overseeing program management for visionOS, the headset\u2019s operating system, according to the people.\n\nPrior to joining Giannandrea\u2019s organization, Vorrath had spent several weeks advising Kelsey Peterson, the group\u2019s previous head of program management. Peterson will now report to Vorrath \u2014 as will two other AI executives, Cindy Lin and Marc Schonbrun. Giannandrea, who joined Apple from Google in 2018, disclosed the changes in a memo sent to staffers.\n\nStory Continues",

Apple Intelligence Ads Say Yes 06:15\n\nWhen will iOS 18.3 be widely released?\n\nSince the iOS 18.3 RC is out, Apple's engineers are likely working through any last-minute glitches that invariably crop up with every major release. Fortunately, that work isn't entirely behind closed doors: The first iOS 18.3 Public Beta was released in late December. Apple seeds its prerelease versions first to developers and then, when the code seems pretty stable, to the Public Beta programs.\n\nWe can, however, look at last year's iOS 17 schedule for guidance, since iOS 17.2 arrived in the same time period one year ago as iOS 18.2 did. Based on that timing, it's a good bet that iOS 18.3 will arrive in as early as January 27.\n\nJames Martin/CNET\n\nWhich devices will run Apple Intelligence?\n\nRemember that Apple Intelligence will work only with the following models that are equipped with the A17 Pro or later (iPhone and iPad Mini) and M1 or later (Mac and iPad) processors:\n\niPhone 15 Pro\n\niPhone 15 Pro Max\n\niPhone 16\n\niPhone 16 Plus\n\niPhone 16 Pro\n\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\niPad Mini (Late 2024)\n\niPad Air (M1 and later)\n\niPad Pro (M1 and later)\n\niPad (M1 and later)\n\nMac computers with Apple Silicon (M-series)\n\nIf your devices are on that list, remember that you need to jump through a couple of hoops to activate Apple Intelligence.\n\nRead more: Make sure you know about these 9 hidden iOS 18 features and how to remove annoying banners and other distractions in Safari.",

It\u2019s made with regionally-sourced timber and other low-carbon materials; surfaces are soft and undulating, and light and shadow play off the curved perimeter roof. Interiors feel sculptural and dynamic, simultaneously nodding to the Art Deco architecture of the city.\n\nOccupying a standalone pavilion, the structure covers a large central space accessed from glazed entrances. This is filled with Apple's signature tables on a floor made of biomass-based terrazzo, flanked by an oak wall system which incorporates service areas such as a pick-up area, a Genius Bar and a demonstration space for VR headsets.\n\n(Image credit: Apple)\n\nApple retail design lead BJ Siegel has said that, considering its size and the fact that it is free-standing, it was decided that locally-sourced materials should be used in the construction of the Apple Miami World Center. The store also runs on 100 percent renewable energy.\n\nVarious pains have been taken to connect the interior with surrounding green spaces. Upon entry, customers are greeted with flora inspired by Miami\u2019s Latin American influence. Rather than putting plants in planters, the Apple Miami Worldcenter is set within a densely-planted public space. The roof, which it calls a \u2018raised garden\u2019, is also covered in greenery, which is visible from the surrounding towers. Although the building echoes the precise, geometric architecture of other Apple Stores, it is softened by organic shapes, warm tones and an abundance of plant life.\n\n(Image credit: Apple)\n\nSiegel explained that biophilic design has been part of Apple's design principles for some time now \u2013 the company\u2019s recently-launched store in Abu Dhabi, for example, is surrounded by a stepped waterfall and home to rows of full-height trees. That said, this has usually been the extent of it: large glass storefronts and interior planting. \u2018The climate in Miami offered a different opportunity, allowing us to embrace the lush landscape and gardens of South Florida to create a densely vegetated urban public space,\u2019 said Siegel.\n\nWallpaper* Newsletter Receive our daily digest of inspiration, escapism and design stories from around the world direct to your inbox.

            "content": "PFAS, more commonly referred to as \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d are everywhere. Studies have detected the harmful compounds in a plethora of everyday objects, from popular nonstick pans to waterproof clothing and just about anything in between. Now, a new class action lawsuit alleges some of those harmful chemicals are present in several Apple Watch wristbands at worrying levels. The suit was filed in the Northern District of California this week and first spotted by The Register. If true, the complaint only further confirms just how difficult it is to avoid contact with PFAS in everyday life.\n\nThe suit specifically sets its sights on three Apple Watch band models: The sports band that comes with most devices, the \u201cOcean Band,\u201d and the Nike-branded sports band. Each of these, the suit alleges, includes harmful levels of PFAS that are used to make the bands resistant to sweat and skin oil. Lawyers cite a recent study which determined several smartwatch bands had median levels of detectable perfluorohexanoic acid, (773 ng/g,) a PFAS, in much higher levels than found in previous analyzing cosmetics (199 ng/g). It\u2019s possible Perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) may pass through skin at different levels with wearables than much finer cosmetics. Scientists also have not established clear guidelines on safe levels of PFHxA exposure, though federal agencies do regulate the amount of the compound that can be detected in drinking water. The suit claims Apple could have achieved similar performance with alternative compounds like silicone, but instead opted for PFAS to drive down cost. These choices were made, the suit claims, despite widespread public knowledge of the potential health risks associated with PFAS.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

The substances trace their origin to 1938 with the creation of Teflon. Since then, variations have been used in everything from fertilizer and stain-resistant fabrics to popcorn bags. PFAS are valuable because they bond carbon and fluorine atoms in a way that makes them uniquely resistant to heat, water, and grease. They are also essentially indestructible. That means trace amounts of these chemicals build up in the environment and can take more than a thousand years to fully break down.\n\nBut PFAS aren\u2019t just bad for the environment. Small portions of these chemicals seep into soil and drinking water which then inevitably makes its way into human bodies. Their presence has become pervasive. Studies have shown a trace of PFAS detectable in 97% of humans. Studies have also linked PFAS exposure to various health risks including liver and immune system damage, impaired fertility, and low birth weight or birth defects in babies. Other research has associated PFAS with increased rates of prostate, kidney, and testicular cancers.\n\nSuit claims Apple engaged in fraud\n\nThe lawsuit bases its allegations primarily on a study published in December in the journal Environmental Science and Technology Letters. There, researchers from the University of Notre Dame U conducted an analysis of 22 smartwatch bands from multiple brands and various price points. The team tested samples using particle-induced gamma-ray emission ion beam analysis and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to detect signs of PFAS. Nine of 22 samples were reportedly found to have \u201celevated levels\u201d of a PFAS called perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA). Though the study did not specify which brand of strap were implicated, the findings were most prevalent in \u201chigher-priced\u201d watchbands over $15.\n\n\u201cThe most remarkable thing we found in this study was the very high concentrations of just one PFAS\u2014there were some samples above 1,000 parts per billion of PFHxA, which is much higher than most PFAS we have seen in consumer products,\u201d study co-author and University of Notre Dame professor Graham Peaslee said in a statement.\n\nPeaslee has previously found PFAS in other consumer products like cosmetics, fast food wrappers, contact lenses, and dental floss, among others. Researchers say chemicals in these products can migrate from the material into humans through \u201cmultiple paths of exposure\u201d including \u201cinhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption.\u201d\n\nIn the Apple case, lawyers representing the plaintiffs allege Apple should have known not to include harmful PFAS and taken steps to remove them from their products. The suit suggests possible health risks associated with PFAS might be more pronounced in this case because consumers are encouraged to keep wearable devices on throughout the day, often for long stretches of time. The complaints allege Apple engaged in fraud, fraudulent inducement, concealment, misrepresentation, negligence, and unjust enrichment. It seeks an injunction to halt the sale of the product as well as monetary penalties.\n\nPFAS use isn\u2019t unique to Apple. Companies across various industries have made efforts to remove PFAS from their products in recent years. Clothing brands like L.L. Bean and Columbia Sportswear have reportedly spent years testing for PFAS and have announced new lines of products free of the substances. Others like The North Face and Vans have pledged to totally eliminate PFAS by 2026. Several states, like New York and California, have enacted laws banning the sale of new clothes found to include so-called forever chemicals. Though there are fewer public examples of consumer tech companies explicitly removing PFAS from wearable products, the lawsuit points to the Google Pixel Watch and FitBit Sport bands, made respectively of recycled yarn and silicone, as examples of competitors using non-PFAS materials.\n\n[ Related: PFAS are toxic and they\u2019re everywhere. Here\u2019s how to stay away from them. ]\n\nEven if the allegations made in the Apple lawsuit are true, the unfortunate reality is simply removing a smartwatch won\u2019t eliminate your risk of interacting with a PFAS. In fact, the most common source of PFAS exposure isn\u2019t through tech or clothes; it\u2019s through the water we drink. A recent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) analysis detected PFAS in almost half of the nation\u2019s tap water. Typical faucet filtration devices aren\u2019t always effective at removing these chemicals. More sophisticated, under-the-sink reverse osmosis machines are more effective, but studies show they also wont catch all forever chemicals. Luckily, newly enacted EPA rules, at least for now, require local utilities to have PFAS in drinking water down to near-zero levels. But completely avoiding PFAS in a world inundated with cheap, disposable goods is still much easier said than done.\n\nThis post has been updated with a statement from Apple on January 24th.",

            "content": "The Apple Watch Sport Band is among those said to contain harmful chemicals -- image credit: Apple\n\nA class action lawsuit has been filed against Apple over the use of fluoroelastomer in several Apple Watch bands, saying the company is hiding how it is using dangerous chemicals.\n\nAs long ago as 2015, when it filed a patent regarding Apple Watch bands, Apple has been aware of health concerns over the fluoroelastomer material it uses in some bands such as the basic Sport Band. At the time, it was claimed that the particular fluoroelastomer recipe used had been strenuously tested to prevent rashes and other skin reactions.\n\nTen years later, the company is being sued for the use of this material, and accused of promoting a health device that is unhealthy. The suit targets Apple's Sport Band \u2014 which comes as standard with an Apple Watch \u2014 plus the Ocean Band, and the Nike Sport Band.\n\nThe class action suit, filed in the Northern District of California, claims that Apple is aware of the issues in these bands. Allegedly, Apple has only made a \"supposed and largely hidden promise\" to stop selling these bands.\n\nThat accusation of a hidden promise refers to a November 2022 report by Apple saying that it was committed to stop using what are called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). According to the These PFAS are commonly called \"forever chemicals,\" which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says are manufactured chemicals that have been been used in consumer products since the 1940s.\n\nWhile the EPA says that research is still ongoing, it does note that \"exposure to certain PFAS may lead to adverse health outcomes.\" The new lawsuit goes further and claims that exposure has been \"linked to various serious public health problems, including prostate and kidney cancer, [and] pregnancy complications.\"\n\nIt also claims that Apple has been making \"false promises\" about the Apple Watch, persuading users to buy for health reasons while not mentioning these potential issues.The suit further says that the \"presence of excessive PFAS in the Products was and is avoidable,\" as alternative materials are available.\n\nConsequently, the suit asks for a trial by jury, with the aim that Apple be forced to cease and desist sales of bands with fluoroelastomer. It also asks for unspecified damages for all affected users, arguing that Apple has been \"unjustly enriched\" by sales of the bands.\n\nApple's position\n\nApple has not directly responded to this specific suit. As well as its 2022 paper on removing the chemicals, though, it does refer to health issues with certain bands on its support pages.\n\n\"A great deal of care and research goes into choosing materials for all of our devices,\" says Apple. It claims to go beyond existing regulations and to extensively test materials, with \"thousands of material composition tests,\" plus trial studies, toxicological assessments, and consultations \"with board-certified dermatologists.\"\n\nIt does still admit that \"a small number of people will experience reactions to certain materials.\" As part of that, Apple lists materials used in its products, although the section about bands including the Sport Band, does not specifically mention fluoroelastomer.\n\nApple does appear to be right about only a small number of people being affected, though. Apple's support forums only contain a couple of users asking about skin irritation, back in 2021.\n\nSeparately, skin conditions such as tattoos have been reported to stop Apple Watch's health features working correctly.",

The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said it was opening dual probes into both U.S. tech giants to assess whether they hold \"strategic market status\" in their respective mobile ecosystems, including operating systems, app stores and smartphone-based browsers. The investigations will \"explore the impact on people who use mobile devices and the thousands of businesses developing innovative services or content such as apps for these devices,\" the CMA said. \"Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish,\" an Apple spokesperson told CNBC. \"We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.\" \"In the U.K. alone, the iOS app economy supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and makes it possible for developers big and small to reach users on a trusted platform,\" the Apple spokesperson added. \"We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nOliver Bethell, Google's senior director for competition, said the company's Android platform \"has helped to expand choice, reduce prices and democratise access to smartphones and apps.\" \"It's the only example of a successful and viable open source mobile operating system,\" said Bethell, urging for a \"way forward that avoids stifling choice and opportunities for U.K. consumers and businesses alike, and without risk to U.K. growth prospects.\" Earlier this week, the U.K. replaced CMA Chair Marcus Bokkerink with Doug Gurr, a former Amazon U.K. country manager. At the time, the watchdog noted that regulators had been asked in a recent meeting with the government to \"tear down the barriers hindering business and refocus their efforts on promoting growth.\" Labour MP Dan Aldridge said via email that the launch of the CMA's investigation into Apple and Google was \"a crucial step forward in ensuring fair competition in our digital economy.\" \"Companies such as Apple and Google decide which ones we access and how much we pay,\" he said in an emailed comment Thursday. \"These investigations will examine these practices, as they can stifle innovation and lead to higher prices for consumers.\"\n\nNew powers\n\nThe CMA now has enhanced regulatory powers after a new U.K. law, called the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act, or DMCC, came into effect at the start of this year. The DMCC seeks to prevent anti-competitive behavior in digital markets. It can designate large companies that have a significant amount of market power in a certain digital activity as having \"strategic market status.\" The CMA now has the power to impose changes to prevent potential anti-competitive behavior from any firm that is given strategic market status.",

            "content": "Apple is struggling to secure approval to sell the iPhone 16 in Indonesia. While it may seem to be a financial issue, the real challenge is navigating local regulations and understanding the government\u2019s underlying intentions. The Indonesian government isn\u2019t simply asking foreign companies to pour money into the economy \u2013 it\u2019s enforcing policies designed to encourage domestic economic growth, technology transfer, and job creation.\n\nBut for Apple, the problem isn\u2019t only the size of the investment but a misreading of Indonesia\u2019s agenda. It\u2019s about aligning with the regulatory landscape and the broader economic goals that the government is pursuing.\n\nThis issue kicked off when Apple failed to meet its previous commitment to comply with Indonesia's local content requirement (LCR) through its innovation scheme, which included the establishment of developer academies in the country. As a result, the Indonesian government took the step of banning the new iPhone 16. In response, the government is now looking for a more substantial commitment from Apple.\n\nThe LCR is a long-standing regulation designed to support local manufacturing and boost Indonesia\u2019s economy. To sell smartphones in Indonesia, manufacturers must meet the minimum local content threshold for their devices. The focus should be on the product, not on ancillary investments such as Apple\u2019s US$1 billion proposal for AirTag.\n\nBy investing in accessories instead of addressing the core requirement for smartphones, Apple misses the point entirely. Additionally, the government views the upcoming AirTag factory on Batam Island, near Singapore, as another commitment Apple has made.\n\nThis policy is not exclusive to Apple. The same LCR rules have led to the Indonesian government\u2019s decision to ban Google\u2019s Pixel smartphones. In practice, this means that Apple and Google should meet the government\u2019s requirements to sell their smartphones in the country. This should serve as a signal to other foreign tech companies: LCR compliance is non-negotiable.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s digital economy is booming, fuelled by expanding internet connectivity, a rapidly growing e-commerce sector, and rising demand for digital services \u2013 making it one of Southeast Asia\u2019s most promising markets.\n\nThe LCR policy for telecommunications devices, enforced by the Ministry of Communication and Digital (formerly Kominfo) since 2021, mandates that smartphones with Long Term Evolution (LTE)/4G/5G technologies must have a minimum of 35 per cent local content. Additionally, the Ministry of Industry has the job of calculating the local content percentage and certifying compliance with the regulation.\n\nApple could take a page from China\u2019s smartphone makers such as Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi, who swiftly align with government expectations through domestic production and local partnerships. This kind of investment is likely what Indonesia expects from Apple to meet its regulatory demands.\n\nChina\u2019s smartphones have become market leaders in Indonesia by establishing local manufacturing operations, enabling them to offer competitive pricing \u2013 key in a price-sensitive market like Indonesia. Extensive distribution networks built with local partners ensure widespread availability both online and in physical stores. Additionally, these brands have tailored their products to Indonesian consumers by incorporating features such as dual SIM capabilities for the large base of prepaid users and high-quality cameras to appeal to social media enthusiasts.\n\nDespite the regulatory hurdles, Indonesia remains a promising market for tech giants like Apple. With a young, tech-savvy population of approximately 280 million people, the country offers enormous potential. In 2023, mobile phone subscriptions exceeded the population, with a penetration rate of 128 per cent, indicating that many individuals own multiple devices. Internet penetration stands at 77 per cent, while 60 per cent actively use social media. Notably, there are 209 million smartphone users in the country.\n\nHowever, Apple\u2019s current market share in Indonesia is relatively small, with iOS devices accounting for 12 per cent of the smartphone market. Looking ahead, Indonesia's market is poised to mature in a way that favours premium products. As consumer purchasing power rises, demand for higher-end smartphones is expected to grow, creating significant opportunities for brands like Apple.\n\nMoreover, Indonesia\u2019s digital economy is booming, fuelled by expanding internet connectivity, a rapidly growing e-commerce sector, and rising demand for digital services \u2013 making it one of Southeast Asia\u2019s most promising markets. Apple\u2019s ecosystem, including iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, and services such as the App Store, iCloud, and Apple Music, is well-positioned to thrive in this dynamic digital landscape.\n\nThe challenge for Apple and other foreign investors is not that Indonesia is closed off to international business, but that the country\u2019s regulatory framework is designed to foster local industry development. This is a crucial distinction that Apple must grasp. The path forward for Apple should involve more than just investment pledges \u2013 it should include a strategic effort to align with the country\u2019s agenda.\n\nThe Merah-Putih cabinet, under President Prabowo Subianto, is focused on driving domestic economic growth and job creation expectedly through stringent regulatory measures. Far from a barrier, these regulations are expected to present opportunities for investors willing to align with Indonesia\u2019s long-term goals. The question is: Will Apple and other foreign investors rise to the challenge, or look elsewhere?",

            "content": "We're less than a month into the new year, and already one of the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average separated itself from the pack in a bad way.\n\nThat stock is Apple (AAPL -0.11%), which is down 8.2% in 2025, at the time of this writing.\n\nHere's why Apple is under pressure and if the sell-off in the growth stock is a buying opportunity.\n\nApple's valuation is strained\n\nApple stock has continued to run higher while its sales and earnings growth dramatically slowed, especially in the last two years. Over the last five years, the stock price is up 262%, revenue is up just 45.9%, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased by 90.5%.\n\nSince Apple's stock price has grown faster than earnings, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio soared to sky-high levels relative to its historical average. In fact, Apple's forward P/E ratio is higher than its average P/E ratio over the last three to 10-year periods. Even if Apple achieves analyst consensus earnings estimates over the next 12 months and the stock price stays the same, it would still be relatively expensive.\n\nGranted, the best companies have a way of growing into their valuations over time. But only if they sustain quality earnings growth, which Apple isn't doing. In fact, Apple is losing its once unstoppable lead in key markets.\n\nCompetition is heating up\n\nAccording to reports by Reuters, Apple's annual shipments in China declined by 17% in 2024, accentuated by a 25% decline in the fourth quarter. Apple now has a 15% market share in China, slightly behind both Vivo and Huawei.\n\nPerhaps the best reason to buy Apple stock is if you think it can recover in China. If that were to happen, it would look like a much better value. After all, Apple is still growing its earnings -- driven by strength in its services segment.\n\nIn the past, the majority of Apple's breakthrough innovations were related to hardware. The transition from the iPod to the iPhone and advancements with iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple AirPods enhanced the Apple ecosystem. However, Apple's services segment has been the true star in recent years. Services like Apple Music, Apple TV+, iCloud, and more are high-margin cash cows that have helped Apple diversify beyond physical products. However, the business relies heavily on products, with 75% of fiscal 2024 revenue coming from products.\n\nThe dependence on products, paired with a lack of breakthroughs in recent years, has put glaring question marks on Apple's ability to innovate. Apple's latest product upgrade, the Vision Pro, is very innovative but hasn't translated to meaningful sales. It doesn't integrate with the rest of the product lineup as well as Apple Watch and AirPods do because those products were relatively affordable accessories marketed to all iPhone users, whereas Vision Pro is $3,499.\n\nApple's ace in the hole\n\nDespite its sluggish growth, Apple generates so much extra cash that it can afford to buy back a boatload of its own stock. Apple reduced its outstanding share count by 34.8% over the last decade. It spent a record $95 billion on buybacks over the last year. For context, that's roughly the entire value of Spotify Technology.\n\nWith fewer shares to go around, Apple has been able to grow EPS at a far faster rate than net income. However, some investors may prefer to see Apple scale back its stock repurchases and divert those funds toward reinvesting in the core business or an acquisition.\n\nThe key takeaway is that despite Apple's slowing growth, it still has plenty of advantages compared to other companies, which arguably justifies a premium valuation. Apple has been fairly conservative with its capital allocation. It has also been criticized for a slow rollout of generative artificial intelligence (AI) functionality. However, Apple's next iPhone series could include far more advanced AI upgrades and spur growth.\n\nThere are better buys than Apple right now\n\nGiven Apple's valuation, investors should only consider the stock if they are confident in the company's ability to monetize AI while continuing to grow its services segment. Just last April, Apple stood out as a compelling value stock. It has rallied around 40% since then, but its results haven't been that impressive.\n\nApple seems like a stock to keep on a watchlist rather than buy now. There are plenty of better alternatives in the tech sector.\n\nMicrosoft has a more reasonable valuation and better growth prospects. Even Nvidia, which is more expensive than Apple, is arguably a better buy because of its undisputed industry leadership, whereas Apple's leadership is being challenged.\n\nIn summary, Apple stock ran too far too fast in 2024, and now it has to prove it's worth the premium price.",

His day job? He\u2019s a lecturer in mathematics at Northeastern University in London.\n\n\u201cPrime Target\u201d, Apple TV+\u2019s latest thriller airing on Jan. 22, places mathematics front and center of its storyline. And when the producers realized they needed a math whiz to make sure all the numbers in the script added up, Davis stepped onto the scene.\n\nAfter successfully landing the position of math adviser \u2014 as he is described on his IMDB page \u2014 at the start of 2023, Davis was tasked with coming up with the sums that would be carried out on screen by Edward Brooks, the show\u2019s math genius and main character.\n\nThe eight-part miniseries follows Brooks, played by Leo Woodall from Netflix\u2019s \u201cOne Day\u201d, a postgraduate math student developing a prime-number-based \u201ckey\u201d capable of accessing every computer in the world.\n\nTim Davis is a math lecturer on Northeastern University\u2019s London campus. Courtesy photo\n\nDavis, along with creator and scriptwriter Steve Thompson, was the brains behind the mathematical breakthroughs that propel the show\u2019s narrative and end up putting Brooks directly into harm\u2019s way.\n\n\u201cThe script would basically say, \u2018Character does math\u2019 or \u2018He does reels and reels of algebra and then crosses it out,\u2019\u201d Davis recalls. \u201cAnd so I had to check, \u2018OK \u2014 yes, we can do that.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd there were times as well when they would talk about math in the script and I would have to say, \u2018Yes, that makes sense\u2019 or, \u2018No, it makes absolutely no sense at all to do this\u2019 \u2014 and they would listen to me, thankfully.\u201d\n\nOnce the script-proofing was done, Davis then moved on to the film set, with scenes shot on location in Cambridge, England, and also at Farnborough International Studios \u2014 situated a short distance from London \u2014 to advise the actors in any scenes involving numbers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d meet up with the actors before they had to do some math and then I\u2019d work through it with them,\u201d Davis explains.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be with them on set while they were working, so I got to know them quite well. It could be very stressful because as soon as the director said \u2018Action,\u2019 I was relying purely on their memory. It is different with lines because everybody can somewhat remember lines \u2014 but these actors had to look like mathematicians. All the ones that did it were very good.\n\n\u201cIn this TV show, the major thing is math, so we were filming math-based scenes for basically two weeks. And I think Leo [Woodall] kind of hated it after that \u2014 he was saying, \u2018I\u2019ve had enough, don\u2019t ever talk to me about math again!\u2019\u201d\n\nWoodall has since described Davis as a \u201cgenius\u201d for his assistance during filming. The 28-year-old British actor, explaining how he prepared for his role in \u201cPrime Target,\u201d told Screen Rant: \u201cFor a lot of it, I had the preparation period of getting familiar with the math itself and spending time with our genius math consultant. That was one part of it.\u201d\n\nDavis is too self-deprecating to accept that label. But he acknowledges that the role set him a hefty challenge. In fact, it was effectively an impossible task.\n\n\u201cSo the problem \u2014 and I said this to the producers \u2014 is it can\u2019t be done,\u201d he says of the program\u2019s main premise that a human mind could produce a key to crack digital encryption codes.",

            "content": "Paulina Acosta \u201922 sat down in an FIU lab one day with a challenge from her professor: Hack into Apple's smart home ecosystem.\n\n\"Apple Home\" is a platform that allows iPhones, iPads and other Apple devices to communicate with smart lights, air conditioning controls, cameras and other gadgets around a home, giving a person complete control of their habitat in one place. Professor Selcuk Uluagac laid out every smart light bulb, garage door control and power outlet imaginable to give Acosta the best chance at intercepting communications between the various electronics so that she might hack into a device to understand its vulnerabilities and potentially help correct them.\n\nShe couldn't crack a single thing.\n\nInstead of frustration, Acosta felt admiration\u2014and found her career calling.\n\n\"The communications were so thoroughly and impressively obscure, it felt like I was looking at nonsense,\" Acosta recalls. \"It made me really appreciate the cybersecurity measures this company takes.\"\n\nToday, Acosta works as an Apple engineer, programming the software that connects iPhones and AirTags. Her journey from aspiring tech professional to Apple engineer was far from straightforward.\n\nFinding her path\n\nWhen Acosta arrived in the United States with an electrical engineering degree from Colombia, she had a clear vision.\n\n\"I fell in love with the idea of working at a big tech company. I saw people solving fascinating and complex engineering challenges, all while earning strong incomes. I wanted that for me, too. But I was struggling in my job interviews,\" she says.\n\n\u201cI faced a fear of failure. Every time I applied for an internship, got an interview and failed it, it felt awful, like my one chance to work at that company was gone.\u201d\n\nRecognizing that she needed to enhance both her technical skills and confidence, Acosta enrolled at FIU's Knight School of Computing and Information Sciences in the College of Engineering and Computing. It was a game-changing decision.\n\nStrengthening her foundation\n\nApple wasn\u2019t always Acosta\u2019s dream company. In fact, she had only owned one Apple device before a career-altering experience changed her mind.\n\nIt started when Professor Selcuk Uluagac hired Acosta as an undergraduate research assistant in the IoT Security Lab and asked her to write a guide explaining how someone could hack into Apple\u2019s \u2018smart home\u2019 ecosystem.\n\nUluagac frequently encourages hands-on learning. His students experiment with various smart home devices, like smartwatches, smartphones and smart TVs. It prepares them to meet industry demands, he says.\n\n\"I saw Paulina's potential and assigned her tasks involving Apple systems,\u201d Uluagac says. \"Her bravery and willingness to step out of her comfort zone immediately stood out. She was one of the most organized and hardworking undergraduate researchers I\u2019ve had in my lab.\u201d\n\nAcosta\u2019s challenge to write a guide for how to hack into the Apple smart home ecosystem turned out to be less of an assignment and more of a lesson and technical challenge. Apple\u2019s cybersecurity measures astounded her.\n\nAn \u2018Apple girl\u2019 was born.\n\n\u201cIn my interview, they asked me, \u2018Why do you want to work here?' says Acosta, recalling how her attempt to hack into the Apple Home ecosystem gave her newfound respect for company's cybersecurity measures. \"I had a good answer.\"\n\nThe journey to Apple\n\nAcosta knew where she wanted to go, but getting there was another matter. Fortunately for her, there were plenty of motivated, like-minded students who were ready to help.\n\nThe computer science major joined two student computing clubs that helped her master the interviewing process. The members practiced presenting projects in mock interviews and utilized online games that simulated the kinds of technical questions that might come up.\n\nAcosta also built up her programming stamina. At ShellHacks, Florida\u2019s largest hackathon hosted annually at the university by the computing organization INIT FIU, she and her teammates in less than two daysbuilt the basics for a project to help visually impaired individuals. Their project used AI models to analyze first-person videos and narrate any obstacles that appear.\n\n\u201cNot only did we win prizes and make friends, but I got even better at presenting my work,\u201d Acosta says.",

However, the most impressive functions might take longer to launch:\n\nAs Mark Gurman explains in his latest Power On newsletter, the first version of Apple Intelligence will make \u201ccosmetic\u201d changes. It will have a new user interface and support for typing questions to Siri instead of speaking them.\n\nMore interesting ar Siri\u2019s new abilities to access user data for contextual information about the user and control third-party apps via the new App Intents software. However, Gurman points out that Siri isn\u2019t getting a ChatGPT-like model for these tasks:\n\nThese upcoming upgrades will make Siri easier to use on a day-to-day basis, but it\u2019s not the brain transplant that the service really needs. Siri is still based on an outdated infrastructure \u2014 AI models that have been overtaken by the technology used by ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini. Siri hasn\u2019t yet been rebuilt for the generative AI age, even if Apple is trying to create the impression that it has.\n\niPhone 16 offers exclusive Apple Intelligence features\n\nUsing the Camera Control button to find out information about a restaurant with Visual Intelligence. Image source: Apple Inc.\n\nWhile we first thought all Apple Intelligence features would be available to all Apple-compatible devices, the company revealed that some features, thanks to the new Camera Control, are exclusive to iPhone 16 users.\n\nCupertino explains that Camera Control unlocks visual intelligence to help users learn about objects and places faster than ever before. Users can click and hold Camera Control to pull up the hours or ratings for a restaurant they pass, add an event from a flyer to their calendar, quickly identify a dog by breed, and more.\n\nCamera Control also serves as a gateway into third-party tools with specific domain expertise, such as when users want to search Google to find where they can buy an item or to benefit from ChatGPT\u2019s problem-solving skills.\n\nApple Intelligence set to expand in 2025 to more languages\n\nImage source: Apple Inc.\n\nDuring the iPhone 16 event, Apple announced it would expand Apple Intelligence to more languages in 2025. Now we know they will be available in April for these languages: Chinese, English (India), English (Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese.\n\nApple Intelligence first launched in U.S. English and quickly expanded to include localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K.\n\nTim Cook explains Apple and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT partnership\n\nImage source: YouTube/MKBHD\n\nRumors were true, and Apple has partnered with OpenAI. According to the company, these two projects work seamlessly, but they have core features that separate them.\n\nWith Apple AI, the company ensures that all data is private through Private Cloud Compute, while OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT usually collects user data. In an interview with YouTuber Marques Brownlee, Apple\u2019s CEO Tim Cook explained the core difference between Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT partnership.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s Private Cloud Computing, and there\u2019s the arrangement with OpenAI,\u201d says Tim Cook. \u201cThese two things are different. So, if you look at Private Cloud Compute, we\u2019re utilizing the same basic architecture as the silicon that\u2019s in the iPhone 15. We\u2019re using the same software, and so we believe that we\u2019ve done it in such a way that it\u2019s as safe and secure and private in the Private Cloud Compute as in the device.\u201d\n\nThat means Apple won\u2019t collect user\u2019s data, won\u2019t make a profile of the user, or take this data to sell it elsewhere. Cupertino aimed to extend the iPhone\u2019s on-device processing to the next level with a level of security that people are used to with their iPhones.\n\nTim Cook continues: \u201cSo we really, we really worked on this on a lot and put a lot of work behind that arrow to be sure that if you\u2019re working on something that requires world knowledge, so you\u2019re out of the domain of personal context and so forth, then you may want to go and use one of the large language models that are on the market, and we will be selected what we feel is the best one with OpenAI and ChatGPT.\u201d\n\nThat said, all personal requests related to Apple\u2019s built-in apps, such as Messages, Mail, Calendar, and more, will use the company\u2019s intelligence. In contrast, \u201cworld knowledge\u201d can be requested for OpenAI ChatGPT and later for other large language models.\n\nNew LLMs can join the party later\n\nWhile Apple will first integrate with OpenAI, the company plans to work with other LLms as well. For example, Cupertino is in talks with Google to license Gemini.\n\nA report also claims Apple will use Baidu for its generative AI functions in China. Baidu\u2019s Ernie Bot is a ChatGPT rival and one of the more than 40 AI models from China that local regulators have approved. A partnership with Apple would be a big win for Baidu, considering the growing competition in the region.\n\nApple Intelligence compatible devices\n\nImage source: Jos\u00e9 Adorno for BGR\n\nDuring the WWDC 2024 keynote, Apple announced which devices will be compatible with its Intelligence:\n\niPhone 15 Pro models or newer\n\nM1 iPad models or newer (such as the M4 iPad Pro) and the new iPad mini (A17 Pro)\n\nApple Silicon Macs running macOS Sequoia\n\nApple papers suggest where its AI efforts are at\n\nImage source: Pixelmator\n\nAI model for instruction-based image editing\n\nIn February, Apple released a revolutionary AI model for instruction-based image editing. According to a paper published by Apple researchers, instruction-based image editing improves the controllability and flexibility of image manipulation via natural commands without elaborate descriptions or regional masks. The study shows \u201cpromising capabilities in cross-modal understanding and visual-aware response generation via LM\u201d as they investigated how MLLMs facilitate edit instructions and MLLM-guided image editing.\n\nThis image editing AI model made by Apple can produce concise and clear instructions for the editing process, create Photoshop-style modifications, optimize photo quality, and edit specific elements of a picture, such as faces, eyes, hair, clothes, and accessories.\n\nMM1: Apple\u2019s AI model\n\nIn March, Apple researchers published a paper highlighting how they\u2019re training a new large language model (LLM).\n\nCalled MM1, this LLM can integrate text and visual information simultaneously. The paper offers an interesting look at the importance of various architectural components and data choices. The researchers say they were able to \u201cdemonstrate that for large-scale multimodal pre-training using a careful mix of image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) few-shot results across multiple benchmarks, compared to other published pre-training results.\u201d\n\nIn addition, they showed that \u201cthe image encoder together with image resolution and the image token count has a substantial impact, while the vision-language connector design is of comparatively negligible importance.\u201d\n\nApple\u2019s MM1 AI model uses a family of multimodal models with up to 30 billion parameters, consisting of both dense models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants, that are state-of-the-art in pre-training metrics and achieve competitive performance after supervised fine-tuning on a range of established multimodal benchmarks.\n\nReALM could be better than OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4\n\niOS 18.1 Apple Intelligence on iPhone 15 Pro: The all-new Siri design Image source: Jos\u00e9 Adorno for BGR\n\nApple researchers have published a paper about a new AI model. According to the company, ReALM is a language model that can understand and successfully handle contexts of different kinds. With that, users can ask about something on the screen or run in the background, and the language model can still understand the context and give the proper answer.\n\nThis is the third paper regarding AI that Apple has published in the past few months. These studies only tease the upcoming AI features of iOS 18, macOS 15, and Apple\u2019s newest operating systems. In the paper, Apple researchers say, \u201cReference resolution is an important problem, one that is essential to understand and successfully handle context of different kinds.\n\nOne example is a user asking for pharmacies near them. After a list is presented, something Siri could do, the user could ask, \u201cCall the one on Rainbow Rd.,\u201d \u201cCall the bottom one,\u201d or \u201cCall this number (present onscreen).\u201d Siri can\u2019t perform this second part, but with ReALM, this language model could understand the context by analyzing on-device data and completing the query.\n\nFerret LLM\n\nThis paper explains how a multimodal large language model can understand user interfaces of mobile displays. The researchers say they have advanced in MLLM usage but still \u201cfall short in their ability to comprehend and interact effectively with user interface (UI) screens.\u201d\n\nThis assistive assistant is still far from being released. But once Apple masters it, it could be integrated alongside ReALM model.\n\nBGR will update this guide as we learn more about Apple\u2019s AI efforts.",

I've spent my life serving the musicians of the Northwest and beyond with an affordable studio and great results.

It\u2019s called Breaking History, and it\u2019s a combination of two things our readers love: news commentary and historical analysis. I\u2019m the host. In each show, I\u2019ll take a look at a person, a movement, or a controversy from the past that can help us understand contemporary America. If you liked my piece about how Republics unravel, or about how students become terrorists, then you\u2019re going to love this podcast.\n\nThe first episode is about Donald Trump\u2019s historic comeback\u2014and why America sometimes craves an anti-elite elite. Trump is not the first populist to win the White House with a promise to drain the swamp. That distinction goes to Andrew Jackson, the seventh president of the United States, whose portrait has just been rehung in the newly redecorated Oval Office. And Jackson\u2019s presidency might be the best guide to what the next four years could look like.\n\nYou can listen to the episode below, or keep scrolling to read a print adaptation of it. If you enjoy either, subscribe to Breaking History on Apple, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nDonald Trump, just sworn in as president, was reelected to be a wrecking ball, a middle finger, the people\u2019s punch to the Beltway\u2019s mouth. But while this populist moment feels \u201cunprecedented,\u201d it\u2019s not. The rebuke of the ruling class is encoded in our nation\u2019s DNA.\n\nPopulism is hard to pin down. It\u2019s not really a governing philosophy or a movement or an ideology. Some call it a political grammar that pits the people against the powerful, the best of us against the rest of us. It\u2019s more of a mood, the desire to fire the bosses, crash the country club, and ask the snobs: You think you\u2019re better than me? And every now and again, populism in America can sweep an old order out of Washington.\n\nPopulism is Sam Adams and his friends dressing up as Mohawks and dumping imported tea into Boston Harbor. It\u2019s the protagonist in a John Grisham novel discovering that the whole damn system is corrupt. It\u2019s Walt Whitman\u2019s \u201cbarbaric yawp.\u201d It\u2019s Dirk Diggler in Boogie Nights quitting on the set of a porno, screaming, \u201cYou\u2019re not my boss!

Here are two key AI features available on your Watch.\n\n#1: Notification summaries\n\nOne of my favorite Apple Intelligence features (and also the most controversial) is notification summaries.\n\nEssentially, AI analyzes the contents of an incoming message, news alert, and more, and can summarize that info in a short, sweet notification.\n\nIt\u2019s especially nice for stacks of notifications from, say, Messages or Slack, because you can get a single AI-summarized notification that informs you about all the things happening in that stack.\n\nApple Watch benefits from notification summaries too, and I\u2019ve found it an especially useful feature on my wrist.\n\nWhen I get a notification, I want to be able to glance down quickly, get the info I need, then go about my day.\n\nNotification summaries make that easy to do, saving me time and minimizing interruptions. Speaking of which\u2026\n\n#2: Reduce Interruptions Focus mode\n\nAnother supported AI feature on Apple Watch is the new Reduce Interruptions Focus mode.\n\nThis feature first arrived in iOS 18.1 as a way to\u2014you guessed it\u2014reduce the interruptions in your life.\n\nHere\u2019s how Apple describes the newest Focus mode:\n\nWhen Reduce Interruptions is active, intelligently allow important notifications to interrupt you and silence notifications determined not to be important.\n\nThe way it works is that Apple Intelligence understands what notifications are generally about, and will only surface ones that seem particularly important. Anything that seems non-urgent will be kept silenced.\n\nYou can still explicitly allow or silence certain apps if you\u2019d like, but by default Reduce Interruptions will let your Watch and Apple Intelligence do all the work for you.\n\nApple Watch\u2019s AI features: wrap-up\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential still untapped for Apple Intelligence on the Apple Watch. However, these two initial features provide a great start. Each enables you to go throughout your day with fewer big interruptions from technology, and that\u2019s a valuable addition.\n\nWhat do you think of these Apple Intelligence features?

It was the latest example of Apple\u2019s struggle in China, its biggest market outside the U.S.\n\nAccording to the report, iPhones \u2014 which had been the number one phone in China this time last year \u2014 fell to third place, with China\u2019s Huawei taking the number one spot.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time since the U.S. ban that Huawei regained the leading position,\u201d Counterpoint analyst Mengmeng Zhang said. \u201cHuawei\u2019s sales increased 15.5% YoY driven by the launch of the mid-end Nova 13 series and high-end Mate 70 series.\u201d\n\nThis follows similar Counterpoint research from last week showing that iPhone sales had fallen 5% last year amid stronger competition, and a lack of Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) features on phones sold in China.\n\nApple has been slower to roll out its AI offerings compared to its competitors, introducing its Apple Intelligence suite following the debut of the iPhone 16 in September.\n\nThe company has not been able to add AI features to iPhone 16s sold in China due to local restrictions. China\u2019s government requires generative AI operators to secure permission before they can roll out a product. That\u2019s left Apple trying to land partnerships with Chinese companies to introduce its AI feature.\n\nApple is also facing pressure in another major smartphone market, with Indonesia banning the iPhone due to that country\u2019s content restrictions. The company had proposed making a $1 billion investment in local manufacturing, but Indonesia\u2019s government said that wasn\u2019t enough to meet a regulation that requires 40% of all content in devices to be sourced in-country.\n\nAs noted here last year, experts argue the company\u2019s embrace of AI technology could transform how people shop, while also pushing back against the idea that Apple is lagging in Big Tech\u2019s AI race.\n\n\u201cApple may be late to the AI surge compared to Google and Amazon, which have been adding AI to products for years,\u201d The Big Phone Store CEO Steven Athwal said in an interview with PYMNTS. \u201cBut Apple has always been about timing and refinement.

As part of this goal, WAT deploys iPad to teachers and students, which school leaders say is helping to drive better academic results.\n\nOur academic outcomes have significantly improved across our schools in the time since we deployed iPad. That\u2019s no coincidence. Dawn Haywood CEO, Windsor Academy Trust\n\nMany of Windsor\u2019s teachers attribute this success to the use of iPad in formative assessment. At the start of a lesson, a teacher uses their choice of app, like Google Docs or Showbie, to pose questions about academic subjects and assess their students\u2019 level of understanding. With Apple Classroom, teachers can see all of their students\u2019 screens at once, allowing them to monitor responses and understand immediately if they need to cover a previous topic again. This also helps educators identify any students who may need additional time understanding a subject, so that everyone can achieve their goals.\n\nWatch the video Video 2 of 2: Windsor schools use iPad to help with formative assessment in the classroom.\n\nApple Professional Learning offerings have also been instrumental in facilitating educator support and development. Teachers across schools take advantage of the Apple Teacher program to build their knowledge about how to best use iPad for education. They are also encouraged to collaborate on lesson plans at regular professional learning sessions where they share best practices and resources with one another. Some educators throughout Windsor are also Apple Learning Coaches who help their colleagues get the most out of Apple technology in the classroom. \u201ciPad not only saves our teachers time by giving them quick access to shared lesson planning ideas and resources, but it also encourages them to bring additional creativity to their teaching. It\u2019s redefining how we approach the curriculum,\u201d says Sal Khan, Assistant Head Teacher at Goldsmith Primary and an Apple Learning Coach.\n\nWAT\u2019s leadership team say their approach to digital learning is making lessons more impactful and also improving results. Since deploying iPad, all WAT schools are now scoring above national standards in attainment, with their secondary schools also above national averages for progress. And 100% of their schools are now rated \u201cgood\u201d or \u201coutstanding\u201d by Ofsted government inspectors. With iPad, teachers can use Keynote to create animations during physics lessons, and students can use Google Docs to solve math challenges and Camera to capture pictures of wildlife for environment audits. Across the board, iPad is deepening engagement, increasing learning, and unlocking opportunities for the students across the West Midlands.",

            "content": "It's totally understandable if you haven\u2019t opened Apple Maps since its disastrous launch in 2012, which among other things saw people driving into riverbanks. It was not a launch that inspired confidence. That was over a decade ago, though, which is an eternity in the world of software. After years of refinement, Apple Maps is pretty good now.\n\nI switch between Google Maps and Apple Maps regularly, mostly as an experiment, and at this point I think Apple's product is just as reliable as Google's for turn-by-turn directions. Sure, Google is more likely to have a given business in its database, especially if that business is new. If you type the same address into both apps, though, they work about as well as each other for navigation.\n\nAnd I'll go even further: There are some things Apple Maps does better than Google. Not all of them are going to matter to all people, granted, but they exist. Here's a quick roundup.\n\nLittle Audio Details\n\nApple Maps, in my opinion, is better at explaining in plain language what you need to do next while you\u2019re driving. For example: Google Maps, when a turn is upcoming, will tell you to turn at a specific street after a certain number of feet. This, while technically correct, almost always leaves me feeling confused. Apple Maps, meanwhile, will tell me to pass the next traffic light and turn right at the one after it. That, to me, is a much clearer instruction. There are a lot of similar interactions. It feels like having a really good navigator sitting next to you.\n\nI also generally find Apple's voices to be both clearer and more expressive, though that's possibly subjective.\n\nQuickly Check Transit Times\n\nCourtesy of Justin Pot\n\nApple Maps has a transit feature called \"Nearby transit\" that just shows a list of the incoming buses and trains near where I'm standing. I use this while waiting for a train at a stop and also when I'm almost ready to leave a bar or restaurant\u2014I can quickly see the next few transit options and time my departure accordingly.",

Loop Capital also downgraded Apple's stock from Buy to Hold, with a revised price target of $230, down from $275.\n\nIn an investor note, Lee said he expects Apple to report lower-than-expected results for its December quarter and a miss on expectations for the second quarter on weak iPhone sales and a lack of interest in AI among consumers.\n\nShares of Apple fell as much as 3.7% midday on Tuesday. The stock is up 16% over the last 12 months. Big Tech rivals Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are up some 36% and 30%, respectively, over the last year, while Microsoft (MSFT) is up just 3.5%. The broader S&P 500 has climbed 20% in the same period.\n\nAccording to Lee, iPhone sales in China fell between 15% and 20% year over year. Apple is contending with a number of headwinds in the region, including the continued ascendence of local offerings from Huawei and Xiaomi and cautious consumer spending amidst a slower economic backdrop.\n\nApple isn\u2019t just dealing with trouble in China. Overall iPhone market share fell roughly 1% year over year in Q4 to 23%, according to estimates by Canalys and IDC. That\u2019s despite the fact that smartphone shipments rose 3%, Canalys reports.\n\nJefferies forecasts that iPhone revenue will decline 0.4% year over year for the first quarter, while total Apple sales will grow 2.8%, lower than the firm\u2019s prior estimate of 4.6%.\n\nPart of Apple\u2019s issue, Lee contends, is that the company\u2019s big push into AI isn\u2019t panning out as investors had hoped. Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence platform for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, was expected to kick off a sales supercycle. But if IDC and Canalys estimates prove correct, it will throw cold water on the AI sales boost.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook (C) seen behind US President Donald Trump (R) and US Vice President JD Vance (L) after the two were sworn into office at an inauguration ceremony in the rotunda of the United States Capitol in Washington, DC, USA, 20 January 2025.

It\u2019s a risky move for Apple, which generally debuts its latest and greatest products and services at one time via big, splashy launch events. That makes it difficult for customers to know when the platform will feature all of the capabilities Apple initially promised when it debuted Apple Intelligence in June 2024.\n\nAI smartphones and their counterpart AI PCs are struggling to gain traction despite a massive sales push from tech giants ranging from Apple and Google to Microsoft and Intel.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone is its most important product, and China is among its most important sales regions. In 2024, the iPhone accounted for $201.1 billion of Apple\u2019s $391 billion in total revenue. The company\u2019s second-largest business segment, its Services division, brought in $96.1 billion.\n\nStory Continues",

Thankfully, Apple has a solution, and it's called Genmoji.\n\nWith the help of Apple Intelligence, you can generate custom emojis right from your keyboard using text prompts or even a person's photo from your Photos library. Below, I break down all the steps for creating your own Genmoji.\n\nCheck out our iOS 18 roundup for a full list of all the top features of Apple's latest operating system. Be sure to also look at our other Apple guides, including the Best iPhones, Best iPhone 16 Accessories, and Best iPads.\n\nEnable Apple Intelligence\n\nBefore we start, you'll want to check if you have access to Apple Intelligence. It launched with iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1, but Genmoji specifically launched in iOS 18.2. To check your software version, go to Settings > General > About. You're good to go if it says iOS 18.2 or newer. If you need to update, back up your device first.\n\nIf you still don't have access to Genmoji, make sure that Apple Intelligence is enabled (it should be by default). Go to Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri and toggle on Apple Intelligence. It's worth noting that Apple Intelligence is only available on select iPhones\u2014the iPhone 16 range, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max.\n\nScreenshots courtesy of Brenda Stolyar via Apple Intelligence\n\nEnter Your Prompt\n\nWhen you have a Messages window open, tap on the emoji icon (the smiley face) or keyboard icon (the globe) to access the emoji keyboard. In the upper right-hand corner of the keyboard, tap on the Genmoji icon (the pink and blue smiley face with a plus sign). Type a few words or a phrase into the textbox that describes what you're looking for and tap Done. Swipe through the populated Genmojis and tap Add on the one you want to use. It'll then appear in your drawer of emojis and stickers. You can also create Genmojis based on images of people in your Photos app. Start by typing in a prompt like \u201cJulian celebrating his birthday,\u201d tap \u201cChoose a Person\u201d from the list of contacts that appear, and select the specific person. From there, you'll see various Genmojis populate based on the prompt.

            "content": "Apple Watch Series 10 expands the already large displays by about 30% without adding much bulk, plus the new models are thinner than ever. While Apple called it a redesign, it's a minimal tweak to the existing decade-old design.\n\nAfter a decade of iteration, Apple Watch is at its peak in the existing form factor. Sure, it's gotten larger, more curved displays, thinner chassis, and many more health sensors, but it's still easily identifiable as a descendent of the Series 0 revealed in 2014.\n\nRumors have already begun about the Apple Watch Series 11, though not much is known just yet. The holy grail of non-invasive blood glucose monitoring is still a moonshot, but blood pressure is reportedly in the works.\n\nWhat's new in Apple Watch Series 10\n\nApple Watch Series 10 comes in 46mm and 42mm sizes, just a bit bigger than the previous generation on the diagonal. However, the display is bigger thanks to slimmer bezels too, which means the larger model has a bigger display than the 49mm Apple Watch Ultra.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 is bigger, but thinner\n\nThe cases are larger, but thinner too. These slightly thinner models maintain the 18-hour \"all day\" battery life.\n\nYear-over-year updates have been minimal since the Apple Watch Series 6 and one of the few actually new pieces of health-related hardware in generations has been turned off in the United States due to a lawsuit. Some rumblings in the legal space suggest that ban could end with a settlement, but until then the blood oxygen detection won't work.\n\nWhile there aren't any new health sensors in Apple Watch Series 10, there is a new health function that is also available for the Apple Watch Series 9 \u2014 sleep apnea detection. A new water temperature sensor and depth sensor are included, inherited from Apple Watch Ultra.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 has a new speaker grill design\n\nImproved speakers enable users to play music or podcasts directly from the Apple Watch. A new speaker grill is visible on the left side of the watch.\n\nThe wide angle OLED display is 40% brighter than the previous model, and the refresh rate is increased in always on mode. That means a second hand can tick normally even when the display isn't active.\n\nApple didn't add any new sensors and the blood oxygen detection feature is still not available in the United States due to a patent dispute.\n\nReturning features\n\nIf you've owned an Apple Watch in recent years, you're likely familiar with the range of feautres available. Classic features like heart rate and fitness tracking are present, plus the more recent upgrades like Double Tap are back.\n\nDouble Tap lets users control some functions with just one hand\n\nDouble Tap is a feature that lets users activate the primary button on the display by pinching their pointer finger and thumb together twice. It means you can cycle through the widget view, play or pause media, or dismiss a notification with just one hand.\n\nUsers can also handoff now playing audio using NFC by tapping their Apple Watch to a new HomePod or HomePod mini. NFC is also used when tapping a Home Key compatible door lock or when using Car Key to unlock your vehicle.\n\nCrash Detection uses various sensors on the Apple watch to determine if you've been in a severe car crash. Fall detection uses similar methods for detecting falls or accidents involving slower collisions like on a bicycle.\n\nEasily swapped bands\n\nOne of the hallmark features of Apple Watch that was once remarkable and now old hat is the ability to easily swap bands. After ten years of Apple Watch, users are still able to use their original bands on Apple Watch Series 10.\n\nDespite size increases for each generation, the large bands always fit the large watch, and the small bands fit the small watch. However, rumors have indicated for several years that Apple could move to a different connector for smart band or magnetic attachment support.\n\nApple offers a range of bands in multiple materials excluding leather. There is a huge market for third-party bands of all shapes, sizes, and materials similar to iPhone cases.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 compared\n\nApple Watch Series 10 is a generation ahead of its more premium Apple Watch Ultra 2 counterpart. There are a lot of ways the two products cross over, but users will need to choose between rugged features or a slimmer design.\n\nThe extensive battery life offered by Apple Watch Ultra 2 might be enough to convince some to choose it over the thinner, lighter Apple Watch Series 10. However, existing Apple Watch owners may want to wait for Apple Watch Ultra 3 in the fall of 2025 before buying the aging model.\n\nThe aluminum case is available in polished jet black, rose gold, and silver. Titanium is available in a natural polished, gold, and slate gray.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 starts at $399 for the aluminum model. Initial shipments and availability began on September 20, 2024.\n\nEverything below this point was written before Apple's September 9, 2024 event and has been preserved for historical purposes. It contains all the rumors and information shared before the Apple Watch Series 10 was introduced.\n\nFollowing after the Apple Watch Series 9, the Apple Watch Series 10 or Apple Watch Series X promises to introduce major updates to a largely unchanging wearable design. After years of fairly similar timepieces being released, Apple is rumored to use the ten-year anniversary of its reveal to give it a revamp.\n\nSome have speculated that Apple could follow a similar release strategy with a special edition series \"X\" model like it did with iPhone. Standard Apple Watch Series 10 could closely resemble the Apple Watch Series 9 it replaces, then an Apple Watch Series X could change things up with a new design and bands.\n\nWhatever Apple's strategy, these models will remain distinct from the Apple Watch Ultra lineup. Apple may skip the Apple Watch Ultra 3 in 2024, saving the iterative update for 2025.\n\nApple Watch Series 10: A needed revamp\n\nMuch like other models of Apple Watch, and some other Apple products, there are some changes that are expected to happen regardless of rumors.\n\nFor example, we know that the Apple Watch will use a new chip inside, moving from the Series 9's S9 SiP in favor of the S10. You can expect it to be more powerful or more power efficient compared to previous versions.\n\nYou can also pretty much expect the aesthetics to be similar to the Apple Watch Series 9, as rumors have not detailed any major structural changes to the product. If Apple had a wild change to the Apple Watch in mind, it should've appeared in supply chain rumors by the summer.\n\nEven so, rumors and reports offered claims that what would change will be more than an incremental update. It won't be a radical redesign, but the tweaks will be significant.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 band changes\n\nThe Apple Watch has used the same strap and lug system for a decade. This meant users could use older bands with their newer Apple Watch models without necessarily needing to buy more.\n\nThat may not be the case for the Apple Watch Series 10 or special edition Apple Watch Series X, whichever is revealed.\n\nRumors claimed the connectors for the Apple Watch band have been completely redesigned. However, the leaker didn't go into detail about the actual changes made to the band, which doesn't instill confidence in their claim.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 may change the band mechanism.\n\nThey did insist that the design change means that older bands won't work with the new Apple Watch model.\n\nThere has been a proposal of Apple using a magnetic band system. Again, there is no clear indication as to how that will work.\n\nApple has looked into ways to use magnets with Apple Watch bands, including protective cases. It has also used patent filings to offer more than 50 drawings of how magnets can securely engage with each other.\n\nWhether this research is used with the Apple Watch 10's bands remains to be seen.\n\nApple Watch Series 10's bigger screen\n\nThe display of the Apple Watch Series 10 could be quite a bit larger than in previous models.\n\nThe display could be a lot bigger on the Apple Watch Series 10\n\nRenders released in June showed a device with a much larger display surface, but with a marginally larger chassis than the Series 9. To end users, this would give the appearance of a bigger screen with thinner bezels.\n\nThe render depicted a 50.8mm display, which would be marginally bigger than the 49mm version used in the Apple Watch Ultra.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 to be larger and thinner, or thicker\n\nReports offer that the most obvious change for the Series 10 will be size. The model will allegedly be much larger than previously offered.\n\nThe current Apple Watch sizes are 41mm and 45mm. The Apple Watch Series 10 is tipped to start at 45mm with the larger size being 49mm.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 should be larger, but the jury's out on thickness.\n\nWhile physically larger, there is some debate about thickness. There have been some claims the Apple Watch Series 10 will be slimmer, following Apple's drive to make its hardware the thinnest and lightest on the market.\n\nHowever, renders have also depicted the Apple Watch Series 10 as being much thicker. At 11.6mm, the new model could be thicker than the Apple Watch Series 9's 10.7mm measurement.\n\nIt may not be too thick though, as it would still be well below the Apple Watch Ultra at 14.4mm.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 power savings\n\nReducing power usage is always good for hardware, since it makes the battery last longer. For the Apple Watch, which has a fairly small battery capacity, it's a crucial thing to develop.\n\nFor the Apple Watch Series 10, the power savings will be introduced via a display technology change. There's already power efficiencies such as adjustable refresh rates, but the Series 10 could go further still.\n\nA new display may save on power usage.\n\nThis time, reports insist that the use of a new low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) thin-film transistor (TFT) technology will be used in the OLED display. LTPO-TFT is already used for some switching TFTs in the Apple Watch display panel, with older LTPS versions also employed for switching TFTs and driving TFTs.\n\nLTPO will be used on more TFTs, including driving TFTs, in the new display. LTPS will still be used, but only on TFTs outside the viewable pixel area.\n\nApple is expected to reveal the Apple Watch Series 10 alongside the iPhone 16 during the \"It's Glowtime\" September 9, 2024 Apple Event. The new model will likely have a similar price structure to the Apple Watch Series 9 and include aluminum and stainless steel options.\n\nAluminum models with GPS start at $399 for the 41mm model and that pricing should be carried over to the new models. Stainless steel starts at $699.",

            "content": "Big tech companies like Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are remaining steadfast in their diversity, equity, and inclusion commitments in the wake of Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.'s decisions to scale back their initiatives, signaling a growing divide in Silicon Valley over how to approach DEI.\n\nApple defended its DEI initiatives against a conservative shareholder group\u2019s attempt to eliminate them, saying as part of a Jan. 10 disclosure to investors that the iPhone maker strives \u201cto create a culture of belonging.\u201d Earlier, Microsoft\u2019s Chief Diversity Officer doubled down on the software maker\u2019s DEI commitments and spelled out the business case for them in a December post on its LinkedIn platform.\n\nThe Apple filing published the same day news broke that Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, disbanded and reassigned its entire DEI team and was sunsetting its hiring policy that focused on diversity. E-commerce behemoth Amazon similarly announced it had retired diversity programs and dialed down its DEI rhetoric as part of a review of hundreds of initiatives.\n\nCorporate efforts to recruit and retain more women and minorities have come under intense scrutiny recently as conservative activists and politicians have tried to reframe DEI as discrimination against White male workers.\n\nMeta\u2019s announcement came after meetings CEO Mark Zuckerberg had with members of President Donald Trump\u2019s incoming Republican administration, according to news reports. Trump advisers are reportedly considering plans to ax diversity offices across the federal government. And Trump\u2019s vice president, JD Vance, has been an outspoken critic of DEI, even authoring a bill during his time as Ohio\u2019s junior senator that would sway companies to disband their DEI initiatives.\n\nWhether tech companies affirm or ax their DEI policies is important to their business, according to Lindsey Stewart, director of stewardship research and policy for Morningstar Sustainalytics. That\u2019s because the industry is in the business of disseminating and publicizing information to a diverse global audience, Stewart said.\n\nAny tech company that doesn\u2019t consider the risks of failing to recruit and retain a diverse workforce could be in for a rude awakening from its consumers and prospective employees, Stewart said.\n\n\u201cIf there are companies that are genuinely scaling back,\u201d Stewart said, \u201cit is possible they could find out the hard way that\u2019s a mistake.\u201d\n\nPublic Affirmations\n\nMicrosoft Chief Diversity Officer Lindsay-Rae McIntyre wrote in a Dec. 20 blog posted on LinkedIn that \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s diversity and inclusion work is more important than ever.\u201d\n\nThe post followed the company\u2019s October diversity and inclusion report spelling out and reaffirming its commitments to DEI.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe it\u2019s the business of Microsoft to be diverse and inclusive so we can build products, services, and a workforce that empowers the world,\u201d McIntyre wrote.\n\nThe October diversity and inclusion report, as well as McIntyre\u2019s sentiments, remain unchanged, the company confirmed.\n\nApple\u2019s comments on diversity came within its latest proxy statement, a document where publicly traded companies discuss issues going up for a vote at their next annual shareholder meeting.\n\nOne of the items on the ballot for Apple\u2019s Feb. 25 meeting is a shareholder proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research urging the company to cease its DEI efforts because they pose \u201clitigation, reputation and financial risks.\u201d\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative shareholder activist group, referred to a landmark ruling by the US Supreme Court that curbed affirmative action in college admissions. The 2023 decision calls the legality of corporate DEI efforts into question, the center\u2019s proposal said.\n\nApple\u2019s board recommended investors vote against the proposal to shutter the company\u2019s DEI programs because its anti-discrimination policies are robust and leadership already takes legal concerns into account.\n\n\u201cWe strive to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work,\u201d Apple added in the disclosure.\n\nApple didn\u2019t respond to a request for further comment.\n\nTech Needs Talent\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet Inc. , the parent company of Google, hasn\u2019t publicly indicated any change in the status of its DEI programs. As of Jan. 17, the Google\u2019s DEI website still affirmed its pledges to disability inclusion, gender equity, LGBTQ+ inclusion, racial equity, and veteran inclusion, among other headline programs.\n\nA spokesperson for Alphabet didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nTech companies in particular have struggled with worker diversity.\n\nThe high tech sector was less racially and ethnically diverse than the US workforce at large in 2022\u2014the most recent year with data available\u2014according to a US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission study released last year. Black workers accounted for 7.4% of the high tech workforce and 5.7% of high tech managers, despite making up 11.6% of the total US workforce, the report said.\n\nYounger generations from which tech companies will need to recruit are far more diverse in race, ethnicity, gender, and a host of other categories, said Michelle Hebl, chair of Rice University\u2019s psychology department, and a scholar on diversity, equity, and inclusion issues. To draw talent from that workforce requires an understanding and prioritization of DEI initiatives, she said.\n\n\u201cOur world is different,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when we are serving people who are not White, we want our workforces to be reflective of populations, because the technology that we\u2019re making is servicing individuals who are also not White.\u201d",

            "content": "Apple released iOS 18.2 in December, more than a month after the tech giant released iOS 18.1. The latest update brought a lot of Apple Intelligence features, like Genmoji and Image Playground, to some iPhones. But when Apple released iOS 18 in September, the tech giant brought T9 dialing to all iPhones.\n\nWith T9 dialing, you can call someone just by typing their name into your iPhone. That means with iOS 18, you don't have to search for a person's name in your contacts to call them or call them from Messages.\n\nRead more: iOS 18 Brings These Features to Your iPhone\n\nHere's everything you need to know about T9 dialing and how to use it on your iPhone.\n\nWhat is T9 dialing?\n\nT9 stands for text on nine keys. Before cellphones had full keyboards, many phones had 12 keys. These were for the numbers zero to nine, star and the pound sign or hashtag -- I felt old just writing that. To text someone, you mostly used the nine numbered keys.\n\nGetty Images\n\nEach numbered key had either three or four corresponding letters attached to it, with the zero key being the spacebar and the one key blank. If you go into your Phone app and tap Keypad across the bottom of your screen, you can see the corresponding numbers and letters.\n\nAt first, if you wanted to type \"Hello\" you had to press 44(H)-33(E)-555(L)-555(L)-666(0). That's a lot of typing for one fairly short word.\n\nT9 texting was introduced later, and it's an early form of predictive typing. It lets you press fewer keys and send messages faster. So for \"Hello\" you'd type 4-3-5-5-6. Much easier.\n\nHow to use T9 dialing on iPhone\n\nWith iOS 18, you can now use T9 dialing to make calls. Here's how.\n\n1. Open your Call app.\n\n2. Tap Keypad across the bottom of your screen.\n\nThat's not his real number. Apple/Screenshot by CNET\n\nFrom here, start typing the name of the person you want to call using the principles of T9. So if you want to call your dad, you'd type 3-2-3 into your keypad, and for your mom, you'd type 6-6-6 -- nothing to be freaked out about there, promise. Their name should appear across the top of the screen. As you type, a backspace button will appear beneath the pound sign/hashtag if you make a mistake. Press that as many times as needed. Note that there is no space button.\n\nOnce you find the right person, tap their name and their phone number will automatically be entered. Then hit the green call button, and you're set.\n\nIf there is more than one person in your Contacts by a given name, as you type you'll see an option beneath the top result that says something like \"3 more\u2026\" Tap that to open a new menu with all the corresponding contacts. Tap the call button next to the right contact and your call will immediately start. Be prepared to explain why you're calling the other person and not just texting them.\n\nFor more on iOS 18, here's what to know about iOS 18.2.1, iOS 18.2 and our iOS 18 cheat sheet. You can also check out what could come to your iPhone with iOS 18.3.",

The feature should arrive with macOS 15.4 and possibly iPadOS 18.4, both due in April.\n\nSimilar to Google's server-side Gmail sorting, which debuted in May 2013, Apple's Mail app on iOS sorts email into categories: \"Primary,\" \"Transactions,\" \"Updates,\" and \"Promotions.\" Moving an email manually from one category to another generally fixes the categorization for that sender from then on. You cannot create new categories, however, or alter how Apple's sorting functions.\n\nSome may prefer the simplicity of a single scroll of messages, versus having to check four separate inboxes to ensure that nothing got missorted or is more important than the label implies. I've used sorting on iOS and generally found it helpful, though I also use the Filters button in the lower-left corner on iOS to do a double-check of all the mail addressed specifically to me. On a Mac desktop, I'm partial to Mimestream, but that's because all my mail comes through Google/Workspace accounts. I'll be watching to see how Mail's sorting translates to macOS.",

Cult of Mac may earn a commission when you use our links to buy items.\n\nApple Pencil Pro: For the artists\n\nApple Pencil Pro is undoubtedly the premium iPad stylus. It offers everything artists need, including pressure sensitivity, tilt detection, palm rejection, a configurable capacitive button button and more. Charging happens on the edge of the latest M4 iPad Pro and M2 iPad Air models, as well as the iPad mini 7.\n\nI use an Apple Pencil Pro and love its new squeeze gesture. A quick squeeze opens a tool palette that lets me quickly switch settings for colors, brush shapes, line weights and more. And being able to use my iPad to easily track down the stylus using Find My if it gets misplaced is wonderful. Don\u2019t miss my review of Apple Pencil Pro.\n\nApple Pencil (USB-C): Better for non-artists\n\nApple Pencil (USB-C) doesn\u2019t have all the features of the Pro model but it costs much less, even when it\u2019s not on sale. And it does what non-artists need. I use the stylus for taking notes and sketching, signing documents and doing light edits to images. It\u2019s perfect for the handwriting mode in the new iPad Calculator app.\n\nThe only downside is that I need to occasionally plug it in to charge. It comes with a built-in USB-C port for that \u2014 hence the name. Read my hands-on review of the stylus for more details.\n\nOur pick for most users Apple Pencil (USB-C) 4.5 $79.00 $69.00 This is the Apple Pencil for the rest of us! In some ways, Apple's new budget stylus is better than the more expensive premium version, which is aimed at serious digital artists. If you need a capable iPad stylus for handwriting and sketching, this is the one for you. Pros: Pairs and charges via USB-C\n\nPairs and charges via USB-C Attaches magnetically\n\nAttaches magnetically Pixel-perfect precision with low latency\n\nPixel-perfect precision with low latency Works with most newer iPad, iPad Pro and iPad Air models. Cons: Can\u2019t get power directly from iPad Read our hands-on review: New USB-C Apple Pencil is lower in price but not usability Buy from Amazon Buy from Best Buy\n\nDeals save you up to 23% on Apple Pencil\n\nApple Pencil Pro ordinarily sets you back $129, but it\u2019s Amazon and Best Buy to the rescue. You can save up to $30 on the top-of-the-line Apple stylus.\n\nBuy Apple Pencil Pro from: Amazon or Best Buy\n\nThe regular cost for Apple Pencil (USB-C) is $79. It\u2019s on sale for $69. That\u2019s a fine price for a top-quality stylus.\n\nBuy Apple Pencil (USB-C) from: Amazon or Best Buy\n\nApple Pencil 2 is marked down 12%, from $129 to $115.\n\nBuy Apple Pencil 2 from: Amazon\n\nMagnetic Apple Pencil (2nd generation) $115.00 With Apple Pencil 2, get pixel-perfect precision and industry-leading low latency, perfect for note-taking, drawing and signing documents.

Apple Pencil 2 is not the same as the new Pencil Pro, and doesn\u2019t work with iPads released in 2024. The opposite is also true \u2014 Apple\u2019s latest Pro stylus doesn\u2019t work with iPads from 2022 and earlier.\n\nApple Pencil (USB-C) supports a broader array of tablets. It works with all the 2024 models, naturally, but support goes back to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 3rd generation, every version of the 11-inch iPad Pro, all the iPad Air models back to the fourth generation, the iPad 10, plus the current and iPad mini 6 models.\n\nWe originally published this Apple Pencil deals post on October 14, 2024.

            "content": "Apple released iOS 18.2 in October, more than a month after the company released iOS 18.1. When Apple released iOS 18.2, it brought the iPhone 16 lineup and the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max some Apple Intelligence features like Genmoji. But iOS 18.1 brought those same iPhones writing tools that can proofread, rewrite and alter written messages and comments.\n\nRead more: Everything You Need to Know About iOS 18.2.1\n\nWith these new tools, you can ask AI to rewrite a business email to sound more professional or friendly, or you can have AI proofread what you've written. These tools can be used anywhere you would type a message, like Messages, Mail and third-party apps like Instagram.\n\nHere's how to use AI to help make your messages pop. Just know that these tools are only available on the iPhone 16 lineup and the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, and you have to request access to Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, you won't be able to use these tools at this time.\n\nWhat to know about Writing Tools in Apple Intelligence\n\nAll Apple Intelligence-enabled devices get a new menu in their keyboard called Writing Tools. You can find this menu by highlighting your text and tapping Writing Tools in the floating menu over your text. You can also access Writing Tools by tapping the Apple Intelligence logo -- the pink and blue atom symbol -- in the menu over your keyboard.\n\nOnce you've opened Writing Tools, you'll see options to Proofread or Rewrite your text.\n\nTapping Proofread will check your text for grammatical errors. If it doesn't detect any errors it will give you the message \"No recommended changes.\"\n\nTapping Rewrite will adjust your message by changing words or describing things in more detail. After tapping Rewrite, you can tap Original to see what your original text was, or you can tap Rewrite again and Apple Intelligence will try again. However, I found that after tapping Rewrite four times on a particular text it didn't change the text at all. The number of times you can tap Rewrite before you stop getting changes is likely dependent on how long your text is, though.\n\nThere are also options to give your text a Friendly, Professional or Concise tone. Tapping Friendly, for example, will make your text read more informal and like chatting with a friend, and tapping Professional will make your text safe for work.\n\nDepending on the content of your text, you might get a message that reads, \"Writing Tools aren't designed to work with this type of content.\" I got this message when using curse words, and it seems to be meant to deter you from going further. However, you can tap Continue in the top right corner of the menu and Apple Intelligence will revise your message anyway. So if you type, \"That's bullshit,\" and ask Apple Intelligence to make it sound more professional, it might say, \"That assertion is inaccurate,\" which is now part of my corporate vocabulary.\n\nYou're right Apple Intelligence. It is. Apple/Screenshot by CNET\n\nIf you like what Apple Intelligence created, tap Done in the top right corner of the menu and the changes will stay. If you don't like what Apple Intelligence made you can tap Revert in the top left corner of the menu and you'll be taken back to the Writing Tools menu. You can also tap Original to check what your original text was.\n\nQuickly edit longer text with Apple Intelligence\n\nYou don't have to go through the Writing Tools menu to proofread or revise a longer text. Instead, highlight the entire text you want to edit and the options Proofread and Rewrite will appear in the menu over your keyboard.\n\nThese buttons work the same way as they do in the Writing Tools menu. If you're happy with your message, tap Done to replace your message with the rewritten version. But if you prefer your original message, tap Revert to go remove all changes.\n\nDon't forget, you should always reread your text if you use any of these tools. Because this is AI, your revised message might have errors or it might not make sense depending on the context.\n\nFor more on iOS 18, here's what to know about iOS 18.2.1, iOS 18.2 and our iOS 18 cheat sheet. You can also check out what could come to your iPhone with iOS 18.3.",

If so, which tech giant will it be?\n\nA report Sunday (Jan. 19) by Bloomberg News examines the company\u2019s trouble and uncertain future. After a messy app rollout in May, Sonos\u2019 market valuation is roughly $1.7 billion, down from more than $5 billion during the pandemic.\n\nThe board, wrote Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, will likely consider whether a sale makes sense. And while Apple has long been seen as a potential buyer, Gurman thinks it\u2019s unlikely.\n\n\u201cIf Apple really wanted to build out its home audio business, it already has the hardware, software, content and manufacturing chops internally,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s just about wanting to get things done properly \u2014 something that Apple is already working on. Later this year, it will launch its own home hub and a new HomePod mini.\u201d\n\nThe report also argued that suitors like Meta, Google and Microsoft also wouldn\u2019t make sense, while Amazon, Samsung and Spotify might consider a purchase.\n\nOf that group, Gurman adds, Amazon seems like the most natural fit, as the company is expected to revamp its device portfolio with an eye toward more upscale products. Sonos\u2019 tech could serve as the backbone for new Amazon Echo devices running the upcoming AI-infused Alexa digital assistant.\n\nIn exploring Amazon\u2019s efforts to upgrade Alexa last week, PYMNTS wrote that making the assistant smarter \u2014 something that\u2019s proven tougher than expected to do \u2014 is not as cut-and-dry as adding a large language model to it to replace its simpler algorithms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as moving from one model to another,\u201d Mike Finley, chief technology officer and co-founder of AnswerRocket, said in an interview with PYMNTS.\n\n\u201cAgentic AI is a bit more nuanced. It needs more structure and guidance to get us a better result. We will have to give it the original \u2018prompt\u2019 like we would in the past, but there\u2019s more work to shape the AI behavior we want.\u201d\n\nHe added that for Alexa to become more useful, it will need to become advanced enough for people to trust it with more important tasks.\n\n\u201cWould you trust Alexa to send the babysitter some cash? What if it hallucinates a couple of zeros on the wrong side? Agentic models can use resources like the ability to access databases or financial accounts, websites, documents, spreadsheets. But powering Alexa with those tools means gaining consumer trust to click \u2018allow,\u2019\u201d Finley said.",

            "content": "Ryan Haines / Android Authority\n\nWhen Apple first rolled out its AI-powered notification summaries as part of iOS 18, I admit I was excited. I tend to disappear in group chats during the day \u2014 usually because I\u2019m staying productive \u2014 which means I often come back to quite the stack of notifications that I have to read through. So, for my iPhone to sort through the mess and bring back a one-sentence summary sounded like a dream come true. As soon as it launched, I opted in.\n\nAnd, as it turns out, Apple Intelligence does summarize my notifications \u2014 or at least it tries to. By trying to condense possibly dozens of messages into one single sentence, it has to pick and choose what context matters. It\u2019s as if I were playing a game of telephone with friends, only the message I\u2019m waiting for is hundreds of words long. Here\u2019s what\u2019s going wrong and what Apple has promised to do about it.\n\nDo you currently use AI notification summaries? 135 votes Yes 18 % No 82 %\n\nContext? Who needs context?\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nAs I alluded to in my intro, the problem with Apple\u2019s notification summaries is simple: They\u2019re just too simple. Unfortunately, someone somewhere decided everything had to boil down to a single sentence, almost like a TikTok or a tweet (back when character limits existed). And, when attempting to summarize a 45-minute conversation between half a dozen other people, that means letting Apple Intelligence choose what matters.\n\nFor example, I\u2019m part of a group chat with several other tech journalists, and we all happened to be in Las Vegas for CES in early January. Of course, we all managed different schedules during our time in Vegas, but we tried to meet up whenever possible to grab lunch or share the location of a coffee shop with fast Wi-Fi \u2014 easier said than done. So, whenever I would wrap up a meeting, I\u2019d almost always pull up my iPhone 16 Pro to check what was going on and where everyone was.\n\nWho knew? It's hard to put 100 messages into a single sentence.\n\nMore often than not, I\u2019d end up even more confused than when I\u2019d started. Although I might occasionally get a helpful fact, like the location of a booth on the show floor or an interesting event, I often got something completely useless, like the phrase \u201cAnalysts are insufferable\u201d or a remark about needing to befriend a new PR representative. Both pieces became part of much funnier conversations later on, but in the moment, I had no idea what I was looking at.\n\nWorse, Apple\u2019s notification summaries aren\u2019t just for personal messages, either \u2014 they also try to make sense of Instagram memes and direct messages. For example, a friend and I share a love for all things women\u2019s sports, so I shot her a clip of Trinity Rodman talking about her relationship \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 with her father, Dennis Rodman. My friend replied that in that setting, Trinity looked surprisingly like Zendaya (not sure I agreed, but not important). In all of its infinite intelligence, Apple Intelligence summarized the interaction as \u201cTrinity Rodman appeared on podcast; surprised to learn he is Zendaya\u2019s dad.\u201d\n\nI mean, come on, Apple, that\u2019s not even close. I guess it\u2019s somewhat close in the sense that Trinity Rodman did appear on a podcast, and we did talk about Zendaya, but everything else has whisper down the lane written all over it. It wasn\u2019t even trying to summarize too many messages this time, either \u2014 our entire one-on-one conversation lasted about five minutes.\n\nGood for a laugh isn\u2019t good enough\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nOf course, using Apple\u2019s notification summaries for personal text messages isn\u2019t a life or death situation \u2014 at least, it isn\u2019t usually. But what happens if it is? The way Apple has its optional summaries set up at the moment is that they\u2019ll work for just about any app on your phone \u2014 social media, personal messaging, or otherwise. And yes, that includes the news.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but the last thing I want is a summary of the news that misses key pieces of context \u2014 the type of thing people read the news for. And this time, it\u2019s not just me complaining about Apple\u2019s struggle to make sense of information. The news errors have been so bad that Apple Intelligence turned the BBC\u2019s report about the murder of the United Healthcare CEO into a summary of how he had shot himself. Not only is it incorrect, but it\u2019s the opposite of the truth. If that type of mix-up were to happen with regard to the wildfires in California, it could put users in danger by suggesting that the fires were headed towards them \u2014 or worse, incorrectly telling them they were safe.\n\nHow do you get this... From this?\n\nUnfortunately, Apple\u2019s tendency to fumble the truth also conflates serious personal situations. My colleagues Rita and Mahmoud were recently discussing the steps required to become an organ donor and how it\u2019s vital to list emergency contact information (just in case). Apple took that information and turned it into a summary about abortion even though the words \u201cabortion\u201d or \u201cscar\u201d were never mentioned. somehow, it still nailed the fact that emergency contact information was part of the discussion. In any situation, bringing up abortion has the potential to be incredibly traumatizing to people, so for Apple to pull it out of the utterly wrong context is even worse.\n\nIs Apple going to do anything about its spotty summaries?\n\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority\n\nSo, with the knowledge that Apple\u2019s notification summaries struggle with context and often try to compress information just a bit too tightly, you\u2019d expect that it means a solution is on the way, right? After all, when Google\u2019s AI-powered search results told people to mix non-toxic glue in with pizza cheese to give it a better pull, it paused its rollout immediately. Well, it sounds like the answer is a resounding no.\n\nInstead, Apple released a statement to Ars Technica, essentially saying that its summaries are optional and that the original content is still easily accessible. It also promised to make content from Apple Intelligence more clearly identifiable as AI-generated and encouraged users to report if they experienced an unexpected or inaccurate summary. That sounds like Apple saying, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like our Apple Intelligence \u2014 the thing we\u2019ve centered our new iPhones around \u2014 don\u2019t use it.\u201d\n\nDon't like Apple's summaries? Don't expect a quick fix.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, I guess that\u2019s the only solution that works now. Right now, you can opt in or out of Apple\u2019s notification summaries one app at a time, which means you could keep them for things like Instagram and Messages but shut them off for news services and business apps like Slack. It\u2019s a fancy way of telling users to turn it off, don\u2019t turn it back on again, and it doesn\u2019t leave a great taste in my mouth when it already feels like Apple is far behind the AI eight-ball in most cases.\n\nGoing forward, I think I\u2019ll probably keep Apple\u2019s notification summaries active for Messages because I can usually keep up with my conversations, but for everything else, I\u2019ll be sticking with a good, old-fashioned pile of notifications.\n\nYou might like",

Cramer started the show by talking about healthcare stocks and said \"Healthcare really hasn't had much of a move so I think those stocks, honestly a safe haven with interest rates going higher.\"\n\nHe added that the US government's export control rules to protect American national security interests were hitting markets hard. According to Cramer \"I still expect 5% to hit on the ten-year [bond] but I've got to tell you the tone is hideous, I think the tone is being set by the Biden administration, doing a last minute 200-page ruling about who can get AI and who can't.\" He added \"And then David, I've got to tell you, I think the Zuckerberg interview on Joe Rogan was seminal.\" The reason behind it was that Zuckerberg's thoughts about the firm behind the iPhone indicated \"you're done, nothing since Steve Jobs, one one of the most offensive interviews I've heard in a very long time.\n\nReturning to the rate cuts, Cramer asserted again that the Fed had misjudged the economy by lower rates in December. According to him \"The whole concept of the rate cuts, as opposed to one or two rate cuts, gotta be off the table because it looks like we've had some very serious misjudgment by the Fed.\"\n\nAs for the fires, Cramer started by stating that there's \"Not enough talk about the fires.\" The day this show was aired, he was covering the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Cramer outlined \"I certainly wanna ask everyone at the healthcare conference, what can happen, in terms of public health, what can happen in terms of asthma.\" Along with healthcare problems arising from the disaster, he added \"But more important as you know, Carl, the loss of life, the destruction, so immense, it's going to impact the economy. We don't even know yet, what could be the results.\"\n\nOne industry that's been at the center of media coverage whether it's for disasters or healthcare is the insurance industry. Talking about insurance, Cramer revealed, \"Well I have to tell you, the insurance regime out here in California is so strict that you have to wonder why bother to write anything. There's a loss-sharing agreement that's terrible, there is a sense to me that it's going to take longer to come back than people realize.

This wasn\u2019t some groundbreaking leak, since the design had already been unveiled on the iPhone back at WWDC, but it was interesting, since there weren\u2019t any signs of the new Mail app coming to macOS quite yet.\n\nThen, in December, iOS 18.3 and macOS 15.3 beta started rolling out. While macOS 15.3 did bring Genmoji to macOS, it didn\u2019t bring the new Mail app to the Mac, leaving many wondering when it\u2019d debut.\n\nHowever, according to Gurman, this will be changing very soon with the upcoming macOS 15.4 release, which will likely enter beta in the coming weeks, and debut in April:\n\nBut there\u2019s another, more under-the-radar feature coming in April as well: The Mac will get the upgraded Mail app that uses AI to prioritize messages and sort content into different inboxes. Right now, iPad and iPhone users are able to tap into the feature \u2014 which is terrific \u2014 but Mac customers have been left behind. That changes with macOS 15.4, I\u2019m told. For those not familiar with the feature: It sorts mail into a primary category, as well as ones for transactions, promotions, updates and all mail.\n\nGurman states that the new Mail app is currently available for iPad users, though that isn\u2019t actually the case quite yet, neither in iPadOS 18.2 nor iPadOS 18.3. Hopefully, we see the new Mail app debut for iPad users soon, with the release of iPadOS 18.4. Only time will tell.\n\nAre you excited for the new Mail app to expand to other Apple platforms? Let us know in the comments.\n\nSome great Apple accessories on Amazon:\n\nFollow Michael: X/Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram",

Read more about how we evaluate products .\n\nIf you've been waiting for a deal on Apple\u2019s flagship AirPods Max, now is the time to buy a pair. Amazon has discounted the USB-C model to $449, or 18 percent off their suggested $549 price. Since we first posted this story earlier, most colors have sold out, but the starlight color is still available at the time of this update.\n\nThe AirPods Max need no introduction, but it\u2019s worth taking a moment to consider if they make sense to buy in 2025. No doubt, they sound great and offer tight integration with other Apple devices, but if you don\u2019t count the minor refresh Apple made this past September, the AirPods Max are now more than four years old. In that time, the competition has only gotten better; in fact, the AirPods Max aren\u2019t even on Engadget\u2019s list of the best noise-canceling headphones you can buy in 2025. Even taking into account their current $100 discount, there are options like the Sony WH-1000XM5 that are better and cheaper.\n\nStill, there\u2019s a case to be made for the AirPods Max, particularly for someone deeply invested in Apple\u2019s ecosystem. As easy as Sony\u2019s app makes pairing, the process is still nowhere near as easy and seamless as Apple\u2019s native integration. If you\u2019re a frequent Siri user, the AirPods Max win there too. Just keep in mind Apple is likely to release a proper update to the AirPods Max later this year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter and subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.\n\nUpdate, January 19 2025, 6:55 PM ET: This story has been updated to reflect that fewer colors remain in stock at the discounted price.",

            "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (^GSPC -1.71%) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (AAPL -0.11%) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.",

After all the festivities of December this first month of the year can feel stark and sombre, with spring still feeling like it\u2019s a long way away. But there is a small festival in January which can help to bring some cheerfulness and delight to an otherwise cold, grey month. Apple Wassailing has enjoyed a resurgence in the last few years, along with a folk revival in the UK. An interest in traditional orchards and the growth of community orchards has meant that Wassailing has become a part of the calendar once again.\n\nKeeping alive the ancient rituals and traditions which encourage a connection and a deep appreciation for our trees and land feels more important than ever. Orchards and woods are disappearing fast and habitats for wildlife are dwindling. Orchards are unique habitats supporting up to 18,000 wildlife species. Wassailing is a bit of fun, but it\u2019s also an enriching experience, because it provides the opportunity to feel a part of preserving the environment. It might be a very small part, but every nurturing action helps.\n\nWassailing is believed to be a centuries old custom that took place on Twelfth Night, this being the last day of Christmas (6th January). But in 1752, England adopted the Gregorian calendar and dates were adjusted by 11 days. Although Twelfth Night remained on the 6th January, traditionalists regard the 17th January\u2014Old Twelfth Night, or \u2018Old Twelvey\u2019\u2014as the proper day for Wassailing, and most Wassails were held around this time. Wassails don\u2019t have to be on this specific date, they can be anytime in January. Likewise they can be held during the day or in the evening.\n\nWassailing has survived down the centuries, although mainly in the South and West country areas of Sussex, Somerset and Gloucester. It is said that villages had their own Wassailing songs.\n\nCeremonies vary, but all have similar core elements. The word \u2018Wassail\u2019 derives from the Anglo Saxon \u2018waes hael\u2019: to be whole and in good health. Wassailers would have been made up of farmers, farm workers and villagers who would go from orchard to orchard in a noisy procession.\n\nThe tradition of wassailing is to wake up the apple trees and scare away evil spirits to ensure a good autumn fruit harvest. A Wassail King or Queen leads the song or processional tune to be played. The best or oldest tree is chosen to represent the orchard. Cider is poured on the roots, and toast (often soaked or dipped in cider) is placed in the forks of the tree or hung from the branches for the robins. These winter bird companions are thought to be the guardians of the orchard. An incantation is recited and the trees are then rapped by the assembled crowd who will sing, shout and bang pots and pans. To conclude the ceremony Wassail songs are performed, accompanied by much merry making.\n\nWassail ceremonies roughly follow this format, although it varies from region to region. Like many folk customs, nothing is set in stone, and it\u2019s open to interpretation. That\u2019s the best thing, there is nothing to get wrong, only what what feels right and appropriate for you.\n\nOften we will do our own wassailing ceremony at home, rather than going to a community Wassail. We have a Cox\u2019s apple tree and a crab apple in our garden, and we\u2019ve had just as much pleasure from blessing our apple trees as we have going to an orchard. Likewise when I\u2019ve lived in flats previously, I have followed my own mini Apple Blessing Ceremony at home and kept it really simple.\n\nBelow you\u2019ll find the Wassail Ceremony that I use. I have included some accessible adaptations underneath that. Feel free to adjust it in ways that suit you. Muddy orchards and gardens in January are not always easy to access. Likewise, if you don\u2019t have apples trees in your vicinity, or outdoor ceremonies are difficult to attend for any reason, Wassailing can be adapted into an Apple Blessing Ceremony that you can do resting inside. It\u2019s no less meaningful. Like all offerings the important part is the intent and thought behind it. Wassailing is about giving thanks for the food we have and offering a blessing for the year ahead.\n\nWASSAIL CEREMONY\n\nTraditionally, the Wassail begins with a musical procession to the orchard or garden tree. The best or oldest tree is chosen to represent the orchard. The music can be played with instruments or sung acapella, or even played on someone\u2019s phone. Singing incantations and traditional wassail songs in the orchards was thought to reawaken the apple trees from their winter slumber. Some people use rags or ribbons to decorate the tree to bring the \u2018good spirits\u2019 and also to \u2018hold\u2019 the participants blessings.\n\nWassailers then gather round the tree. The ceremony then begins with an invocation:\n\nEveryone present is invited to take a piece of toast, pour a little cider on it (or dip the bottom of the toast into a bowl containing cider) then hang it on the tree, offering a blessing for the year ahead. Some participants choose to say a blessing out loud as they do so, such as \u201cto good health and a good harvest\u201d, some people prefer to say a private, silent blessing. There\u2019s no right or wrong way. Pieces of toast were hung up in the branches of the apple trees to please the spirits already in the fruit trees and to attract more good spirits.\n\nA participant is then invited to pour cider on the soil, over the roots of the tree, to wish them \u201cgood health\u201d.\n\nThen an incantation is recited by wassailers, such as the Sussex Tree Blessing:\n\nThe trees are then rapped with sticks by the assembled crowd, and at the same time there\u2019s singing, shouting, clattering pots and pans and making as much of a din as possible. The rapping and beating of the tree was believed to stimulate its growth, and also banish any bad spirits to ensure a good harvest of fruit next autumn.\n\nTo end the ceremony, everyone joins in the singing of a traditional wassail song, such as the Old Fox Wassail:\n\nThe merrymaking continues with wassail punch, cakes and more music. You can find a Wassail Punch recipe below.\n\nADAPTATIONS\n\nIf it\u2019s better for you, instead of gathering round a tree you can sit at a table indoors and use a bowl of apples as the focal point. You can still use all the same verses: invocation, incantation and Wassail song. You can also use toast, and pour a little juice (or cider) on it to offer a blessing of good health and a good harvest for the year ahead. You could add candles next to the apples, and any other greenery if you like.\n\nOn the other hand, to simplify it even further you could lie down holding an apple in your hands and recite the invocation, incantation and Wassail song out loud, or in your head. It will hold significance because of your intention, not the amount of things you use or don\u2019t use.\n\nWASSAIL PUNCH\n\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published Serves 4 Less than 10 minutes preparation time 20 minutes cooking time\ufeff This is a non-alcoholic version.

            "content": "My name is Leon Perez, and I\u2019m 79 years old. If you grew up in Cuba in the 1950s like me, you witnessed many historic events unfold before your eyes. A newlywed Frank Sinatra honeymooned on the island, Ernest Hemingway wrote his Pulitzer Prize-winning The Old Man and the Sea from his villa on the outskirts of Havana, and the island imported many of the classic, colorful vehicles from Ford, Cadillac, and Chevrolet that continue to transport people today. Amid the cultural and economic boom that the island was experiencing, however, were rising political tensions that would soon change the lives of many \u2014 including Cuba\u2019s Jewish population. In the 1950s, Cuba had a thriving Jewish community. We were a population of over 25,000 Jewish people from all over the world \u2014 from places such as Greece, Syria, Russia, Turkey, Spain, and Egypt. However, everything changed after the Cuban Revolution of 1959 and Fidel Castro\u2019s rise to power. Many Jewish people, my family included, who had experienced persecution before, became terrified they would experience it again.\n\nReina Perez (Leon\u2019s mother \u2013 L), David Perez (Leon\u2019s father \u2013 R), Alberto (Leon\u2019s brother \u2013 L), and Leon (R). Image courtesy of Daniel Perez.\n\nOur Jewish Life in Cuba My father was of Turkish origin but never told us whether he was born in Turkey or Cuba. My mother was also of Turkish descent. Our family played an important role in the consolidation of the Jewish community in Havana. As the community began to grow throughout the 1930s and 1940s, my father opened a small Hebrew school. He also established a business school called La Comercial. This school was designed to teach entrepreneurship skills to people from the Jewish community who had recently arrived in Cuba, enabling them to earn a living and survive. He met my mother at this school, and they later married in Havana. After a few years of running La Comercial, my father responded to requests from community members for a school where their children could study and learn about Jewish values and culture. In 1950, he opened the first-ever Hebrew school for children on the island, called the Albert Einstein Institute. My father was always looking out for others. If someone from the community couldn\u2019t afford the full school fees, he would let them attend regardless. He also welcomed non-Jewish children to teach them the value of diversity.\n\nCelebration for Cuban Independence Day with students of the Hebrew school in La Havana, to the left are David and Reina Perez (Leon\u2019s parents). Image courtesy of Daniel Perez.\n\nA Revolution and a Flight to Safety My parents invested so much in the Jewish community in Cuba, they never imagined they would have to uproot their lives once more to seek safety abroad. However, when Fidel Castro came to power in 1959, many Jewish people on the island became fearful. The new Cuban government reminded them of the suffering Jewish communities had experienced in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe: forced displacement, massacres, and expulsions. As a consequence, around 95% of the Jewish population left the island during this period of history. Thousands of Cuban Jews started contacting HIAS to plan their journeys to safety in the United States. My parents got in touch with HIAS via letters and began making arrangements for my brother and me to travel to Miami, Florida. I was only 15 years old at the time, and my brother was 12. I don\u2019t know how our plane tickets came into my parents\u2019 possession, but eventually, they did. In 1961, my brother and I left the island. We stopped three times on our way to Miami: first in Jamaica, then in Aruba, and finally in Cura\u00e7ao before reaching the U.S. I don\u2019t remember every part of the journey, but I recall that in Cura\u00e7ao, we lived in a house owned by people affiliated with HIAS who were helping Cuban refugees. We stayed in that house for 10 days while HIAS organized everything for our travel to the U.S. HIAS then took us from Cura\u00e7ao to Miami, where another family took us in, and we lived with them. My parents, still in Cuba and making arrangements to reunite with us, were concerned about my brother and me feeling isolated in Miami. They requested that HIAS transfer us to the home of a family in New York, close to a cousin of my mother. HIAS made it happen. We stayed with a Jewish family who welcomed us with love. I still remember the sweet bubbe of the family, who made us matzo ball soup.\n\nLeft: Leon Perez (L) with his brother Alberto Perez (R). Right: Reina and David Perez (Leon\u2019s parents) with Leon (L) and his brother Alberto (R). Images courtesy of Daniel Perez.\n\nA Family Reunion and a New Beginning Six months later, in July 1961, my parents left Cuba with HIAS\u2019s support. They had a stopover in Jamaica, where they stayed for some time in a communal house. After that, they finally arrived in New York, and we were reunited. HIAS provided us with funds to find somewhere to live in New York. We moved into an apartment close to my mother\u2019s cousin in Brooklyn. Eventually, my parents found jobs \u2014my father as a college teacher and my mother as a secretary. We all settled in and started learning English. When my parents became more economically stable, they returned the money HIAS had provided, so it could help others in need. Now, I\u2019m 79 years old and have a family of my own. I married my wife, who is from Colombia, in New York, and we have three children together. Those children have given us seven grandchildren, and we couldn\u2019t be happier. I also had a successful clothing and hosiery business, which I managed until just three years ago. The business allowed me to provide for my family and create a stable life for us in the United States. Looking forward, my greatest hope is for my family to remain healthy, happy, and free from persecution. Thanks to HIAS, we are here today and can envision this bright and promising future.",

            "content": "Apple trees barren from the recent winter frost span miles of backroad in West Virginia\u2019s Eastern Panhandle. In a few months, the trees will flower; come autumn, they will bear local growers bushels of ripe fruit.\n\nBlossoming apple trees are a familiar sight for the region and play a key role in the local agriculture industry. But federal and state officials say market woes have placed the future of West Virginia\u2019s orchards at risk.\n\nThat is a reality Don Dove, general manager for Orr\u2019s Farm Market in Martinsburg, has felt first hand.\n\nDove says demand for his apple supply has waned. One-third of the apples his team grows go toward food processing, but processing companies have requested fewer and fewer apples since 2023. That year, about 20 percent of his total apple crop went unclaimed, he said.\n\n\u201cIt added a real big stress onto our crop there, right off the bat, as soon as we started picking,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when we knew we had a problem.\u201d\n\nOrchards remain in jeopardy\n\nDove is not alone. The importation of apples and apple concentrates for food processing from countries with lower labor costs has widely displaced domestic growers.\n\nIn early 2024, retail prices for apples grown in the United States fell to a three-year low, according to Catharine Weber, agricultural economist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Economic Research Service.\n\nWeber delivered data on the current state of the U.S. apple industry through a prerecorded video presentation at a regional forum Thursday. The event was hosted by the Farmlink Project, a nonprofit that helps domestic farmers redistribute excess produce to eliminate food waste.\n\nFarmlink invited apple growers from across Appalachia to the event. The afternoon forum followed a tri-state meeting that morning, which aimed to familiarize Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia farmers with various forms of state and federal aid available to agriculture businesses in Appalachia.\n\nFarmlink organizers used the second meeting to inform Appalachian growers like Dove about the state of the apple industry and solicit feedback over how to best support their business needs.\n\n\u201cThese are wonderful farming families from wonderful communities that have got the most nutritious produce item we could have \u2014 and that is the apple \u2014 to improve food insecurity and nutrition health in our country,\u201d said Mike Meyer, head of farmer advocacy for Farmlink.\n\nAt his orchard, Dove said the fallout from West Virginia\u2019s apple market issues has not been as severe as it could have been. That is because orchards like Orr\u2019s Farm Market found support from the state and federal government and their work with Farmlink.\n\nApple growers from Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia met in Martinsburg Thursday to discuss the state of the apple industry with the nonprofit Farmlink Project.\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: Jack Walker/West Virginia Public Broadcasting\n\nWhen the state stepped in\n\nIn 2023, the USDA allocated $10 million to the West Virginia Department of Agriculture (WVDA) through the Agricultural Adjustment Act, a 1933 law that allows the government to subsidize agricultural oversupply. The USDA provided a subsequent $3.1 million in 2024.\n\nThe WVDA allocated this funding to nonprofits like Farmlink, which coordinated the distribution of extra apples to food banks and hunger relief programs nationwide, while paying farmers for the produce.\n\nBetween September and December 2024, Farmlink distributed 18 million pounds of West Virginia-grown apples to food insecurity charities, Meyer said. 3.3 million pounds of apples were sent to recipients within the state, including 49 charities.\n\n\u201cWe hope to grow the program,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been successful in West Virginia for two years. It\u2019s a large, team effort.\u201d\n\nJody Sims works for Kitchen\u2019s Farm Market, an apple and produce business based in the Berkeley County community of Falling Waters. Last year marked her first time working with Farmlink, and she said the redistribution process was a boon for business.\n\n\u201cThey have been amazing. They help with finding food banks that are willing to take the loads,\u201d she said. \u201c20, 30 minutes later, they\u2019re calling you back: \u2018Hey, I got a truck coming. How many loads you got?\u2019\u201d\n\nMeyer said Farmlink hopes to model its work in surrounding states around its partnership with West Virginia state officials. This could help regional apple growers through a tough spot, he said.\n\nBut the future of efforts like these depends on a renewal of government funding. With new elected officials being inaugurated on both the state and federal levels this month, Meyer said Farmlink is reaching out to new administrations to keep programs like these going.\n\nBarren amid the off-season frost, fruit trees stretch across the property of Orr\u2019s Farm Market in rural Berkeley County.\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: Jack Walker/West Virginia Public Broadcasting\n\nAn uncertain season ahead\n\nMeyer said it is unlikely for demand issues in the apple industry to end soon.\n\n\u201cWhen I think about 2025, I think it will be a similar supply situation to 2023 and 2024,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cI think, unfortunately, some of these markets are gone for good \u2014 particularly in the eastern United States.\u201d\n\nFederal officials with the USDA are currently looking into long-term solutions, but Meyer and the team at Farmlink are hoping a new slate of elected officials will renew shorter-term forms of aid in the interim.\n\nAmie Minor-Richard serves as assistant commissioner of the WVDA, under recently reelected Commissioner Kent Leonhardt. She said there is no \u201cone direct program\u201d that will solve issues in the industry, but that the WVDA hopes state and federal representatives will provide farmers broad support.\n\nMinor-Richard said the WVDA\u2019s is advocating for a reexamination of policies surrounding apple importation to ensure that domestic farmers \u201care on a level playing field.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to lose our apple orchards here in the United States, because then we\u2019ll have to depend on foreign countries to provide us our nutrition,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a scary, scary idea.\u201d\n\nThe WVDA is advocating for a higher tax credit for farmers donating excess produce, in addition to a renewal of redistribution support for the state\u2019s apple growers, Minor-Richard said.\n\nBut funding for redistribution support from groups like Farmlink has previously come from budget appropriations on the federal level. In the past two years, former Sen. Joe Manchin led the effort to secure this funding.\n\nWith Manchin\u2019s seat now filled by the state\u2019s former governor, Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., Minor-Richard said the WVDA intends to discuss the program with the Justice administration.\n\nWhile Minor-Richard said Justice was supportive of agriculture in the past, his delayed inauguration meant these conversations are yet to take place. She added that WVDA have also reached out to the office of incumbent Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., regarding federal forms of aid.\n\n\u201cWe hope to have those conversations in February,\u201d Minor-Richard said.\n\nIn the meantime, farmers like Dove are bracing for a season of uncertainty ahead. Without financial support from the government, he worries that the Eastern Panhandle\u2019s apple industry could face serious risk.\n\n\u201cIt really could fold up quickly without the proper funding and proper safety net,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "With President-elect Donald Trump adding uncertainty around whether a TikTok ban will go into effect, the focus is now turning to companies like Google and Apple that are expected to take the popular video sharing app off their platforms in just two days.\n\nThough the Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld a federal law that could ban TikTok nationwide, it\u2019s unclear how a shutdown of the popular social media platform will play out and what Americans will see when the clock strikes midnight on Sunday.\n\nThe court decision comes against a backdrop of unusual political agitation by Trump, who vowed that he could negotiate a solution after he takes office, and the administration of President Joe Biden, which has signaled it won\u2019t enforce the law beginning Sunday, his final full day in office. Now, tech observers \u2014 and some users \u2014 are intently watching to see what happens over the weekend and beyond.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really in uncharted territory here in terms of tech policy,\u201d said Sarak Kreps, the director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute.\n\nUnder the law, mobile app stores \u2014 like the ones operated by Apple and Google \u2014 and internet hosting services will face major fines if they continue to distribute the platform to U.S. users beyond the deadline for divestment from ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company. The companies could pay up to $5,000 for each user who continues to access TikTok, meaning penalties could total to a large sum.\n\nLate Friday night, TikTok posted a statement on X saying that \u201cthe Biden White House and the Department of Justice have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok\u2019s availability to over 170 million Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\u201d it said.\n\nExperts have noted TikTok\u2019s app should remain available for current users, but existing ones will no longer be able to update it, making it unusable in the long term.\n\nTrump\u2019s national security adviser has signaled this week that the incoming administration may take steps to \u201ckeep TikTok from going dark,\u201d though what that looks like \u2014 and if any of those steps can withhold legal scrutiny \u2014 remains unclear.\n\n\u201cMy decision on TikTok will be made in the not-too-distant future, but I must have time to review the situation,\u201d Trump said Friday in a post on Truth Social after the court\u2019s ruling. Earlier in the day, he said in another post that TikTok was among the topics in his conversation with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nIn the meantime, some of the attention has turned to tech companies, such as Apple, Google and Oracle, who currently offer TikTok on their app stores or host company data on their servers.\n\nTech CEOs have been attempting to forge friendlier ties with Trump, who wants to put the TikTok ban on hold, since he was elected in November. But Kreps said it would \u201cdefy credulity\u201d for them to continue to offer TikTok, even if they want to please Trump, since it would open them up to punitive fines.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday upheld the federal law banning TikTok beginning Sunday unless it\u2019s sold by its China-based parent company. President-elect Donald Trump vowed he could negotiate a solution, and the Biden administration has signaled it won\u2019t enforce the law.\n\nTech companies are also used to removing apps at the behest of governments. In 2023, Apple says it removed nearly 1,500 apps globally. Nearly 1,300 of the apps were taken down in China.\n\n\u201cPenalties for companies like Apple and Google could run as high as $850 billion,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X on Thursday, while referring to the U.S. TikTok law. \u201cNot sure I\u2019d take a politician\u2019s word if I ran those companies.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, said he believes there\u2019s a \u201csmall chance\u201d that nothing happens to TikTok, but acknowledged that would require \u201cenormous risk on the on the part of the companies that support them.\u201d\n\nApple, Google and Oracle did not respond to questions sent this week about their plans on TikTok.\n\nIn a video after the court ruling, TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is expected to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration and be granted a prime seating location on the dais, thanked the president-elect for \u201chis commitment to work\u201d with TikTok to \u201cfind a solution\u201d that keeps the platform available.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform \u2014 one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process,\u201d Chew said.\n\nEarlier this week, TikTok told its U.S. employees that its offices would remain open for work even if the \u201csituation\u201d won\u2019t be resolved by Sunday. In the memo, which was first reported by The New York Times and confirmed by the company, TikTok told workers that their \u201cemployment, pay and benefits\u201d were secure, adding that the law was written in a way that impacts the U.S. user experience, not the entities that employ them.\n\nMeanwhile, in a letter sent Friday to Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland, an attorney for TikTok creators who sued the government asked the administration to pause enforcement of the law \u201cuntil there is further definitive guidance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, we request that you clarify that no app store, internet hosting service, or other provider faces any risk of enforcement or penalties with respect to TikTok, CapCut, or any other ByteDance apps, until such further guidance has been issued,\u201d said the letter by attorney Jeffrey Fisher.",

            "content": "ChatGPT is OpenAI's extremely useful chatbot for answering questions. Here's how to use the generative AI tool in Apple's Notes app in macOS.\n\nApple Intelligence is now integrated with OpenAi's ChatGPT in macOS, ad well as iOS and iPadOS. Many features of ChatGPT are integrated with Apple apps starting in macOS Sequoia 15.1, and iOS and iPadOS 18.2.\n\nWhile Apple has stated support for Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT are evolving and still in progress, some features are working and included in Apple's operating systems. Expect a further phased rollout of Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT in the near future.\n\nFor a complete review of new Apple Intelligence iOS and iPadOS features, see our article iOS 18.1 & iPadOS 18.1 review: baby steps with Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn order to use ChatGPT in Notes, you have to have a subscription to ChatGPT Plus ($20/month), Pro, Enterprise, Team, or Educational. OpenAI has stated support for ChatGPT free tier integration in macOS will be coming later in 2025.\n\nOpenAI has a pricing page, and at $20/month, the Plus tier is fairly reasonable. Plus or higher also gives you access to o1 and o1-mini models.\n\nIf you already have Apple Intelligence and the ChatGPT extension enabled, skip to the last section \"Using ChatGPT in Notes\". Even so, the next section below has some useful info on where ChatGPT is available in Apple apps.\n\nWhat's included\n\nIn the above versions of Apple's operating systems, Apple states Apple Intelligence is integrated into Notes, Photos, Siri, Safari, and other apps with Writing Tools. ChatGPT is also integrated into some of the apps.\n\nFor example, you can now use ChatGPT prompts in Siri for lookups. Apple Intelligence Writing Tools work anywhere there is a text field.\n\nWriting Tools include summarizing text, rewriting text, proofreading, and even composing text. Apple also provides summaries in the form of Notification summaries, web page summaries, and others.\n\nSummaries for web pages in browsers are particularly useful. Some third-party browsers such as Firefox also support summaries.\n\nYou can turn off Notification summaries separately in System Settings->Notifications->Summarize Notifications.\n\nApple promises that using Apple Intelligence does not send your data to Apple (although some parts of Siri can still require this).\n\nTurning on Apple Intelligence\n\nBefore you can use ChatGPT in Apple's apps you must first turn on Apple Intelligence in the System Settings app (or the Settings app in iOS).\n\nTo do so, open System Settings in the /Applications folder on your Startup Disk (or from the Apple menu), then scroll down and click on Apple Intelligence & Siri on the left.\n\nNext, on the right, click Get Apple Intelligence to begin the setup process. After clicking the button it will be replaced with text reading \"In Progress...\" while the additional software is downloaded and installed.\n\nThis may take a while (up to an hour or more on some Macs).\n\nWait for Apple Intelligence to install and set up.\n\nOnce that is completed, you'll get a notification that your Mac is ready to use Apple Intelligence. The System Settings button will reappear, but this time it reads Set Up Apple Intelligence.\n\nClicking that button displays a sheet that walks you through setting up each feature of Apple Intelligence. This is not unlike the sheets that appear when you set up a new Mac.\n\nThe first step is choosing which apps use summaries. You can skip this part by clicking Set Up Later if you don't want summaries.\n\nClick \"Set Up Apple Intelligence\" to get started.\n\nNext, you'll step through Siri setup, but mind that there's no way to opt-out on the sheet at this point. The setup notifies you that Siri may send some of your data to Apple (including audio), but that the data is not tied to your Apple account.\n\nClick Continue, then select a Siri Voice from the list provided. Click Continue again.\n\nNow the sheet gives you a chance to opt out of sending your data to Apple if you want. Click Not now to opt-out, then click Continue.\n\nApple Intelligence and Siri are now fully enabled and you can turn either off or back on by using the two sliders that appear in System Settings. Also now enabled at the bottom of the Apple Intelligence & Siri pane is an Extensions section, one of which is for ChatGPT:\n\nApple Intelligence installed and enabled in macOS Sequoia.\n\nTurning on ChatGPT\n\nGo ahead and click ChatGPT under Extensions to set up ChatGPT. There's also a slider for determining if you want to allow Siri to recommend using ChatGPT in some instances.\n\nNext, click the Set Up... button next to Use ChatGPT.\n\nYou'll now get another sheet telling you what ChatGPT can do: integrate with Siri, compose text in Writing Tools, and work with a ChatGPT account. Click Next - which leads you to another sheet informing you that the Mac works with ChatGPT in a way that preserves your privacy:\n\nYou decide what gets shared with ChatGPT You can turn ChatGPT off in System Settings any time You can use ChatGPT with an account, or use it anonymously\n\nIf you want to use ChatGPT with an account, click the Use ChatGPT with an Account button. Otherwise, click the Enable ChatGPT button to use it anonymously.\n\nClick \"Set Up...\" to begin the setup of the ChatGPT extension.\n\nThere's also a privacy note button that gives you a text summary of Apple's and OpenAI's policy on ChatGPT privacy in the extension. If you want, you can Select All (Command-A) on the text, copy it by Control-clicking, then paste it into a file in TextEdit or another editor for later review.\n\nOf particular note are these paragraphs:\n\n\"If there is no explicit request to use ChatGPT, your request is analyzed to determine whether ChatGPT might have useful results. If it does, Siri will ask whether you would like to use ChatGPT. If you choose, Siri will send your request to ChatGPT and present the answer directly. You also can choose to disable Siri asking you to confirm whether Siri should send a request to ChatGPT by going to Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri > ChatGPT, and tapping to turn off Confirm ChatGPT Requests.\n\nWhen you use Writing Tools and visual intelligence with the Camera Control, you will be able to choose whether you would like to use the ChatGPT extension for each of these features separately.\"\n\nThe note then goes on to explain that, in anonymous mode, it is OpenAI's official policy that it must not store requests, or their results (unless required by law), and it must not use requests to train its models. Attached documents are also not stored in anonymous mode.\n\nIn anonymous mode, OpenAI does not receive any info about your Apple account, and your IP address is hidden from OpenAI servers. General location information is however sent for the purposes of \"enabling ChatGPT to prevent fraud and comply with applicable law\".\n\nYou can turn off ChatGPT and its interaction with Apple Intelligence in the Extensions pane at any time, in the same way that you turned it on. You can also leave Apple Intelligence and/or Siri turned on, even if you turn the ChatGPT extension off.\n\nAfter you've read and understood the Privacy statement, return to the Extension pane, and click Enable ChatGPT. Once ChatGPT is enabled in System Settings, you can later click the Sign In button, and turn it off entirely using the slider.\n\nOpenAI \"Advanced Capabilities\" are free up to a certain limit, then basic ChatGPT functionality is available until twenty-four hours have elapsed.\n\nThere's also a slider for confirming Siri requests.\n\nThis completes the set up of both Apple Intelligence and the ChatGPT extension.\n\nUsing ChatGPT in Notes\n\nOnce Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT have been enabled, you can now use them in Writing Tools in any app that supports text editing - including the Notes app.\n\nCurrently to use ChatGPT/Notes integration you have to be signed into a ChatGPT account because OpenAI has to verify your paid pricing tier. If you're not signed in, go back to the Extension pane in System Settings for ChatGPT and click the Sign In button.\n\nYou'll also need to go to the Settings page for your ChatGPT account, enable the Works With Apps setting, then click Manage Apps to select which apps you want to allow ChatGPT to work with.\n\nTo use ChatGPT in Notes, open the Notes app, select any note on the left, then press Option+Shift+1 on your keyboard. This brings up the ChatGPT prompt in which you can type a question to get an answer for the information contained in the selected note.\n\nIf, for some reason, the Note can't be processed, ChatGPT servers can't be reached, or you're not signed in to ChatGPT, you'll hear the macOS system sound.\n\nThere's also a voice mode you can enable to control ChatGPT.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nChatGPT integration with Apple apps is exciting because it promises to take automation to a whole new level. This includes lookups, summaries, editing, condensing, composing, and more.\n\nWhat would really be cool would be for Apple to provide some other automation features from a UI standpoint (much like AppleScript does today). For example, one could imagine telling ChatGPT to select all notes with certain titles or content, and then merging them, condensing their content, removing parts of content, or sending them somewhere else.\n\nVoice control combined with UI interaction could be really powerful.\n\nImagine having one hundred notes in the Notes app and telling ChatGPT to \"Merge all notes containing Apple-related content\". That could save hours.\n\nThe possibilities may be endless.",

The tech giant had been facing mounting pressure to withdraw the service, which sent notifications that appeared to come from within news organisations' apps. \"We are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update,\" an Apple spokesperson said. Journalism body Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said it showed the dangers of rushing out new features. \"Innovation must never come at the expense of the right of citizens to receive reliable information,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"This feature should not be rolled out again until there is zero risk it will publish inaccurate headlines,\" RSF's Vincent Berthier added.\n\nFalse reports\n\nThe BBC was among the groups to complain about the feature, after an alert generated by Apple's AI falsely told some readers that Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had shot himself. The feature had also inaccurately summarised headlines from Sky News, the New York Times and the Washington Post, according to reports from journalists and others on social media. \"There is a huge imperative [for tech firms] to be the first one to release new features,\" said Jonathan Bright, head of AI for public services at the Alan Turing Institute. Hallucinations - where an AI model makes things up - are a \"real concern,\" he added, \"and as yet firms don't have a way of systematically guaranteeing that AI models will never hallucinate, apart from human oversight. \"As well as misinforming the public, such hallucinations have the potential to further damage trust in the news media,\" he said. Media outlets and press groups had pushed the company to pull back, warning that the feature was not ready and that AI-generated errors were adding to issues of misinformation and falling trust in news. The BBC complained to Apple in December but it did not respond until January when it promised a software update that would clarify the role of AI in creating the summaries, which were optional and only available to readers with the latest iPhones. That prompted a further wave of criticism that the tech giant was not going far enough.\n\nA news alert from December 2024 was among the complaints made by the BBC to Apple\n\nApple has now decided to disable the feature entirely for news and entertainment apps. \"With the latest beta software releases of iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and macOS Sequoia 15.3, Notification summaries for the News & Entertainment category will be temporarily unavailable,\" an Apple spokesperson said. The company said that for other apps the AI-generated summaries of app alerts will appear using italicised text. \"We're pleased that Apple has listened to our concerns and is pausing the summarisation feature for news,\" a BBC spokesperson said. \"We look forward to working with them constructively on next steps. Our priority is the accuracy of the news we deliver to audiences which is essential to building and maintaining trust.\"\n\nAnalysis: A rare U-turn from Apple\n\nZoe Kleinman \u2022 @zsk Technology editor",

I asked Siri to use ChatGPT to show me how to brew a cup of coffee, and at first, it wrote out a seven-step process on how to make drip coffee in a standard brewer. Those instructions were a little wonky, telling me to measure out my water and coffee grounds before grinding my coffee beans. Another time, I asked the same thing and Siri gave me a five-step process, which was more accurate. There is a disclaimer at the bottom of these ChatGPT requests that reads, \"Check important info for mistakes.\"\n\nYou can also copy what Siri and ChatGPT show you by tapping a button in the top right corner of the window that shows two pieces of paper. Then, you can paste the response in a message or a note if you want -- but again, you should verify the details of your request.\n\nRead more: ChatGPT Gets Integrated Into Siri With iOS 18.2\n\nGenmoji\n\nThere are over 3,000 emoji you can use, but sometimes you can't find the one you really want. Genmoji is here to help. With the Apple Intelligence Genmoji feature, you can describe the emoji you're looking for and iPhones with Apple Intelligence will attempt to generate a new emoji based on your description.\n\nApple/Screenshot by CNET\n\nTo use Genmoji, go into a message and tap the emoji keyboard in the bottom left corner of your keyboard. Then, type the emoji you're looking for into the search bar. If there isn't an emoji that matches your description, tap Create New Emoji just below the search bar. Your iPhone will then show you a few variations of what it came up with based on your description. You can swipe through the emoji, and when you find a Genmoji you like, tap Add in the top right corner to permanently add that new emoji to your keyboard.\n\nRead more: How to Create Custom Emoji With Genmoji and AI\n\nVisual Intelligence\n\nThis is Apple's answer to Google Lens. Visual Intelligence is an Apple Intelligence feature that lets you point your camera at something, like a dog, and your iPhone will then use the photo to search online to help you identify it. The feature can also be used to detect phone numbers to create contacts, scan QR codes and translate languages.\n\nYou can also integrate this feature with ChatGPT to help you identify items, as well as to help you better understand what's on a page or screen. Note that you don't need a ChatGPT account to use the integration.\n\nThis feature is also only available on the iPhone 16 lineup since it utilizes the series' new camera control side-button. If you have one of the new iPhones, long press the new side-button where the SIM card tray used to be to quickly pull up Visual Intelligence.\n\n\"The camera control provides instant, easy access to the camera with just a click. It allows you to adjust various camera features simply by sliding your finger,\" Apple said at its Glowtime event in September. \"Its convenient design ensures it's always within reach.\"\n\nImage Playground\n\nThis Apple Intelligence feature takes Genmoji one step further and lets you create whole images based on text prompts in a tool called Image Playground. This feature is a standalone app and it can also be found in Message by tapping the plus (+) button to the left of your text box.\n\nImage Playground is filled with prompt suggestions, themes, places and more to get you started. You can enter multiple prompts to make the image more specific, but once I entered seven prompts a popup appeared telling me to use fewer. There's also an option to change the art style from the default cartoony 3D images to illustrations.\n\nIf you want to put yourself, friends, family or your pet into one of these images, you can. Tap the plus (+) sign in the bottom right corner and then tap either Choose Photo or Take Photo. You'll still have to choose or enter a prompt in addition to the photo.\n\nApple/Screenshot by CNET\n\nThe feature can create some simple images, and it can be unintentionally funny with how weird other images are. In one instance, I selected the prompts astronaut, artist and lighthouse. One of the results showed an astronaut leaning against what I Imagine is an invisible stool while painting a multicolor beach scene. But for some reason there's a lighthouse just floating in the background. Phenomenal work.\n\nYou can also draw a sketch in Notes, select your sketch and then use it with Visual Playground. That way you can either clean up your sketch, or if -- like me -- you're not an artist, you can use the feature to flesh out your sketch.\n\nRead more: Everything You Need to Know About Image Playground\n\nFind My improvements\n\nThe Find My app can be used to locate things like your AirPods and MacBook, and with iOS 18.2, Apple makes it easy for everyone to get help finding lost items. If you go into Find My > Items and tap one of your items, you have two new options: Share Item Location and Show Contact Info.\n\nApple/Screenshot by CNET\n\nIf you enable Share Item Location, Find My will create a link that you can share with others so they can notify you if they find your lost or missing item. This could be especially helpful as we head into the holidays as more people are traveling and losing luggage at airports or leaving items behind. These links expire after one week, though, which may not be enough time to find them.\n\nIf you enable Show Contact Info, others can connect to lost items so they can find ways to contact you and bring your item back to you.\n\nNew Mail categories\n\nThe Mail app on every iPhone also gets an upgrade in iOS 18.2. Apple announced in September that Mail would soon be able to sort emails to multiple categories to keep your important emails in one place and ads or promotions in another, like Gmail and Outlook do. The new layout keeps things mostly tidy, but Mail doesn't always get it right. For example, I found an email for digital tickets I previously ordered in the Promotions category rather than the Primary category.\n\nYou don't have to use the new layout if you don't want to. To change your Mail layout back, go into Mail, tap the three dots (...) in the top right corner and tap List View.\n\nRead more: What to Know About Mail Categories and How to Disable Them\n\nVolume slider is back on your lock screen\n\nApple/Screenshot by CNET\n\nApple previously removed the volume slider on the iPhone's lock screen. You could still use the volume buttons on the side of your iPhone, but it wasn't as precise as the slider. With iOS 18.2, you can add the slider back to your lock screen.\n\nGo to Settings > Accessibility > Audio and Visual and tap the toggle next to Always Show Volume Control. Now, whether you're listening to a podcast or music from one of Apple's apps or a third-party app the volume slider will be present on your lock screen.\n\nRead more: How to Bring the Volume Slider Back to Your iPhone in 4 Easy Steps\n\niPhone speaker volume limit\n\nApple/Screenshot by CNET\n\nIf you have kids who like to play games or watch videos on their iPhones and they set the music to full blast, that could damage their device's speakers -- not to mention that it could be annoying to you. But iOS 18.2 lets set a maximum volume limit on an iPhone.\n\nTo set a limit go to Settings > Sounds & Haptics > Volume Limit and tap the toggle next to Limit Maximum Volume. A scale will appear and you can select what you want the limit to be. Apple does note that this limit doesn't apply to things like phone calls, FaceTime calls, emergency calls or Find My sounds.\n\nChange your default apps\n\nIf you like using another messaging or email app, like Signal or Gmail, over Apple's native apps, you can change your default apps to those other apps in iOS 18.2. And in some regions you can even change your default app marketplace.\n\nRead more: Don't Like Your Default iPhone Apps?

Since then the tech company has made some changes to its news aggregator service, like the addition of the Quartiles puzzles. With iOS 18.2, Apple brings Sudoku to Apple News Plus subscribers.\n\nIf you subscribe to Apple News Plus ($13 a month) go to News > Following > Puzzles to play the latest puzzle. Every day, Apple launches a few of these puzzles, each ranging in difficulty, so there's always a new brain-teaser to play.\n\nRead more: What You Need to Know About Sudoku on Your iPhone\n\nRequire Screen On camera toggle\n\nIf you have any phones from the iPhone 16 lineup, you have the Camera Control button. You have to press this twice to open your camera if your screen is asleep or inactive, but Apple introduced a new toggle in the iOS 18.2 so that you can press the Camera Control once to open your camera even if your screen is off.\n\nTo do this, go to Settings > Display & Brightness and tap the toggle next to Require Screen On to disable the feature. Now if you press the Camera Control while your screen is off, your iPhone will open your Camera without a second press. However, it could also lead to accidentally opening your camera more often.\n\nHere are the full release notes for iOS 18.2.\n\nApple Intelligence (All iPhone 16 models, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max)\n\n1.

            "content": "The board of Apple has joined Costco\u2019s board in recommending that investors reject shareholder proposals from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) that ask the companies to publish a report on the risk of its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs or eliminate them completely. Corporate board members at other companies that want to remain committed to their DEI programs may want to examine how these two companies are dealing with these anti-DEI shareholder proposals and adapt some of their methods.\n\nAlthough the shareholder votes on these proposals have not yet been completed, any board of a company that might be targeted by NCPPR might want to begin discussing and planning how they might react to anti-DEI shareholder proposals. Of course, as several other companies determined last year, ending such programs is also an option that boards can choose.\n\nIn Apple\u2019s case, the NCPPR shareholder proposal is asking the company to cease all DEI efforts. The conservative group argues that last year\u2019s US Supreme Court ruling that discrimination on the basis of race in college admissions violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment may also apply to corporate DEI programs, potentially equating them with illegal discrimination.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,\u201d NCPPR wrote in its supporting statement to its shareholder proposal against Apple. \u201cShareholders request that the Company consider abolishing its Inclusion & Diversity program, policies, department and goals.\u201d\n\nIn its shareholder proposal against Costco, NCPPR is asking that \u201cthe Board conduct an evaluation and publish a report, omitting proprietary and privileged information, on the risks of the Company maintaining its current DEI (including \u201cPeople & Communities\u201d) roles, policies and goals.\u201d\n\nIn its supporting statement to its shareholder proposal against Costco, NCPPR wrote, \u201cWith 310,000 employees, Costco likely has at least 200,000 employees who are potentially victims of this type of illegal discrimination because they are white, Asian, male or straight. Accordingly, even if only a fraction of those employees were to file suit, and only some of those prove successful, the cost to Costco could be tens of billions of dollars.\u201d\n\nIn both cases, NCPPR has labeled DEI as \u201cillegal discrimination\u201d even though no court has made that determination, and the conservative group cites the threat of lawsuits as the primary risk and reason for getting rid of DEI programs.\n\nHere is how the Apple and Costco boards are dealing with these challenging shareholder proposals:\n\nIn its proxy statement, Apple has responded to the shareholder proposal asking it to cease all DEI programs by asserting that:\n\n1. The proposal is unnecessary as Apple already has a well-established compliance program and the proposal inappropriately attempts to restrict Apple\u2019s ability to manage its own ordinary business operations, people and teams, and business strategies. The proposal inappropriately seeks to micromanage the Company\u2019s programs and policies by suggesting a specific means of legal compliance.\n\n2. Apple\u2019s Board and management team maintain active oversight of legal and regulatory risks and compliance for its global business. Apple\u2019s determination of the appropriate means by which to comply with applicable law, including any associated changes to our programs, policies, departments, or goals, is a fundamental aspect of Apple\u2019s business operations.\n\n3. We seek to conduct business ethically, honestly, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and our Business Conduct and Compliance policies are foundational to how we do business. And we strive to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work.\n\nIn its proxy statement, Costco has responded to the shareholder proposal asking for a report on the risks associated with its DEI programs by asserting that:\n\n1. Our success at Costco Wholesale has been built on service to our critical stakeholders: employees, members, and suppliers. Our efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion follow our code of ethics: For our employees, these efforts are built around inclusion \u2013 having all of our employees feel valued and respected. Our efforts at diversity, equity and inclusion remind and reinforce with everyone at our Company the importance of creating opportunities for all.\n\n2. We believe (and member feedback shows) that many of our members like to see themselves reflected in the people in our warehouses with whom they interact.Having diversity in our supplier base, including appropriate attention to small businesses, is beneficial for many of the same reasons diversity benefits our Company. We believe that it fosters creativity and innovation in the merchandise and services that we offer our members.\n\n3. As part of our obeying the law, all decisions regarding recruiting, hiring, promotion, assignment, training, termination, and other terms and conditions of employment will be made without unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, religion, age, pregnancy, disability, work-related injury, covered military or veteran status, political ideology or expression, genetic information, marital status, or other protected status.\n\n4. Our focus on diversity, equity and inclusion is not, however, only for the sake of improved financial performance but to enhance our culture and the well-being of people whose lives we influence. The proponent professes concern about legal and financial risks to the Company and its shareholders associated with the diversity initiatives. The supporting statement demonstrates that it is the proponent and others that are responsible for inflicting burdens on companies with their challenges to longstanding diversity programs. The proponent\u2019s broader agenda is not reducing risk for the Company but abolition of diversity initiatives.\n\nThe key takeaways from the Apple and Costco boards\u2019 responses are:\n\n\u2022 Respond quickly and directly to shareholders, explaining why the company engages in DEI programs. Apple states that the company strives to \u201ccreate a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work.\u201d Costco states that \u201cOur efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion follow our code of ethics.\u201d These statements and more are in the company proxy statements for all investors to see so they can draw their own conclusions.\n\n\u2022 Emphasize that your company follows the law and is aware of what it needs to do to operate the DEI programs legally and in compliance with current regulations. Make sure to point out that your company does not discriminate against anyone.\n\n\u2022 If possible, declare and substantiate any benefits (financial performance, recruitment, enhanced corporate culture or otherwise) that DEI has contributed to the company.\n\nLastly, Costco sought to demonstrate that the NCPPR has an anti-DEI agenda that actually is contributing to the legal risks that it claims to want to eliminate for the company (noting that it has threatened filing lawsuits against others.) That approach might hold more risk than some boards would like to take.\n\nPrint Article",

The sci-fi thriller from creator Dan Erickson is an amazing piece of TV, one of those triumphs of world-building that leaves you shaking and racing to Reddit to read theories as soon as an episode ends. Severance debuted in 2022 and is only just now returning after substantial production delays. It follows workers at a megacorporation who submit to a procedure that severs their work memories from their personal ones, and it gets wildly weird. The new season, which I\u2019ve seen most of, is a worthy follow-up to the first.\n\nSeverance is not alone among strong Apple TV+ sci-fi or strong Apple TV+ shows in general. For my $9.99, this service is an indispensable streamer these days, the gateway not just to Severance but to Slow Horses, For All Mankind, and a handful of others. No platform has a better ratio of things I watch to things I finish\u2014and actually enjoy\u2014than this one.\n\nI am in the minority. Though its parent company might have ambitions for the service that are more complex than winning the streaming wars, it is clear that Apple TV+ is losing them in a lopsided fashion. According to Nielsen data, well under 1 percent of all TV screen time in the United States is spent on Apple TV+ in any given month. (About 0.3 percent is typical. YouTube, the king, is above 10 percent, while Netflix is around 8 percent, Prime Video 4 percent, and Hulu 3 percent.) Apple TV+ is so far down the list of streamers by watch time that Nielsen relegates it to the \u201cother streaming\u201d category of a pie chart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s odd. Apple is the most ubiquitous company around, with a theoretical billboard for its streaming service sitting in most of our pockets at all times. Yet Apple cannot get a bite from the streaming public, seemingly no matter how much money it spends on any number of quality shows. I have decided that Apple TV+\u2019s issues are the result of a weird thing to say about an Apple product: The service is just a bit too pure for this world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple has never released subscriber figures for its streamer. That number might not be illuminating anyway, because the company has given away lots of subscriptions. If you have bought certain Apple products in the past few years, you have gotten some free months of Apple TV+. If your favorite baseball team had a game on Apple TV+, you could get some free months of Apple TV+ to watch that one game. (You could even do this if you were a former subscriber who had taken a break.) If you did nothing at all but were at home on the first weekend of the year, you could at least get Apple TV+ free for a few days.\n\nFreebies aren\u2019t the only idea Apple has tried to get more people onto the service. It also followed the same strategy as most of its would-be competitors. Live sports are perhaps the easiest way for a huge company to drive subscribers to a streamer. (See Peacock\u2019s use of the NFL playoffs and Olympics.) Apple hasn\u2019t gotten any properties that big, and one of its bigger bids, the one for the Pac-12, didn\u2019t work out. Weekly Major League Baseball games last year did not lift it out of the viewership basement. Apple\u2019s partnership with Major League Soccer, which now puts every game on a special paywalled product within Apple TV+, has been pretty good for MLS, all things considered. Yet Apple TV+ continues to languish at the bottom of the pecking order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts sports portfolio aside, Apple TV+ has an excellent selection of shows. A few have caught cultural fire, most of all Ted Lasso, a sports sitcom with a heavy dose of mental health drama. The Morning Show has done well enough to briefly get into the top 10 most-watched streaming shows. Silo, a post-apocalyptic drama about people living in an underground tube, has done some big numbers. So has Shrinking, a mental health dark comedy of sorts that shares a star and writer (Brett Goldstein) with Lasso. These shows have each cost many millions of dollars, all with impeccable sets and production value. They also have huge stars anchoring them: some Harrison Ford here, some Jennifer Aniston there, some Jason Sudeikis or Reese Witherspoon there. In a vacuum, you would think they\u2019d all be blockbusters. Yet Apple TV+, in raw viewership terms, continues to flail.\n\nNobody will ever feel bad for Apple, which is less an edgy, independent producer and more the most powerful company in the world trying to grab a slice of the streaming ecosystem to pad its reputation or, one day, its margins. Being part of the most giant of tech giants has sometimes limited the good work Apple TV+ has done. Tim Cook reportedly intervened to stop a show about the death of Gawker, a website that offended him personally. Jon Stewart\u2019s latest talk show ended because it wasn\u2019t palatable for him to talk freely about geopolitics on a service operated by a company that sells lots of iPhones in China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate Netflix\u2019s New Hit Show Is Relentlessly Violent\u2014Except When It Comes to One Odd Choice Read More\n\nBut let us assume that the American public isn\u2019t passing on Apple TV+ because of a principled objection to Big Tech\u2019s control over storytelling. Seemingly everyone has an idea about why the service hasn\u2019t caught on more. If there were one silver-bullet answer to the question of why more people aren\u2019t watching, then Apple, which sits atop of a pile of many billions of dollars in cash, would have found it by now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe service barely has a library. You can scroll through all of Apple TV\u2019s couple of hundred shows and movies in a matter of seconds. Most tech media have surmised that this small library is a disadvantage, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re right: Apple just doesn\u2019t have an endless pile of titles to algorithmically throw users into as soon as they\u2019re done with whatever they\u2019re watching. But I have quite enjoyed the platform\u2019s small selection, because it spares me from the paralysis of endless choice that drowns me on Netflix.\n\nOther factors abound. Apple TV+ doesn\u2019t get nearly the marketing push that Apple\u2019s hardware gets, a disparity that\u2019s drawn the attention of entertainment journalists. The service\u2019s shows are great, but you may have noticed the lack of any discussion in this story about feature-length films. That is because Apple\u2019s forays into film have been somewhere between \u201cfine\u201d and \u201ccommercially and critically disastrous,\u201d as when spy movie Argylle bombed in 2024. Then there is the simple matter of price. Apple TV+ is competitive at $9.99 a month, especially for a service that remains (for now, anyway) ad-free. But $9.99 is more than the old $4.99 and $6.99, and no streamer is immune to people bailing as it hikes the price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the company at issue here were not literally Apple, this streaming service would be a sympathetic player. I want a streamer that doesn\u2019t confuse me with a deluge of titles I\u2019ll never watch, shuffling me algorithmically from one to the next faster than I can tell what is happening. I want a streamer that does not mind spending tens of millions of dollars on untested properties, rather than intellectual property reboots. (Hollywood\u2019s economy could use it.) I want a streamer that isn\u2019t fully bound to reality programming as a low-cost way to keep eyeballs. That may all be too much to ask for in the long term, but for now I will settle for something more modest. I would like enough people to watch Severance that I can have a proper group chat about it before some cost-cutter in Cupertino asks what\u2019s going on.",

Yes, you\u2019ll still find fingerprint readers in a few places on Apple devices, such as MacBook keyboards and iPad sleep buttons. But gone are the days of the iconic Touch ID home button on the iPhone and iPad. In fact, once the next-generation iPhone SE launches in the coming months, we\u2019re not likely to ever see it again.\n\nIf you\u2019re like my mother and you fear all change, I\u2019ve got some good news for you. Apple\u2019s discontinued iPad 9th-Gen tablet is back in stock at a few different retailers, including Amazon and Best Buy. It\u2019s also on sale at the lowest price I\u2019ve seen in a while \u2014 just $249 at Amazon for the 64GB model or $399.99 for the 256GB option. The only bad news is that inventory keeps coming and going, so you\u2019ll have to keep checking back a few times a day if you miss the restock that happened at the time of this writing. As for Best Buy, I don\u2019t recommend buying one there because it\u2019s actually $0.99 more expensive than the newer iPad 10th-Gen, which is down to $299 right now.\n\nSee Pricing See Pricing See Pricing See Pricing\n\nApple\u2019s newer 10th-Gen iPad was a decent upgrade, but it\u2019s not really anything to write home about. It\u2019s also much more expensive than the previous-generation iPad model, which was just dumped from Apple\u2019s current tablet lineup.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

But it starts at $349 even after Apple\u2019s price cut, while the 10.2-inch iPad started at $329. And now, since the iPad 9th-Gen has been discontinued, you can get it even cheaper until retailers sell out of their current stock.\n\nThanks to a big discount, this best-selling iPad model starts at just $249. Or, if you want to bump up your storage to 256GB instead of 64GB, you\u2019ll still save a bundle and pay $399.99 instead of $479. Those are both great prices, but there\u2019s obviously one problem. Since this iPad model is discontinued, it won\u2019t stay in stock for very long.\n\nSee Pricing See Pricing\n\nAnother great deal is available right now for anyone in search of a more compact Apple tablet.\n\nThe iPad mini has been a reader favorite ever since the 1st-generation model debuted back in 2012. Apple is now on the 7th-generation model after fans waited an eternity for the update that came last year.\n\nApple\u2019s newest iPad mini has a powerful A17 Pro processor, all-day battery life, and a stunning 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display.

The firm made headlines recently by needling Southwest Airlines for accepting federal funds while allegedly prioritizing certain groups. The Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs addressed the complaint, indicating no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nAmerica First Legal also filed a lawsuit against Target regarding a Pride campaign the company held several years ago, among other Target nods to diversity.\n\nIn a challenging year, how employers maintain DEI\n\nAlong with noting that it is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate in recruiting, hiring, training, or promoting, Apple \u201cseeks to operate in compliance with applicable non-discrimination laws\u201d in both the U.S. and other jurisdictions where it employs workers.\n\nPer the proxy statement, the conservative think tank\u2019s proposal \u201cinappropriately seeks to micromanage the Company\u2019s programs and policies by suggesting a specific means of legal compliance.\u201d\n\nThe approach of Apple\u2019s leadership is similar to Costco\u2019s recent rejections of DEI-related shareholder proposals.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, a Lululemon shareholder went as far as to seek retribution for dropped stock prices due to blowback from DEI programming perceived as performative.\n\nApple\u2019s 2025 annual shareholder meeting will take place virtually on Feb. 25 at 8:00 a.m. PT.",

            "content": "The Competition Appeal Tribunal has refused an application for a collective proceedings order (\u201cCPO\u201d) in a claim against Apple and Amazon regarding alleged breaches of competition law in connection with the sale of Apple products on Amazon\u2019s UK website.\n\nIn a judgment handed down on 14 January 2025 (the \u201cJudgment\u201d),[1] the Tribunal, chaired by Mrs Justice Kelyn Bacon, concluded that it could not make a CPO in this case because the Proposed Class Representative, Christine Riefa Class Representative Limited (the \u201cPCR\u201d), had failed to satisfy the authorization condition.\n\nFollowing two certification hearings, including \u2013 for the first time at the certification stage \u2013 the cross-examination of Professor Christine Riefa as sole representative of the PCR, the Tribunal concluded that the PCR had \u201cnot demonstrated sufficient independence or robustness so as to act fairly and adequately in the interest of the class\u201d.[2]\n\nThe issues arising at the hearings focused primarily on the PCR\u2019s funding arrangements and their implications for the question of the PCR\u2019s suitability to act as a representative in these proceedings. In particular, the funding terms included (i) a success fee calculation that Amazon and Apple argued gave rise to excessive and unfair returns to the funder, (ii) a requirement for the PCR to seek payment to the funder in priority over distribution to the class, and (iii) confidentiality provisions that prevented disclosure of the funding terms to class members.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal concluded that the funding terms (as amended following the first hearing) were not in themselves \u201csufficiently extreme to warrant calling out\u201d, the evidence as to (i) the circumstances in which those terms had been agreed, and (ii) the limited extent to which the PCR had scrutinized and understood them, led the Tribunal to conclude that the claim should not be certified. In particular, the PCR had not demonstrated that it was suitably qualified to act as class representative and the manner in which it had approached the funding arrangements did not reflect sufficient regard to the interests of the class.[3]\n\nCleary Gottlieb acted for Amazon in successfully resisting the CPO Application.\n\nThe Proposed Claim\n\nThe PCR sought aggregate damages on behalf of a proposed class comprising all those who had purchased Apple (and Beats-branded) products at retail level in the UK from late 2018 onwards.\n\nThe core allegation in the proposed collective proceedings was that certain agreements between Apple and Amazon in relation to the sale of Apple products on Amazon\u2019s UK website amounted to a breach of competition law. The result of the alleged breach was said to be that purchasers of Apple products via any retail channel in the UK had paid higher prices than they otherwise would have.\n\nThe claim was brought on a \u2018standalone\u2019 basis, in the absence of any decision by the Competition and Markets Authority or the European Commission on which the PCR could rely to establish liability.\n\nAs recorded in the Judgment, the \u201cgenesis\u201d of the case appears to have been an approach by economist Dr Chris Pike of Fideres Partners LLP to law firm Hausfeld & Co. (\u201cHausfeld\u201d), further to which Hausfeld arranged funding for the claim and subsequently identified the PCR.[4]\n\nIssues Arising on the CPO Application\n\nBy an application filed in July 2023, the PCR applied for a CPO on an opt-out basis (the \u201cCPO Application\u201d).\n\nIn their Responses to the CPO Application, Amazon and Apple raised substantive objections to the claim, which they opposed in its entirety. However, the focus of argument at the certification stage was on issues relating to the PCR\u2019s funding arrangements and, correspondingly, the PCR\u2019s suitability.[5]\n\nThese matters were relevant to the authorization condition, which requires the Tribunal to determine whether it is \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d for the PCR to act as a class representative in the proceedings.[6] As summarized in the Tribunal\u2019s Guide to Proceedings 2015 (the \u201cCAT Guide\u201d), the \u201ccentral purpose of this assessment is to ensure that class members are adequately and appropriately represented\u201d.[7] It requires consideration of (inter alia):\n\nwhether the PCR \u201cwould fairly and adequately act in the interests of the class members\u201d;[8]\n\nthe PCR\u2019s ability to manage proceedings and instruct its lawyers;[9] and\n\nthe PCR\u2019s financial resources, including third party funding, insurance and fee arrangements with its lawyers.[10]\n\nIn the present case, further to the points raised by Amazon and Apple in their Responses, at the first certification hearing in July 2024 the Tribunal expressed clear concerns regarding: (a) the PCR\u2019s funding terms; (b) the means by which they had been obtained; (c) the PCR\u2019s ability to make independent decisions on funding matters; and (d) the PCR\u2019s acceptance of confidentiality provisions that prevented disclosure of the funding terms to class members.[11]\n\nAs a result of those concerns, the Tribunal gave the PCR an opportunity to file further evidence and to make any necessary adjustments to the Claim Form and/or funding arrangements, and directed the listing of a further certification hearing in advance of which the Proposed Defendants could apply for permission to cross-examine the PCR.\n\nThat hearing took place in September 2024 and Professor Riefa (as the sole representative of the PCR) was cross-examined by counsel for both Amazon and Apple. This was the first time a PCR had been cross-examined at the certification stage.\n\nThe Funding Issues\n\nThe key funding issues live at the two certification hearings can be summarized as follows:[12]\n\nThe requirement to seek an order for payment to the funder in priority to the class.\n\nIn the event of a successful outcome and an award of damages to the class, the PCR\u2019s litigation funding agreement (the \u201cLFA\u201d) imposed an obligation on the PCR to apply to the Tribunal for an order permitting all or part of the award to be paid to the PCR in respect of costs, fees and disbursements. If the Tribunal made such an order, payments of such amounts to the PCR\u2019s funder, solicitors and counsel would take priority over and above any distribution to the class members.\n\nFollowing the first certification hearing and in light of the issues raised at that hearing, the LFA was amended.[13] The amended LFA retained the requirement for the PCR to make such an application, but only \u201cwhere it is appropriate in all the circumstances\u201d. The revised clause provided for a dispute resolution mechanism in the event of a disagreement about whether it was appropriate to make such an application.\n\nThe possibility of such an application gave rise to a concern that payment of the funder\u2019s return (and amounts due to lawyers and insurers) could substantially diminish or even exhaust the pot of damages available to the class in the event of a successful outcome. Moreover, the amended wording requiring an application to be made \u201cwhere [ ] appropriate\u201d introduced considerable uncertainty, given the lack of clarity as to how \u2018appropriateness\u2019 should be judged.\n\nThe amount of the success fee.\n\nAfter an initial amendment to reflect the outcome of the decision in PACCAR,[14] prior to the first certification hearing, the LFA provided that the funder\u2019s success fee be comprised of: the drawn funds; plus a \u2018priority multiplier\u2019 of up to 1.75 times the drawn funds, depending on when the claim was resolved; plus the greater of: (i) a \u2018balancing multiplier\u2019 of up to 2.75 times the drawn funds, depending on when the claim was resolved; or (ii) an amount giving the funder an internal rate of return (IRR) on its drawn funds of 45%.\n\nThe Proposed Defendants raised concerns at the first hearing that: (i) the potential sums recoverable by the funder were very high and potentially excessive; and (ii) the IRR-based clause gave the funder an incentive to ensure the proceedings lasted as long as possible and to allow maximum draw down of funds, which may in turn incentivize the funder to resist an otherwise reasonable settlement.\n\nAgain, amendments were made following the first certification hearing. A new definition of the success fee was introduced, which replaced the IRR with a revised set of increased multipliers, which varied over time and reached a maximum of 5.75x after seven years.\n\nThe Proposed Defendants\u2019 continued to argue that the potential returns to the funder were too high. In particular, evidence filed on behalf of the PCR between the two hearings indicated that the maximum return in this case was almost double what was available elsewhere on the market. Moreover, there was no evidence before the Tribunal that the rates now provided for in the LFA were fair or market-tested on the basis of the risks inherent in this particular claim.\n\nThe Suitability Issues\n\nThe issues regarding the PCR\u2019s suitability to act as class representative arose in two primary ways.\n\nFirst, the issues with the terms of the LFA described above themselves gave rise to a concern as to the PCR\u2019s suitability, as they appeared to run counter to the PCR\u2019s overarching responsibility to protect the interests of the class.\n\nSecond, the evidence advanced on behalf of the PCR in support of the CPO Application generated concerns regarding the extent to which the PCR had in fact scrutinized and understood the terms of the LFA, which in turn gave rise to a broader question as to the PCR\u2019s ability to manage the proceedings generally.\n\nProfessor Riefa\u2019s first witness statement in support of the CPO Application (\u201cRiefa 1\u201d) contained very little detail on the funding arrangements or the extent of any independent detailed consideration of the terms of the LFA by the PCR. The limited detail that was provided contained an important error.\n\nSpecifically, Riefa 1 explained that, in the event of a successful outcome, the PCR would make an application for payment of costs and expenses (including those due to the funder) from any unclaimed damages (i.e. after distribution to the class). This description did not accurately reflect the terms of the LFA and, as Amazon\u2019s counsel submitted at the first certification hearing, this indicated that Professor Riefa may have concluded that the terms of the LFA were reasonable on the basis of a misunderstanding of those terms and the obligations they imposed on the PCR.\n\nThe Tribunal also raised its own concerns regarding the PCR\u2019s approach to the confidentiality provisions in the LFA. In response to questioning on those points at the first hearing, the position advanced by counsel for the PCR was that the funder \u201cfelt strongly\u201d about them and the PCR \u201cwould not want to take a position contrary to that of her funder\u201d.[15] Although certain assertions of confidentiality were subsequently waived by the funder, the PCR\u2019s position that she would not want to take an adverse position vis-\u00e0-vis her funder nevertheless indicated that she may not have been acting with the interests of the class front of mind (particularly since the class\u2019s interest was likely to be in understanding the nature of the commitments taken on by the PCR pursuant to the LFA, which it could not do if the relevant provisions of the LFA could not be disclosed to class members).[16]\n\nUnexplained errors in the terms of the LFA and the ATE policy also gave rise to concerns regarding the PCR\u2019s attention to detail, and the lack of any consultative panel raised the question of whether the PCR had sufficient independent support.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Decision\n\nDespite having expressed its concerns at the first hearing and given the PCR an opportunity to rectify the issues arising, by the conclusion of the second hearing the Tribunal concluded that the PCR had failed to satisfy the authorization condition, and thus declined to make a CPO.\n\nThe Tribunal reached this decision \u201con the basis of a cumulative assessment\u201d of the relevant matters, which included each of the funding and suitability issues set out above.[17]\n\nAs to the funding issues, the Tribunal noted that it \u201cshould be reluctant to venture into an assessment of the commercial terms of the LFA unless they are sufficiently extreme to warrant calling out\u201d.[18] Having regard to evidence provided on behalf of the PCR about the \u201cuncertainty of the litigation funding market in the aftermath of the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in PACCAR\u201d, the Tribunal declined to conclude that the terms of the LFA in this case met that threshold.[19] Nevertheless, the Tribunal concluded that it was appropriate to consider the circumstances in which the LFA was agreed.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s refusal to certify thus focused on the suitability issues, as to which the evidence filed on behalf of the PCR after the first hearing and Professor Riefa\u2019s evidence on cross-examination at the second hearing were particularly relevant.\n\nThe PCR\u2019s Further Evidence and Professor Riefa\u2019s Cross-Examination\n\nAlthough the evidence submitted following the first hearing contained further detail about the negotiation of the LFA and the PCR\u2019s engagement in that process, the Tribunal held that it \u201cdid little to mitigate the overall impression that the PCR was and remains over-reliant on her advisers\u201d.[20]\n\nThe Tribunal recognized that collective proceedings inevitably require third party funding and that PCRs are entitled to take the advice of their solicitors (who may themselves be acting on conditional fee arrangements) in relation to the funding terms on offer.[21]\n\nHowever, the Tribunal concluded that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence of robust and independent scrutiny of the arrangements by Prof Riefa\u201d.[22] In particular:\n\nProfessor Riefa \u201cappears to have accepted the amendments which incorporated the IRR return into the LFA without inquiry as to whether further efforts might identify better terms or alternative sources of funding\u201d (\u00a793).\n\nProfessor Riefa\u2019s further witness statement \u201cwas vague as to [her] understanding of how the revised success fee terms compared to the previous terms\u201d (\u00a794).\n\nThe Tribunal further held that Professor Riefa\u2019s answers during cross-examination did not improve matters:\n\n\u201cThroughout her cross-examination, we found Prof Riefa to be hesitant and uncertain in her answers. Overall, she did not demonstrate that she had a strong understanding of the arrangements she had entered into on behalf of the PCR\u201d (\u00a795).\n\nProfessor Riefa had no clear answer in response to questioning from Amazon\u2019s counsel as to the basis on which she had made the erroneous statement in Riefa 1 in relation to the payment of the success fee from unclaimed damages (\u00a7\u00a796-97).\n\nBy her responses to questions from Apple\u2019s counsel regarding when it would be \u201cappropriate\u201d for the application envisaged in the LFA for priority payment to the funder to be made, Professor Riefa \u201cfailed to persuade [the Tribunal] that she had properly understood this provision\u201d and would be capable of carrying out the necessary exercise of balancing the competing interests of the class and the funder (\u00a7\u00a7100-101).\n\nFurther, Professor Riefa \u201cdid not appear to have given thought to the point that making an application for the funder to be paid in priority would also benefit Hausfeld [\u2026] such that a conflict of interest might then arise (and indeed already arose) in taking advice from Hausfeld on this clause\u201d (\u00a7103).\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s concerns were \u201cexacerbated\u201d by the confidentiality issues. Specifically, the Tribunal could see \u201cno justification in withholding any of the terms of the LFA from the scrutiny of the public and in particular the potential class members\u201d.[23] The Tribunal was concerned that Professor Riefa had only engaged with the question of confidentiality insofar as required to respond to the concerns it had raised at the first hearing, and noted that Professor Riefa was \u201cclearly alive to the interests of the funder\u201d but did not \u201chowever, appear to have considered sufficiently where the interests of the class members lie\u201d.[24]\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal concluded that \u201cthe written and oral evidence of Prof Riefa has not convinced us that she has a strong understanding of the nature and extent of her responsibilities to protect the interests of the class she seeks to represent\u201d.[25] Consequently, the PCR had \u201cnot demonstrated sufficient independence or robustness so as to act fairly and adequately in the interests of the class\u201d,[26] and the Tribunal thus refused the CPO Application.\n\nPractical Implications\n\nFirst and foremost, the Judgment has important implications for current and future PCRs, who can expect to be held \u201cto a high standard\u201d by the Tribunal in relation to all aspects of proposed collective proceedings.[27]\n\nRecognizing that individual cases are likely to give rise to different circumstances, the Tribunal has made clear that it does not seek by this Judgment to impose specific conditions on the types of PCRs that may be put forward, nor specific obligations on PCRs in relation to the negotiation of funding arrangements.\n\nNevertheless, the Judgment emphasizes the \u201ccentral and crucial role\u201d played by the PCR,[28] who cannot be \u201cmerely a figurehead for a set of proceedings being conducted by their legal representatives\u201d.[29] Rather, the PCR \u201ccarries a heavy responsibility to ensure that the proceedings are conducted, in all respects, in the bests interests of the class\u201d.[30]\n\nIn this regard, the Judgment is a reflection of the Tribunal\u2019s broader focus on its role in ensuring that the collective proceedings regime operates for the benefit and in the interests of class members. Similar attention to this central tenet of the regime was recently demonstrated, for example, in the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of two collective settlement applications in Mark McLaren Class Representative Ltd v MOL (Europe Africa) Ltd and others, where the Settlement Tribunal expressed particular concern about the possibility of payments to the funders and other stakeholders before it was apparent whether such payments might operate to the detriment of the class.\n\nThe Judgment will of course also be of interest for those advising PCRs, and for funders and insurers involved in collective proceedings, all of whom will be alive to the possibility of greater scrutiny from both the Tribunal and those opposing CPO applications in relation to the terms of the relevant funding arrangements and the means by which they have been negotiated and agreed.\n\nAlthough the Judgment reiterates that there is no requirement for a PCR to be supported by a consultative or advisory panel, the Tribunal\u2019s concerns in this case about the PCR\u2019s lack of experience and independent support (in particular, the absence of a consultative panel) may increase the likelihood of PCRs seeking to appoint consultative panels comprised of independent advisors with a range of expertise in future.\n\nFinally, the Judgment represents a departure from the Tribunal\u2019s approach in previous cases such as CICC v Mastercard[31] and Gormsen v Meta,[32] where the Tribunal\u2019s refusal to certify collective proceedings was expressly accompanied by a further period for the PCRs to address fundamental flaws in their cases before coming back for a second attempt at certification.[33] The Tribunal has, for the first time, simply refused certification with no invitation for the PCR to come back with a revised application.\n\nThe case is notable for its focus on funding and suitability issues (as opposed to the methodological flaws) and serves as an important reminder that CPOs may be resisted and refused on various grounds, and the Tribunal will look to ensure that the proposed proceedings will best protect the interests of the proposed class in all respects..\n\n[1] Christine Riefa Class Representative Limited v Apple Inc. & Others [2025] CAT 5.\n\n[2] Judgment, \u00a7115.\n\n[3] Judgment, \u00a7118.\n\n[4] Judgment, \u00a75.\n\n[5] The Proposed Defendants also raised a concern with the PCR\u2019s proposed class definition and its attempt to claim for future damages up to the point of judgment (or settlement), but the point was effectively conceded by the PCR following the first certification hearing.\n\n[6] Competition Act 1998, Section 47B(8)(b); Competition Appeal Tribunal Rules 2015 ( \u201cCAT Rules\u201d), Rule 78(1)(b).\n\n[7] CAT Guide, \u00a76.29.\n\n[8] CAT Rules, Rule 78(2).\n\n[9] Judgment, \u00a724; CAT Guide, \u00a76.30.\n\n[10] CAT Rules, Rule 78(2)(d); CAT Guide, \u00a76.33.\n\n[11] These concerns are summarized at paragraphs 89-91 of the Judgment.\n\n[12] The Proposed Defendants also identified a number of issues in relation to the PCR\u2019s ATE insurance, though these were effectively rectified by the PCR in advance of the first certification hearing.\n\n[13] For a third time, certain amendments having already been made over the preceding months (including to rectify apparent errors in the drafting).\n\n[14] R (on the application of PACCAR Inc and others) (Appellants) v Competition Appeal Tribunal and others (Respondents) [2023] UKSC 28.\n\n[15] Judgment, \u00a789(6).\n\n[16] Judgment, \u00a789(6).\n\n[17] Judgment, \u00a7115.\n\n[18] Judgment, \u00a7110.\n\n[19] Judgment, \u00a7110.\n\n[20] Judgment, \u00a792.\n\n[21] Judgment, \u00a7105.\n\n[22] Judgment, \u00a792.\n\n[23] Judgment, \u00a7113.\n\n[24] Judgment, \u00a7113.\n\n[25] Judgment, \u00a7104.\n\n[26] Judgment, \u00a7115.\n\n[27] Judgment, \u00a7116.\n\n[28] Judgment, \u00a7104.\n\n[29] Judgment, \u00a7116.\n\n[30] Judgment, \u00a7116.\n\n[31] [2023] CAT 38.\n\n[32] [2023] CAT 10.\n\n[33] In those cases, the Tribunal\u2019s refusal to certify was based on the PCRs\u2019 failure to set out an adequate methodology by which the proceedings could be tried on a collective basis.",

            "content": "Apple (AAPL -0.11%) stock has been a big winner since the start of the pandemic, soaring in value as the company's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion. The party may finally come to an end this year, though, as a combination of stagnating iPhone sales, the potential collapse of a $20 billion annual revenue stream, and a lofty valuation come together to put pressure on the stock. While anything could happen in the stock market, it will be tough for Apple stock to keep its rally going throughout 2025.\n\niPhone stagnation\n\nAs much as Apple tries to convince consumers that each year's iPhone models are worth the upgrade, that's increasingly not the case. In the early days of the smartphone industry, smartphones improved drastically each year. As the industry has matured, it's getting hard to tell the difference between this year's flagship smartphones and last year's flagship smartphones.\n\nApple's big thing last year was Apple Intelligence, the company's suite of AI-powered tools for the iPhone and its other devices. So far, Apple's AI push has been a swing and a miss. One survey found that 73% of iPhone users said the AI features add little or no value. Apple Intelligence will likely improve over time, but for now, it's not helping the company sell more iPhones.\n\nTotal iPhone revenue in the twelve months that ended Sept. 28 was roughly unchanged from the previous 12-month period, and iPhone sales reportedly declined by 5% during the holiday quarter. It's not clear how Apple can reverse these trends, and with the iPhone accounting for more than half of the company's total revenue, any sales decline is going to be tough to offset with other products.\n\nA $20 billion problem\n\nApple currently receives in excess to $20 billion annually from Alphabet in a deal that makes Google the default search engine on the Safari web browser. These payments show up in Apple's services segment, and they're essentially pure profit.\n\nThere's a real chance that this gravy train will come to an end as Google readies for an antitrust trial over online search set for April. Apple has asked to participate in the trial to defend its own interests as Google faces the prospect of being forced to divest major assets. That $20 billion annual payment to Apple could end up on the chopping block if it's viewed as anticompetitive.\n\nIf you assume this payment is pure profit, it represents around one-sixth of Apple's annual operating income. Losing it would be a significant blow to the bottom line.\n\nValuation and interest rates\n\nDespite stagnating iPhone sales and uncertainty around the Google payments, Apple stock trades for about 38 times trailing-twelve-month earnings. The last time Apple was this expensive was during the early days of the pandemic when booming demand for PCs, smartphones, and other gadgets lifted sales.\n\nOne important thing to consider is interest rates. The stock market doesn't exist in a vacuum, and valuations that investors are willing to pay are ultimately a function of the alternatives available. Since the Federal Reserve began cutting rates, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury has been soaring, and it's now closing in on 5%.\n\nWhy are rising bond yields potentially bad for stocks with lofty valuations? The 10-year Treasury is often considered the risk-free rate. The higher the risk-free rate is, the higher the return other assets must offer to compensate. For a stock like Apple, where revenue growth is sluggish and profits may come under pressure this year, a price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 40 becomes much more difficult to justify as the risk-free rate rises.\n\nShares of Apple have tripled in the past five years despite revenue growing at a far slower rate. With the valuation at elevated levels, a correction could be in the cards for the tech stock this year.",

Among his duties: an hour-long show beamed live from Los Angeles every weekday starting at 9 a.m. Pacific time.\n\nA decade later, Lowe is a fixture of pop music around the globe: a relentlessly upbeat tastemaker-turned-cheerleader whose touchy-feely interviews with the biggest names on the charts draw audiences in the millions on Apple Music and YouTube.

Each runs 24 hours a day with programming hosted by a mix of veteran radio personalities and musicians such as Becky G and Stephan Moccio.\n\n\u201cThe reason we started radio was because we want to be a place where culture happens, where parties are starting, where artists come and get to have a safe space to talk about why they made certain music,\u201d says Oliver Schusser, Apple\u2019s vice president of music and sports. \u201cAnd that\u2019s more important today than it ever was.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCupertino-based Apple \u2014 whose music-streaming service counts 93 million subscribers, according to Business of Apps \u2014 wouldn\u2019t specify how many people listen to its radio stations. \u201cWe\u2019re not a numbers kind of company,\u201d Schusser says \u2014 one advantage of being part of a corporation routinely described as the world\u2019s most valuable.\n\nYet Tatiana Cirisano, a music industry analyst at Midia Research, says Apple Music\u2019s investment in radio \u201cisn\u2019t just some experiment they can throw money at because they\u2019re Apple.\u201d At a moment when the growth of digital streaming has slowed, the stations are a way for Apple Music to distinguish itself from competitors like Spotify \u2014 the clear industry leader with 640 million users \u2014 and Amazon Music. (Unlike Apple, Spotify offers a free ad-supported plan.)\n\n\u201cIf you think about the past decade of streaming, it\u2019s been characterized by a complete lack of differentiation, where all these platforms had the same interface and the same catalog,\u201d Cirisano says of the format that now accounts for 84% of recorded music revenues. \u201cBut that\u2019s not enough to compete anymore because we\u2019re running out of potential new subscribers.\u201d To lure customers, Spotify has gone big on podcasts and audiobooks. Live radio, Cirisano says, \u201cadds some scarcity to the marketplace. And live entertainment experiences\u201d \u2014 think of the splashy deals Netflix has struck recently with the NFL and WWE \u2014 \u201care sort of the last scarce entertainment experience now that everything is available on demand.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNatalie Eshaya, who oversees Apple Music Radio, says the new stations reflect the platform\u2019s broader commitment to bringing \u201ca human touch\u201d to the streaming ecosystem. It\u2019s a framing that seems intended to draw a contrast with Spotify, which in 2023 introduced a DJ-like feature controlled by artificial intelligence and which last month drew widespread criticism for incorporating AI into its popular year-end Wrapped promotion. At Apple, Eshaya says, \u201cWe choose the music and we curate the programming \u2014 that\u2019s been the moral compass since Day 1.\u201d\n\nEbro Darden, right, talks with Jennifer Lopez on Apple Music 1 in New York in 2024. (Tomas Herold / Getty Images for Apple Music)\n\nIn addition to Lowe, Apple Music Radio features broadcasting pros like Ebro Darden, who also hosts a morning show on New York\u2019s Hot 97; Nadeska Alexis, who came up through MTV and Complex; and Evelyn Sicairos, formerly of Univision. (Before she joined Apple in 2015, Eshaya worked as a producer on Ryan Seacrest\u2019s morning show on L.A.\u2019s KIIS-FM.) But Lowe, who also holds the title of global creative director \u2014 and who recently stepped in for James Corden as host of a special holiday edition of \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d \u2014 is clearly Apple Music\u2019s guiding personality.\n\nBorn and raised in New Zealand, he made music himself before going into radio and reckons it\u2019s his artistic temperament that allows him to connect intimately on the air with stars such as Adele, Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga and Bad Bunny. \u201cI speak the artist language,\u201d Lowe says in his office in Culver City. \u201cI think most artists would probably go, \u2018Yeah, he gets it.\u2019 \u201d Curled on a sofa wedged into the corner of the dimly lighted room, he\u2019s dressed in his customary baggy jeans and sweater and wears a pair of stylish geometric glasses. \u201cAnd I like working at a company that rewards that,\u201d he adds.\n\nWhat Lowe views as his empathy with musicians \u2014 \u201cThe trust that artists have in him is kind of iconic,\u201d Eshaya says \u2014 is seen by some as a level of deference in his interviews that can border on obsequiousness. \u201cI\u2019m aware of the fact that some people feel I\u2019m overly positive or I\u2019m not critical enough,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s my job. There are certain things that artists may feel are sensitive \u2014 could be personal, could be a tragedy in their life, could be something they\u2019re not willing to talk about \u2014 and I don\u2019t necessarily feel like I have a responsibility to get that information or that they have an obligation to give it to me.\u201d\n\nDoes he think of himself as a journalist?\n\n\u201cNo, I actually don\u2019t,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cI have an opportunity to spend an hour with an amazing artist, and I really want it to be the most beautiful human experience I can have.\u201d When Katy Perry went on Lowe\u2019s show in September to promote her album \u201c143\u201d \u2014 a would-be comeback LP that earned some of last year\u2019s harshest reviews \u2014 he told her the new music was \u201csuch a gift\u201d and that she\u2019d reclaimed her role as \u201cthe Katy Perry that everybody loves\u201d; more to the point, he declined to ask Perry about her controversial decision to reunite with the producer Dr. Luke after she\u2019d earlier parted ways with him in the wake of Kesha\u2019s allegations that he\u2019d sexually assaulted her. (Kesha and Luke reached a settlement in 2023.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI did the best I could in the environment that I was in to have that conversation. We both enjoyed each other\u2019s company, and her fans seemed to like it,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cIn that moment, given the timing of the music and where we were and how quickly it was all happening, it\u2019s not something that we landed on.\u201d\n\nSchusser pushes back on the idea that Lowe avoids tough questions, citing a 2020 interview with Justin Bieber in which the pop star tearfully discussed his history of self-destructive behavior. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that Justin\u2019s publicist would not have wanted the conversation to go the way it went,\u201d Schusser says. Yet it\u2019s common knowledge in the music industry that, after Lowe conducts a prerecorded interview (as opposed to one he does live), an artist and/or their reps are welcome to request cuts \u2014 not exactly protocol even within the often-chummy world of celebrity journalism.\n\nThen again, as Lowe himself points out, he doesn\u2019t work for a news operation. \u201cI\u2019m in a streaming service where we\u2019re trying to get more people to listen to music,\u201d says the married father of two teenage sons. \u201cMy job is to help a business be healthy.\u201d Darden, who\u2019s known on Hot 97 as an aggressive interviewer, says that \u201con Apple, I try to create more space for the art and more grace for the artist\u201d than in the more pressurized realm of terrestrial radio.\n\n\u201cPeople are listening to Hot in their cars, and they\u2019ve got very limited time,\u201d he says of his morning gig. \u201cYou stepped into the room, we got to get to it. Start the chainsaw, you know what I mean?\u201d\n\nTo musicians planning an album rollout \u2014 many of whom already regard interviews with traditional journalists as an unnecessary risk in the era of social media \u2014 a friendly chat on Apple Music Radio might represent a safer way to reach an audience disinclined to worry about the finer points of how (and why) pop-star content is created.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t repair any relationships between A and B \u2014 I can only do what\u2019s required when they want C,\u201d Lowe says of the way musicians interact with legacy media and with him. \u201cI can\u2019t do someone else\u2019s role just because they don\u2019t get to do it, and I have access.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd what\u2019s the incentive to do something else? Schusser isn\u2019t exaggerating by much when he says, \u201cEvery artist on the planet that has a new project \u2014 whether it\u2019s an album, a song, a tour, a collaboration \u2014 they\u2019re all coming to us.\u201d Apple\u2019s coziness with musicians, which it facilitates in part by paying a higher royalty rate per stream than Spotify, has always been crucial to its brand: In Apple Music\u2019s early days, the service brokered deals for exclusive access to albums by Frank Ocean, Drake and Chance the Rapper; among the other stars with radio shows on the platform today are Summer Walker, Rauw Alejandro, Jamie xx, Hardy and Elton John, who\u2019s hosted \u201cRocket Hour\u201d since 2015.\n\n\u201cMost companies that work in streaming are technology companies \u2014 they don\u2019t really care about music,\u201d Schusser says. \u201cIf it\u2019s books or podcasts or something else, it\u2019s just bits and bytes. We\u2019re a music company, and we have no intention to add other things into our music experience.\u201d (One thing Apple is planning in the next few years, according to the exec: upgrading its studios in cities including L.A., Nashville, Berlin and Paris so that the company can produce small ticketed events.)\n\n\u201cMusic doesn\u2019t get event-ized enough\u201d in the streaming economy, Lowe says. \u201cIt gets released mostly at the same time, then it fights for itself, and it\u2019s really hard because there\u2019s a lot to fight against. This is easily the cheesiest thing I can tell you, but music is incredibly special. Putting an hour or two hours of radio together to create a mood \u2014 it sends a message that it\u2019s worth showing up for.\u201d",

            "content": "High molecular weight genomic DNA extraction\n\nFresh leaves were harvested from a Dovyalis afra tree (ICRAF 04990) maintained at World Agroforestry (ICRAF) Nairobi, Kenya, and immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen leaves were ground in liquid nitrogen in a mortar and pestle and high molecular weight (HMW) genomic DNA was extracted following the protocol provided by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) on \u201cHigh Molecular Weight gDNA extraction from fever tree leaves (Cinchona pubescens)\u201d, downloaded from the ONT community in June 201915. Briefly, Carlson lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 2% CTAB, 1.4 M NaCl, 1%, PEG 8000, 20 mM EDTA) was used to lyse the cells, followed by chloroform phase-fractionation. The HMW genomic DNA was bound and eluted using the Qiagen Genomic Tips (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The HMW genomic DNA was cleaned using RNAse and Proteinase K. HMW genomic DNA longer than 10 Kbp was selected using a polyethylene glycol (PEG) and salt solution (9% PEG 8,000, 1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8) according to Jones et al.16.\n\nDNA nanopore sequencing\n\nSequencing libraries were prepared according to the ONT SQK-LSK109 ligation sequencing kit (ONT, Oxford, England) protocol. A 1.5 \u03bcg aliquot of the HMW genomic DNA was used. Repair and 3\u2032 adenylation was done using the NEBNext FFPE DNA Repair Mix (M6630) and the NEBNext Ultra II End repair/dA-tailing Module (E7546). The adaptors were ligated using the NEBNext Quick Ligation module (E6056) (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts, USA) and purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). The libraries were loaded onto FLO-MIN106D (R9) flow cells and sequenced on a MinION sequencing platform. Eight (8) MinION runs were done.\n\nBasecalling and De-novo genome assembly\n\nRaw \u2018fast5\u2019 files from eight MinION runs were used as input to Guppy (ver5.011)17 for basecalling using the high accuracy (hac) basecalling configuration. This generated 6,728,728 reads totaling 39,879,979,963 bp with an average length of 5,926.8 bp.\n\nTwo de novo draft genome assemblies were generated with the ONT long reads generated above using two long read assemblers, Flye (ver2.8.1)18 and wtdbg2 (Redbean) ver2.419, both with default parameters. The assembly generated by Flye was more contiguous, (N50 of 13,328,472 bp, Table 1, Fig. 2) compared to wtdbg2\u2019s assembly (N50 of 1,206,481 bp, Table 1). We therefore retained the Flye assembly for further analyses.\n\nTable 1 Dovyalis afra Flye and Redbean de novo assemblies\u2019 statistics. Full size table\n\nFig. 2 Sequence length distribution: The length distribution of scaffolds and contigs from the Dovyalis assembly on a logarithmic-scale. The scaffolds/contigs above the N50 and N75 are coloured in green and blue respectively. Full size image\n\nRNA extraction and sequencing\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from seven tissues representing various developmental stages of the Bark, stem and leaves using the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, 250 mg of fresh tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen using chilled mortar and pestle and homogenized in 1.5 mL of lysis buffer prepared with 2-mercaptoethanol. After brief incubation and centrifugation, 0.5 mL of the lysate was recovered and 0.5 volumes of 96% ethanol added, mixed and passed through an RNA binding column. On-column DNase treatment was done using Purelink DNase and the RNA recovered in 100 \u03bcL of RNase free water. RNA yield and quality was checked using Qubit 2.0 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). RNA libraries were constructed following the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) manual, and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq. 2500 platform (paired-end, 100-bp reads), generating about 52 Gbp of sequence data.\n\nDe novo transcriptome assembly\n\nA three-step RNAseq data preparation guideline was used to improve its quality for annotation. First, random errors from the RNAseq reads were removed using RCorrector (ver1.0.4)20. Secondly, uncorrectable read pairs were removed using FilterUncorrectabledPEfastq.py python script21. Lastly, the reads were further processed for adapter removal and quality trimming using TrimGalore (ver 0.6.7)22 and the reads quality was assessed using Fastqc (ver 0.11.7)23. The clean reads were assembled with Trinity (ver 2.13.2)24 using default options. Finally, TransDecoder (ver5.5.0)25 was used to predict and identify 77,660 candidate coding regions within the Trinity generated transcripts sequences.\n\nRepeat annotation\n\nRepetitive regions of the Dovyalis draft assembly were identified using RepeatModeler (ver 1.0.8)26 which created a de novo repeat library. The repeat library was used in RepeatMasker (ver 4.0.6)27 to identify and classify the repeats in the Dovyalis assembly. Overall, a total of 620,527 interspersed repeats comprising retroelements, DNA transposons, rolling-circles and unclassified repeats totaling 60.42% of the Dovyalis assembly were identified (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 The number, type and proportion of interspaced repeat elements identified in the Dovyalis afra assembly. Full size table\n\nGene prediction and functional annotation\n\nThe funannotate (ver1.8.15) pipeline28 was used for predicting gene models in the repeat-masked Dovyalis genome. The pipeline comprises of four main scripts: \u201cfunannotate train\u201d for training the ab-initio gene predictors, \u201cfunannotate predict\u201d for predicting gene models, \u201cfunannotate update\u201d for refining gene models including of untranslated regions, and \u201cfunannotate annotate\u201d for functional annotation of identified gene models. The funannotate pipeline integrates different sources of evidence for predicting gene models including homology (protein evidence), transcripts (expression evidence) and ab-initio predictors.\n\nFor homology evidence, we downloaded and combined protein sequences of four well annotated closely related genomes; Populus trichocarpa (cottonwood, Ptrichocarpa_v4.1), Populus deltoides (eastern cottonwood, Pdeltoides_v2.1), Salix Purpurea (purple osier willow, Spurpurea_v5.1) and Eucalyptus grandis (flooded gum eucalyptus, Egrandis_v2.0) from Phytozome29. Protein sequences of the longest transcripts were used. For ab-initio evidence, the \u201cfunannotate train\u201d script was used to train ab-initio gene predictors: Augustus (ver3.3.3)30, SNAP (ver2006-07-28)31, GlimmerHMM (ver3.0.4)32. For this, cleaned RNAseq reads were aligned to the repeat-masked and indexed Dovyalis genome using Hisat2(ver 2.1.0)33 and the read alignments were used as input for genome-guided transcript assembly using Trinity24 which generated 116,867 transcripts. The transcripts were further aligned back to the genome using PASA (ver2.4.1)34 to define complete gene models which were subsequently used to train Augustus, SNAP, GlimmerHMM. Additionally, the de-novo transcript assembly previously described was used as transcript evidence.\n\nUsing all this evidence, the \u201cfunannotate predict\u201d script generated weighted consensus gene structures using EvidenceModeler35. We predicted 27,449 protein-coding gene models and 501 tRNA-coding genes.\n\nFunctional annotation of the predicted genes was conducted with \u2018funannotate annotate\u2019 script which is based on domain conservation and sequence similarity by searching the predicted sequences against public databases. Here, Interproscan (ver5.25-64.0)36 was used to align against InterPro37 protein databases; TIGRFAM, SUPERFAMILY, PANTHER, Pfam, PRINTS and ProDom38. The gene models were further screened for homology using eggnog-mapper (ver2.1.9)39 and parsed the predicted results from Interproscan and eggnog-mapper to Funannotate \u201cannotate\u201d to annotate the putative functions of the protein sequences using CAZYmes40, MEROPS41, BUSCO42, UNIProtKB43, PFAM44, dbCAN45 and GO46 Ontologies databases.",

            "content": "The Apple Watch Series 10 has been on my wrist for three months now and it's clear that it's the best smartwatch Apple ever made. But that doesn't mean there aren't things that a future Series 11 could do better.\n\nAt this point, so early in the review, you're probably ready to scream \"Apple Watch Ultra 2\" at your screen. Don't worry, I haven't forgotten it, but the Apple Watch Ultra models are different and I'd argue the Series 10 is the better watch.\n\nFor most Apple Watch buyers, the Ultras are just too big, too bulky, and too expensive. They come with features they don't need like cellular connectivity and a huge, rugged design that's built to deal with the great outdoors in ways the standard models aren't.\n\nPeople who want an Apple Watch Ultra will buy one. Half of our staff has.\n\nBut I'd wager that anyone who just wants to buy an Apple Watch will go with the Series 10 or SE, as well they should \u2014 because the former is the best yet even if the changes compared to last year's model are most definitely iterative.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 three-month review: Setting the scene\n\nI always feel it's important to understand where reviewers are coming from when we write these kinds of things, and this review is no different. I've been using the Apple Watch Series 10 for three months now, and I've loved every minute of it.\n\nFor years now, I've been wearing an Apple Watch Series 5. It's old at this point and was cut off from watchOS updates with the 2024 release of watchOS 11 which means, for me at least, it was time to look for something new.\n\nI'd used other Apple Watches, of course, it's part of doing this kind of job. I briefly had an Apple Watch Series 7 before I decided the Series 5 was sufficient and the differences between the two didn't warrant the cost of the upgrade.\n\nThen I used an Apple Watch Ultra when that was first released in 2023 and, again, it fell by the wayside. I like big watches, so that wasn't the issue. It just didn't really suit me and the most exercise I get is walking my dog a few times a week, so it was never going to really be in its element.\n\nNext came the Apple Watch Series 10. Apple was good enough to send me a loaner and I figured it was time to see what the latest models had to offer. Apple is reading this for the first time after its publishing, and had no input or control over its creation \u2014 as these things should be.\n\nSo with the backstory laid out, what do I make of the latest Apple Watch to enter the lineup and do I think people should buy one?\n\nThat's complicated.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 three-month review: A familiar-yet-new approach\n\nApple made a big deal about the new Apple Watch's design, but if we're all being honest with ourselves, it looks the same. It isn't quite the same, granted, but if you showed someone a Series 10 and a Series 9 one after the other I think most people would be hard-pressed to tell you the difference.\n\nBut differences, there absolutely are.\n\nThose differences start with the display and case size; the Series 10 now comes in 42mm and 46mm configurations which is a full millimeter bigger than its predecessor. It isn't hugely noticeable, but a millimeter is a millimeter and Apple says this is the biggest display it ever put into its smartwatch. Yes, the display in the 46mm model is bigger than the one used in the Apple Watch Ultra or Ultra 2.\n\nThe more svelte case also means the new watch is lighter than its predecessor. The aluminum model sheds 10% of its weight while that doubles to 20% when we compare the stainless steel Series 9 to the titanium Series 10.\n\nThe tech is different, too. The Apple Watch Series 10 features an LPTO3 OLED display whereas the Series 9 makes do with LPTO OLED instead. What that really means is that the watch is now 40% brighter when viewed at an angle while the low-end refresh rate has been lowered to just 1Hz.\n\nThat might not sound all that impressive, but the move from the 10Hz refresh rate of the Series 9 means this is the first Apple Watch to show seconds even when the display is dimmed. That's cool and makes the Apple Watch Series 10 feel much more like a watch if that makes sense.\n\nOn the outside, Apple has ditched the premium stainless steel construction and replaced it with a new titanium option. Most people will likely opt for the aluminum version that sticks around from previous Apple Watches, though.\n\nIf they do, they'll get a new color to choose \u2014 and choose it, they should. The Jet Black aluminum color is gorgeous and its polished finish looks way better than aluminum has any right to look.\n\nWith that in mind, it's perhaps no surprise that this is the model that I've been using. For completeness, Apple sent me the 46mm Apple Watch Series 10 in Jet Black aluminum with the Ink Sport Loop. I've been wearing it with a few different bands because I'm a sucker for a metal bracelet, though.\n\nOther changes? Well, the new model is 10% thinner which is nice, and it does make it seem to stand less proud on my wrist. Is it by a lot? No, not at all.\n\nAnd that pretty much sums up the Series 10 in a lot of ways. The design is different, and it's definitely better. But I'm not sure it's different enough to warrant the way Apple initially touted the design tweaks.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 three-month review: An Apple Watch, but better\n\nOn the inside, there are more changes that are noteworthy without changing the game too much. The Series 10 gains a new S10 SIP, or system-in-package, making it the fastest Apple Watch I've ever used. It also means there is support for features like on-device Siri processing and the Double tap gesture.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 even looks good when it's charging.\n\nThe new chip hasn't impacted battery life though, with Apple touting the same 18 hours. For me, the Apple Watch Series 9 lasts plenty long enough and I charge it once a day, while I'm having a shower \u2014 that's with an hour's workout and sleep tracking plus the usual barrage of notifications with the display set to maximum brightness at all times.\n\nAnyone who balks at the idea of charging their Apple Watch daily isn't going to be converted here, and the Ultra 2 is still the battery life king. But the Series 10 has a party piece that helps lessen the battery life issue, at least.\n\nWith the launch of the Series 10 Apple has been able to upgrade the charging system. Now, a 30-minute charge is enough to take a dead watch to around 80% battery life, which really is a game-changer should you find yourself in need of a top-up before running out the door.\n\nThere are more improvements when compared to the Series 9, too. The new model has a water temperature sensor and a depth gauge, should you want that kind of thing. It's no diving watch but again, people who want one of those already know they want an Ultra 2 so that's far from an issue as far as I'm concerned.\n\nBy now you should have noticed something of a recurring theme here. The Apple Watch Series 10 is an Apple Watch Series 9, but better, more refined. And that's a good thing.\n\nThe pre-launch rumors had hinted (again) at a big departure for this model, something akin to the iPhone X's switch from the familiar iPhone 7 aesthetic. That didn't happen and perhaps it never will.\n\nBut if you're a fan of the way the Apple Watch looks, and like the one you have, the Series 10 is probably for you. Just don't expect to be blown away when you first take it out of the box.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 three-month review: Where does the Series 11 go next?\n\nAll of that does beg the question of where Apple could improve things next time out. There are obvious suggestions, and they're ones that come up each and every year.\n\nThe new, larger display means you can fit more on-screen.\n\nIn a nutshell, the battery life could be better. The display could be brighter even though it's already best-in-class bright, and maybe the Action button would be nice on the non-Ultra model.\n\nMaking the thing cheaper wouldn't go amiss, either. And make it even faster, maybe?\n\nBut in reality, there's only so much that Apple can do here. These things are small, so barring a big advancement in battery technology, Apple seems content with its stated 18 hours of life per charge. And honestly, that's probably enough for nearly everybody.\n\nIf you need a sleep tracker, use your last Apple Watch that you're charging while you're wearing your Series 10. If your day goes longer than 18 hours, maybe it's time for a new job.\n\nThe new S10 SIP is fast enough, and it makes a huge difference for me having come from a Series 5. Apps load so much more quickly and support for watchOS 11 is nice, too \u2014 I'm a big fan of Smart Stacks and Live Activities on my wrist!\n\nThe only real change I'd like from an Apple Watch Series 11 is something new. I want to look at a Series 11 and immediately recognize it without pondering which colors are available on which models first.\n\nApple might be a victim of its own success here and it almost nailed the form factor when the OG watch launched more than a decade ago. We'd see more design changes if it had more work to do so again, iteration isn't necessarily a bad thing here.\n\nBut Apple is full of smart people and great industrial designers. I'm sure they're capable of giving the Apple Watch Series 11 that new car smell that you have to go with the Ultra 2 to get today.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 three-month review: Where do we go from here?\n\nSo with all of that said, where does that leave us with the Apple Watch Series 10?\n\nIn a nutshell, it's the best Apple Watch ever made and if you're shopping for your first Apple smartwatch this is the one that you should buy, assuming you don't need the Ultra or Ultra 2 or need to go the SE route. It really is pretty great, and I can't imagine a world where you'll be left disappointed.\n\nBut things get a little more complicated if you're upgrading from a previous model. If it's a Series 9, the decision will depend on how much it will cost you to switch \u2014 look out for trade-in offers to lighten the load here.\n\nI'd suggest that's the case if you're coming from an Apple Watch Series 8 as well, and possibly even a Series 7. But if you're toiling with a Series 6 or older, you're going to love the Series 10. The same goes for anyone upgrading from an Apple Watch SE for that matter, too.\n\nFor me, the jump from my Series 5 to the Series 10 is a night-and-day experience, the kind that makes the new model feel like a whole different device. The speed, watchOS 11, and bigger display make that possible and I notice them every day.\n\nNow we wait to see what comes next. And even if it's another iterative update, it'll probably still be the best smartwatch on the planet.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 review: Pros\n\nThe bigger display means you can fit more information on-screen\n\nJet Black is just as stunning as it was on the iPhone 7.\n\nThe S10 SIP is fast and responsive, making apps whizz along.\n\nFaster wireless charging means that battery life is less of a concern.\n\nThe watchOS 11 software brings new features including Live Activities and more.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 review: Cons\n\nThe design is perhaps a little too familiar at this point.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 perseveres with Wi-Fi 4 support.\n\nThose who do worry about battery life may still going have charger anxiety.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 Rating: 4 out of 5\n\nWhere to buy the Apple Watch Series 10\n\nThe Series 10 is on sale now, and you can check out our Apple Watch Series 10 Price Guide to get the best deals at a variety of retailers.\n\nYou can also find a roundup of the best Apple Watch deals that are curated by our team across the wearable line, including blowout offers on remaining Series 9 inventory and the rest of the lineup.",

            "content": "Jason Hiner/ZDNET\n\nI am a user of tools. I work a great many hours each week. Anytime I find a tool that helps me meet my deadlines, do something I otherwise couldn't do, or get a little more sleep or personal time, I add it to my kit bag, even if that means spending some money. For example, I've invested in an entire army of camera robots because they help me turn out better and more interesting videos.\n\nWhen Apple Intelligence was announced, and its big features were tied to the iPhone 16 series, I decided it was time to upgrade my four-generation old iPhone 12 Pro Max. I bought my iPhone 16 Pro Max specifically for the productivity benefits I expected to get from Apple Intelligence.\n\nAlso: Why you should power off your phone once a week - according to the NSA\n\nThe fact that I haven't touched any of the Apple Intelligence tools since they were released with iOS 18.1 and iOS 18.2 is evidence that I haven't found a reason to. Jason Perlow was right. Of course, Jason is almost always right, which is one of the many reasons I'm glad I get to work with him here at ZDNET.\n\nIn this article, I'm going to go down the list of Apple Intelligence features in iOS 18.1 and 18.2 and share with you why I'm not using them. I did test Apple's AI features while writing, just to confirm aspects of what I was writing. But I haven't found any actual productive use for any of them.\n\nLet's first discuss privacy\n\nBefore I go down the list of tools, let's discuss privacy. Apple has made a fairly big fuss about privacy, specifically the way it uses its own private cloud to keep your AI requests private. While most Apple Intelligence AI processing is done on the phone, some aspects that require cloud capabilities are isolated specifically for privacy protection.\n\nAlso: iOS 18.2 was killing my iPhone's battery until I turned off this feature\n\nThis is good, and if I were deeply concerned with my privacy, I would probably choose to use Apple's tools over those of ChatGPT. But Apple does send queries to ChatGPT, and while they are anonymized, the content of those queries will go into ChatGPT's information maw to be cataloged and processed in undisclosed ways.\n\nI've lived my life in the public eye for a few decades now, so Apple's privacy solution isn't all that important to my personal needs. If it were, I probably would find Apple Intelligence's implementation of features like writing tools to be a more valuable offering.\n\nWriting tools\n\niOS 18.1 introduced the ability to proofread, summarize, and rewrite text on your phone. iOS 18.2, released in December 2024, added the ability to compose text based on a prompt.\n\nThese features have been table stakes in every chatbot released since 2022. There is nothing particularly \"Apple\" about the AI here, except that some of the processing is done on-device.\n\nPersonally, I don't write on my phone. Way back in the PalmPilot days, I did. It was exciting to be able to take my little Palm device and a folding keyboard to a coffee shop and get work done. But laptops were big and heavy back then, and iPads didn't exist. Now, if I expect to be out and need to do some writing, I take my MacBook Air or an iPad with a keyboard case.\n\nAlso: How iOS 18 turned my Apple Watch into the productivity tool of my sci-fi dreams\n\nZDNET does not allow articles to be created with AI help, so no matter what device I have, I wouldn't use Apple Intelligence writing tools for my articles. The text I mostly produce while on the go, especially when I just have my phone, consists of Slack responses, text message responses, and email responses.\n\nThose can all just be dictated using tools that have been in iOS for years. Apple Intelligence adds nothing in those contexts.\n\nThere is one writing tool that has proven to be a game changer for me, but it came out in iOS 18, before Apple Intelligence was officially released. That's the ability for iOS to transcribe voice memos. I described how that feature transformed my Apple Watch into a powerful dictating and writing assistant. That feature was a win, but it's not officially tied to Apple Intelligence.\n\nWriting tools: Might help some folks, no real value to me.\n\nSiri-ously?\n\nOK, yes, Siri is now prettier. That new color band around the iPhone is kind of nice. But does it add any real productivity value? No.\n\nIn April, I showed how Logitech introduced a little free add-on software app that allows you to send prompts to ChatGPT. Because it ties nicely to a mouse key, it's a tiny convenience when working throughout the day. All it does is provide a dialog to accept a prompt, send the prompt to ChatGPT, and then display ChatGPT's results in a window.\n\nAlso: How I set ChatGPT as Siri's backup - and what else it can do on my iPhone\n\nApple Intelligence's Siri \"upgrade\" barely provides as much functionality. If you turn on ChatGPT in Settings (you can also link your ChatGPT Plus account), when Siri can't answer a question, it will ask if you'd like to send the question to ChatGPT. If you approve that action, it passes your query to ChatGPT, and you get back a text-based response in a little pop-up.\n\nOoh. Ahh.\n\nThe ChatGPT app on the iPhone is vastly better. You can have entire audio discussions with ChatGPT via the phone's speaker and microphone. Using AI hands-free is a powerful way to benefit from AI, but with Siri's ChatGPT integration, you just get a little pop-up with text.\n\nAlso: How to program your iPhone's Action Button to summon ChatGPT's voice assistant\n\nOh, and now you can thumb-type into Siri instead of just dictating. Ooh. Ahh.\n\nI mean, what the heck, Apple? All this time, delaying features for three months after the phone launches, and the best you have is passing on a query through an API call? Freshman programming students were doing that back in 2023. Your devs could have learned how to do this in one free course, over a weekend.\n\nSiri integration: It looks cool, but that's it. No added value. Yawn.\n\nNotification Summary and Reduce Interruptions Focus Mode\n\nThese two go hand-in-hand in my mind. Both are designed to help you manage the incoming flow of notifications, surfacing only the notifications you want to see and summarizing the details to make it easier for you to take action.\n\nBut\u2026 you're relying on a provably fallible AI to manage your notifications. That's fine if you want to reduce the number of spam notifications about sales from Harbor Freight Tools, for example. But it's not fine if you want to make sure you get important work and family notifications.\n\nAlso: What's really destroying your productivity - and 3 simple ways to focus better today\n\niOS has long had better tools for this. First, I've turned off notifications from all apps where I really don't want to see notifications. This approach doesn't work for Instacart, because while a shopper is out shopping, I want those notifications. I don't want the useless sale promos, especially when they promote foods I don't eat.\n\nIn Instacart's case, I just live with the extra notifications. But because I've turned off most notifications from most apps, the Instacart notifications aren't overwhelming. My concern with using the AI would be that Apple Intelligence would deliver the notification that there's a sale on Twinkies but not the notification that my shopper wants to know if he can replace fresh strawberries with a pint of strawberry ice cream.\n\nAnother tool I use is found in the Ringtone area of Contacts. If I want to make sure a family member can reach me, I turn on Emergency Bypass. That feature ensures that even if my phone is muted or in a do-not-disturb focus mode, my most important contacts can get through.\n\nThese approaches are far more reliable than hoping Apple Intelligence can figure out what messages I really want to get and which I want to ignore.\n\nAI notification management: There are better and more reliable tools available\n\nPriority email notifications and mail categories\n\nHey, Apple. Welcome to 2013. I use the Gmail app on my iPhone. None of the Apple Intelligence features targeted at email work in the Gmail app. That's OK because new Apple Intelligence features like mail categorization and priority email notifications have been available in Gmail since roughly 2013.\n\nAlso: This easy email trick will make your inbox clutter vanish - automagically\n\nI have been training my email inbox for years. When I get an email that's not highly important, I move it out of the Primary category. Gmail now knows to send priority messages to Primary, all the promotions and press releases I receive to Promotions, all my family-related correspondence to Social, all status-related notices to Updates, and all tech support requests to Forums. Once in a while, Gmail puts the wrong thing in the wrong category, and a simple drag-and-drop trains it on what's right.\n\nThen, in my Gmail app, I have my email notifications set to high priority only. That way, the Gmail app only sends me notifications when I get a high-priority email.\n\nAI email management: Not available for Gmail, where functionally equivalent features have been available for years.\n\nPhoto-related features\n\nI find the Remove Background feature available from the Finder quite useful. But it's been around since iOS 16 and is not part of Apple Intelligence.\n\nAlso: I use Photoshop's AI tool every day - here are my 5 essential tips for the best results\n\nApple does offer a new Photos Clean Up feature, which is basically a generative fill feature. It removes the selected object and fills the now-open space with what would have been behind the image.\n\nI much prefer to tweak my photos in Photoshop, but I can see this as a powerful tool for those traveling and simply wanting to upload a slightly cleaned-up image to a social media account. I'm not that user, so while helpful, I don't use it.\n\nNow, that brings us to the custom memory movie maker. I don't like this. I'm not the target user of this custom memory movie thing. Perhaps if I had a baby and wanted to share a set of pictures with the grandparents, it might apply. But for me, it might as well just not exist. I don't like it when apps decide to blindside me with past memories when I'm not in the mood to reminisce.\n\nThen there's Apple Intelligence's feature that allows you to describe a photo or video and get intelligent results back. Searching for \"Pixel under a blanket\" resulted in Photos identifying that Pixel is my pet, but none of the pictures returned showed him under a blanket. For the record, we have a lot of pictures of Pixel curled up in the blanket.\n\nIt did not find this or the hundreds of other Pixel under a blanket picture we have taken. This was taken with the iPhone 16 Pro Max. David Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nOn the other hand, searching for \"3D printer\" did return a lot of results with 3D printers in the images or videos. I do a lot of 3D printer-related content on my YouTube channel, and Apple Intelligence did find those images. It was not able to separate out images of a certain brand of printer, but at least it's a start.\n\nPhoto features: Mixed bag, where some features are better in Photoshop, some I don't use, and some that are unreliable.\n\nImage Playground, Image Wand, and Genmoji\n\nThese are three AI image generation tools, and they're\u2026 cute.\n\nAlso: This hidden Apple feature turns your iPhone or iPad into an AI image generator\n\nI tried my hand at Image Wand, which takes an image you draw in Notepad and turns it into a more usable picture. The gotcha is that it requires a prompt as well as the image. I \"drew\" a picture of my dog Pixel, then used the wand tool to select it and prompted \"Pixel.\" I didn't tell the AI my picture was a dog, and you'd be forgiven if you couldn't tell, either. Even so, it did generate a dog picture that was loosely similar to my pup.\n\nScreenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nI tried again, simply drawing a circle and then prompting as \"Pixel.\" This time, the AI generated a few different rings but no dog.\n\nImage Playground takes the idea a step beyond, delving into DALL-E 3 and Midjourney territory, but in a far more limited way. It only allows for three graphic styles. I generally don't expect to use this tool instead of Midjourney, which I pay for. That said, it's possible that Apple's images aren't generated based on a publicly available dataset, so they may not be copyright violations waiting to happen. I don't yet have any good details on how Apple is constructing its images, but this is an area we will be following.\n\nAnd then there's Genmoji. Genmoji is a tool that lets you create an emoji from an idea or prompt you type in. It might be fun, but I really can't see myself using it for anything. I'm not a big emoji user, so I'm again probably not the target market.\n\nImage creation tools: Other tools are much more rich and useful, these are cute, but serve no real practical purpose in my workflow.\n\nVisual Intelligence\n\nLook, as someone who spent years in product marketing, I'm as appreciative of a branding scheme as anyone. But Visual Intelligence, which is supposed to be a big feature of the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro, is a giant nothingburger.\n\nSo, here's how it works. You can only access it using the Camera Control button on the iPhone 16 or 16 Pro. Why? Because some product manager figured people might buy an iPhone 16 to get it.\n\nAll it does -- all it does -- is let you snap a picture and then send it to ChatGPT for analysis or Google to search for similar images. That's right, Apple Intelligence's vaunted Visual Intelligence feature is a shortcut. That's it.\n\nYou don't need an iPhone 16 or 16 Pro to get features like this. Google Lens will run on any iPhone that runs iOS 15 or later. That's an iPhone 6s or newer. An iPhone 6s! Google Lens does all that Visual Intelligence does, and more.\n\nAlso: 5 Google Lens tricks to level up your image search\n\nAnd then there's the ChatGPT app. All you need to do is open the ChatGPT app, hit the plus sign, take a picture, and then give ChatGPT a prompt. ChatGPT will do the rest. ChatGPT will run on an iPhone 8 or newer. Just make sure you're running iOS 16.1 or later.\n\nVisual Intelligence: Unnecessarily predatory marketing hype. C'mon, Apple. You're better than this.\n\nThe final verdict\n\nIt's possible that some of you may find some of the Apple Intelligence features compelling. I know there are at least two or three of you out there who spent an entire weekend creating custom emoji. Don't worry -- your secret is safe with me.\n\nBut none of these features are compelling. Worse, few are even useful. And Visual Intelligence is hype without substance, tied to selling a higher-end model of phone.\n\nI do give a few points for the privacy argument, and I have found value in Voice Notes transcription, but otherwise, nothing here will benefit my mobile life whatsoever.\n\nFor a company founded on the principle of \"insanely great,\" I think Apple Intelligence is leaning way too heavily on that old reality distortion field, but Apple no longer has anyone with the chops to keep the field operating long enough to fool anyone.\n\nYou can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

            "content": "Indonesia is one of Southeast Asia's largest potential tech markets. But industry experts warn that a maze of regulation threatens to hamper investment.\n\nIndonesian regulators last week rejected a proposal from Apple that the tech giant had hoped would pave the way for sales of the iPhone 16 in one of Southeast Asia's largest markets.\n\nIndonesia requires 40% of parts used in certain smartphones to be produced domestically. To comply, Apple had pitched a $1 billion investment in a manufacturing facility on Indonesia's Batam island to produce parts for the AirTag tracking device.\n\nHowever, Indonesian Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang pointed out that since the AirTag is not an iPhone part, the facility would not count towards the locally produced component rule for the iPhone 16, which was rolled out in September 2024, before the local sales ban was first announced.\n\nThe regulation, known locally as The Domestic Component Level (TKDN), calls for locally produced components to be integral parts of a device, whether it is a smartphone, a tablet or a computer.\n\nAryo Meidianto Aji, a Jakarta-based smartphone market analyst, told DW that it seems Apple \"does not understand\" the TKDN scheme rules.\n\n\"Since AirTag is an accessory sold separately from the mobile phone itself, even with significant investment, AirTag will not contribute to the TKDN percentage,\" he said.\n\n\"Ideally, Apple would establish a factory in Indonesia where components can be produced domestically and included in the sales packaging of Apple devices. For instance, adapters, data cables, earphones, cases, and even simple components of the packaging and manuals have their own assessment weight.\"\n\nIndonesia eyes more tech investment\n\nNevertheless, Apple's Batam AirTag production facility is set to open next year, according to Indonesian Investment Minister Rosan Roeslani.\n\nIndonesia economy catches up amid boom To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nIt will be Apple's first production facility in Indonesia, which is seeking to compete with other Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam in becoming a tech production hub.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that the government is not making Indonesia an easy choice.\n\n\"We can appreciate the government's intention to increase local components within products marketed in Indonesia, yet we cannot force multinational companies to comply without providing them with options and the necessary ecosystem,\" said Muhammad Habib, a Jakarta-based international relations expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\n\"Playing hard to get can send a negative signal to the international community. We have remarkably high demand, but we have not been able to meet the needs of the company,\" he told DW.\n\n\"Additionally, Singapore and Malaysia have recently created special economic zones focused on producing high-tech products and integrating into the global technology supply chain,\" Habib said.\n\nApple's initial $1 billion investment proposal in Indonesia compares with nearly $16 billion invested in Vietnam, where it operates multiple production facilities. India is another investment location.\n\nApple had initially proposed a $100 million component factory to meet the local parts requirement, but the government said it was not enough.\n\n\"We have done an assessment and this [proposal] has not met principles of fairness,\" said Industry Minister Gumiwang in November, comparing Apple's proposal to larger investments in Vietnam and Thailand.\n\nIndonesia's \"fairness principles\" compare how companies invest in other countries, while calling for contributions to local jobs and economic development.\n\nMuhammad Habib from CSIS said that with US President-elect Donald Trump taking office, Indonesia should think about how it uses leverage with US-based tech giants.\n\n\"During Trump's tenure, there will be a tendency for business actors to approach Trump to secure more incentives or other forms of support in terms of the economy, geopolitics, and other areas. If we are too stringent, we risk not only losing the investment but also facing other undesirable consequences,\" he said.\n\nDespite being a massive potential market for Apple, most smartphones used in Indonesia are made by South Korea's Samsung, or Chinese manufacturers such as OPPO.\n\nNon-compliant smartphones bought abroad can still be brought into Indonesia, as long as users pay a tax. Indonesia has also banned the sale of Google Pixel phones for failing to meet the local parts rule.\n\n\"Apple's market share in Indonesia is not substantial, particularly for their new products. The larger share is held by some of the older products. Consumers will become weary of waiting for uncertain devices, leading to a significant potential shift to other devices,\" said market analyst Aryo.\n\nApple faces antitrust charges in US To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nEdited by: Wesley Rahn\n\nWritten with material from Reuters.",

            "content": "After a relatively boring Apple Watch update in 2024, it seems Apple has big plans for the 2025 lineup, including the long-rumored Apple Watch SE 3 redesign. In his latest Power On newsletter, Bloomberg\u2018s Mark Gurman teased some of the most exciting features coming to the 2025 Apple Watch lineup.\n\nApple Watch SE 3 redesign: While Gurman doesn\u2019t say exactly what will change with the Apple Watch SE 3, it will likely get bigger display options. With the Apple Watch Series 10 featuring 42mm and 46mm versions, we could expect the upcoming SE device to at least get a 41mm and 45mm bump. Apple could even make the entry-level wearable thinner as well, as it did with the Series 10 in 2024.\n\nSatellite connectivity: Gurman also reiterates a report from last year. According to the journalist, Apple Watch Ultra 3 will get satellite texting, giving users the ability to send text messages with Globalstar Inc.\u2019s fleet of satellites even when they don\u2019t have a cell signal or Wi-Fi connection.\n\n5G RedCap network access: The journalist believes Apple will upgrade the 2025 lineup with 5G RedCap network access. With it, the Apple Watch could get faster speeds on the cellular version without draining quite as much battery. The RedCap\u2019s 5G is a 5G standard for devices that don\u2019t need the full power of 5G technology. This feature will be available on at least the Apple Watch Series 11 and Apple Watch Ultra 3.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

Image source: Jos\u00e9 Adorno for BGR\n\nHigh-blood pressure detection: After adding sleep apnea detection to the 2023 and 2024 Apple Watch models, Apple plans to add high-blood pressure detection to the upcoming models, including Series 11 and Ultra 3. A previous report suggested that this technology would work similarly to Apple\u2019s sleep apnea detector, which means users won\u2019t get specific readings but will be informed that they may be in a state of hypertension.\n\nRevamped Health app: Gurman believes Apple will revamp the Health app, even though he isn\u2019t clear on the changes. The company has been focusing on this app over the past few years as it continues to add new features. In 2023, the software expanded to the iPad, and in 2024, watchOS 11 brought key new features, such as the Vitals app.\n\nAI-based coaching service: This feature has been rumored for a while now. Gurman believes Apple will add an AI-based coaching service to help users exercise more. This could combine the Apple Fitness+ service, the recently released Training Load feature, and newer Apple Intelligence features.\n\nWrap up\n\nThese are some of the most exciting features of the 2025 Apple Watch lineup. BGR will let you know when we learn more about the Apple Watch SE 3, Apple Watch Series 11, and Apple Watch Ultra 3.",

            "content": "Despite pressure from a conservative group, Apple is going against the grain.\n\nAs AFROTECH\u2122 previously reported, Meta announced a hard stop to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and will no longer maintain its DEI team, effective immediately. The company stated it intended to place its attention \u201con applying fair and consistent practices to mitigate bias for everyone, regardless of their background.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe legal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in the United States is changing,\u201d Janelle Gale, Meta\u2019s vice president of human resources, said in a memo. \u201cThe Supreme Court of the United States has recently made decisions signaling a shift in how courts will approach DEI. \u2026 The term \u2018DEI\u2019 has also become charged, in part because it is understood by some as a practice that suggests preferential treatment of some groups over others.\u201d\n\nMeta now joins companies including Amazon, Walmart, and McDonald\u2019s in retracting their DEI efforts ahead of President-Elect Donald Trump\u2019s return to office. However, Apple is separating itself from the pack. In its proxy statement on Jan. 10, Apple shared a list of proposals up for a vote at its yearly shareholder meeting on Feb. 25, including one request to cease its \u201cInclusion & Diversity program, policies, department and goals.\u201d\n\nAccording to CNN, The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a conservative think tank, plans to share an anti-DEI proposal to Apple during the meeting. It claims DEI creates litigation risks and could prompt negative responses from customers and employees. The group further alleges that thousands of Apple employees could be \u201cpotential victims\u201d of discrimination through DEI efforts and believes if effected parties decide to sue Apple, it would result in a loss of \u201ctens of billions of dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are simply asking for a consideration. The proposal, if approved, would not automatically result in the abolishment of DEI,\u201d Stefan Padfield, executive director of the NCPPR\u2019s Free Enterprise Project, told CNN.\n\nNonetheless, Apple\u2019s board of directors is advising its shareholders to vote against any proposal that would dismiss DEI efforts.\n\n\u201cAt Apple, we believe that how we conduct ourselves is as critical to Apple\u2019s success as making the best products in the world,\u201d the company said in the proxy. \u201cWe seek to conduct business ethically, honestly, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and our Business Conduct and Compliance policies are foundational to how we do business. And we strive to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work.\u201d\n\nThe company continued, \u201cThe proposal is unnecessary as Apple already has a well-established compliance program. The proposal also inappropriately attempts to restrict Apple\u2019s ability to manage its own ordinary business operations, people and teams, and business strategies. Apple is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate in recruiting, hiring, training, or promoting on any basis protected by law. Apple seeks to operate in compliance with applicable non-discrimination laws, both in the United States and in the many other jurisdictions in which we operate, and in that regard monitors and evolves its practices, policies, and goals as appropriate to address compliance risks. The proposal inappropriately seeks to micromanage the Company\u2019s programs and policies by suggesting a specific means of legal compliance.\u201d\n\nPadfield views Apple\u2019s statement as \u201cnon-responsive\u201d and believes \u201ccorporations that have been pushing DEI have lost the goodwill to simply say \u2018trust us.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor proposal No. 6, regarding the removal of DEI efforts, it will require \u201cthe affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting, and a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.\u201d",

            "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nApple\u2019s board of directors has recommended shareholders vote against a conservative think tank\u2019s proposal to consider scrapping the tech giant\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.\n\n\u201cAt Apple, we believe that how we conduct ourselves is as critical to Apple\u2019s success as making the best products in the world. We seek to conduct business ethically, honestly, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and our Business Conduct and Compliance policies are foundational to how we do business,\u201d the company said Friday in its proxy statement.\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) notified Apple in September that it intends to submit the anti-DEI proposal at Apple\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on February 25. If passed by shareholders, it would require Apple to consider eliminating some or all of its DEI policies.\n\nBut Apple said the proposal \u201cinappropriately attempts to restrict\u201d and \u201cmicromanage\u201d company operations and policies. The company also said it has a \u201cwell-established compliance program,\u201d and its board actively manages business and legal conduct to ensure it complies with laws in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nStefan Padfield, executive director of the NCPPR\u2019s Free Enterprise Project, said DEI poses risks, including litigation, customer backlash and divisiveness among employees, that outweigh the benefits.\n\nThe NCPPR said that Apple \u201clikely has over 50,000 who are potentially victims of this type of discrimination.\u201d The NCPPR said if any employees sue the company, Apple could lose \u201ctens of billions of dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are simply asking for a consideration. The proposal, if approved, would not automatically result in the abolishment of DEI,\u201d Padfield told CNN. He called Apple\u2019s statement \u201cnon-responsive\u201d and said that \u201ccorporations that have been pushing DEI have lost the goodwill to simply say \u2018trust us.\u2019\u201d\n\nDEI isn\u2019t new. Neither is the backlash\n\nApple\u2019s diversity programs aren\u2019t new. Its supplier diversity program was established in 1993 and works with various nonprofits, including the National Minority Supplier Development Council and National Veterans Business Development Council. Apple also hired its first vice president of inclusion and diversity in 2017 and has 67 employee groups known as \u201cdiversity network associations,\u201d the first of which was established in 1986.\n\nBut other companies are abandoning their commitments or renaming programs to \u201cappear more palatable\u201d to the incoming Trump administration and other critics, said Nani Vishwanath, a consultant and facilitator of DEI and employee experiences at the Courage Collective.\n\nMeta, John Deere and Walmart are among the companies that have made such changes to their DEI commitments following pressure from right-wing activists, legal groups, customers and President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nChanging DEI programs doesn\u2019t necessarily shield a company from further backlash. McDonald\u2019s, which announced on January 6 that it would roll back DEI practices, was sued Sunday by the American Alliance for Equal Rights, an anti-affirmative action group. The lawsuit claims the fast food company did not fully adhere to its commitment to treat \u201ceveryone\u201d fairly because it kept a college scholarship program for Hispanic and Latino high school students.\n\nOther companies aren\u2019t buckling to demand. The NCPPR has made similar proposals to shareholders of major companies, including retail giant Costco, whose board of directors recommended shareholders vote against DEI policies.\n\n\u201cThose who are staying fiercely committed understand how it\u2019s imperative,\u201d Vishwanath said.\n\nVishwanath said DEI is \u201cvastly misunderstood\u201d and companies don\u2019t always understand why they implemented the programs. DEI efforts were originally intended to advance the representation of people from various identities and backgrounds, and this affected employee trainings, resource networks and recruiting practices. But there isn\u2019t a single definition for DEI, which has complicated its implementation.\n\nShe said these misunderstandings cause inconsistency with DEI initiatives. She suggested companies should ask themselves if DEI policies were \u201ca reactive add-on or was it intrinsically important to the company\u2019s success?\u201d\n\n\u201c(DEI) will continue to be met with curiosity or resentment,\u201d said Vishwanath. \u201cFor organizations to remain relevant and meaningful to both their internal and external audiences, they need to think about what practices they need to evolve.\u201d",

As reported in Bloomberg's Power On newsletter, the Apple Watch line will, as usual, receive a refresh alongside new iPhones. This is expected to include a revamped version of the Series and Ultra models, which will outwardly look the same, but feature significant upgrades. Meanwhile, a new version of the lower-cost Apple Watch SE will get a new design, the report said.\n\nA representative for Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMost notably, the Ultra 3 watch is expected to include satellite connectivity and 5G RedCap (reduced capability) network access. This is a streamlined version of 5G that requires fewer components and improves power efficiency. The feature is expected to be exclusive to the third-generation Ultra Watch. The Ultra line was not updated in 2024.\n\nThe updates would reflect Apple's continued effort to position the Apple Watch Ultra as a device with advanced tools that would appeal to fitness enthusiasts and hikers who may find themselves in remote locations without access to the internet\n\nRead more: Best Apple Watch Deals\n\nApple is reportedly working with telecommunications company Globalstar to expand its satellite service, which may pave the way for additional features in the future. Although the report didn't share extensive details, the new satellite connectivity could be similar to the Emergency SOS via Satellite feature that debuted on the iPhone 14 in 2022. This feature allows users to send short messages to first responders while off the grid.\n\nRead more: Apple Watch Series 10 Review: I Wasn't Expecting It to Be This Good\n\nThe new models are also expected to have more advanced health tracking. A high blood pressure detection tool could debut on both the Ultra and Series models, the report said. The company is also said to be designing its health app, as well as AI-based coaching services, potentially integrated with upgraded AirPods.\n\nThe report also said Apple's next-generation AirPods may also include heart rate monitoring and other health-focused sensors. Meanwhile, AirTags, which haven't seen significant updates since their 2021 launch, could also receive a redesign with farther range and better location tracking.",

The update brought a handful of new Apple Intelligence features, like Genmoji and Image Playground, to people with the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max or a device from the iPhone 16 lineup. However, iOS 18.1 gave those iPhone owners access to Apple Intelligence, which can provide summaries in multiple places across their devices.\n\nRead more: Your iOS 18 Cheat Sheet\n\nWith Apple Intelligence and a compatible iPhone, your device can provide you with a summary of a lengthy email, a webpage, Message notifications and more. It can also show you a summary of what you have written in Notes and other messages.\n\nHere's what you need to know about summaries with Apple Intelligence on your iPhone. Note that before you use Apple Intelligence, you have to request it for your iPhone. To do so, go to Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri and tap Get Apple Intelligence.\n\nSummaries in Mail\n\nParsing through emails and email chains for information can be tedious, especially if you get a lot of work emails sent to your device. Thankfully, Apple Intelligence can summarize emails for you so you aren't reading a lot of preamble and want to just get right to the heart of the message.\n\nIt was a great show if you were wondering. Apple/Screenshot by CNET\n\nTo view email summaries, open Mail, choose the email you want to read, and then pull your screen down to reveal a new Summarize button. Tap this and you'll see some lines of summary. You can change how many lines of summary you see by going to Settings > Apps > Mail > Preview and choosing anything from no lines of summary to five.\n\nIt's also important to note that if you're using iOS 18.2's Mail Categories, you can only see AI summaries for emails in your Primary category. Emails in other categories won't give you summaries. If you're using List View in Mail all your emails will have a summary available.\n\nRead more: What You Need to Know About Mail Categories in iOS 18.2\n\nNotification summaries\n\nWith Apple Intelligence, some of your apps can give you summaries of notifications on your Lock Screen, and this feature is on by default in most cases. This feature can summarize your notifications in a few words, but be careful while reading these. According to the BBC, one of the publication's headlines was summarized inaccurately.\n\nIf you don't want to risk reading a bad summary, you can turn this feature off. Go to Settings > Notifications > Summarize Notifications and tap the toggles next to the apps you no longer want to receive notification summaries from. You can also tap the toggle next to Summarize Notifications at the top of the menu to turn the feature off for all apps.\n\nRead more: Apple's Notification Summaries Can Be Absurdly Wrong\n\nWebpage summaries in Safari\n\nApple/Screenshot by CNET\n\nApple Intelligence can also summarize certain webpages in Safari. To view these summaries, open Safari and go to a webpage, then look on the left side of the address bar. You should see a rectangle with a few dashes beneath it and sparkles. Tap this symbol and it pulls up a menu showing the summary of the webpage.\n\nBe aware that this feature isn't available on all webpages. On webpages this feature isn't working yet, the symbol on the left side of the address bar won't have any sparkles.\n\nSummarize text with Writing Tools\n\nWriting Tools is an Apple Intelligence menu that lets you proofread, edit or alter something you're writing. It also lets you summarize your message or notes.\n\nTo view these summaries, highlight what you want to summarize, tap Writing Tools in the pop-up menu -- you might have to scroll through the options in this menu -- and then tap Summary. Writing Tools will show you a summary of what you have highlighted, and it will let you Copy, Replace and Share that summary. These summaries could help you prepare for a presentation, let you quickly read over anything in Notes or trim your own messages down to just the key points.\n\nRead more: Proofread, Edit and More With Apple Intelligence Writing Tools\n\nFor more on iOS 18, here's what to know about iOS 18.2 and iOS 18.1 and our iOS 18 cheat sheet.

You can also enable it for certain apps but not others from the same screen.\n\nWriting Tools / Image Creation\n\nYou can turn Writing Tools and Image Creation off, but you have to go through Screen Time in Settings:\n\nTap Content & Privacy Restrictions .\n\nEnable Content & Privacy Restrictions .\n\nTap Intelligence & Siri .\n\nTap Image Creation or Writing Tools, then Don\u2019t Allow.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a clumsy fix \u2014 this is really more for preventing kids from cheating on their homework \u2014 but it works. You won\u2019t get pop-up options to rewrite text, and you won\u2019t be able to create new Genmoji. Open the Image Playground app on iOS, and the option to create new pictures will be blocked (though you can access previous ones you\u2019ve saved).\n\nMessage prioritization\n\nAI-powered message prioritization in Apple Mail is another feature you can disable on its own \u2014 or, more precisely, hide from view.\n\nInside your Mail app\u2019s Inbox , tap the three dots at the top right.\n\nSwitch to List View and disable Show Priority.\n\nYour inbox will be back the way it was before Apple Intelligence arrived.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t leave much in terms of Apple Intelligence in iOS 18.2 that you can\u2019t specifically disable. There\u2019s the Clean Up tool in Photos and the Intelligent Breakthrough feature in Focus, but you can easily ignore these options if you don\u2019t need them.\n\nTurn off Apple Intelligence completely on your iPhone\n\nApple Intelligence can be enabled or disabled in full. Screenshot: Apple Disabling Apple Intelligence won\u2019t remove the AI models from your phone. Screenshot: Apple\n\nIf you really don\u2019t want anything to do with Apple Intelligence, and you\u2019ve already enabled it, you can turn it off completely.\n\nOpen up Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri .\n\nLook for the Apple Intelligence toggle switch at the top to fully enable or fully disable all of the Apple Intelligence features currently available on your iPhone.\n\nThe first time you turned this toggle switch on \u2014 assuming you did \u2014 iOS downloaded the necessary AI models for local processing to your phone. These models, which take up 7GB or so of room, then subsequently stay on your iPhone in the future, regardless of whether you have Apple Intelligence enabled.\n\nIf you want to disable Apple Intelligence and free up the space used by the local iOS models, you need to reset your iPhone and start again from scratch without enabling Apple Intelligence during setup. You can do this from Settings by choosing General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Erase All Content and Settings, Since this will, of course, wipe everything on your phone, ensure all your important data is safely backed up.",

It will remain the same as the Apple Watch Ultra 2 visually, but as previously rumored, bring with it satellite connectivity. The new report doesn't add any detail, but it's likely that the feature will be similar to the original Emergency SOS via Satellite that was introduced with the iPhone 14 and allowed brief text messages to be sent to first responders.\n\nIt's also claimed that the Apple Watch Ultra 3 will gain 5G RedCap (Reduced Capacity) network access. This is like a lite version of 5G which needs fewer components such as antennas, and has better power efficiency.\n\nThis means 5G RedCap is suited to wearables like the Apple Watch Ultra, which are battery-powered, and unlikely to need more than occasional 5G access.\n\nWhile 5G RedCap and satellite connectivity are said to be exclusive to the next Apple Watch Ultra, there is a feature that will come to both that and the Apple Watch Series 11. It's expected that high blood pressure detection will be added to both watches.\n\nJust as with the Apple Watch Ultra, it's believed that there will be no clearly visible redesign to the Apple Watch Series 11. However, it is now rumored that the lower-cost Apple Watch SE will get a new design.\n\nMore health features\n\nAlongside the high blood pressure detection in the Apple Watch, it's reported that there will be heart-rate monitoring in the next generation of AirPods. Those will include other unspecified health sensors, which have previously been predicted to be for temperature measuring.\n\nThe new health sensors will feed their results into what's now expected to be a revamped health app. There may also be an AI-based coaching service, presumably presenting health and exercise advice.\n\nThere is now also expected to be a redesign for AirTags, the hardware of which has been entirely unchanged since their debut in 2021. The new report has no further details, but other recent rumors have said that the chief difference in AirTags 2 will be increased range and better location tracking.",

It\u2019s like Steve Jobs invented the iPhone, and now they\u2019re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later.\u201d\n\nHe argued that iPhone sales are flagging because consumers were waiting to upgrade their devices, waiting for more improved models.\n\n\u201cSo how are they making more money as a company? Well, they do it by basically, like, squeezing people, and, like you\u2019re saying, having this 30% tax on developers by getting you to buy more peripherals and things that plug into it,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cYou know, they build stuff like AirPods, which are cool, but they\u2019ve just thoroughly hamstrung the ability for anyone else to build something that can connect to the iPhone in the same way.\u201d\n\nMeta last year offered advertisers a way to avoid the 30% service charge levied by Apple. The offer lets businesses that use boosted posts on Facebook and Instagram can go to those platform\u2019s websites on mobile or desktop devices to boost their content and not pay the service charge.\n\nPYMNTS has contacted Apple for comment but has not yet gotten a reply.\n\nIn the podcast interview, Zuckerberg contended that Apple defends itself from criticism from other companies by saying it wants to protect user privacy and security. He added that it could solve that problem by improving its protocol, such as building better security and using encryption.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s insecure because you didn\u2019t build any security into it.

            "content": "Almost everyone knows Apple (AAPL -0.11%). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers.\n\nApple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015.\n\nApple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar , was recently 3%.\n\n, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.",

            "content": "I\u2019ve used and tried every Apple Watch since its launch in 2014. I was on the shop floor at Apple on day one of the Apple Watch launch, and for all of the last decade, I\u2019ve been wearing, using, or writing about the Apple Watch.\n\nBut after years in Apple\u2019s fold, 2024 heralded a new opportunity to try fitness tech from the other side of the iOS/Android divide. I\u2019ve used the mightily impressive Mobvoi Ticwatch Atlas, and to close out the year I got my hands on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra.\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 is the undisputed best smartwatch out there, and one of my personal favorite pieces of tech, so I was keen to get a look at Samsung\u2019s answer to the rugged, durable, adventure-going smartwatch.\n\nBut after barely 10 minutes with the Samsung Galaxy Ultra, I became flabbergasted by the absence of a feature I\u2019d never even considered wasn\u2019t ubiquitous on smartwatches of all shapes, sizes, and manufacture. I am, of course, talking about the digital crown.\n\nMy first Samsung\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nI didn\u2019t notice the Galaxy Watch Ultra didn\u2019t have a digital crown until I first put it on and used it. After successfully pairing it with my Samsung Galaxy Fold Z 6, I started to play around with the watch\u2019s basic settings and features.\n\nThe first time I encountered a menu, I instinctively reached for the digital crown to scroll, and to my horror, felt nothing. I tried again, but still nothing. \u201cWhat on earth is going on?\u201d I thought to myself, peering down at the side of my Galaxy Watch Ultra in dismay. There, staring back at me was the Ultra\u2019s array of Quick Button, Home Button, and a Back button, with no scrolling crown in sight.\n\nThe lack of a digital crown has made me question everything I thought I knew about smartwatches. In 10 years of covering and using Apple Watch, I\u2019ve had little reason to stray beyond Apple\u2019s walled garden, but I\u2019d never stopped to consider that some Android smartwatch models didn\u2019t have a digital crown.\n\nHow on earth do you scroll on a watch without a digital crown? A quick shop-around has reassured me that Google has adopted this indispensable tech with its Google Pixel Watch range, but I\u2019m genuinely astonished that Samsung hasn\u2019t got on board.\n\nDefying convention\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nThe Galaxy Watch Ultra is definitely an impressive timepiece, and one of the best Android smartwatches to boot. It certainly draws a bit too heavily on the design of the Apple Watch Ultra, from the squarer, blockish design, the rear sensor configuration, and the flashes of orange, which everyone seems to have decided is the color of adventure.\n\nHowever, I love the band attachment mechanism, and the vibrant display really makes the colors pop. Yet this emulation of Apple\u2019s hardware makes the lack of a digital crown all the more befuddling, how did Samsung take so much inspiration from the Apple Watch Ultra and skip over one of its most important and useful features?\n\nAn \u201cultra\u201d smartwatch by definition is meant for tackling the great outdoors. A world of mud, dirt, sand, and water that makes a touch screen unreliable. Having a tactile input like a digital crown is vital to retaining more control and functionality over your timepiece in inclement weather. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s critical if you\u2019re trying to use your smartwatch while wearing gloves, as I found out on a recent trip to the English Lake District.\n\nI use the digital crown on my Apple Watch every single day. It\u2019s there for scrolling through messages and emails, controlling the volume of music during a workout, or sifting quickly through the tiles on the smartstack.\n\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking, and yes, I have used Samsung\u2019s Touch Bezel on the Galaxy Watch Ultra. I hate it. Not only is it not conducive to use in the great outdoors for all the aforementioned reasons, but I actually think it harms the user experience because your finger often obscures what you\u2019re trying to look at and scroll through on the screen.\n\nPerhaps with time I\u2019ll grow used to the Ultra\u2019s Touch Bezel and its lack of a digital crown, but the revelation that not every smartwatch has a digital crown has ruined me. I\u2019d defy anyone using a Galaxy Watch to try their hand at a digital crown on any Apple Watch or Android alternative and tell me that it\u2019s not a better, more tactile, and more satisfying experience.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about the Galaxy Watch Ultra if you're an Android user. It\u2019s the most rugged and exciting adventure watch on the smartwatch market right now. It has excellent battery life, and a tough titanium exterior, and it\u2019s frequently discounted to the extreme, drastically increasing its value.\n\nRumors about the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 are scant to non-existent, but I\u2019d say a slam-dunk upgrade for the next iteration would be the introduction of a digital crown for scrolling that would drastically improve the user experience. It\u2019s not a bad watch by any means, but a digital crown seems like an easy place to start when it comes to second-gen improvements.",

In the past, they've been able to produce tremendous returns for shareholders.\n\nTwo examples are Amazon (AMZN -2.83%) and Apple (AAPL -0.11%), successful enterprises that touch the lives of billions of people daily. Despite their massive sizes, they both deserve to be on your investment radar.\n\nWhich of these \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks is the best one to buy right now?\n\nAmazon: Multiple growth levers\n\nIn the last 12 months, Amazon reported net sales of $620 billion. This is a gargantuan sum that would make you believe the top line has no upside going forward. But that's a flawed assumption, as Amazon benefits from numerous secular tailwinds.\n\nFor starters, the company is the clear leader in the e-commerce market. According to Statista, nearly 40% of all online shopping in the U.S. goes through Amazon.com, well ahead of second-place Walmart. E-commerce spending accounts for just 16% of total retail activity in the U.S., so there is a long growth runway that Amazon can capture.\n\nAnd besides streaming entertainment and digital advertising, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is making the company a cloud computing leader, commanding 31% global market share in the industry. Revenue growth has accelerated in recent quarters, boosted by heightened customer interest in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nRecently, Amazon's management team, led by CEO Andy Jassy, has been focused on cost cuts and operational efficiency. A business as large as this one unsurprisingly developed some bloat that needed addressing. This is music to investors' ears.\n\nThat's because Amazon's bottom line is expanding at a rapid clip. Operating income soared 55% year over year to $17.4 billion in Q3. And executives believe that figure will increase 36% (at the midpoint) in the just-ended fourth quarter. Wall Street analysts expect revenue to rise 11% in 2025, but they forecast operating income to just 21%. I believe a continuation of this trend is in store for the foreseeable future.\n\nApple: Incredible brand strength\n\nApple is the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of just under $3.7 trillion. Getting to this point can be attributed to its strong brand presence, one that consumers associate with a premium status, high-quality offerings, and exceptional design and innovation. This has helped the business benefit from pricing power over the years.\n\nApple's hardware devices, most notably the iPhone, get a lot of attention. That's warranted, as this single product represented 51% of company revenue in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 28). And it's precisely what has made Apple a global icon. But revenue growth here isn't exciting anymore.\n\nThat's not the case for the company's various software and services offerings, like Apple TV+, iCloud, Apple Pay, and advertising, which are becoming more important for the overall business. This division has grown revenue at a compound annual rate of 12% in the past three years, faster than hardware. And it boasts a fantastic gross margin of 74%.\n\nThe combination of hardware and software creates Apple's powerful ecosystem. This locks users in and discourages them from leaving to competitors. In other words, there are switching costs.\n\nAnother compelling trait Apple possesses is its pristine financial condition. The company is incredibly profitable, raking in $93.7 billion in net income in fiscal 2024, good for a net profit margin of 24%. That has helped support a balance sheet position with $50 billion in net cash, reducing financial risk for investors.\n\nPrice matters\n\nThere's no question these two companies are top-notch enterprises. But investors can't ignore valuation, as the price you pay matters.\n\nAs of this writing, Amazon trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 36, while Apple's multiple is at 33. Amazon's quickly expanding bottom line, especially when compared to Apple's more muted growth, helps justify paying what is a slightly premium valuation.\n\nLooking out over the next five years, I believe Amazon has a chance to produce a higher return than Apple, making it a better stock to buy.",

            "content": "Apple's iPhone 16 series boasts a set of new features, like improved cameras and deep integration with Apple Intelligence, but the company's rumored foldable iPhone Flip is still nowhere to be seen. Most makers of Android phones, including Samsung, Google, Motorola, OnePlus, Xiaomi and Honor, have been selling folding devices for years now, and it's beginning to feel like Apple is late to the party. That might be a problem.\n\nApple dominates in the premium phone category, but foldables -- which fit into the premium space in terms of price -- are already nipping at its heels, with Motorola telling CNET that 20% of customers buying its Razr foldable jumped ship from Apple. Meanwhile, Samsung is in the sixth generation of its Flip and Fold series. As CNET's Lisa Eadicicco found out during a visit to Seoul, \"foldables are everywhere\" in Samsung's home country of South Korea.\n\nWould Apple go with a smaller format like the Galaxy Z Flip series? Amy Kim/CNET\n\nWith almost all the major Android phone manufacturers getting in on the foldable game, Apple runs the risk not just of losing out on potential customers but also of allowing a rival like Samsung to become the go-to name for the category, which could make it harder for Apple to have an impact if it eventually launches its own folding product. Furthermore, customers who've become early adopters of a foldable, attracted by the fancy bending tech, may be too entrenched in the Android ecosystem by the time Apple's phone arrives to want to switch to iOS.\n\nApple is unlikely to be worried. It's estimated that around 20 million foldables from all manufacturers were sold worldwide in 2023, while Apple reportedly sold 26.5 million iPhone 14 Pro Max handsets in the first half of that year alone. Clearly, Apple feels it has yet to miss the boat.\n\nThe iPhone 15 Pro Max is a superb phone. But what if it could bend? Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nApple has always found success in biding its time, observing the industry and launching its own take on a product when it's ready. Apple didn't invent phones, tablets, smartwatches or computers, but it found ways to take existing products and make them more useful, more valuable in day-to-day life and -- dare I say -- more exciting. It's why the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Mac lines dominate the market today.\n\nFor me, I need to see Apple's take on the foldable phone. I've written before about how disappointed I am in foldables. I've been a mobile reporter for over 13 years and phones have become increasingly dull as they've converged to become slight variations on the same rectangular slab.\n\nRead more: Best Flip Phone for 2025\n\nFoldables promised something new, something innovative, something that briefly sparked some excitement in me, but several years in, that excitement has dwindled to the point of being extinguished. They are fine products and while I like the novelty of a screen that bends, they're not a revolution in how we interact with our phones. Not in the way that the arrival of the touchscreen was when we were still pushing buttons to type out texts.\n\nI did hope that Google's Pixel Fold would be the phone to catapult the foldable forward, and while the new Pixel 9 Pro Fold -- the second generation of Google's foldable -- does offer some great updates, it still doesn't offer any kind of revolution. Instead, it feels more like a \"me too\" move from Google. Ditto for the OnePlus Open. So I'm left instead to look toward Apple, a company with a track record for product revolutions, to create a new take on the genre that genuinely drives forward how we use our phones.\n\nGoogle's Pixel Fold is a decent phone, but it doesn't drive the category forward in any meaningful way. James Martin/CNET\n\nThat innovation won't just come from the product design. Apple works closely with its third-party software developers, and it's that input that would help a folding iPhone become genuinely useful. My biggest complaint around foldables right now is that while the hardware is decent, the devices are essentially just running standard versions of Android with a handful of UI tweaks thrown in. They're regular phones that just happen to bend.\n\nFew Android developers are embracing the folding format, and it's not difficult to see why; the users aren't there in sufficient numbers yet to justify the time and expense to adapt their software across a variety of screen sizes. The multiple folding formats already available mean Android foldables face the same fragmentation issue that has plagued the platform since the beginning. Android-based foldables are simply a more difficult platform for developers to build for than regular phones. Apple would be able to change that, as it proved with the iPhone and iPad.\n\nApple didn't invent tablet computers, but its iPad line revolutionized the category. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nGiven Apple's close relationships with top-tier developers -- not to mention its own vast developer team -- I expect an eventual Apple foldable to offer innovations that make it more than just an iPhone that folds in half.\n\nAnd I truly hope it does. I want to look forward to tech launches again. I want to feel excited to get a new gadget in my hands and feel that \"wow\" moment as I do something transformative for the first time.\n\nIn short, I don't want to be bored by technology anymore. Apple, it's over to you.",

            "content": "Apple's slate of 2025 products look to be dominated by a large number of low-cost and entry-level devices. Here's what to expect.\n\n\n\nWith advancements like Apple Intelligence and all-new in-house chip designs, Apple is reportedly looking to enhance many of its budget-friendly offerings, ensuring they remain competitive in an increasingly crowded market. These updates also indicate a slight shift in Apple's approach to low-cost devices, moving beyond entry-level hardware to introduce features once reserved for premium models, such as OLED displays, Face ID, and advanced wireless technology.\n\nIndeed, Apple's first custom modem and Bluetooth chip is coming to entry-level devices first. Similarly, the company is focusing on lower-end smart home devices such as the HomePod mini, Apple TV, and Command Center, before devoting attention to higher-end models. We're expecting a total of eight new or refreshed low-cost Apple devices this year:\n\n\n\nThe \u200cMacBook Air\u200c will finally be upgraded to the M4 chip, delivering up to 25% faster multi-core CPU performance than the current model. It could also gain support for two external displays and a 12MP webcam with Center Stage. Launching in spring 2025, the new models will likely maintain their current starting price of $1,099. All models now start with 16GB of memory as standard.\n\nThe iPhone SE 4 is rumored to feature a design similar to the \u200ciPhone\u200c 14, including a 6.1-inch OLED display, \u200cFace ID\u200c, a USB-C port, and a 48MP rear camera. It will likely be powered by the A18 chip with 8GB of RAM to support \u200cApple Intelligence\u200c and will debut Apple's first in-house 5G modem. Expected to launch in March 2025, the new \u200ciPhone\u200c SE is expected to be priced between $400 and $500, with a slight increase from the current $429 due to significant upgrades.\n\nThe 11th-generation \u200ciPad\u200c will retain the 10.9-inch display and Touch ID power button but will likely upgrade to an A17 Pro or A18 chip with 8GB of RAM to enable \u200cApple Intelligence\u200c. Expected in spring 2025, the device may continue to start at $349, with the possibility of a base storage upgrade to 128GB.\n\nThe AirTag 2 will include an upgraded Ultra Wideband chip for a threefold increase in tracking range, better Vision Pro integration, and a tamper-proof speaker for enhanced anti-stalking measures. Launching in mid-2025, it is expected to maintain the current $29 price point.\n\nApple's Command Center will serve as an all-new smart home hub product with a 7-inch display, built-in speakers, a camera for FaceTime, and proximity sensors for dynamic interface adjustments. It will run a new \"homeOS\" with widget-focused controls and Siri integration. Expected to launch around March 2025, the price is yet to be confirmed but is expected to be competitive with similar products like Amazon's Echo Show, which is priced at $90. A higher-end version of the device on a robotic arm is expected to debut in 2026, so the initial Command Center is likely to be an entry-level device akin to the \u200cHomePod mini\u200c.\n\nThe second-generation HomePod mini is expect to gain a new in-house Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip supporting Wi-Fi 6E, improved audio quality, and a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip for better handoff. Likely to launch in mid-2025, the device will likely retain its $99 price point.\n\nA new \u200cApple TV\u200c 4K is rumored to feature an updated A-series chip, likely the A16 or newer, Wi-Fi 6E support, and possibly a built-in camera for \u200cFaceTime\u200c. Expected to launch in 2025, the device could see a starting price drop to $99 from the current $129, aligning better with competitors like Amazon's Fire Stick.\n\nThe \u200cApple Watch SE\u200c 3 will likely feature larger displays, a faster chip, the S10 or S11 chip, and may adopt a more affordable plastic casing. The current model will be three years old this fall. Expected in late 2025, the device could maintain its $249 starting price or potentially decrease slightly to compete with rival devices and appeal to parents purchasing for children.",

            "content": "Apple last year introduced Apple Intelligence, its own set of AI tools. Since they are all processed on-device, Apple Intelligence requires the latest hardware such as the iPhone 15 Pro and later. Even so, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the requirements of Apple Intelligence haven\u2019t helped Apple boost iPhone sales.\n\nUsers not convinced to buy a new iPhone because of Apple Intelligence\n\nIn a note on his blog, Kuo said that Apple\u2019s efforts to promote Apple Intelligence haven\u2019t resulted in an increase in iPhone sales. According to his sources in the supply chain, most iPhone owners don\u2019t seem interested in buying a new model just because of the AI features. A SellCell survey last month revealed that most users see little to no value in Apple Intelligence so far.\n\nThe analyst notes that Apple was unable to sustain the \u201cinitial buzz\u201d after announcing Apple Intelligence at WWDC 2024, as its competitors \u201chave advanced rapidly in subsequent months.\u201d Kuo believes that other AI platforms such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT benefit from being cloud-based, while Apple Intelligence is entirely reliant on hardware processing.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s efforts to promote on-device AI face multiple structural challenges. For example, despite the initial buzz following Apple Intelligence\u2019s debut at WWDC 2024, its appeal has significantly declined compared to cloud-based AI services, which have advanced rapidly in subsequent months,\u201d Kuo said. The analyst added that \u201cthere is no evidence of Apple Intelligence\u2019s ability to benefit hardware replacement cycles.\u201d\n\nApple has been rolling out Apple Intelligence features in phases. First, the company introduced Writing Tools and the summarization feature with iOS 18.1. Then, with iOS 18.2, Apple introduced Genmoji, Image Playgrounds, and ChatGPT integration. The long promised more advanced Siri with on-screen awareness is yet to come in April.\n\nAnother aspect that certainly affects interest in Apple Intelligence is its availability. Not just because of the hardware requirements, but because Apple\u2019s AI features are only available in English so far. The company says it will introduce support for more languages later this year.\n\nEven so, Apple has been heavily using Apple Intelligence to promote its latest hardware. Most of the ads for the iPhone 16 and M4 Macs highlight features such as Genmoji and text summarization.\n\nRead also",

            "content": "The next Apple TV is on the way, long overdue, and likely to bring with it multiple updates. Here's what the rumor mill believes is on the way for Apple's set-top box.\n\nApple's last update to the Apple TV was in 2022. A new model is likely to arrive sometime in 2025, if rumors about the set-top box are to be believed.\n\nAs usual for Apple hardware, there are a wide variety of changes expected for the device. What follows is what the rumor mill and online chatter propose Apple will do to its smallest device for the home's biggest screen.\n\nApple TV - Redesign and networking\n\nJust as it has done for the Mac mini and other hardware, Apple's push to make everything more compact will continue with the Apple TV. The 2022 design was a bit smaller, but so will the 2025 update.\n\nDon't expect a new dongle design or anything too dramatic. It should look like how it does now, but slightly thinner.\n\nTwo different models are also expected as usual, with a lower-end entry-level model accompanied by a higher-end version. The upper-tier model will have more storage, thread connectivity, and an Ethernet port.\n\nNetworking will also be one of the bigger upgrades for the Apple TV.\n\nApple has been working on its own in-house wireless chip, which could end up debuting in the Apple TV and a new HomePod. Codenamed Proxima, the chip supports Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, which are both big upgrades for the set-top box.\n\nThese will be replacing the Broadcom chips already used in the Apple TV, and will be the first real-world trial for Apple's design. Eventually, they will make their way into the iPhone and other hardware.\n\nThis could even turn the Apple TV into a mesh access point in the future, helping to improve your home and smart home's Wi-Fi coverage.\n\nApple TV - Processing\n\nA faster processor is always a good bet for hardware updates. The A15 Bionic in use at the moment is a powerhouse, but it does have a lot on its plate.\n\nAside from usual video streaming duties and gaming, it's also used as a smart home hub. That means it has to deal with HomeKit secure video feeds and other tasks, which aren't necessarily user-facing.\n\nWith a better chip, it could improve the processing, opening itself up to handling more HomeKit analysis tasks.\n\nIt's not hard to imagine an Apple TV with an A18 chip.\n\nGaming is also becoming more important to Apple, and with netting some major titles on Mac already, giving the Apple TV more power could bring them to the compact device too.\n\nAs for what this chip could be, code found in iOS 18 references a new home accessory using an A18 processor. This is the same as used in the iPhone 16.\n\nThere's also a chance that the Apple could end up using the A17 Pro in the Apple TV. It's the minimum chip required to run Apple Intelligence, which could bring more benefits to the Apple TV.\n\nThat includes an improved Siri, with more contextual awareness. This will help improve search, handle follow-up queries, and maybe even improve recommendations for the user.\n\nApple TV - Audio improvements.\n\nMultiple comments in AppleInsider videos have asked about getting DTS Audio in the Apple TV. We know Apple supports Dolby Atmos, but the people who want DTS aren't backing down.\n\nTo be the be-all-and-end-all of streaming boxes, it should support as many formats as it can. Adding DTS would make sense in this scenario.\n\nAdd in that Disney+ added support for DTS:X, it means the format is seeing some higher adoption. Whether that translates into full-blown support is another matter.\n\nApple TV - Siri Remote\n\nThe current second-gen Siri Remote is good, but it could still enjoy some changes. For a start, the side Siri button could receive a small rebranding to an Apple Intelligence button, which wouldn't take that much to accomplish.\n\nSecond-gen Siri Remote\n\nBetter Find My support would be welcomed, as even Google made its streaming box easy to find the remote, thank to a button on the back of the box that makes the remote play a sound. This is a simple interface for users, while Apple still uses a more rudimentary Find My implementation.\n\nTelling the user that the remote is in the living room isn't that helpful. However, real Ultra Wideband support would solve this problem by directing modern iPhones in the right direction.\n\nApple TV - Possible release times\n\nThere were reports that Apple was ready to release the updated Apple TV in early 2024, but pulled back from doing so for some reason.\n\nThis could've been to add new features, or even to avoid dealing with it during the Apple Intelligence launch. It's unknown why, but it was seemingly pulled from a 2024 launch, with a 2025 release seemingly more likely at the time of WWDC.\n\nHowever, no-one ultimately knows when it will be released. A release during the Spring window seems as likely as any other to get a new box to play with.",

            "content": "Apple last week agreed to pay $95 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that accused the company of recording customers using the Siri virtual assistant.\n\nThe settlement period covers a full decade, and given the ubiquity of Apple products, there's a good chance you'll be eligible for a piece of the payout. How much that'll be will depend on the number of claimants: The higher that number goes, the less each claimant gets. Still, it will pay out a certain amount per Siri-enabled device that you own.\n\nThe impact of this settlement has the potential to be wide-ranging, given the reach of Apple's product ecosystem. According to a Business of Apps report from November, citing company and market research data, there were roughly 155 million active iPhones in the US as of 2024, a number that's been steadily increasing since the product's debut. Similarly, active Apple TV streaming boxes in the US have also been increasing year to year, with over 32 million active in the US as of 2023.\n\nTo find out if you're eligible for this settlement, read on. You can also find out if you're eligible for the 23andMe data leak settlement.\n\nWho sued Apple and why?\n\nThis class action lawsuit, Lopez et al v. Apple Inc., was first brought against Apple in 2019, with plaintiffs alleging that they were routinely recorded by their Apple devices after unintentionally activating the Siri virtual assistant, violating their privacy in the process. They further alleged that these recordings were then sold to advertisers and used to target them with ads online.\n\nSpecific incidents mentioned in the suit include plaintiffs seeing ads online for brands like Air Jordan and Olive Garden after Apple device users discussed them out loud. In some instances, plaintiffs claimed that their devices began listening to them without them having said anything at all. At least one plaintiff involved in the case was a minor when it was first filed.\n\nThough it agreed to the settlement, Apple hasn't admitted any wrongdoing.\n\n\"Siri has been engineered to protect user privacy from the beginning,\" Apple said in a statement sent to CNET. \"Siri data has never been used to build marketing profiles and it has never been sold to anyone for any purpose. Apple settled this case to avoid additional litigation so we can move forward from concerns about third-party grading that we already addressed in 2019. We use Siri data to improve Siri, and we are constantly developing technologies to make Siri even more private.\"\n\nWho is eligible for this class action settlement?\n\nThe eligibility requirements for this settlement are fairly broad, as it's open to anyone who owned a Siri-enabled Apple device between Sept. 17, 2014, and Dec. 31, 2024. In order to opt in, you'll have to swear under oath that at some point during that period, you accidentally activated Siri on each device you want to get a payment for.\n\nSiri-enabled devices include iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, MacBooks, iMacs, Apple TV streaming boxes, HomePod speakers and iPod Touches.\n\nHow can I get from the class action settlement?\n\nPayments per device are to be capped at $20, though depending on how many people opt in to the settlement, claimants could receive less than that. Each individual can only claim payments for up to five devices.\n\nAt this stage, it's unclear when payments will be disbursed and how claimants will go about opting in. The settlement terms still need to be approved by a federal judge, with a hearing on the matter now scheduled for Feb. 14.\n\nFor more on Apple, see why a majority of users don't care for Apple Intelligence and find out which iOS setting can stop apps from tracking you.",

Amazon is once again offering all four colors of the most affordable 15-inch M3 MacBook Air models with some similarly deep discounts. You\u2019ll find the 16GB model with 256GB of storage marked down to $1,099 shipped and the 512GB variant at $1,299 shipped to deliver the lowest prices we can find and the best deals since they were slightly lower during Black Friday. Both the 256GB and the 512GB variant are also matched at Best Buy right now.\n\nThe 256GB carries a regular price at $1,299 these days, while the 512GB goes for $1,499 \u2013 both are now $200 off the new going rate. Having said that, you know the drill by now \u2013 these two machines just got a RAM upgrade for essentially FREE, which means they are now actually $400 under the price you would have paid for these configurations before Apple upped its RAM game back in October of 2024.\n\nNeedless to say, these are fantastic prices for an M3 MacBook Air that\u2019s Apple intelligence-ready no matter when the looming M4 models surface.

            "content": "writes about pop culture, media, and ethics. Before joining Vox in 2016, they were a staff reporter at the Daily Dot. A 2019 fellow of the National Critics Institute, they\u2019re considered an authority on fandom, the internet, and the culture wars.\n\n$95 million is a headline-making number, especially when it comes as a result of a proposed class action lawsuit settlement in which claimants accused Apple of unlawfully surveilling them through Siri and other Apple devices. If the settlement is approved by the district court in Oakland, California, overseeing the case, people who owned a Siri between September 17, 2014, and December 31, 2024, and who believe they experienced an \u201cunintended Siri activation,\u201d will be able to file a claim for $20 as compensation.\n\nThe lawsuit began in 2019 after a Guardian investigation in which a whistleblower came forward to allege \u201ccountless instances\u201d in which Apple devices, including Siri and the Apple Watch, had inadvertently listened in on users. At the time, Apple had staffed numerous third-party contractors to listen to the devices, which included the inadvertently obtained data \u2014 though it claimed this was only for purposes of improving them, not, as many litigants alleged, selling the data to advertisers.\n\nThe company quickly stopped the practice, though not before public debate about whether Siri was really spying on its users became widespread. After all, this wouldn\u2019t be the first time a tech company had been accused of audio surveilling its users without their knowledge or consent. Not only that, but a nearly identical lawsuit concerning Google\u2019s Voice Assistant, filed in the same court and likely to result in a similar settlement, is waiting in the wings.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening with all of these audio devices? Are Amazon and Microsoft listening in as well? And does this all actually constitute a serious breach of privacy?\n\nThe answers to these questions are simultaneously simple and complicated. The experts Vox spoke with to find out more told us that the public outcry over Siri\u2019s data collection may all be much ado about, relatively, nothing.\n\nAh, but it\u2019s the relativity that\u2019s the concerning part. The reason Siri\u2019s data collection may not matter in the bigger picture isn\u2019t because it\u2019s not potentially harmful or unethical.\n\nIt\u2019s because it\u2019s just a drop in the bucket.\n\nWe probably won\u2019t know the extent of Apple\u2019s audio surveillance\n\nThe ongoing anxiety over the potentially invasive practices of large tech companies like Apple and Google may have distorted our understanding of what the Apple lawsuit is about. Alex Hamerstone, a cybersecurity consultant for the security consultancy TrustedSec, told Vox that the lawsuit may be \u201cprojecting a lot of people\u2019s concerns about the overall surveillance state.\u201d\n\nIn other words, what feels like it\u2019s a major referendum \u2014 a chance to hold major tech companies accountable for a major privacy violation \u2014 is really what Hamerstone described as \u201ca niche case.\u201d\n\nThe way Siri and similar smart assistant devices are supposed to work is that you use a \u201cwake phrase\u201d to activate them \u2014 like, \u201cHey, Siri.\u201d The problem is that Apple devices (and, allegedly, those of other tech companies including Google and Amazon) can be activated inadvertently in any number of ways, and users haven\u2019t always known when those activations have occurred. The lawsuit against Apple alleges that not only was its unauthorized listening a deceptive business practice, the impact involved multiple instances in which Apple violated confidentiality laws as well as the privacy of minors. The Guardian\u2019s 2019 investigation reported that Siri had allegedly unlawfully recorded everything from confidential doctor\u2019s visits to illegal drug deals to couples having sex.\n\nIn the Apple lawsuit, claimants point out that Apple, in a 2018 letter to Congress, had stated in no uncertain terms that Siri would never be activated without users\u2019 express consent \u2014 arguably a boldfaced lie. But Apple continued to protest that it hadn\u2019t violated the letter of its privacy contract with consumers. While Apple did acknowledge to the Guardian that it made inadvertent recordings and passed \u201ca small portion\u201d of these unauthorized recordings on to its third-party contractors, it never had to testify in court about whether it sold any of that data to advertisers, which was one of the biggest allegations made by consumers in the class action lawsuit. On January 8, the company updated its website with a statement claiming that \u201cApple has never used Siri data to build marketing profiles, never made it available for advertising, and never sold it to anyone for any purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cSiri has been engineered to protect user privacy from the beginning,\u201d an Apple spokesperson told Vox. \u201cSiri data has never been used to build marketing profiles and it has never been sold to anyone for any purpose. Apple settled this case to avoid additional litigation so we can move forward from concerns about third-party grading that we already addressed in 2019. We use Siri data to improve Siri, and we are constantly developing technologies to make Siri even more private.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a widespread belief that these devices are listening to you,\u201d Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontiers Foundation, told Vox. \u201cPeople think Facebook\u2019s listening to you, all sorts of things are listening to you, and they\u2019re placing ads based upon what they hear.\u201d\n\nAs it stands, we\u2019re not likely to find out the details. As the lawsuit against Apple moved forward, it seemed possible that we would; the court had found as recently as 2021 that \u201cthe targeted advertising claims ... are rendered plausible by the unique nature of oral communications.\u201d In other words, the court was sympathetic to the view that the private conversations you have are unique; it shouldn\u2019t be possible for you to receive advertising based on those conversations unless your privacy has been violated in a major way.\n\nUnder the terms of the proposed settlement, however, Apple doesn\u2019t admit liability \u2014 not for recording users without their explicit consent to begin with, nor for any potential misuse of those recordings. And without a trial to force its hand, the company most likely won\u2019t have to disclose what it did with all that data.\n\n\u201cThe upshot for all of us is that Apple claims that they did get these accidental recordings, and they used them to make the system better, but that they didn\u2019t use it for other things,\u201d Cohn told Vox. \u201cAnd we aren\u2019t going to know the answer to that ... I would say at the end of this case, we\u2019re no closer to learning whether that\u2019s true than we were at the beginning.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that existing US surveillance and technology laws haven\u2019t always kept up with the emergence of \u201csmart\u201d devices. When a similar lawsuit was brought against Samsung and others in 2017 for unlawfully recording its users on its smart TVs, a New Jersey federal court ultimately dismissed it on a technicality \u2014 though the court also seemed skeptical of the ephemeral nature of the suit\u2019s allegations. After the lawsuit was dismissed in 2018, a new civil suit was brought against it; that case is still making its convoluted way through the courts. As for the forthcoming Google lawsuit, it\u2019s so similar to the Apple one that it will likely have a similar outcome.\n\nOne reason it\u2019s hard to pin down tech companies for these types of violations in the legal system is that the nature of laws against, for example, wiretapping rely on an outdated understanding of the tech in question. \u201cSo much information security these days is contractual and regulatory,\u201d Hamerstone told Vox. \u201cThe legislation has not kept up with the speed of technology.\u201d\n\nAnother reason is that it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s been taken from you in this situation; since (as the court noted) Apple was the one in possession of the intercepted recordings, the claimants struggled to articulate what exactly had been intercepted. Cohn noted that Apple had deleted many of the recordings in question, which made it even harder for the lawsuit to move forward effectively.\n\nAnother reason the lawsuit may have faced difficulty is that it\u2019s hard to claim you haven\u2019t consented to having your data collected in one way when you\u2019ve likely unwittingly consented to having it collected in so many others.\n\nYour phone doesn\u2019t need to listen to you\n\nCohn emphasized to Vox that Apple\u2019s insistence that it wasn\u2019t intentionally illegally surveilling users was probably true \u2014 because, after all, why would it need to?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a labor-intensive, compute-expensive thing to do to track us when they\u2019ve got this cornucopia of completely legal, easy to do, low-computational ways of surveilling all of us,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI think people are just unaware of how much of a profile marketers and companies have on each of us and how much data we\u2019re sharing,\u201d Hamerstone told Vox. \u201cGenerally we agree to do it through these end user license agreements ... even if you could get through the legalese, it\u2019s just impossible to read that many words.\u201d Through the use of metadata like cookies on websites, and your daily purchases, media consumption, and behaviors, companies can find out more about you than you ever realized. They can engage in highly complex predictive algorithmic marketing that makes you feel spied upon. Even when you might think you\u2019re just sharing that information in a private conversation that your Alexa just happened to overhear, you could be sharing it in numerous other ways without realizing it.\n\n\u201cEverything is just constantly being collected about us and put in databases,\u201d Hamerstone said. \u201cYour phone doesn\u2019t need to listen to you. It knows what you\u2019re likely to buy and all these other things because of all the other data that we have about everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe good news is your phone probably isn\u2019t listening to you in the way that you\u2019re afraid it is,\u201d Cohn said. \u201cThe bad news is that doesn\u2019t really matter in terms of [marketers\u2019] ability to place these uncanny ads and make you feel like you\u2019re being watched all the time.\u201d\n\nIn case this all makes you feel a bit hunted, you\u2019re not alone; browsers that emphasize privacy control have grown in popularity in recent years. Cohn was adamant that \u201cwe need legal protection and that the onus shouldn\u2019t be on individuals to try to protect themselves\u201d from the ever-encroaching reach of data collection into our lives.\n\n\u201cAll your devices should come with privacy protections that just work and you don\u2019t have to think about it,\u201d Cohn said.\n\nCohn also stressed the need for increased privacy laws, more protections for consumers, and an updated legal system that can more readily handle these types of lawsuits. She pointed out that the Apple lawsuit \u201chad to go through a lot of hoops that it shouldn\u2019t have had to go through\u201d and shouldn\u2019t have taken four years just to result in a settlement.\n\n\u201cWe need a comprehensive privacy law that\u2019s got real teeth that empowers people to sue,\u201d she said.\n\nThe important next step, she said, is to create laws that address not only what the tech companies could be doing with our data, but the invasive things they\u2019re doing already.\n\n\u201cWe need to simplify things for these privacy cases and we need to expand the reach of [the law] to include metadata ... rather than just having these cases where we\u2019re trying to push the edge.\u201d",

Farm Show apple mural\n\nBiglerville students represented the \"core\" of their town's apple industry roots at the state's largest agricultural show for the second time this year.\n\nThat's thanks to the work of numerous Biglerville High School students, who once again created a mural honoring the region's apple industry as part of the State Horticultural Association of Pennsylvania's exhibit at the Pennsylvania Farm Show this week.\n\nIt was the second time the \"Canners\" of Biglerville's Upper Adams School District, named for the town's fruit canning industry, were able to put on display their support for their local industry, after the school's students first created an apple mural for the farm show in 2023.\n\nThis year's mural, designed by senior Haylee Smith, the president of the school's National Art Honors Society, was made out of just under 1,500 apples, said Shawn Heiges, the adviser for the school's National Art Honors Society.\n\nAfter four students from the school's technical education class, taught by teacher Bob Dwyer, built the framework for the mural, 17 students from the school's National Art Honor Society added the apples onto the framework.\n\nIn the years that the mural has been a part of the show, it has become a \"growing\" sensation at the show, even drawing comparisons to the show's legendary butter sculpture.\n\n\"It's super exciting for them,\" said Heiges of the mural's popularity, \"they are really proud of themselves.\"\n\nThe structure of the mural uses nails behind the spots for each apple, where the apples are pressed onto the nails by the students. The framework was first built by Dwyer and Biglerville students for the 2023 farm show, Heiges said.\n\n\"It was really nice to have them all working so great together to put the mural up,\" said Heiges.\n\nBuilding the mural with the almost 1,500 apples took the 17 students just under an hour the day before the show opened, Heiges said.\n\n\"It was good teamwork,\" she said. \"They really hustled.\"\n\nThe nearly 1,500 apples were donated to the mural by the Rice Fruit Company, based in Gardners, Heiges said.\n\nThe design was \"a little competition\" among the art students, Heiges said, where students used photocopies of a graphic that had little circles designated for each possible spot of an apple on the framework, then filled those circles in with colored pencils to create their designs.\n\nNAHS president Smith's winning design featured the state of Pennsylvania created with green apples. Inside of the state, red apples were used to create an image of an apple, along with text. Four different kinds of apples were used for the mural, Heiges said.\n\nThe project was a natural one for Biglerville students, who are surrounded with the state's apple industry in northern Adams County.\n\n\"The apple industry is a huge part of this whole community,\" said Heiges, \"there's so many orchards around here, and there's so many families who have had generations involved in the orchards.\"\n\nEllie Hollabaugh Vranich, of one of those local orchards, Hollabaugh Bros., is a member of the State Horticultural Association of Pennsylvania, and was the liaison to the school on the project, said Heiges.\n\n\"The Hollabaughs have been in the orchards for a long time,\" said Heiges, noting the company has been deeply involved in the community and supporting projects like this one.\n\nIn a post on the orchard's page, the business thanked the school district for their involvement.\n\n\"Special thanks to the Upper Adams School District and its students and staff for supporting the design and creation of the mural to represent the PA Apple industry at the farm show!\" read the post.",

            "content": "Apple (AAPL -0.11%) and Microsoft (MSFT -1.90%) are two of the biggest rivals in tech. And today, they're both spending heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) as their rivalry evolves into yet another chapter.\n\nThey are among the most highly valued stocks in the world with market caps in excess of $3 trillion. Apple is ahead today, but which stock ends up more valuable in the next five or 10 years could ultimately depend on which business has the better AI strategy.\n\nIn 2024, Apple's stock rose by 30% as it outperformed Microsoft, which increased by just 12% in value. But which AI stock is likely to be the better buy in 2025 and beyond: Apple or Microsoft?\n\nThe case for Microsoft\n\nThere are 1.6 billion devices running Windows in the world. It's a staggering number of machines and it's the big reason why Microsoft can be a big winner in AI. It has many customers already using its software in the corporate world. If the company can develop Copilot into the next big subscription service, that has the potential to be a massive growth catalyst for the business in the long run.\n\nCopilot is still in its early innings but it has an advantage over ChatGPT and other AI offerings because it is added within products like Word and Excel. Users can easily access the AI right within their daily workflows without going to a separate site or launching a new application. It can help with forecasting sales and profit numbers for accountants in Excel, or creating presentations and ads in PowerPoint. The potential for synergies and efficiencies due to Copilot is why investors shouldn't overlook the massive opportunity this is for Microsoft.\n\nIt may take some time for Microsoft to develop Copilot into what it needs to be for organizations to justify having all their users subscribed to it, but if it happens, it could add billions in revenue for Microsoft and unlock a big growth opportunity for years to come.\n\nThe case for Apple\n\nThere are 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world that the company could offer its AI services. Apple has been slower in rolling out its AI strategy, which is why it may still have more of an untapped opportunity than Microsoft. Apple hasn't wowed users at this stage, nor has it really disappointed them. Many Apple Intelligence features are still set to come in 2025, including new Siri features that will help users find messages and send files and photos more easily.\n\nAs the company offers more AI-powered services on its devices, that could serve as a significant catalyst, propelling more users to upgrade their phones and tablets to ensure they're not missing out on the latest features and capabilities.\n\nPlus, there's the opportunity for Apple to offer AI-related subscription services, which could unlock even more revenue-generating opportunities. Some analysts have estimated that the company could charge as much as $20 per month for advanced AI features. With Apple targeting a more affluent customer base, there may also be less resistance from its users in paying for greater functionality.\n\nWhich stock should AI users invest in?\n\nApple was the better stock to own in 2024 and I think the story will play out the same this year and over the long term. The company is taking a slower, more cautious approach with AI. That can be a better strategy as Apple can better evaluate which features its users want, and which ones it may not want to spend time and money developing.\n\nAnd while Microsoft may have a lot of potential business customers to tap into thanks to the wide reach of Windows, that may involve a bigger hurdle. Companies would need to justify spending $30 a month per user whereas Apple could get a boost from simply convincing users to upgrade their devices.\n\nBoth of these companies could benefit significantly from AI-related revenue, but Apple may have a clearer and easier path to that growth than Microsoft, which is why it looks to be the better AI stock to own today.",

The code also suggests that the app will integrate with iCloud, with a web version on iCloud.com also a possibility.\n\nThe app apparently taps into Apple's previously unused GroupKit daemon, which handles database models for groups of people. Little else is known about the app \u2013 it could be standalone, or it could be an integration with existing apps. Whatever it is, the Invites app sounds like it will offer more event-related features than those found in Calendar, which currently manages event invites through a rather simplistic interface.\n\nThe beta code references reportedly first appeared in one of the iOS 18.2 betas, before being removed from the final release. Now they're back in iOS 18.3 beta 2, but that doesn't guarantee that Apple will release the app. The company could just be experimenting with an idea that is ultimately nixed from iOS 18.3, or Apple could decide to hold it over for a succeeding software update.\n\nApple seeded the second betas of iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3 to developers on Tuesday for testing purposes. There are no new Apple Intelligence features in the updates, which will likely focus primarily on bugs and small software refinements. Additional Apple Intelligence functionality is coming in later iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 updates.",

Apple rival Google\u2019s Pixel phones are banned for not meeting the 40% rule either, hindering smartphone sales in one of the world\u2019s most populous countries.\n\nApple had proposed building a $1 billion plant to make its AirTag tracking device in partnership with a local company, the FT report said.

More important to financial, legal, accounting, consulting, and other business services companies is having top quality, turnkey space,\u201d the report states. \u201cSpeculative suites have been a successful landlord strategy to lure tenants given the exorbitant costs of construction and protracted time lines.\u201d\n\nThe investment management company said there are no general office projects under construction in Seattle, so that could mean the market has reached peak vacancy.\n\n\"Could this be a turning point in the market where companies are coming back to Seattle or choosing to move to the city compared to Bellevue, for example?\" KOMO's Jackie Kent asked.\n\n\"As Bellevue's started to fill up, we expect to see the pendulum swinging back into Seattle and that's led by the tech industry and the employers,\" Blankenship responded. \"It's a positive change and we embrace it.\"\n\n\u201cLike Microsoft, Amazon, and the more than 100 companies with engineering outposts in the region, Apple seeks to tap into our outstanding tech talent pool,\" said Rachel Smith, president and CEO of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce. \"While about 30% of Seattle\u2019s office space remains vacant - a number we need to drive down by making it easy and desirable to start or expand a business - the news of Apple\u2019s expansion paired with Amazon employees returning to the office Jan. 1 gives me a sense of optimism that our region's future continues to be bright.\"\n\nALSO SEE |\n\nThis is a developing story.

He replaced Luca Maestri, who announced last year that he was planning to step down as the company\u2019s finance chief after more than 10 years in the post.\n\n\u201cWe think Parekh will continue Maestri\u2019s playbook and this should be good news for Apple shareholders,\u201d William Kerwin, equity analyst for Morningstar Research Services, said in an email. \u201cIn terms of challenges, we think maintaining profit expansion in the face of antitrust headwinds that could impact services revenues will be a key focus.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe finance leadership change comes as Apple is closing in on a $4 trillion stock market valuation amid artificial intelligence investments that have boosted sluggish iPhone sales, Reuters recently reported.\n\nThe tech giant posted $94.9 billion in revenues for its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter ended Sept. 28, an increase of 6% over the year-earlier period, according to results released on Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cThe level of intensity that we're putting into AI has increased a lot, and you maybe don't see the full extent of it because we've also had some internal reallocation of the base of engineering resources that we have within the company,\u201d Maestri said in an earnings call at the time.\n\nMaestri oversaw a period of tremendous margin expansion for Apple, along with rising leverage towards the firm\u2019s goal of being net cash neutral longer-term, according to Kerwin.\n\n\u201cWe expect both of these trends to continue under Parekh and predict continuity in Apple\u2019s strategy in the transition,\u201d he said.\n\nMaestri will stay on at Apple as leader of the company\u2019s corporate services teams, including information systems, technology, information security and real estate development, reporting directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook, the company said last year in a press release announcing its finance leadership transition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fortunate that we will continue to benefit from the leadership and insight that have been the hallmark of [Maestri\u2019s] tenure at the company,\u201d Cook said in the release.\n\nHe added that Parekh\u2019s \u201csharp intellect, wise judgment, and financial brilliance make him the perfect choice to be Apple\u2019s next CFO.\u201d\n\nParekh has served at Apple for more than a decade. Prior to his role as head of FP&A, he led worldwide sales, retail, and marketing finance, according to the release. He began his tenure leading the financial support of Apple\u2019s product marketing, internet sales and services, and engineering teams.\n\nBefore joining Apple, Parekh held various senior leadership roles at Thomson Reuters and General Motors.\n\nThe Friday announcement comes just on the heels of the company\u2019s agreement to pay $95 million to settle a proposed class action lawsuit alleging that its voice-activated digital assistant Siri violated users' privacy, as reported by Bloomberg Law.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple is also facing an antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice claiming the company has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe Trial Balance is CFO.com\u2019s weekly preview of stories, stats and events to help you prepare.\n\nPart 1 \u2014 Apple\u2019s new CFO, an internal promotion, gets started\n\nKevan Parekh, now the new CFO at Apple, is just days into what is likely one of the most challenging jobs in corporate finance. However, Parekh\u2019s nearly dozen years of experience working for the company throughout the FP&A function, as evidenced by the confidence bestowed upon him by Apple CEO Tim Cook and the board, has prepared him for his first executive leadership position.\n\nParekh\u2019s predecessor, Luca Maestri, who has been rumored to be pursuing a CEO role, had CFO experience before joining Apple in 2013. But as data and financial strategy become increasingly important \u2014 particularly in Apple\u2019s case as it strives to remain at the forefront of global consumer tech offerings \u2014 the company chose to promote an internal hire who likely has a deep understanding of the business from a planning and analysis perspective.\n\nParekh worked as director of FP&A at Apple in 2020 and was promoted to vice president of FP&A in 2023. Both Maestri and Parekh worked at GM Europe in the mid-2000s, with Maestri as CFO and Parekh as a regional treasurer.\n\n\u201cHe knew how to turn it into a competitive advantage,\u201d wrote Wouter Born, general partner at Born Capital and an FP&A advisor to CFOs, in a LinkedIn post. \u201cHis rise highlights a growing trend. Today\u2019s most impactful CFOs don\u2019t just protect value. They create it.\u201d\n\nThough Parekh was likely hired for his ability to communicate data and develop strategic initiatives based on it, his hands are full. The company has faced increased global competition in the cellphone market, backlash over its AI initiative and data security partnership with OpenAI, stagnation in its CarPlay software, struggles in gaming initiatives and the decline and underwhelming performances from credit card partnerships.\n\nParekh will also likely have a role in shaping shareholder confidence around Apple\u2019s strategic plans. As a result of the aforementioned challenges, many have said Apple is overvalued, leading institutional investors like Berkshire Hathaway to shed the stock in recent years.\n\nPart 1 \u2014 This week\n\nHere\u2019s a list of important market events slated for the week ahead.\n\nMonday, Jan. 6\n\nTuesday, Jan. 7\n\nWednesday, Jan. 8\n\nThursday, Jan. 9\n\nFriday, Jan. 10\n\nPart 3 \u2014 New budgeting growth tools, Metric of the Month, Revvity CFO Q&A\n\nThis week, CFO.com will publish a story on zero-based budgeting as a strategic growth tool (1/7), a new edition of the Metric of the Month series on the cost of financial management (1/8) and a Q&A with Revvity CFO Max Krakowiak (1/9).",

            "content": "It's not true that Apple has always shunned the Consumer Electronics Show, but in 2025 it is yet again the most dominant company at the event, despite not being there.\n\nApple's disregard of CES is so well known that it was headline news in 2020 when it was claimed that the company was attending it again. But Apple didn't exhibit anything, didn't launch anything, and it didn't have a stand.\n\nIt was only there to take a stance instead.\n\nIn that 2020 CES, Apple's then senior director of global privacy, took part in a panel on the subject. Jane Horvath said everything you would expect Apple's privacy chief to say, and then the panel was over.\n\nSo with no offense to Horvath or CES, this was not Apple really attending the show in 2020. It was the firm's head of privacy doing the rounds of talks and panels on her subject.\n\nApple did exhibit at CES\n\nYou actually have to go back to the early '90s to find when Apple bothered to show up to CES properly. John Sculley unveiled the Newton MessagePad at the May 1992 version in Chicago. We all know how that ended up.\n\nIt didn't seem so at the time, it instead seemed like Apple making a hugely successful announcement. But Sculley announced it far, far too early.\n\nThis is actually key to why Apple will not attend CES \u2014 and why it ceased attending Macworld Expo after 2009. That's also why Macworld Expo died, after limping on for five further years.\n\nFrom Apple's perspective, it no longer wanted to be tied to another firm's or another event's timetable for its announcements.\n\nThere would be no repeats of the Newton announcement and no launches, until Apple was ready \u2014 or that was the theory. In practice, Apple made an early announcement of its AirPower charging device in 2017, and but ultimately cancelled the whole project.\n\nOther than that peculiar misstep and the odd early sneak peek at devices such as the iMac Pro, Apple has been working to its own schedule.\n\nIt helps that over time, and certainly by the end of the 2010s, Apple was also big enough that it simply didn't need other firms' events.\n\nOvershadowing CES\n\nBut if it's decades since Apple exhibited at CES, there has not been a single show in recent years that was not replete with products related to Apple. Or, filled with products that were competing with Apple, sometimes quite desperately.\n\nEven as recently as CES 2024, there were VR and AR headsets aplenty, and nobody cared because the Apple Vision Pro was coming.\n\nThat said, headsets had failed to get many people caring even when there was no sign of Apple entering the market. There's a bit of an argument that people still aren't fussed about headsets.\n\nA similar thing is going on with CES 2025 and the Circular Ring. It's a smart ring that now includes health features such as an ECG, but hanging over it is the specter of an Apple Smart Ring.\n\nThere isn't even an Apple Smart Ring, Apple has not announced one \u2014 although it has filed for many patents on the idea. But still, there's a sense of a company trying to get a foothold in the market before Apple takes it over.\n\nIf you can't beat them, accessorize them\n\nMore directly and immediately tying their business to Apple, is the slew of companies producing accessories for the iPhone and other devices. Eli Health has released a hormone testing kit for the iPhone, for instance, while Hyper and Targus have launched a slew of cases, hubs, and backpacks.\n\nMany of those, especially the backpacks, could of course be used to carry any company's devices. But the HyperPack case comes complete with an integrated tracker that works with Apple's Find My.\n\nThen other firms, such as Moft, have now launched stands for the iPhone \u2014 and which also work with Find My.\n\nAnd even when there doesn't seem to be an Apple connection, there is. SwitchBot is using CES 2025 to launch its new K20+ Pro robot vacuum cleaner \u2014 and it integrates with Siri.\n\nSo do the new Lutron Caseta window shades. Withings' new Omnia smart mirror may use its own sensors, but it comes with an iPhone app that integrates with Apple's Health one.\n\nIf Apple builds it, they will come\n\nBy now in 2025, with over two billion iPhones active in the world, and the company exceeding $3 trillion in value, the sheer volume of Apple devices is able to distort CES. If Apple supports a certain technology standard in its devices, that standard is suddenly vastly more attractive to other firms.\n\nThis year that's perhaps most visible with Thunderbolt 5. That connectivity standard was co-developed by Intel and a host of partners including Apple, but it's needed Apple to make it mainstream.\n\nApple's newest MacBook Pro models and the M4 Pro Mac mini support Thunderbolt 5 and its ability to provide up to 240W power, and up to 120Gb/s data transfer speeds. Thunderbolt 5 existed before these Macs, but CES 2025 is showing off new compatible docks from the likes of Targus and Ugreen.\n\nApple and CES\n\nCES needs Apple and the organizing body knows it. Apple's massive user base means a massive list of companies looking to fulfill needs and perhaps to ride on the coattails of the iPhone manufacturer.\n\nThere's a strong argument that if Apple needed CES, it would show up. But each firm that tries to tack on to Apple's devices with its own accessories, is also bolstering the market for Apple's products.\n\nAnd then firms that are trying to sell VR headsets or smart rings are always compared to Apple, or they're claiming with wishful thinking that Apple will never be a competitor. So even they, with no connection to any Apple device, are constantly giving Apple free publicity.\n\nPerhaps this will change some day, and perhaps Apple will decide it needs to exhibit at CES. But for now, Apple is so big that it casts a shadow over the entire Consumer Electronics Show without even trying.",

The money received depends on how many valid claims are filed, according to the settlement.\n\nPlaintiffs in the case estimated total damages to the class exceeded $1.5 billion, but they agreed to settle the lawsuit because obtaining \u201cthe total damages at trial would be a challenge, given Apple\u2019s denial of liability,\u201d the settlement said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe settlement is pending approval from U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White.",

            "content": "A perfect storm of economic challenges is pushing Washington apple farmers out of business.\n\nSmall orchardists say they are unable to sustain losses for years on end amid economic conditions they feel will only continue to worsen. The closures are fueling a wave of private equity-backed farmland consolidation.\n\nThe trend is the result of an ever-constricting web of factors. They include rising labor costs and stagnant prices paid to farmers, but also dramatic apple oversupply caused by increased farm efficiency and the loss of major international markets due to then-President Donald Trump\u2019s 2018 tariffs.\n\nThose converging conditions afflict farmers who produce Washington\u2019s most valuable crop, which supplies nearly 7 in 10 apples eaten around the U.S. and is worth about $2 billion a year.\n\nConsolidation\n\nFollowing in his father and grandfather\u2019s footsteps, Tim Calhoun runs a midsized orchard and fruit distribution company in the Yakima Basin near Wapato.\n\nThe area is home to about a third of Washington\u2019s 188,000 acres of apple orchards. Neat rows blur into the distance, where Mount Rainier\u2019s foothills rise up to meet a sky that\u2019s almost always blue.\n\nWalking through his family\u2019s orchard at the end of the last harvest in October, Calhoun, 41, explained the industry is in the worst spot he has ever seen it.\n\n\u201cWhy the larger companies keep getting larger and larger and larger and larger is because the margins in farming are shrinking every year for the last 40 years,\u201d he said.\n\nSince his family started farming the site in 1969, the operation has steadily grown to keep up, increasing from roughly a dozen acres to 170 \u2014 which is about the size of 130 football fields. The operation has also expanded into pears, cherries, peaches and other fruits, as well as the distribution business.\n\nThe Calhoun family acquired acreage plot by plot as neighbors left farming. Some were older orchardists who retired but didn\u2019t have kids who wanted to take over. Others sold because they couldn\u2019t ride out the economic slumps the industry has experienced in the last half-century.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve grown up doing this, I\u2019ve seen multiple rounds of downturns,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cJust on my 1-mile road, there used to be, when I was a kid, probably over 20 different family farms. And now, there\u2019s probably only three farms on this whole road \u2014 all owned by different companies.\u201d\n\nAlthough Calhoun emphasized he respects the success of the remaining large family-run operations, he said the current wave of closures is different exactly because of that consolidation.\n\nThe massive scale now required to make a profit is unattainable to all but the biggest operations, he said. Many of those are backed by some of the world\u2019s largest private equity companies to help them survive bad years that small competitors just can\u2019t.\n\nWith many of Calhoun\u2019s peers losing money on each bin of apples they sell to distribution warehouses year after year, he said a wave of bankruptcies is looming.\n\nThe most recent agricultural census data shows Calhoun\u2019s fear is already reality.\n\nA staggering 187 Washington apple farms closed between 2017 and 2022, with 2,335 remaining. Operations smaller than 50 acres were hit especially hard. Both total apple acreage and the average size of an orchard expanded.\n\nPrices and pressures\n\nBehind that economic bloodbath is an increasingly tough market for even the biggest producers.\n\n\u201cThe price that we\u2019re getting paid is the same or lower than we got paid in the \u201990s,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cSo our cost basis for producing that apple has gone up tenfold, but the apple itself is not being sold for tenfold what it was.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Washington producers received an average of 34 cents for each pound of apples they produced in the 1990s, inflation adjusted USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service data shows. Apples wholesaled for 27 cents per pound in 2023.\n\nExperts also said the rising cost of producing apples is a key driver of the crisis, but that no one factor was to blame.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been, especially in the last three or so years, kind of a perfect storm,\u201d said Michael Schadler, president of the Washington Apple Commission.\n\nIn that time, an oversupply of apples dropped prices, inflation raised how much it costs to grow and ship them, labor costs jumped, and stagnant demand for Washington\u2019s hallmark crop from the public topped it all off, Schadler said.\n\n\u201cLabor accounts for about 60% of all the operational costs,\u201d said Karina Gallardo, an economics professor at Washington State University who focuses on agriculture. \u201cBack in 2009, this percentage was about 45%.\u201d\n\nNew technologies and mostly reliable water supplies have allowed producers to expand the regions where they grow, contributing to oversupply, said Jon DeVaney, president of the Washington State Tree Fruit Association.\n\nAnd even the trees themselves are more efficient than ever.\n\n\u201cWe went from having low-density planting with 400, 500 trees per acre with big trees with big canopies, to the more sophisticated and more modern tree fruit walls, which can have 1,800, 2,000 trees per acre,\u201d Gallardo said.\n\nThat has driven up yields per acre in recent decades, in turn boosting total production, according to USDA data.\n\nExports dip\n\nHistorically, when oversupply threatened to drop prices, the international export market served as a pressure release valve for Washington producers to unload any overabundance, Gallardo said.\n\nBut that all came to a crashing halt in 2018 when Trump announced tariffs on India and China.\n\nTariffs are a tax applied to imports from other countries, intended to encourage domestic production over imports.\n\nAnd while the move might have left U.S. steel producers in a better spot, the countries fired back with retaliatory tariffs that all but ended apple exports to two of Washington\u2019s biggest markets, Gallardo, DeVaney and Schadler each explained.\n\n\u201cIn the end, the big loser is going to be the country or the producers in the country who are not able to allocate their product to the export destination,\u201d said Gallardo, who co-authored an analysis of the tariffs\u2019 impacts.\n\nThat\u2019s easy to see in export data.\n\nBetween the 2010-11 harvest and the 2017-18 harvest, an average of 33% of Washington\u2019s apple crop was exported, Washington Apple Commission data shows.\n\nBut the number fell to 27% on average from the 2018-19 to the 2023-24 harvests.\n\nThat 6% amounted to an extra 310 million pounds of apples on average each year, bloating the U.S. market and tanking prices. Some estimates say more.\n\nVicious cycle\n\nIn a cruel twist, the resulting small farm closures have fueled a vicious cycle.\n\nThat\u2019s because they open the door for regional agricultural giants to buy more and more land with the backing of a near-endless pot of money from global financial goliaths like Goldman Sachs.\n\nAnd the more land they own, the more efficiently they can operate and the less profit they need per apple. That enables large producers to accept prices lower than a small farmer can, DeVaney said.\n\nThe giants also have the advantages of being able to survive years of losses, as well as make costly upgrades, DeVaney said.\n\nWhile the crisis hitting apple farmers is complicated, its consequences are simple: Dozens of small Washington farmers are losing everything to agribusinesses backed by some of the largest companies to ever exist.\n\nApple farming, once a way for families east of the Cascades to build economic security, now leaves them drowning in debt.\n\nSearching for hope\n\n\u201cGuys can dip into their savings and dip into lines of credit and everything, but at some point if that doesn\u2019t turn around,\u201d Calhoun said, \u201cit\u2019s either sell your farm or go bankrupt, or bulldoze your orchard, or just quit \u2014 because you just can\u2019t sustain losses year over year.\n\n\u201cFarming\u2019s always gone in waves and cycles,\u201d he added, \u201cbut there\u2019s not a bright light at the end of this cycle to see where you\u2019re going to come out the other side.\u201d\n\nOne family he knows is bulldozing 180 acres of apples to cut costs and enable them to focus on cherries and apricots, which are more profitable crops.\n\nAgriculture has always relied on hope just as much as water, sun, soil and sweat, but Calhoun said people are having to dig increasingly deep to find it.\n\nEven the celebrated arrival of Washington\u2019s Cosmic Crisp apple \u2014 which the New York Times dubbed \u201cthe most promising and important apple of the future\u201d in 2015 \u2014 hasn\u2019t played out like the industry hoped.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t lived up to the hype. The apple itself has, the apple is an incredible apple, but the returns that we thought we were going to get on this apple have been minuscule at best,\u201d Calhoun said.\n\nAs he walked along neatly trellised rows of the scarlet apples, he said he spent at least $150,000 planting them only years earlier.\n\nCalhoun was just paid for his 2023 Cosmic Crisp crop: about $6.95 for each 900-pound bin that retailed for roughly $2,691.\n\nBut while he isn\u2019t afraid to acknowledge the severity of the crisis, Calhoun can\u2019t seem to dwell on it too long.\n\n\u201cThe joke in farming is, \u2018Next year will always be better,\u2019 and that\u2019s the lie we tell ourselves every year, whether it\u2019s true or not. It\u2019s a lifestyle, if you didn\u2019t love the lifestyle, you couldn\u2019t do any kind of farming,\u201d he said.\n\nThat love of farming and the lifestyle it provides him and his family, maybe even more than hope, seems to keep him going in the face of the industry\u2019s increasingly dependable crisis.\n\nA moment later, Calhoun hustled to his small cold-storage building to load apples into the back of a farmers market operator\u2019s truck before the sun set.",

Credit: Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nApple is slowly doling out more and more AI features to iPhone users, but it's coming at a price.\n\nIn just the last few months, the internal storage requirements to install Apple Intelligence on a supported Apple device (be it an iPhone, iPad, or Mac) have nearly doubled from the initial investment. According to a notice on Apple's website (spotted by 9to5Mac), installing Apple Intelligence on your device now requires 7GB of storage space.\n\nFor context, the initial rollout of Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.1 only carried a 4GB install size. Ever since the iOS 18.2 update added more features like Genmoji to the mix, the storage requirement has ballooned in size. As Apple keeps adding onto Apple Intelligence in the future, don't be surprised if the commitment continues to increase. The oldest iPhone that can run Apple Intelligence is the iPhone 15 Pro, which starts with 128GB of internal storage.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

You either get none of them or you get all of them.\n\nFor many, this won't be an issue. Not everyone fills up their camera rolls or Apple Music download queues, so not everyone is bumping up against the storage limits on their devices all the time.

No matter what, growth will likely depend on rising services revenues this year as well, which has been the case for quite some time.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the new iPhone and MacBook Air offerings, Apple is also reportedly working on a smart home display product known as its Command Center, as well as the next iteration of its AirTag tracking device.\n\nAn updated Mac Studio, Mac Pro and Apple TV 4K are all expected sometime during the first half of 2025, along with new versions of the company\u2019s AirPods, Apple Watch and Vision Pro headset, the report said.\n\n\u201cWhile products like the AirTag or Vision Pro might be more cool than moving the financial needle, I view these new products as helping to further the brand\u2019s moat, which at the end of the day helps to continue the growth in services revenues,\u201d said Julian Lin, investing group leader for Best Of Breed Growth Stocks.\n\nThe news comes as Apple is approaching a $4 trillion valuation based on the company\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) efforts. The tech giant\u2019s stock surged by 16% late last year as investors banked on AI-enhanced versions of the iPhones.

            "content": "Apple (AAPL -0.11%) is one the world's largest publicly traded companies, with a market cap of $3.7 trillion and it continues to attract investor attention as it slowly steps into new areas of innovation, like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe tech stock easily outpaced the S&P 500 over the past three years, gaining 37% compared to the index's nearly 24% gains (as of this writing). Still, given its already massive size, some investors will wonder if this giant has enough innovation left to continue putting up impressive returns. So let's take a look at the case for buying, holding, or selling Apple this year.\n\nIs there a case for buying Apple?\n\nApple offers investors an opportunity to ride some of the biggest tech waves, such as (like AI) without as much of the risk of the types of big share price swings some smaller stocks experience. Apple introduces new features and services methodically. It often takes a slower approach than some rivals, but ultimately benefits immensely from using this approach.\n\nFor example, Apple launched several new services (Apple Arcade, Apple TV+, Apple News+, and Apple Card) in 2019. In the first nine months of 2024, its services segment brought in $96 billion in sales.\n\nHowever, skeptics have accurately pointed out that Apple hasn't introduced a new must-have device with mass appeal in years. Adding to the case against buying Apple is that its stock is relatively expensive right now, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 33.6, compared to the S&P 500's forward ratio of 23.4.\n\nI don't think it's a terrible idea to own Apple if you're looking for a slow-growth tech giant that still has the potential to introduce new products and services, but you're probably not missing out on too much potential right now if you opt to not buy the stock.\n\nThe case for holding Apple\n\nI already own some Apple stock, so I've thought plenty about the case for holding onto it. While there may not be a compelling case for some investors to buy Apple now, I think there's one reason it's worth keeping them in your portfolio: artificial intelligence.\n\nThe industry is in the early stages of the artificial intelligence era, and Apple could eventually benefit from the technology. It recently introduced Apple Intelligence on its latest devices, a suite of tools and services that helps users with an array of tasks such as writing emails, summarizing notifications, and keeping track of their appointments. Apple's AI can even hand a user's query off to ChatGPT if it can't handle a request itself.\n\nIt's still unclear how Apple will make money from this, aside from giving users a new reason to upgrade their old iPhones. Apple might also eventually wrap its AI into its services subscription, charging people for access to the most advanced features. There has also been some chatter around the idea that Apple Intelligence could eventually be paired with a user's choice of an AI chatbot such as ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude, and that Apple would then take a cut when its users upgraded to a premium AI service.\n\nThe point is that Apple rarely gets left behind over the long haul when it comes to new market opportunities, so I'm holding onto some of my Apple stock to see where the company goes with its AI pursuits.\n\nThe case for selling Apple\n\nWhen it comes to the question of whether or not you should sell Apple, the answer will in part be personal to each investor.\n\nThere are a few standard legitimate reasons for selling any stock:\n\nThe investment thesis you had for the company when you bought the stock no longer applies.\n\nThe company is being acquired.\n\nYou need the money.\n\nYou want to rebalance your portfolio.\n\nYou've identified better investment opportunities.\n\nThough I would keep some shares, too, I've considered selling some of my Apple shares for the last reason on that list. I'm bullish about Apple benefiting from AI, but there are clearly many fast-growing tech companies that are benefiting much more from it right now.\n\nIf you own some Apple stock, take a look at the list above and ask yourself if any of those reasons apply to your personal investment strategy. Aside from the company being bought (which Apple certainly isn't in danger of), the reasons for selling will mostly come down to personal preferences based on your investment strategy and financial needs.",

            "content": "Other Good iPads\n\nPhotograph: Apple\n\nApple no longer sells these iPads, but these slightly older models are still good options, as long as you can find them for the right discount. I recommend checking third-party retailers (like Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H). I also suggest cross-checking the price with the latest models to make sure you're spending a fair amount less on the older tablet. Older models not mentioned here are increasingly hard to find and might not be worth it.\n\niPad Pro (2022, 6th Gen): These iPad Pro tablets (7/10, WIRED Review) use the same M2 chip that's inside the MacBook Air (2022), Mac Mini, and iPad Air (2024). It also has an excellent mini-LED screen (with a 120-Hz screen refresh rate) along with a dual camera system (with a lidar sensor), a front-facing camera with support for Center Stage, as well as great speakers and mics. It's compatible with the original Magic Keyboard case, second-generation Apple Pencil, and Apple Pencil with USB-C. I only recommend it if you can find the 11-inch for $749 or less and the 12.9-inch for $900 or less.\n\niPad Air (2022, 5th Gen): This iPad Air has an M1 processor (which can also be found in the 2020 MacBook Air), a 10.9-inch LCD screen, a USB-C port, Touch ID built into the top power button, and support for 5G. It's a great, lightweight tablet that's plenty powerful for most tasks. It packs support for the second-generation Apple Pencil, Apple Pencil with USB-C, and the Magic Keyboard case. I only recommend it for $450 or less.\n\nGreat iPad Accessories\n\nZugu Case Photograph: Zugu\n\niPad accessories are endless. Below, we've highlighted some of our favorites to round out your tablet experience, and you can find more in our Best iPad Accessories guide.\n\nZugu Case for $50: This is our favorite folio case for the iPad for multiple reasons. It's not only durable (complete with a rigid bumper), it also has a magnetized cover that stays shut and a flap that allows you to position the screen at eight different angles. The case is magnetic, allowing you to stick it on the fridge securely. It's also reasonably priced, comes in an array of colors, and has a spot for your Apple Pencil.\n\nSatechi M1 Wireless Mouse for $30: We're already big fans of Satechi's accessories at WIRED, and this mouse didn't disappoint. It has a comfortable ergonomic design, a sleek aluminum finish, and smooth scrolling. It has great battery life too\u2014with a built-in lithium-ion battery, I've been using it for the past four months and have yet to charge it.\n\nMageasy CoverBuddy Case (iPad Pro) for $65: This case allows you to magnetically connect it to Apple's Magic Keyboard case without having to take off the case each time. It feels durable and doesn't add too much bulk to the iPad. There's also a slot for the Apple Pencil Pro or the USB-C version. The company also offers the CoverBuddy Lite for the iPad Air (M2).\n\nPhotograph: Brenda Stolyar\n\nLogitech Combo Touch (10th-Gen) for $160: The Combo Touch (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a built-in keyboard, trackpad, and kickstand, making it ideal for getting work done on your iPad. It's also detachable, so you can easily remove the keyboard when you don't need it. It connects via Apple's Smart Connector, meaning you never need to tinker with Bluetooth or bother charging it. It's also available for the iPad Pro (M4) (although it does add a bit of weight to such a thin tablet) and the iPad Air (M2).\n\nCasetify Impact Screen Protector for $56: If you're worried about damaging your iPad screen, I recommend this protector from Casetify. It's super thin, has excellent touch sensitivity, and is mostly fingerprint-resistant (I've wiped some smudges here and there). It's painless to apply\u2014the company supplies a microfiber cloth, a de-dusting sticker, and wet and dry wipes.\n\nPaperlike Charcoal Folio Case for $70: Paperlike is known for its screen protector, but the company also offers a great case. It's designed to feel like a sketchbook, complete with a polyester fabric cover that feels lightweight and high-quality. You can also prop your iPad up at two different levels. It doesn't come with an Apple Pencil slot, but there is a large flap closure that keeps it from falling out. I tested it with the iPad Air, but it's also available for the iPad Pro (both sizes).\n\nStayGo Mini Photograph: Twelve South\n\nTwelve South StayGo Mini USB-C Hub for $60: Ports are limited regardless of the iPad model. This hub from Twelve South has an 85-watt USB-C port with passthrough charging, a USB-A port, an HDMI, and a headphone jack. If you have trouble fitting it on an iPad with a case, the included socket-USB-C-to-plug-USB-C cable will fix this.\n\nApple Magic Trackpad 2 for $128: For a spacious trackpad, the Magic Trackpad 2 is a great choice. Instead of physical buttons, it has Force Touch sensors where you can feel different levels of pressure on the pad. With support for various iPadOS gestures, you won't have to touch the screen as much. It automatically pairs with your iPad via Bluetooth and recharges with the Lightning port.\n\nLogitech K380 Bluetooth Keyboard for $40: If you prefer an external keyboard, it's hard to go wrong with the Logitech K380. It's lightweight and portable and can be connected to up to three devices via Bluetooth (with dedicated buttons to switch between them). The keyboard is powered by AAA batteries, which lasted us around four months, so you don't have to worry about carrying a charger around.\n\nTwelve South HoverBar Duo 2.0 for $80: The HoverBar serves two purposes. You can mount it to the side of your bed, kitchen counter, or shelf (to view content comfortably and hands-free) or you can use the included stand at your desk. With the 2nd-gen version, you can now remove the arm from the clamp and attach it directly to the stand\u2014making it easier to swap between both modes.",

Some of the devices Apple stopped selling this year have been controversial during their lifespan, so we thought we\u2019d take one last look back.\n\nHere, we\u2019ll cover all of the most controversial products that Apple stopped selling in 2024.\n\nFineWoven cases\n\nImage source: Jos\u00e9 Adorno for BGR\n\nApple\u2019s leather case replacement was a flop. The FineWoven products were controversial, and the company quickly addressed this issue by removing the iPhone cases from store shelves and rebranding the other FineWoven products to avoid more backlash. Nevertheless, users can still get FineWoven Wallets and Apple Watch bands.\n\nUnfortunately, Apple didn\u2019t come up with an alternative. Instead, its subsidiary Beats released a plastic case for the iPhone 16. They\u2019re great, but not as good as the leather versions.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

While they have beautiful construction, impressive sound quality, and all the features that make AirPods so magical, they never sold as well as Apple wanted.\n\nFor four years, customers waited for a second iteration of these headphones. Instead, they got a USB-C version with almost the same features (other than support for wired listening). While AirPods Max are still superb, they\u2019re steeped in controversy: They\u2019re heavy, the carrying case isn\u2019t practical, and they lack proper Find My capabilities, Lossless support, and more.\n\niPhone 15 Pro\n\nImage source: Christian de Looper for BGR\n\nHow can the best iPhone of the year also be the worst? Apple\u2019s iPhone 15 Pro was controversial from the beginning: It lacked an important camera feature available on the iPhone 15 Pro Max, had terrible battery life, and most of the issues concerned the A17 Pro chip.\n\nWhile it had a revolutionary 3nm processor, it constantly overheated. Even with several software updates, users complained about how this device handled heavier tasks. Apple discontinued this device after it released the iPhone 16 Pro model. However, the first iPhone with Apple Intelligence was one of the worst the company ever released.\n\nM2 iPad Pro\n\nAfter an impressive M1 iPad Pro release, the M2 iteration was quite meh. No one can say this device wasn\u2019t powerful enough. However, its accessories would drain its battery when it wasn\u2019t in use, and the lack of major new features made this iPad Pro a weak upgrade.\n\nUsers were hoping for a front-facing camera in landscape mode, an upgrade to the Magic Keyboard, and an enticing iPadOS update. All of that came in 2024 with the M4 iPad Pro.\n\nApple Watch Series 9\n\nThe health sensors on the back of the Apple Watch Series 9. Image source: Christian de Looper for BGR\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 9 was a great product. However, at least in the US, there was a major controversy: Apple had to halt sales of this wearable due to a patent infringement ban. As a result, during the majority of the time the company sold this wearable, it couldn\u2019t include a functioning blood oxygen sensor in the US.\n\nA way to avoid this ban was to purchase an Apple Watch Series 9 from a third-party marketplace or another country. Even to this day, Apple Watch Series 10 models sold in the US still suffer from this ban.\n\nMagic accessories\n\nImage source: Christian de Looper for BGR\n\nApple released the Magic accessories with a Lightning port in 2015. While they were a better solution than their predecessor, with a removable battery, it was a surprise when the company launched the M3 iMac still with Lightning ports.\n\nFortunately, by the end of 2024, Apple revamped the iMac with the M4 chip and USB-C port. This change allowed users to use a single cable for multiple devices.",

            "content": "Hey, Siri: How much does it cost Apple to settle a privacy lawsuit?\n\nThe tech company has agreed to pay $95 million in cash to settle a proposed class-action case alleging that products enable with the voice-activated Siri assistant violated people\u2019s privacy, Reuters reported on Thursday night. The preliminary settlement was filed Tuesday evening in Oakland, California, and it awaits approval from U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White.\n\nThe settlement comes after Apple-device owners claimed that the brand\u2019s products regularly recorded their private conversations after they accidentally activated Siri, Reuters noted. These users allege that Apple then sent these discussions to third-party actors such as advertisers. For example, two plaintiffs say after talking about Air Jordans and Olive Garden, they were served ads for the sneakers and the restaurant. Another said after discussing a brand-name surgical treatment with his doctor, he got ads for the same treatment.\n\nWhile Apple will pay up in response to the lawsuit, the company has denied any wrongdoing, Reuters wrote. \u201cSiri has been engineered to protect user privacy from the beginning,\u201d an Apple spokesperson said in a statement shared with Robb Report. \u201cSiri data has never been used to build marketing profiles and it has never been sold to anyone for any purpose. Apple settled this case to avoid additional litigation so we can move forward from concerns about third-party grading that we already addressed in 2019. We use Siri data to improve Siri, and we are constantly developing technologies to make Siri even more private.\u201d\n\nThe period for the class-action suit begins on September 17, 2014, when Apple debuted the \u201cHey, Siri\u201d feature that plaintiffs claim led to the surreptitious recordings. It runs through the end of 2024, and those who submit claims can receive up to $20 per Siri-enabled device. The lawyers for the plaintiffs, meanwhile, can ask for up to $28.5 million in fees and $1.1 million in expenses from the settlement. (The lawyers did not respond to Reuters\u2019s request for comment.)\n\nThe $95 million settlement is but a drop in the bucket for Apple, though. It amounts to just nine hours of profit for the company, Reuters reported. In the most recent fiscal year, Apple tallied a net income of a whopping $93.7 billion.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only such tech-privacy lawsuit playing out at the moment. Google is engaged in a similar legal fight, with users of that company\u2019s voice assistant also alleging invasions of privacy. That lawsuit is pending in the same district as the Apple case, and the plaintiffs there are being represented by the same law firms backing the Apple plaintiffs.\n\nIf this Apple case is to serve as a template, we could soon see Google agreeing to settle for a similar sum.",

It just isn't. They're too expensive, there are too many, and it's also just a lot of work to keep track of so many options and apps and interfaces. Some folks pick and choose, while some folks use the rotation method (service #1 for a few months to catch up, then service #2 for a few months to watch their stuff, and so forth).\n\nApple TV+ is free this weekend for anybody who has an Apple ID. It's a service that has not taken off the way some people thought it might, despite having some successes \u2014 Ted Lasso in particular. I'm not here to tell you to pick this service over any other one, or to pay for it at all. But I am here to give you a little advice on what might be worth using this free weekend to catch, since they're giving it away.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSome things (aside from Ted Lasso) have gotten a ton of good press already. Severance is a spooky, beautifully designed drama/sci-fi story about the drudgery of office life, and it's starting again in a couple weeks, so now could be the perfect time to catch up. Pachinko is a really moving saga based on Min Jin Lee's novel of the same name. My current favorite show, if I had to name one, is Shrinking, a very funny and often very emotionally rich story about a bunch of great characters, many of them therapists \u2014 it also features my favorite Harrison Ford performance in years and years and years. Bad Sisters, especially the first season, is a delicious and fabulously performed story of devoted siblings getting the better of a terrible, terrible husband.\n\nOther favorites of the TV critics I know: Dickinson, Slow Horses, For All Mankind, Silo, and this year's Cate Blanchett drama Disclaimer. And they've got movies, too: Coda won best picture at the 2022 Oscars, after all.\n\nBut maybe you feel like \"yes, yes, I've heard of all those things.\" So let me spotlight a handful of other Apple offerings that haven't gotten quite as much attention that you might enjoy.\n\nThe Afterparty: This series stars a murderer's row of comic actors \u2014 in the first season it was folks like Sam Richardson, Ben Schwartz, John Early, Ike Barinholtz, Tiya Sircar and Ilana Glazer \u2014 in an actual murder mystery that takes place at a high school reunion. Every episode is done in a different genre (musical, action picture, rom-com). It's a lot of fun, and if you enjoy comic mysteries as much as I do, it might be right up your alley.\n\nPlatonic: I was a big fan of this show, starring Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne as best friends who reunite after a long time out of touch. It's really funny, but it also has a nice feel for actual platonic friendships (it is not about whether they are going to kiss) and their complications. If you like your comedies to be proudly and brightly funny rather than heavy and high-concept, give it a shot.\n\n\n\nI was a big fan of this show, starring Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne as best friends who reunite after a long time out of touch.

These donations\u2014which aren\u2019t covered by campaign finance law and can be unlimited\u2014signal a clear willingness to work with the Trump administration and a desire to curry favor with the once and future president.\n\nThe tech sector is particularly eager to suck up.\n\nIn December, Meta and Amazon donated $1 million to the inauguration committee, and OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman said he planned to do the same. Uber and its CEO Dara Khosrowshahi have both donated $1 million apiece (even as the company\u2019s chief legal officer Tony West is vice president Kamala Harris\u2019 brother-in-law). The donations to Trump\u2019s inauguaral committee total about $150 million so far, a record-breaking sum, with more expected to flow in. Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos also dined at Mar-a-Lago with Trump just before Christmas, joined by Elon Musk.\n\nIt\u2019s common, of course, for companies to make donations to inaugural committees to signal that they intend to work with the new administration; President Biden\u2019s inaugural committee ultimately raised $62 million, including from Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Pfizer, and Bank of America. Amazon donated $267,000\u2014a significantly lower sum than they\u2019re now giving Trump\u2014 while Google gave $337,000. (Google has not announced any donations to Trump\u2019s second inauguration.)\n\nThe tech sector is particularly eager to suck up to Trump now, as they seek policies favorable to artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. (Crypto companies have donated especially lavishly to the inaugural committee; the largest single donation comes from Ripple, which announced a $5 million contribution in XRP, its own crypto token.) Parts of the sector are also clearly hoping to avoid backlash from people like Andrew Ferguson, Trump\u2019s pick to chair the Federal Trade Commission, who has said he will use his perch to fight \u201ccensorship\u201d of conservative viewpoints from Big Tech and, of course, go after \u201cwokeness.\u201d Trump and many others in his incoming administration are unusually obsessed with tech companies, seeing them as architects of conservative suppression, and have made clear that balancing the scales is one of their first priorities.\n\n\u201cBig Tech should be accountable for years of censorship and deplatforming,\u201d tweeted venture capitalist David Sacks on Twitter, in a reply to Elon Musk and far-right figure Laura Loomer. \u201cIt\u2019s got to stop.\u201d Trump has announced that Sacks will serve as an AI and cryptocurrency \u201cczar\u201d in his new administration, and also lead a council of science and tech advisers.\n\nThe money flowing into Trump\u2019s various coffers also isn\u2019t limited to donations from the tech sector. The New York Times reported Saturday that post-election donations to Trump-affiliated entities\u2014benefitting the inauguration, his eventual presidential library, and the Make America Great Again Inc. super-PAC\u2014have totaled $200 million.\n\n\u201cEVERYBODY WANTS TO BE MY FRIEND!!!\u201d Trump posted on TruthSocial, shortly after the dinner with Bezos.

            "content": "I'm sitting at a restaurant with a few pals, enjoying dim sum, when a friend asks whether he should upgrade to the iPhone 16. I ask him which iPhone he has. My friend ponders aloud, \"The iPhone 14? Or is it the 13? I don't know; they all look the same.\" He then pulls out his phone, an iPhone 12, and hands it to me to verify, as if I were one of the guys on the show Pawn Stars.\n\nMy friend brilliantly and unintentionally makes a valid point. Recent iPhone models look conspicuously similar. It's a sentiment I've heard from family members, friends and Apple enthusiasts, and seen opined across the tech journalism sphere with headlines calling the iPhone boring, or saying the new iPhone looks just like the old one.\n\nOf course, boring is in the eye of the beholder, and such criticism might not be apropos in 2025 as rumors indicate that Apple will launch a new, thinner-style phone, nicknamed the iPhone 17 Slim. The phone's primary appeal would be its svelte design, forgoing the camera-dominant allure of current Pro and Pro Max models.\n\nBut I have to wonder whether an iPhone that looked like it took Ozempic would actually excite Apple enthusiasts, who yearn for a truly major update. Current iterations of the iPhone already have a bounty of features and services that are both vital to our daily lives and nifty but often overlooked. Therefore, a slimmer phone would be unlikely to shake things up, especially at a time when Apple emphasizes the iPhone's utility-centric design, which makes the device as impressive as it is mundane.\n\n\"You can't go more minimal than minimal.\" Paul Snyder, College of Creative Studies in Detroit\n\nWhen Apple released its earnings report last month, it showed signs of growth and stagnation. iPhone sales rose 6% for the fourth quarter of 2024 but were nearly flat for the fiscal year and showed just a 3% increase over the fourth quarter of 2023. Most companies would love to have those financials. But Apple is held to a different standard, and some observers see less than record-breaking results as a weakness.\n\nIt's difficult to know how much those numbers were impacted by customers who've grown indifferent to Apple's design aesthetic and held off on getting a new phone, or others who've jumped brands for a foldable phone, like the Motorola Razr Plus. Clearly, there's pressure on Apple to innovate (look at the launch of Apple Intelligence this year) and there will always be a burden on the company to be a consumer product leader for enthusiasts and shareholders alike. Since phones are still the biggest product Apple sells, a majority of that pressure falls on pushing forward the iPhone's design and development while artfully pleasing its massive and diverse user base.\n\nThat can be a bit of balancing act. Take it from tech writer John Gruber, who publishes the site Daring Fireball. He says: If you ask \"the mainstream people, the people who make up most of the billion people on the planet using Apple devices, 'Do you want a radically new iPhone that you have to learn again?' ... the answer is, 'Are you out of your mind?'\"\n\nThe iPhone X defined what a modern phone should be\n\nThe iPhone X marked a turning point in smartphone design. Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nBut how did we get here? The iPhone's current design is the result of 17 years of refinements. Over its first nine years, the iPhone went through a lot of changes, some quite revolutionary: It got taller, bigger and then thinner. It lost the headphone jack but gained an extra rear camera. The back went from aluminum to plastic to glass to aluminum again, and then returned to glass with the iPhone X, remaining that way ever since.\n\nIt's as if Apple had been tailoring mock-ups of the ideal phone for nearly a decade, only to lock everything down with the release of the iPhone X.\n\n\"Apple being Apple kind of got to this basic form factor with the iPhone X,\" said Gruber. \"At that point, it's like, 'Yeah, here's the way they should be.'\"\n\n\"We've settled into this era now where phones are a utility. They're a commodity. They are about as sexy to buy as a new microwave oven.\" Michael Fisher of the MrMobile YouTube channel\n\nThe iPhone's design has certainly changed in small ways since the iPhone X debuted in 2017. The iPhone X, XS, XR and 11/11 Pro had curved sides. The iPhone 12 and newer models have flat edges. The camera bump seems to grow in size every year and, since the iPhone 11 Pro's arrival, houses three different lenses on the Pro models. But in terms of the iPhone X, the soul of its design became an archetype for what a modern smartphone should be and is today: a metal chassis to house the phone's internals, sandwiched between two pieces of glass, one for the display and the other with a camera bump.\n\nIt's not just Apple. Samsung, Google, OnePlus and others have all gotten to a similar minimalistic glass-sandwich design with rounded corners for their smartphones. A lazy criticism would be to say that they're copying Apple, which is not really the case. But much in the same way that laptops now all have a similar fundamental aesthetic (compared with the wild early years of notebook computers with trackballs, in the '90s and early 2000s), it feels like phones are starting to settle into a universal look. And this ubiquity, as humdrum as some might find it, proves that the iPhone, and smartphones in general, have finally become a mature consumer product, in the same way laptops or automobiles have over decades.\n\nSamsung's Galaxy S24 stands to the left of an iPhone 15. Yep, the camera arrays are different \u2014 but not much else. James Martin/CNET\n\nApple's earnings clearly prove that the company is doing just fine with its current approach and doesn't need to disrupt a good thing for the sake of change. And much in the same way that a breakthrough in touchscreen technology was fundamental to launching the original iPhone, it would likely take another innovation to truly transform things.\n\n\"Whether or not [Apple's] up for a radical shift in design is anybody's guess,\" said Paul Snyder, chair of transportation design for undergraduate studies at the College of Creative Studies in Detroit. \"You can't go more minimal than minimal.\"\n\nAlso check out: A Billion Pixels a Second: An Inside Look at Apple's iPhone 16 Camera Labs\n\nBelieve it or not, iPhones used to be quite fun\n\nWith a 3.5-inch display and that flat glass sandwich design, the iPhone 4 was as much a tiny jewel as it was a phone. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nIf the iPhone's current design is considered boring, you have to wonder when the device was exciting. In 2010, when Steve Jobs launched the iPhone 4, he described the design as \"glass on the front and the rear, and stainless steel running around. And the precision of which this is made is beyond any consumer product we've seen. It's closest kin is like a beautiful, old Leica camera.\"\n\nThe previous two models, the iPhone 3G and 3GS, had plastic backs that were contoured to fit in your palm. So it was profound to see Apple make the jump to the iPhone 4's flat glass sandwich design. And for many people, including myself, the iPhone 4, and the nearly identical iPhone 4S, are the pinnacle of Apple design. The stainless steel band made the phone look and feel premium, especially with the band encircling that back of glossy black glass.\n\n\"You had Steve Jobs on stage geeking out about how the industrial design of the iPhone 4 was evocative of a Leica camera,\" said Michael Fisher, a tech reviewer who helms the MrMobile channel on YouTube. \"It was just so gorgeous, and it was such a lovingly crafted phone that I had left iOS behind in favor of the Palm Pre and wanted to jump back.\"\n\nThis is the iPhone 5S, which launched in 2013 and looks nearly identical to the iPhone 5. Notice the chamfered edges. Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nAfter the iPhone 4 and 4S, Apple launched the iPhone 5, which had a taller, 4-inch screen, compared with the 3.5-inch one on previous models (it's wild how small either of those displays seems today). Apple replaced the glass back on the 4 series with an aluminum one for the launch of the iPhone 5, which made the phone even thinner.\n\nThen the iPhone 6 arrived. It was slim and had a large (at the time) 4.7-inch screen, curved edges and an aluminum back that wrapped around the sides and sported antenna lines. Apple released a second version, called the iPhone 6 Plus, with a bigger, 5.5-inch screen. But let's put it this way: No one compared the iPhone 6 to a Leica. If the iPhone 4 exemplified the heights Apple design could reach, the iPhone 6 showed how the company could turn a product into a daily utility that everyone needed \u2014 cue the record years of iPhone sales.\n\nA pile o' iPhones. From the top down: the iPhone 5S, the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus. Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nIf you were to mash up the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 6, you'd start to see where something like the iPhone X and the current iPhone 16 series came from.\n\n\"We've settled into this era now where phones are a utility. They're a commodity,\" said Fisher. \"They are about as sexy to buy as a new microwave oven.\"\n\nLaptops, phones and automobiles\n\nHere's a display window in Prague with several Apple PowerBook 100 models. Getty Images\n\nIn 1992, my father, who was an architect, brought home one of the strangest things I'd ever seen. It was the PowerBook 100 that Apple launched in 1991, and it had a 9-inch black-and-white screen, a lead battery, and a trackball (where today you might find a trackpad). It weighed more than 5 pounds and cost $2,500 (the equivalent of $5,800 today). Thankfully, my dad's firm bought it for him to run the program AutoCAD.\n\nThe PowerBook \u2014 though it bears some squint-your-eyes resemblance to the MacBook Pro I'm writing this story on \u2014 looks ridiculous. There was a very obvious gap when it was closed, to accommodate the trackball, and it was chunky: 1.8 inches thick when it was closed. But 17 years after that first Apple laptop launched, we got the very first MacBook Air, which, much like the iPhone X, cemented what a contemporary laptop should be.\n\n\"When we talk about the Razr Plus, we're seeing that 25% of consumers are actually coming from iPhone devices.\" Majo Martin, North America marketing director at Motorola\n\nLaptops, like cars, have had their design refined over decades. And smartphones are approaching that two-decade mark.\n\n\"It's an unsatisfying answer to say that boring year-over-year revisions for years, between major updates, are really the way to go,\" said Gruber. \"But it's the truth, and it's the way everything goes. Cars had decades of innovation, and then reached a point where \u2014 can you really tell a 10-year-old car on the road?\"\n\nOf course, automobiles, especially in the US, are heavily regulated, which in turn is reflected in a car's design. No matter the manufacturer, if you're trying to make a vehicle, you have to take into consideration multiple factors, like the aerodynamics for fuel efficiency, and safety features for a crash, and you're going to end up in the same general area as other companies in terms of design.\n\n\"I think what the customer sees is like the silhouette. You look at a midsized CUV, for example, and the silhouettes are very similar,\" said Snyder.\n\nAnd even though phones aren't regulated to the extreme that vehicles are, both smartphones and cars have become devices that house our various ecosystems and software. Apple's revenue from its services grew by 12% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and that's from things like the App Store, Apple Music and iCloud.\n\n\"It's not a phone anymore, right? It's actually a horrible phone, because I have to take five steps to actually make a call,\" said Greg Darby, who, like Snyder, is at the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, as chair and associate professor for product design. \"That's what's happening within an automotive interior. It's the fact that it's more than just, 'I just want to sit in a car and drive someplace.' Although I think people are starting to become too saturated with technology.\"\n\niPhone Fold, Slim or hello, Moto?\n\nFormer CNET writer Stephen Shankland tries out Adobe Lightroom on the Apple Vision Pro. Stephen Shankland/CNET\n\nWhen you look at the scale and size of Apple's customer base and you factor in the iPhone's ubiquity, it raises the question of what can Apple do, if anything, with new iPhone models beyond refinements. And the answer might be to look at the innovative interfaces that yielded other significant Apple products. The original Macintosh was a breakthrough primarily because of its mouse and graphical user interface. The iPod took off because of the scroll wheel, which is sadly no more. And the iPhone was defined by its touchscreen and software.\n\n\"We've already seen the next interface, and indeed, we have rejected it,\" said Horace Dediu, an Apple analyst and tech commentator. \"It is, of course, the Apple Vision Pro.\"\n\nDediu, who's a fan of Apple's headset, is right about the Vision Pro. But we've only seen the first version. Just because a new interface can be innovative and compelling doesn't mean it'll quickly achieve wide adoption. It took years for the iPhone to really take off with consumers. Though I think a greater number of people at this point would be more thrilled by an iPhone Slim than a Vision Pro.\n\nHere's a mock-up of what iOS might look like on a foldable iPhone modeled on Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip. Mock-up by Justin Reynoso/CNET\n\nWhat if there was another option, though? Over the last five years, Apple's competitors have been experimenting with a new phone design that seems like it came straight from an episode of Westworld: foldable phones.\n\n\"In order to get any kind of fun these days from a phone, in terms of a hardware perspective, you really have to look at foldables,\" said Fisher.\n\nFoldable phones arrived in 2019 and improved on some of their initial wonkiness, particularly durability issues and software, only over the last couple of years. They typically come in two forms. The first is a flip style, where the phone folds in half to become smaller, much like the clamshell flip phones of the late-'90s and early-2000s, but with a foldable screen. And then there's the fold-style option that opens out into a mini-tablet-size screen.\n\nIn recent years, the foldable phone space has seen rapid growth. A March report from IDC estimated that there'd be 37.6% more foldables shipped in 2024 compared with 2023. The same report projects that companies will ship 45.7 million foldable phones in 2028. Keep in mind, that's still a relatively small number, when you consider that the same firm estimated in November that there'd be 1.24 billion smartphones shipped in 2024. Now that we're into 2025, it'll be interesting to see how those estimates pan out.\n\nThe Motorola Razr Plus (2024) is positioned half open, with its 4-inch exterior screen lit up. James Martin/CNET\n\nBut as some Apple enthusiasts hope for a possible foldable iPhone or even an iPhone Slim, other companies, like Motorola, are seizing the moment to convert iPhone owners into first-time buyers of a foldable phone.\n\n\"When we talk about the Razr Plus, we're seeing that 25% of consumers are actually coming from iPhone devices,\" said Majo Martin, Motorola's North America marketing director.\n\nBy comparison, Martin told me that 20% of new Motorola Razr owners in 2023 switched over from an iPhone. She said that growth is driven by emotional response. When I reviewed the Motorola Razr Plus (2024), I had trouble remembering the last time I'd used a phone that was as fun as the Razr. Motorola prioritized the experience of using the Razr Plus over pretty much everything else, and there's a lot of value in that for people who want to have their phone be another way to express themselves and their personality.\n\nWill Apple ever release a foldable? And will it be popular? I mean, the names \"iPhone Flip\" and \"iPhone Fold\" do have a nice ring.\n\n\"The foldable thing is a future possibility that Apple would go do and that would go mainstream,\" said Gruber. \"And if and when it happens, it will inevitably be the exact same story that we have covered so many times, where Apple waited and waited and waited and waited, and now they have a foldable. And they're not going to to say, 'This is the first foldable phone,' but they're going to present it like, 'This is the first good foldable phone.'\"",

            "content": "When Apple Intelligence first arrived on the scene for compatible iPhones, an Apple support document revealed that it would gobble up a not insignificant 4GB of storage for the extra functionality.\n\nNow, with the release of iOS 18.2, that has nearly doubled in just a few months. A support page on the Apple website, spotted by 9to5Mac, reveals that supported iPhones, iPads and Macs must sacrifice 7GB of storage for the extra functionality.\n\nTo be entirely fair to Apple, this storage creep hasn\u2019t happened for no reason. The roll-out of iOS 18.2 brings a whole host of new features, including Genmoji, ChatGPT in Siri, Image Playground, Visual Intelligence, Compose with ChatGPT and more. These are all features that should make compatible iPhones more competitive with Samsung\u2019s Galaxy AI-toting handsets.\n\nIt\u2019s also not like Apple ever claimed that the 4GB demand would remain static. Indeed, the company specifically stated that \u201cstorage requirements for on-device Apple Intelligence models will increase as more features roll out\u201d in the iOS 18.1 notes.\n\nAll the same, such storage creep is a worrying trend for iPhone users who opted for 128GB handsets at launch. For them, Apple Intelligence has gone from taking up 3% of the phone\u2019s capacity to 5.5% in just a few months. For those wanting Apple Intelligence on their 64GB M1 iPad Air, the percentage rises to 11%.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the expected timeline for iOS 18, and while iOS 18.3 doesn\u2019t appear to be adding much in the way of AI, the arrival of iOS 18.4 in the spring is set to add significant Siri changes which will likely make the storage demands soar even higher.\n\nI\u2019d rather have the extra space\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide / Shutterstock)\n\nThe good news is that if Apple is serious about AI for the long haul, it will likely need to stop scrimping on storage space for its entry-level models. Apple Intelligence already forced the company into upping the RAM for its non-Pro handsets, and it seems likely that 256GB may become the norm sooner rather than later too.\n\nBut what about those with 128GB handsets juggling with limited storage space today? A simple answer would be to allow users to remove AI features and continue using their iPhones as they have for the past decade.\n\nNot everyone needs or wants artificial intelligence at their fingertips 24 hours a day, after all \u2014 and I must confess I\u2019m an AI Luddite myself. I\u2019ve only used generative AI a handful of times out of curiosity, and I\u2019ve found it too prone to hallucinations to make it too unreliable for research.\n\nThe photography editing features are astonishing in a technical sense, but it\u2019s also not for me. I cling to the old-fashioned view that stitching together multiple photos for a perfect snap, removing distracting objects, or dropping yourself in a scene at the tap of a screen merely ends up distorting genuine, happy memories into something cheap and inauthentic. Give me real and imperfect any day.\n\nIn other words, if I had a compatible iPhone (I don\u2019t \u2014 still on a 14 Pro here), I\u2019d much rather have more free space to play with, than bloated AI features I don\u2019t use. But while you can disable Apple AI in the settings, at the time of writing, once you\u2019ve installed it, there doesn\u2019t seem to be an easy way to reclaim all of the space it takes up.\n\nHopefully that will change in time. Apple may honestly feel that AI is the future, but us non-believers should be free not only to ignore it, but to revel in the extra storage space that decision brings.",

Officials believe the attackers are an as-yet-unidentified Advanced Persistent Threat group linked to China\u2019s government that exploited flaws in remote tech support software made by BeyondTrust to carry out what the Treasury Department described as a \u201cmajor\u201d breach. The company told the Treasury on December 8 that the attackers stole an authentication key, which ultimately allowed them to access department computers. While the Treasury says the attackers were only able to steal \u201ccertain unclassified documents,\u201d new details have already begun to emerge, which we\u2019ll get into more below.\n\nBefore the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last month, gun silencers were mostly a thing you encountered in Hollywood films\u2014or in Facebook and Instagram ads, if you looked closely. WIRED found that someone has run thousands of ads for \u201cfuel filters\u201d that are, in fact, meant to be used as gun silencers, which are heavily regulated by US law. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has since removed many of the ads, but new ones keep popping up.

While CHP says it has linked to posts on the social network since 2018 without any issues until this week, a spokesperson tells WIRED they\u2019re \u201clooking into it\u201d now.\n\nIf you\u2019ve added better privacy and security practices to your list of 2025 goals, one easy place to start is your old chat histories.

And stay safe out there.\n\nApple this week agreed to pay $95 million to settle a class action over its Siri voice assistant\u2019s alleged eavesdropping. The lawsuit, Lopez et al v. Apple Inc., accused Apple of recording people\u2019s conversations without their knowledge and sharing that data with third parties to serve advertisements. The issue stemmed from Siri\u2019s voice-activation function\u2014\u201dHey, Siri\u201d\u2014which two plaintiffs say surreptitiously captured conversations that resulted in ads for Nike shoes and the Olive Garden. One plaintiff claimed to have been served an ad for a medical treatment after having a conversation with his doctor. People who qualify as part of the class covered by the settlement, which must be approved by a federal judge in California, could receive up to $20 per device, for as many as five devices.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson said in a statement to WIRED that Siri was designed to be private and that \u201cSiri data has never been used to build marketing profiles and it has never been sold to anyone for any purpose.\u201d As Reuters points out, the settlement amount is approximately nine hours of profit for Apple, which made nearly $94 billion in the last fiscal year. The company will not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the agreement, and the spokesperson said Apple settled \u201cto avoid additional litigation so we can move forward from concerns about third-party grading that we already addressed in 2019.\u201d\n\nNewly unsealed court documents revealed that the FBI allegedly discovered during a search for a single illegal firearm the \u201clargest seizure of homemade explosives in FBI history.\u201d According to court records, the explosives arsenal was found at the Virginia home of Brad Spafford, where investigators allegedly found more than 150 pipe bombs and other explosive devices. Prosecutors say the FBI found a backpack containing pipe bombs and adorned with a grenade-shaped patch with the hashtag #NoLivesMatter\u2014a potential reference to a far-right extremist \u201caccelerationist\u201d group, The New York Times reports. While prosecutors claim that Spafford\u2014who allegedly used a photo of US president Joe Biden for target practice\u2014aimed to \u201cbring back political assassinations,\u201d his attorney contends that he is a harmless \u201cfamily man\u201d who should be granted release\n\nFollowing revelations earlier this week that Chinese state-backed hackers breached the US Treasury in early December, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the hackers specifically targeted the Office of Foreign Assets Control. The attackers may have been looking for information about the Office\u2019s possible plans to sanction Chinese entities. Additionally, Bloomberg reported on Thursday that the attackers targeted the computers of senior Treasury officials, where they were able to access unclassified material. Thus far, investigators have reportedly identified about 100 computers compromised by the hackers. Sources told Bloomberg, though, that the attack seems to have been more of a crime of opportunity than a clandestine, long-planned operation like China\u2019s recent infiltration of US telecom companies.\n\nAs China\u2019s Treasury hack comes into focus, the impact of its intrusions into American telecommunications firms is still widening. Two days after Christmas, Anne Neuberger, the White House deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, held a briefing with reporters in which she raised the count of telecoms breached by the Chinese hackers known as Salt Typhoon from eight to nine and suggested that at least some of the blame for those breaches lies with the companies\u2019 own inadequate security. \u201cThe reality is that, from what we\u2019re seeing regarding the level of cybersecurity implemented across the telecom sector, those networks are not as defensible as they need to be to defend against a well-resourced, capable offensive cyber actor like China,\u201d Neuberger said. She added that the hackers had targeted the communications histories of fewer than 100 people\u2014mostly in Washington, DC, reportedly including president-elect Donald Trump and vice president-elect JD Vance. Neuberger said that the espionage incident calls for new Federal Communications Commission cybersecurity regulations that she says might have limited the scope of the breaches had they been in place.\n\nCars collect and transmit as much sensitive location data as any modern digital device, and the privacy pitfalls of all that tracking are becoming all too clear. Case in point: A whistleblower warned Germany\u2019s Chaos Computer Club and the country\u2019s Der Spiegel news outlet that Cariad, a subsidiary of Volkswagen, left exposed online a trove of 800,000 electric vehicles\u2019 location data. The leak included cars sold by not only Volkswagen but also other brands, including Seats, Audi, and Skoda. For Audi and Skoda, that location data was accurate only to within about six miles, but Volkswagen and Seats cars could be located to within about four inches. The exposed data has since been secured, but the incident nonetheless demonstrates how far carmakers have yet to go to rein in their data collection.\n\nUpdated at 8:47 am EST, January 7, 2025: Added comment from an Apple spokesperson.",

            "content": "Curious how they decided what made this splash image.\n\nWeek-to-Week should have probably been renamed to Month-to-Month given how other commitments took priority late in 2024, but it\u2019s still the newsletter for Episodic Medium, where I discuss developments in the media industries. Become a free subscriber to receive future newsletters and updates on the shows we cover weekly for paid subscribers who support our team of contributors on a monthly or yearly basis.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few months since I\u2019ve managed to write a newsletter, mostly because I was reviewing 3 shows for most of the fall and my actual job was requiring even more of my attention than usual. This means that there\u2019s no shortage of TV stories that I\u2019ve missed reflecting on, and there will no doubt be more as we head into the new year.\n\nI owe you a few housekeeping things in the short term, including a fall schedule for the start of 2025 and a look back at our contributors\u2019 favorite reviews of 2024, but those will need to wait until next week. In the meantime, though, I can\u2019t help but note that Apple has decided to ring in the new year with a Free Preview weekend for their Apple TV+ service, which has led to a flood of recommendations from newsletters, BlueSky posters, and perhaps even those Real Life Acquaintances I\u2019ve heard so much about. All you\u2019ll need is an Apple ID and seemingly you\u2019ll have access to the whole of Apple TV+\u2019s film and television library from January 4-5.\n\nAs a note: Free Previews used to be very much a thing for premium cable channels back in the day (HBO still does them somewhat regularly), but with the caveat that they only covered linear broadcasts. In this sense, it was a brief taste of what it would be like to have HBO, with big Hollywood movies and premiere episodes of prestige TV shows accessible for a brief moment only to be pulled away if you don\u2019t pony up the $15 a month to have it added to your cable package. For a streaming platform, the logics are similar: they hope you get a taste of a show or two and decide to sign up to see more. The difference is that with a full 48-ish hours of streaming available, you could watch a complete TV season or two\u2014or three?\u2014in that span, should you be so inclined.\n\nI do wonder whether anyone subscribed to this newsletter is the target for such a Free Preview, though. Apple TV+ is a weird service in that it\u2019s probably close to\u2014maybe even past\u2014Netflix and Disney+ in terms of the number of total users who have ever had access to it, thanks to the company\u2019s free trials attached to all device purchases. But it also has an industry-high churn rate as a result, and I really wonder how many people out there are aware enough of the company\u2019s programming to have their eyes on a show to watch but unwilling to pony up the $10 to sample it for a month and, say, work their way through Ted Lasso. The audience for a Free Preview strikes me as people without Apple devices with low awareness of the company\u2019s offerings, with Apple hoping that word-of-mouth for returning shows like Severance and established hits like Slow Horses will proliferate among our social networks.\n\nSo for our free subscribers, here\u2019s the nine Apple TV+ shows that we\u2019ve covered here at Episodic Medium in our first three years, plus some additional options we didn\u2019t\n\n(but probably could have).\n\nOngoing Shows? That\u2019s a Samplin\u2019\n\nThese are all shows that are still running, meaning that you\u2019d be watching with the expectation that you would eventually be willing to subscribe to the service to see the rest of the narrative.\n\nGiven the timing, it feels safe to say that the single most-watched show over the free preview weekend will be Severance, which may have aired three years ago but has remained in the pop culture consciousness. My reviews of season one have been going out to all subscribers on a weekly basis, and we\u2019re just a few weeks away from the show\u2019s return on January 17.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a show to watch week-to-week, your best bet is probably Silo\u2014 if you seet aside the whole weekend, you could binge through the first season and work your way into the second, with the chance to follow along with Ben Rosenstock\u2019s coverage of the second season over its last few episodes (Season 3 and 4 have officially been ordered).\n\nIt likely won\u2019t be returning until later in the year, but a weekend is probably an ideal length of time to work through 22 half-hour-ish episodes, making Shrinking the ideal candidate for a weekend binge if you\u2019re looking for a dramedy and want to catch up on my reviews of the first two seasons.\n\nOf Apple\u2019s ongoing shows we\u2019ve covered, Bad Monkey would be the most leisurely binge watch, with just a single ten-episode season with some shorter episodes sprinkled in there. There\u2019s officially a second season coming, but it\u2019s also a fully contained story, and thus wouldn\u2019t make you feel like you\u2019d need to shell out $10 to see more beyond what Liam Mathews covered last year.\n\nWith three full seasons, this is honestly probably too ambitious a project for a single weekend, but it\u2019s doable ahead of the show\u2019s fourth season and its upcoming spinoff ahead of our coverage returning late in the month (with a new writer, since Lisa had to move on after covering season three).\n\nThere\u2019s no way you can get through the first four seasons of this show before it returns later this year, but you could argue that watching beyond season two is already a kind of dicey proposition, and seasons one and two are both tremendous TV that you\u2019d enjoy with some free time even if my reviews of seasons three and four charted the show\u2019s struggle to carry on.\n\nClosed Loops\n\nThese shows have all concluded their runs (at least for now), meaning you could complete them in a weekend without feeling the urge to subscribe after.\n\nAgain: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re reading this newsletter with an awareness of Ted Lasso and yet have never bothered to sample Ted Lasso, but there\u2019s never a bad time to sample the first season, check your mileage on the second, and then puzzle your way through the third alongside my reviews (although the runtimes get too long for a full binge in a weekend to be feasible for most).\n\nYou could argue that neither the stylistic experimentation of the former\u2019s murder mystery or the periodized parodies of the latter\u2019s musical were sustainable beyond their first seasons, but there was probably some gas left in the tank for both before Apple cut them off, and I was glad Lisa Weidenfeld got to work through the second seasons here at the newsletter.\n\nI understand why Apple was willing to throw money at an Air Force followup to Band of Brothers and The Pacific, but the actual results ended up suggesting that the writers/producers never fully cracked the right angle into the story. The show still has its merits, though, and Josh Spiegel worked through them week-to-week.\n\nShows We Could Have Covered\n\nSometimes shows slip through the cracks, or debut at the wrong time, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not worthwhile (since the days of covering so much that anything worthwhile gets coverage are long gone).\n\nSlow Horses\n\nWith a multi-season renewal, it\u2019s safe to say that Slow Horses is a bit part of Apple\u2019s future, which means it\u2019s probably an investment in future subscriptions if you try to work through as many of its 6-episode seasons as you can.\n\nPachinko\n\nI\u2019ll admit to being Part of the Problem when it comes to this great show, which returned for a second season that I have yet to find time for (like I said above, my fall was a bit hectic). I\u2019m not sure if the show has a future, but some sampling during this weekend wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing for its possible renewal.\n\nBad Sisters\n\nI wondered if there was any audience for a second season of this show, given how close-ended the first seemed to be, and I have to admit the discourse around the second season was\u2026extremely limited. But it does now have two seasons, and you could probably work through both in a weekend.\n\nMonarch: Legacy of Monsters\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is ever going to be complex enough to justify coverage, but this extension of Legendary\u2019s Monsterverse did a pretty good job of telling a coherent story across timelines while feeding the monster of its blockbuster auspices, and would be a really manageable binge across the weekend.\n\nPlatonic\n\nI\u2019m still pretty confused by the fact Apple decided to make more of this show, but I nearly covered the first season back in 2023 before they decided to burn it off at a quick pace. But it\u2019s got Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne in very charming roles, and the quick burn fits the preview well.\n\nI imagine that paid subscribers might have some favorites of their own\u2014I\u2019m actively baiting my boyfriend by leaving Servant off\u2014so feel free to share in the comments. And I\u2019ll be back next week with looks back and forward.",

Lawyers in the case have proposed scheduling a Feb. 14 court hearing in Oakland to review the terms.\n\nIf the settlement is approved, tens of millions of consumers who owned iPhones and other Apple devices from Sept. 17, 2014, through the end of last year could file claims. Each consumer could receive up to $20 per Siri-equipped device covered by the settlement, although the payment could be reduced or increased, depending on the volume of claims. Only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers are expected to file claims, according to estimates in court documents.\n\nEligible consumers will be limited to seeking compensation on a maximum of five devices.\n\nThe settlement represents a sliver of the $705 billion in profits that Apple has pocketed since September 2014. It's also a fraction of the roughly $1.5 billion that the lawyers representing consumers had estimated Apple could been required to pay if the company had been found of violating wiretapping and other privacy laws had the case gone to a trial.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe attorneys who filed the lawsuit may seek up to $29.6 million from the settlement fund to cover their fees and other expenses, according to court documents.",

            "content": "Apple last year deployed a mechanism for identifying landmarks and places of interest in images stored in the Photos application on its customers iOS and macOS devices and enabled it by default, seemingly without explicit consent.\n\nApple customers have only just begun to notice.\n\nThe feature, known as Enhanced Visual Search, was called out last week by software developer Jeff Johnson, who expressed concern in two write-ups about Apple's failure to explain the technology, which is believed to have arrived with iOS 18.1 and macOS 15.1 on October 28, 2024.\n\nIn a policy document dated November 18, 2024 (not indexed by the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine until December 28, 2024, the date of Johnson's initial article), Apple describes the feature thus:\n\nEnhanced Visual Search in Photos allows you to search for photos using landmarks or points of interest. Your device privately matches places in your photos to a global index Apple maintains on our servers. We apply homomorphic encryption and differential privacy, and use an OHTTP relay that hides [your] IP address. This prevents Apple from learning about the information in your photos. You can turn off Enhanced Visual Search at any time on your iOS or iPadOS device by going to Settings > Apps > Photos. On Mac, open Photos and go to Settings > General.\n\nApple did explain the technology in a technical paper published on October 24, 2024, around the time that Enhanced Visual Search is believed to have debuted. A local machine-learning model analyzes photos to look for a \"region of interest\" that may depict a landmark. If the AI model finds a likely match, it calculates a vector embedding \u2013 an array of numbers \u2013 representing that portion of the image.\n\nThe device then uses homomorphic encryption to scramble the embedding in such a way that it can be run through carefully designed algorithms that produce an equally encrypted output. The goal here being that the encrypted data can be sent to a remote system to analyze without whoever is operating that system from knowing the contents of that data; they just have the ability to perform computations on it, the result of which remain encrypted. The input and output are end-to-end encrypted, and not decrypted during the mathematical operations, or so it's claimed.\n\nThe dimension and precision of the embedding is adjusted to reduce the high computational demands for this homomorphic encryption (presumably at the cost of labeling accuracy) \"to meet the latency and cost requirements of large-scale production services.\" That is to say Apple wants to minimize its cloud compute cost and mobile device resource usage for this free feature.\n\nWith some server optimization metadata and the help of Apple's private nearest neighbor search (PNNS), the relevant Apple server shard receives a homomorphically-encrypted embedding from the device, and performs the aforementioned encrypted computations on that data to find a landmark match from a database and return the result to the client device without providing identifying information to Apple nor its OHTTP partner Cloudflare.\n\nThus, Apple unilaterally began running people's Photos through a locally running machine-learning algorithm that analyzes image details (on a purely visual basis, without using location data) and creates a value associated with what could be a landmark in each picture. That value is then used on a remote server to check an index of such values stored on Apple servers in order to label within each snap the landmarks and places found in Apple's database.\n\nPut more simply: You take a photo; your Mac or iThing locally outlines what it thinks is a landmark or place of interest in the snap; it homomorphically encrypts a representation of that portion of the image in a way that can be analyzed without being decrypted; it sends the encrypted data to a remote server to do that analysis, so that the landmark can be identified from a big database of places; and it receives the suggested location again in encrypted form that it alone can decipher.\n\nIf it all works as claimed, and there are no side-channels or other leaks, Apple can't see what's in your photos, neither the image data nor the looked-up label.\n\nApple claims that its use of this homomorphic encryption plus what's called differential privacy \u2013 a way to protect the privacy of people whose data appears in a data set \u2013 precludes potential privacy problems.\n\n\"Apple is being thoughtful about doing this in a (theoretically) privacy-preserving way, but I don\u2019t think the company is living up to its ideals here,\" observed software developer Michael Tsai in an analysis shared Wednesday. \"Not only is it not opt-in, but you can\u2019t effectively opt out if it starts uploading metadata about your photos before you even use the search feature. It does this even if you\u2019ve already opted out of uploading your photos to iCloud.\"\n\nTsai argues Apple's approach is even less private than its abandoned CSAM scanning plan \"because it applies to non-iCloud photos and uploads information about all photos, not just ones with suspicious neural hashes.\"\n\nNonetheless, Tsai acknowledges Apple's claim that data processed in this way is encrypted and disassociated with the user's account and IP address.\n\nWhile there's no evidence at this point that contradicts Apple's privacy assertions, the community concern has more to do with the way in which Apple deployed this technology.\n\n\"It\u2019s very frustrating when you learn about a service two days before New Years and you find that it\u2019s already been enabled on your phone,\" said Matthew Green, associate professor of computer science at the Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute in the US.\n\nApple gives fanbois The Sweetest Thing: A delete button for that U2 album FLASHBACK\n\nThe Register asked Apple to comment, and as usual we've received no reply. We note that lack of communication is the essence of the community discontent.\n\n\"My objection to Apple's Enhanced Visual Search is not the technical details specifically, which are difficult for most users to evaluate, but rather the fact that Apple has taken the choice out of my hands and enabled the online service by default,\" said Johnson in his second post.\n\nHe told The Register that it's unclear whether the data/metadata from your Photos library is uploaded before you even have a chance to disable the opt-out setting.\n\n\"I don't think anybody knows, and Apple hasn't said,\" Johnson observed. \u00ae",

            "content": "Here's the latest on the largest publicly traded company in the world.\n\n2024 was a banner year for Apple (AAPL -0.11%), with the stock delivering a total return of 33%, and it currently holds the top spot among all publicly traded companies by market capitalization at $3.7 trillion. Given its position, investors might wonder how much room the tech giant has to grow.\n\nSo, let's examine where Apple stands today, management's capital allocation strategy, and its outlook for 2025 to determine whether the stock is a buy, sell, or hold.\n\nApple continues to impress, but growth is slowing\n\nApple's latest financial results show that the tech giant continues to generate an unrivaled amount of revenue compared to its peers, with $391 billion during its fiscal year 2024. For comparison, Alphabet (GOOG -2.71%) (GOOGL -2.65%) and Microsoft (MSFT -1.90%) generated $339.9 billion and $254.2 billion during that same period, respectively.\n\nHowever, Apple's year-over-year revenue growth is slower than that of its counterparts, at only 2%, compared to 10.6% for Alphabet and 11.7% for Microsoft.\n\nA closer look at Apple's sales by category reveals mixed performance across its segments. iPhone sales, the company's largest segment, reached $201.2 billion in fiscal year 2024, reflecting modest growth of just 0.3%. Meanwhile, sales in the iPad and wearables/home accessories segments declined by 5.7% and 7.1%, respectively.\n\nThe bright spot for Apple continues to be its services segment, which includes Apps and in-app purchases, subscriptions, Apple Pay, and advertisement placements. For its fiscal year 2024, Apple's services generated $96.2 billion, equating to a year-over-year increase of 12.9%.\n\nDespite some lumpy sales growth, Apple continues to generate a staggering amount of free cash flow, which is the amount of money after operational and capital expenditures. For its fiscal 2024, Apple generated $108.8 billion, which is a 9.3% increase from the same period last year. For comparison, Alphabet and Microsoft generated $55.8 billion and $72.7 billion, respectively, over the trailing 12 months.\n\nApple prioritizes returning capital to shareholders\n\nWith Apple's robust free cash flow, management returns capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, equating to an annual yield of 0.4%. While the yield is relatively low compared to other dividend stocks, investors can reasonably expect annual increases for the foreseeable future, considering management has raised it for 13 consecutive years and has a low payout ratio -- the percentage of profits paid out as dividends -- of only 16.3%.\n\nIn addition to a growing dividend, Apple aggressively repurchases its shares, boosting each shareholder's ownership stake without requiring additional investment. While buybacks are subject to a 1% tax, they are generally more tax-efficient than dividends, which are double-taxed -- first at the corporate level and then again when paid to shareholders.\n\nIn 2024 alone, Apple reduced its outstanding shares by 2.2% and by an impressive 13.8% over the past five years. Notably, in its fiscal 2024, management spent nearly $95 billion on share repurchases and, in May, unveiled a new $110 billion buyback program.\n\nApple is betting on AI for future growth\n\nLike other tech giants, Apple is investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential source of new growth. The company spent $31.8 billion in research and development during its fiscal year 2024, up 4.9% from its fiscal year 2023. In a recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook noted how Apple Intelligence, which is the company's free built-in AI system for its products, \"will transform how users interact with technology.\"\n\nThe technology is only available on Apple's relatively newer hardware models, which could prompt more consumers to upgrade from their current devices.\n\nWhile still in its infancy stage, management believes that Apple Intelligence will grow its services revenue by \"double digits\" and the company's total revenue by \"mid-single digits\" in its fiscal Q1 2025 compared to its fiscal Q1 2024.\n\nHere's the bottom line on Apple stock\n\nBefore investing in any stock, it's essential to consider its valuation -- after all, even a great company like Apple can become a poor investment if its price is too high.\n\nOne metric available is price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF), which measures a company's market capitalization against its free cash flow. Currently, Apple trades at nearly 36 times its trailing-12-month free cash flow of $108.8 billion. Comparing this ratio to competitors' and Apple's historical valuation helps assess whether the stock is cheap, fairly valued, or overvalued.\n\nCompared to Alphabet and Microsoft, which trade at 44 times free cash flow, Apple is less expensive. However, its current P/FCF ratio marks a five-year high. While the potential of the AI boom is exciting, much of the anticipated growth has yet to materialize, indicating that Apple's current valuation is rich.\n\nDespite this, Apple remains a compelling long-term investment, and current investors should consider holding. The company will continue to reward shareholders through rising dividends and share repurchases, and if its AI strategy delivers, it could pave the way for a transformative new growth phase.",

            "content": "BEFORE VISITING APPLE\u2019S secretive Fitness+ production facility in Santa Monica , I had never seen a robotic camera in action. Then I found myself standing in the massive room where all the streaming service\u2019s workouts are filmed, and I was surrounded by them (and when I was told the studio houses the most in the world operating in one place, I wasn\u2019t surprised). All the rigs were focused on Fitness+ trainer Sam Sanchez , who was leading a Strength session that would be uploaded for the platform\u2019s users to sweat along with (on their iPhones, iPads, and Apple TVs of course), just like they\u2019d drop into a group fitness class at their local in-person studio.\n\nThis is how has been operating since it launched as Apple\u2019s first foray into training, right as the streaming workout trend surged at the end of 2020. By then, the Apple Watch had transformed from a general use wearable into a potent health device . Fitness+ gave the company another service to entice consumers to turn to Apple for everything. People would use the phone, wear the watch, and build their bodies under the tutelage of Apple-approved trainers.\n\nThe platform has been pumping out workout content ever since (over 6,000 videos at this point just over four years in). But as the larger fitness landscape has evolved, Apple\u2019s fitness platform (and most online fitness platforms, actually) have struggled with a blind spot: Standalone workout sessions simply aren\u2019t the best way to build muscle. As the fitness conversation has refocused itself around strength training and muscle-building for longevity, consumers have increasingly chased long-term workout programs that let them capitalize on progressive overload (more on that later).\n\nNow, Apple wants in. To start the New Year, Fitness+ is introducing a suite of new features aimed at helping you reach your muscle-building goals\u2014and the headliner is right up my alley, the brand\u2019s first progressive strength training program. I visited Fitness+ HQ to learn more about the announcements from Apple vice president of Fitness Technologies Jay Blahnik. I got a behind the scenes look at the process of filming a workout and talked to the team behind the platform about its mission to bring more muscle to the Apple ecosystem.\n\nFitness+ Adds Progression\n\nTOURING THROUGH THE Fitness+ studio makes it clear just how committed Apple is to its workout service. The shoot was remarkably efficient, from all those cameras on the floor (and suspended from the ceiling) to the control room of producers editing on the fly so that the production could be as close to live as possible. The whole space radiated competence and focus\u2014and sure, I know there was a bit of a performance put on for me as the outsider looking in. But you can't fake it once the cameras are actually rolling. That efficiency is the only way the studio could pump out up to 40 video productions per week from a single stage as it does.\n\nThe trainers bring that same level of focus behind the scenes when they're designing the workouts that will eventually make it onto the production floor. After watching the shoot, I headed backstage with Blahnik to hear from the rest of the Fitness+ trainers about that process. They usually have four weeks to design their individual workouts, and they collaborate so sessions fit within the platform\u2019s larger ecosystem. The workouts are constructed so they won't clash with other content\u2014from the music selections on the playlist to the movements in the routines\u2014but they\u2019re not explicitly made to be taken in sequence, and there's not a direct tie from one to the next.\n\nLots of exercisers want to make strength and muscle gains, but up until now, Fitness+ has focused its content on everything but structured strength programs. Users could build custom plans focused on music, activity type, and session duration. But they don't focus on a personal training goal\u2014and they don't focus on a path to progress their lifts, which you need for growth in the gym.\n\nCourtesy of Apple Sanchez, center, leads the Strength workout.\n\nThis training principle is called progressive overload . In practice this requires you to expose your muscles to increased stimulus over time via frequency, volume, and/or intensity. For example, you may lift 20 pounds for eight reps of biceps curls one week. If you do 10 reps at the same weight the next week, you\u2019ve \u201cprogressed\u201d. This consistent progression over the life of your training pushes your body to adapt, building muscle and strength (and helping you reach other goals, too).\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s where Fitness+'s new \u201c3 Perfect Weeks of Strength\u201d program comes into play. The series (which launches January 6) is the first time the team has offered a plan like this. Given the shift in structure, the new strength program is meant to be a step up from the platform\u2019s standard fare.\n\nI wasn\u2019t able to try any of the workouts ahead of time, but I was able to talk with the program\u2019s architects. Shortly after Sanchez stepped off camera, she joined me with Blahnik and her Fitness+ trainer colleagues Darryl Whiting (Pilates), Greg Cook (Strength), and Dice Iida-Klein (Yoga) in a meeting space outfitted similarly to Apple's showrooms, with a modern aesthetic that reminded me of times I've waited on a Genius Bar appointment. More than anything else, the group emphasized the deep collaboration behind the scenes as the key (or \u201csecret sauce\u201d or \u201csuper power\u201d) to the new programs.\n\nCourtesy of Apple\n\n\u201cAs we progress, what we're learning is that we need to do more for those users that have been with us for the four years\u2014and we also need to do more for those users who are looking for their supplement to push them a little further,\u201d Blahnik said. \"We heard 'we're loving the weeklies, but we'd like something to know that if we only had three weeks or a certain period of time, that we could do it and get everything in.\"\n\nWhile the platform doesn\u2019t allow for the same type of trainer-client interaction you\u2019ll get in-person or even on live streamed platforms, the Fitness+ team said the idea for these new progressive programs came from user feedback. The trainers don\u2019t interact with users through the platform directly, but they receive reams of DMs and Blahnik noted that a \"great part of their week is spent communicating with our users.\" Sometimes that comes in the form of a funny story, like when a strength devotee shared with Whiting that they celebrated his birthday over 100 times because it was mentioned in a class they repeated regularly, or as inspiration for new features, like the user who told Sanchez they had leveled up their weight when they repeated a workout and were proud of the progression.\n\nAs the name implies, the new strength program is split into three weeks, each with a distinct theme and four workouts using a pair of dumbbells. The first week focuses on progressive overload, the second focuses on time-under-tension (which helps build mind-muscle connection so you get more from your exercises), and the third focuses on an underrated training idea called dynamic power (the idea that your muscles can not only produce force, but produce force quickly, a key trait for longevity). Three-week programs might not seem like a lot since most training cycles last anywhere from four to 12 weeks (I personally like nine weeks as the sweet spot to get in the groove of a plan). But if you've never done a structured program before, the three-week timeline is a nice entry point that doesn't require too much commitment, either. \u201cIt came from us wanting to give our users a goal,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cWhat are these aspects of strength training that we can put into a digestible amount of time for you to start a goal and finish it?\u201d\n\nUsers are also encouraged to repeat the cycle as soon as the three weeks are complete\u2014which is the whole point of that first principle of progressive overload: besting what you did before in order to make your body adapt and grow. Blahnik and Sanchez insisted that these three-week cycles are made for \"someone who's already strength training\" and is \"ready to take it up a notch.\" But it's also likely that these workouts will mostly appeal to beginners, because more experienced trainees will want to ramp up to aim for loftier goals with more involved plans.\n\nApple fitness + (Courtesy Apple)\n\nThe Fitness+ take on progression may have some room to grow for strength, but it has broader applications as well. Another new feature debuting in 2025 is Yoga Peak Poses, which provides progressive sequencing and focused instruction on a single difficult maneuver (these will include Dancer, Twisted Hand to Big Toe, and Crow). \"We really dial into the specifics and the alignment of the poses,\" Iida-Klein said, and compared the program to a private session or the extra attention you'd get when you ask an instructor for help after a tough yoga class IRL.\n\nWhere Fitness+ Goes Next\n\nTHESE ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE another step in the evolution of Fitness+. A redesign last September introduced new personalization and curation features; if you only used Fitness+ for yoga and rowing, for example, you\u2019d be served suggestions for those types of workouts. You can also use all of the workouts and meditations you upload into the Health app from other services, too, so those who use the service as a supplement to other workouts can have the whole scope of their wellness routine considered (I\u2019ve enabled this function, and I appreciate how the sporadic solo kickboxing sessions I tackle in my backyard will be included). This personalization is meant to make the platform more useful for \u201cadvanced\u201d users, Blahnik said.\n\nPersonalization is great for individuals, but as plenty of stats on the fitness world post-Covid have borne out, lots of people prefer exercise as a social endeavor. Activity tracking platform Strava\u2019s annual Year in Sport trend report saw a major uptick in social and group exercise last year (more on that in just a moment). Even though Fitness+ wasn\u2019t conceived with isolation in mind, it is strictly a digital-first platform designed so that most users will engage with its content solo (there are features that allow users to train together via FaceTime, \u201cSharePlay,\u201d but these connections are still largely via technology). \u201cWe see the service as a digital service first, not an in-person service,\u201d Blahnik said. \u201cBut we've tried really hard from the beginning to make sure that we're meeting people where they're at, with the communities that they love.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what the Fitness+ team hopes another of the new announcements will address: Fitness+ will allow for Strava integration (current and new Strava subscribers will receive up to three free months of Fitness+ membership as part of the partnership, too). Once users have completed a Fitness+ workout, they\u2019ll be able to share a stylized recap of their session on their Strava feed. Later in the year, Fitness+ will feature workouts with Strava athletes.\n\nApple fitness + (Courtesy Apple) Apple fitness + (Courtesy Apple)\n\nBlahnik sees this integration as an opportunity for Fitness+ to branch out beyond users' devices, since the network offers \"lots more people that are connected to their community.\u201d Strava already has a similar functionality with Peloton, and I\u2019ve seen my friends on the platform posting those workouts in the same way they share their running or cycling routes out on the road. Notably, those posts are typically solo training, unlike the group runs I often see friends post with photos from along the route. Time will tell how putting Fitness+ workouts on the same feed as your buddy's latest 5K route will foster more engagement, but for a certain type of endurance junkie, the Strava co-sign does bring provide some legitimacy.\n\nStill, will give users more options; along with Peak Yoga Poses and strength, there are also pickleball and breath meditation programs launching on January 6. More celebrity-driven Time to Walk spots (Adam Scott, Steve Aoki, Tiffany Haddish) and Artist Spotlight series (Janet Jackson, Coldplay, Bruno Mars, Kendrick Lamar) are on the way, too, which give the service a degree of cultural cachet.\n\nFor most guys with ambitious gym goals (something like, say, body recomposition ), Fitness+ will be best used as a supplement to a more comprehensive training plan. You can make solid gains with just dumbbells, but if you're pushing to layer on serious muscle, you'll need more equipment. (You'll also want to pair your workouts with nutrition, which is something MH is doing in our new Body Recomp package ).\n\nApple fitness + (Courtesy Apple)\n\nBlahnik is just fine with that. Apple Fitness+ was always designed to be used as a supplement to more involved training programs\u2014if that\u2019s what serves the user best. There are a dozen workout types on the service, after all, so it has always been about far more than simply strength. And since Fitness+ is built right into Apple\u2019s devices and millions of people got new iPads, Apple Watches, and iPhones during the holiday season (complete with free Fitness+ trials), it\u2019s likely that users will find their way to some part of the service. That\u2019s all part of Blahnik and the Fitness+ team\u2019s mission.\n\n\"What we've been trying to do since the beginning,\u201d Blahnik said, \u201cis make sure that everything we do is in service of making ourselves more available to more people doing what they love to do, how they love to do it, where they love to do it.\u201d",

Lawyers in the case have proposed scheduling a Feb. 14 court hearing in Oakland to review the terms.\n\nIf the settlement is approved, tens of millions of consumers who owned iPhones and other Apple devices from Sept. 17, 2014, through the end of last year could file claims. Each consumer could receive up to $20 per Siri-equipped device covered by the settlement, although the payment could be reduced or increased, depending on the volume of claims. Only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers are expected to file claims, according to estimates in court documents.\n\nEligible consumers will be limited to seeking compensation on a maximum of five devices.\n\nThe settlement represents a sliver of the $705 billion in profits that Apple has pocketed since September 2014. It\u2019s also a fraction of the roughly $1.5 billion that the lawyers representing consumers had estimated Apple could been required to pay if the company had been found of violating wiretapping and other privacy laws had the case gone to a trial.\n\nThe attorneys who filed the lawsuit may seek up to $29.6 million from the settlement fund to cover their fees and other expenses, according to court documents.",

Reuters said that Apple was accused of not only harvesting conversations from its customers, but also offering that illegally collected data to third party advertisers.\n\nThe plaintiffs cite cases where users asked Siri for information on Air Jordan sneakers and Olive Garden restaurants only to be later served advertisements for each business with timing that was too precise to be mere coincidence.\n\nThe case could provide a precedent for further lawsuits against vendors who sell personal assistant devices. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon all provide hardware and software that functions in the same way as Apple\u2019s Siri, and carry similar privacy and data security concerns.\n\nAside from violating user privacy by collecting the data, sharing queries with advertisers poses a security concern as Apple (and other vendors) would have no way of verifying that the data was being properly encrypted and protected from outside threat actors.\n\nApple paying out a settlement will likely spur other attorneys and users to press their own class action claims over data collection and sharing with advertisers.\n\nWhile the $95 million payout is not exactly pocket change, it will not make for a sizable dent in Apple\u2019s cash reserves.

The largest tech giant, which has always depended on the iPhone to fuel growth, is battling large headwinds, including sales that have slumped in China.\n\nMeanwhile, UBS has cut its estimates for iPhone sales further below Wall Street consensus, adding to growing analysts' caution. In a note Wednesday, UBS analyst David Vogt said Apple was facing a 5 percent drop in iPhone revenue for this December quarter, a sign of trouble ahead. The world's largest company, Vogt said, 'winter is here' for Apple, whose iPhones fell 8% in November, largely because of a 28% decline in China.\n\nIn a bid to revive the sales slump, Apple will be offering discounts on several iPhone models from January 4 to 7 in China. As the company faces an increasingly mixed economy, the company is also discounting the flagship iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models by 500 yuan ($68). Fierce competition from local smartphone makers and a sluggish Chinese economy, whose faltering property crisis and weak consumer spending have contributed to the dip in sales, have hit Apple's bottom line.\n\nHowever, UBS has stuck with its neutral rating on Apple stock and a price target of $236, a bit below the consensus price target of $248 among the 18 analysts surveyed by FactSet.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

This included \"confidential medical information, drug deals, and recordings of couples having sex,\" according to the investigation. Siri is only supposed to activate upon hearing the wake word \"hey Siri,\" but there were reported instances of Siri being triggered by other things \u2014 such as the sound of a zipper, an Apple Watch being raised in a certain way, and hearing a voice.\n\nApple users claimed private conversations were recorded and then shared with third-party advertisers. They would then see ads for products mentioned in certain conversations and even a surgical treatment after discussing it with their doctor. Apple subsequently issued a formal apology and said it would no longer save voice recordings.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

In order for Apple users to claim their part of the settlement, they must submit a claim for up to five Apple devices with Siri (iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, MacBook, iMac, HomePod, iPod touch, or Apple TV) and swear under oath that they inadvertently activated Siri \"during a conversation intended to be confidential or private,\" said the settlement proposal.\n\nApple isn't the only company in trouble for privacy violations incurred by voice assistants.

Most of the updates come in the form of new health, fitness and safety tracking tools. There's a new sleep apnea notifications feature, which can indicate signs of moderate to severe sleep apnea when you wear the Apple Watch Series 10, Series 9 or Ultra 2 to sleep. There's also a new Vitals app and you can finally pause your activity rings.\n\nWatchOS 11 is compatible with any Apple Watch from the Series 6 and later, and the second-gen SE. To try out WatchOS 11.2, you need to have iOS 18 on your iPhone paired to the Apple Watch. To start the installation process, go to Watch > General > Software Update. Once you've installed the update, these are our favorite features that you should explore.\n\nWatch this: What's New in WatchOS 11 05:53\n\nSleep apnea notifications\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 9, Ultra 2 and Series 10 can check for signs of potential sleep apnea, a potentially serious condition where you stop breathing throughout the night. It's estimated that 1 billion people around the world may have the condition.\n\nUsing the accelerometer, the Apple Watch tracks a new metric called breathing disturbances by monitoring for small movements at your wrist. You'll be able to see this metric in the Health app after each night of sleep, listed either as elevated or not elevated. A notification will be sent if the watch notices consistent signs of sleep apnea. The feature has received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration in the US, and will also be available in over 150 countries.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 can detect signs of sleep apnea. Lisa Eadicicco/CNET\n\nCamera Remote controls\n\nOne of the sleeper apps on the Apple Watch is the Camera Remote which lets you control your iPhone's cameras. A new addition that Apple added in WatchOS 11.2 is the ability to pause video recordings. iOS 18 brought the ability to pause and unpause video recordings on your iPhone, but it's nice to see the feature added to the Apple Watch now, too.\n\nChange your Activity Rings\n\nIn WatchOS 11 you can finally adjust your activity rings and take a rest day if you're sick. In the Activity app, tap on the three rings and then tap pause rings. You can pause for the day, week or month, or you can set a custom target.\n\nAnother great new option is being able to change your goals for each ring: Move, exercise and stand. If you know that a 30-minute exercise goal isn't right for you, that can be adjusted up or down.\n\nAdjusting your Move ring in WatchOS 11. Celso Bulgatti/CNET\n\nIndividual days of the week can also be adjusted. Go to the calendar icon at the top right then press schedule and adjust accordingly. I know my Tuesdays are usually pretty low on workouts as I'm in the office, so I set that target to be lower, then up my weekend goals as I'm out and about a lot more.\n\nThe Vitals app tracks your health overnight\n\nWhen you wear the Apple Watch to track sleep, it's also recording other key metrics like heart rate, respiratory rate and wrist temperature. The Vitals app surfaces these metrics in the morning so you can see them on your wrist, rather than pulling out the Health app to dig into the menus. Use the screen or the crown to scroll through the metrics.\n\nOne helpful view is the past seven days view, which tells you if any of your vitals fall outside of your range of normal and highlights it in pink. You'll also get notification on your wrist if two or more vitals are off.\n\nThe Vitals app. Celso Bulgatti/CNET\n\nTraining Load helps you keep an eye on your workouts\n\nTraining Load is a way to measure the intensity of your workout routine, so you can keep on track if you're working towards a marathon or the like, or want to avoid over-training.\n\nOpen the Activity app and find a new icon in the top right. Tap the chart symbol and the white line shows your 28-day weighted average of activity, with your past seven days compared against it. You can scroll the digital crown to go back through your last week's workouts. They'll be categorized as anything from \"well above\" to \"well below\" your average and each gets an effort rating.\n\nThe Training Load screen in the Activity app. Celso Bulgatti/CNET\n\nCompatible cardio workouts like walks, runs, hikes and rowing will get an effort rating out of 10. The Apple Watch calculates this based on data like height, weight and age, plus calorimetry data from your workout like GPS and heart rate.\n\nYou can adjust this effort rating if you think it doesn't really reflect your workout. Say you're overly tired from a late night and pushed to do a run, but it was slower than usual, you can change the effort rating to more accurately reflect how you felt. Tap the effort rating to bring up a chart and turn the crown to move the rating.\n\nA nice perk if you have an Apple Watch Ultra or Ultra 2 is that you can see your vitals and training load data on the Modular Ultra face by customizing the side bezel complication.\n\nCheck in with your Apple Watch for safety\n\nThere's a new safety tool on the Apple Watch called Check In with WatchOS 11. It works both from the Workout app, and from the Messages app. Similar to how Check In functions in iOS 17, you open the Messages app and choose the plus icon to find Check In. Here you can adjust it to \"check in\" with a friend or family member based on a period of time, or when you arrive at a set destination.\n\nDuring a workout, swipe right and tap Check In. It will automatically text your selected contact when you finish your workout. If the Apple Watch notices you're not progressing as expected; your speed increases dramatically; or if your heart rate goes down close to your resting during an intense workout, it will prompt you to respond.\n\nOtherwise it will share your location, with either limited or full data based on your selection, with your contact.\n\nA Live Activity appears at the top of the Smart Stack. Celso Bulgatti/CNET\n\nOnce you start a Check In, this also starts a Live Activity on the watch that shows up in the Smart Stack. Like on iOS 17, Check In only works if your recipient is also running iOS 17 or later and it will not work for other contacts who aren't using iMessage.\n\nThe redesigned Photos watch face\n\nWatchOS 11 doesn't have any new watch faces per se, but the Photos face gets more functionality. Pull out your iPhone and go into the Watch app, where you can choose people, pets, nature or city photos to highlight on your wrist.\n\nIn the background, your phone rates the best photos on composition and facial expressions to highlight what it thinks are the top images to show on your watch face. You can even go one step further and change the size and font of the time, plus background colors on your images to make the watch face more personal.\n\nRemote app gets even more tools\n\nI use the remote app on the Apple Watch more than I care to admit and it has even more controls in WatchOS 11. Open the Remote app then tap the three dots at the top right. Here you can mute and unmute your connected Apple TV, turn on captions or even power off your connected device with one tap.\n\nThe Translate app in WatchOS 11. Celso Bulgatti/CNET\n\nTranslate app\n\nThe translate app is now on the Apple Watch. Just speak your phrase and choose the target language, then the Apple Watch plays back the translation. In the settings you can change the speed to make playback slower or faster. Plus, you can download 20 different language packs so it will work even if you don't have the paired iPhone with you.\n\nA few of my other favorite features of WatchOS 11 include:\n\nExtra tools to help track pregnancy in the Health app.\n\nLive Activities now appear in the Smart Stack, like if you call a car or snooze an alarm.\n\nOffline mapping in Apple Maps now lets you get turn-by-turn navigation for hikes with voice guidance.\n\niMessage tapbacks have a different look, which is a nice subtle change.\n\nTides app to keep track of water conditions.\n\nDouble Tap now lets you navigate through any app -- messages, weather or basically anything else -- in two pinches.\n\nSince you need to download iOS 18 to try out WatchOS 11, you might as well explore some of its new features, too. Check out our iOS 18 cheat sheet for features to try.",

The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will receive a 400 yuan reduction.\n\nApple's iPhone 16 series smartphones on sale in Beijing. (Reuters)\n\nThe discounts come as consumers remain cautious with spending amid China's slowing economy and deflationary pressures, with the country's consumer inflation hitting a five-month low in November.\n\nApple is grappling with declining market share in China, the world's largest smartphone market, where local manufacturers have intensified competition.\n\nHuawei has emerged as a particularly strong challenger since its return to the premium segment in August 2023 with locally-made chipsets. Huawei had cut the prices of a variety of high-end devices, including mobile phones, by up to 3,000 yuan over the weekend on one of China's leading e-commerce platforms.\n\nApple briefly fell out of China's top five smartphone vendors in the second quarter of 2024 before recovering in the third quarter. The U.S. company's smartphone sales in China still slipped 0.3% during the third quarter from a year earlier, while Huawei's sales surged 42%, according to research firm IDC.\n\nThe Apple promotion also includes discounts of 200 to 300 yuan on older iPhone models, as well as other categories of products such as MacBook laptops and iPad tablets. Customers must use designated payment methods including WeChat Pay or Alipay to qualify for the discounts.\n\n(Reporting by Liam Mo and Brenda Goh; Editing by Jamie Freed)",

A round-trip ticket to Singapore at that time was only $120. You could fly to Singapore and back to Indonesia on the same day, so it was more cost-effective,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWinston used the phone without problems for about a year, until the Indonesian government in 2022 issued a regulation mandating that all phones be registered.\n\nDespite registering his phone as required, the device suddenly lost signal one day and would not reconnect to the network, even with a different SIM card, he said.\n\n\u201cI went to a licensed Apple products reseller in Medan because I thought there was a problem with the phone, but they just said, \u2018There is nothing we can do or suggest,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nSaddled with an unusable iPhone, Winston, who has had no problems with his current iPhone 15, which he bought through a licensed reseller, sold the device at a loss at a secondhand store during a subsequent visit to Singapore.\n\nIndonesia, the fourth-most populous country with some 280 million people, is one of the world\u2019s largest smartphone markets.\n\nThe archipelago was home to some 190 million smartphone users in 2022, according to market research firm Newzoo.\n\nAccording to data from the Ministry of Industry, the country imported about 22,000 Google Pixel phones and 9,000 iPhone 16s in 2024, before authorities announced the bans.\n\nSmartphone shipments to Indonesia were dominated by devices made by China\u2019s Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo, and South Korea\u2019s Samsung.\n\nAbdul Soleh, a lawyer in Medan, said the prohibitively expensive price of the iPhone 16 for many Indonesians might explain why there had not been more vocal opposition to the ban.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is a real shame, because iPhones are very popular and have a high user satisfaction rate in Indonesia,\u201d Soleh told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cIt would be better if the iPhone 16 could be sold in Indonesia because there are quite a lot of enthusiasts here.\u201d\n\nKhairul Mahalli, the head of the Chamber of Commerce in North Sumatra, said that while Indonesia\u2019s TKDN policy is aimed at supporting local industry, it could have unintended consequences.\n\n\u201cAs a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) with a trade industry that works between countries, it is fine to protect our industries, but we also need to have checks and balances in place,\u201d Mahalli told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cOne of the issues for the future could be that, if Indonesia blocks the sales of certain products, other countries could do the same and no longer accept the sales of Indonesian products on the international market.\u201d\n\nMahalli said it was the job of the government to find ways to minimise harm to local industries that are less drastic than outright bans on foreign products.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to completely ban foreign sales, as Indonesia\u2019s market is large enough to accommodate foreign products due to its large population of over 270 million people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at whether local production can keep up with consumer demand.\u201d\n\nRio Priambodo, the head of the legal and complaints department at the non-profit Indonesia Consumers Organization, said consumers should think twice about purchasing the latest iPhone model, especially through illegal resellers in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Consumers Organization recommends that consumers don\u2019t just try to buy the iPhone 16 by any means possible if it has been banned by the government,\u201d Priambodo told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cIf purchases are made illegally, this will eliminate the dimension of consumer protection that all customers should have.\u201d\n\nIn a bid to break the impasse, Apple has pledged to dramatically ramp up its investment in the country in exchange for lifting the ban.\n\nIn November, the California-based tech giant offered to invest $100m in the country over two years, a 10-fold increase from an earlier pledge to pour $10m into the construction of an accessories and components factory in Bandung, West Java.\n\nDespite the offer, the Ministry of Industry appeared unmoved.\n\n\u201cFrom the government\u2019s perspective, of course, we want this investment to be larger,\u201d spokesperson Febri Hendri Antoni Arif said at the time.\n\nOn November 25, Jakarta formally rejected the offer, with Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita saying it did not meet Indonesia\u2019s \u201cprinciples of fairness\u201d.\n\nHe said that Apple had invested more significant amounts in neighbouring countries such as Thailand and Vietnam, including $15bn for manufacturing facilities in the latter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBased on the technocratic assessment, the investment amount has not met the figure that we consider fair,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe want Apple to return to do business here, but we need a fair resolution.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Apple fans such as Winston face the prospect of making do without the latest models for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cI understand that the ban is for political reasons because Apple does not want to invest in Indonesia, and I stand with my government. But I will never buy an iPhone abroad again,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "For over a decade, Apple has consistently announced all-new hardware product lines, from the iPad in 2010 to the Vision Pro in 2023. But for the first time in 14 years, Apple failed to announce any major new hardware products in 2024, focusing solely on updates and refinements to its existing product lines.\n\n\n\nWhile Apple unveiled a large number of significant hardware refreshes in 2024, such as the redesigned iPad Pro and Mac mini, these were all evolutions of existing categories, not entirely new product lines. The only entirely new announcement of note, Apple Intelligence, was software-based and does not qualify as new hardware. This makes 2024 the first year since 2009 in which Apple did not release a completely new hardware product. Here's a look back at the major new products announced each year from 2010 to 2023:\n\n\n\n2024 stands out for its lack of a new category, focusing instead on enhancing existing devices and introducing new software features.\n\nIt's worth noting that many of Apple's product lines have reached a high level of maturity. Instead of creating entirely new categories, Apple is seemingly doubling down on perfecting its existing lineup, as demonstrated by the introduction of OLED display technology to the \u200ciPad Pro\u200c, the more refined design of the Apple Watch Series 10, or the M4 family of Apple silicon chips.\n\nWhile \u200cApple Vision Pro\u200c was announced in 2023, it did not launch until February 2024, and constitutes a major new \"spatial computing\" product line for the company. It demanded a whole new OS, accessory ecosystem, retail store space, and more. As a result, is likely that Vision Pro dominated Apple's focus in 2023 and 2024.\n\nSimilarly, Apple's pivot toward AI in the form of \u200cApple Intelligence\u200c was announced in June 2024. \u200cApple Intelligence\u200c seeks to reshape how users interact with their devices, introducing unprecedented levels of personalized automation and generation on Apple devices. Since \u200cApple Intelligence\u200c exists solely as software for existing product lines, Apple focused on expanding \u200cApple Intelligence\u200c support in 2024, exemplified by the introduction of the iPhone 16, \u200ciPhone 16\u200c Plus, and seventh-generation \u200ciPad mini\u200c, as well as bumping the entire Mac lineup up to 16GB of memory as standard.\n\nApple's long-rumored, but ill-fated, electric vehicle project, may also have diverted substantial resources before its reported cancellation. This effort, combined with the monumental development demands of \u200cApple Intelligence\u200c and the Vision Pro, likely consumed a significant portion of Apple's recent R&D capacity.\n\nMoreover, Apple's 2024 product lineup is still likely feeling the lingering effects of the global slowdown during COVID-19, as most Apple products operate on a development cycle of two to four years. These overlapping factors may explain why 2024 lacked the introduction of an entirely new hardware product line.\n\nCompounding this, the global tech market has seen slowing growth in consumer hardware, with many buyers opting to extend the lifecycle of their devices. It would therefore make sense that Apple has prioritized incremental upgrades such as the \u200cApple Pencil\u200c Pro and fourth-generation AirPods, over launching new product categories that require significant consumer adoption and investment.\n\n2025 is rumored to see the introduction of a smart home \"Command Center\" resembling a \u200cHomePod\u200c with a 7-inch display, which could constitute an all-new product line amid Apple's expected refocus on the smart home. Beyond this, no totally new hardware product lines are expected this year.",

            "content": "THE APPLE WATCH has evolved from simple smartphone companion to comprehensive fitness and health monitoring powerhouse since its debut nearly a decade ago. Today, the current smartwatch lineup covers all the bases. There\u2019s the versatile Series 10, adventure-ready Ultra 2, and a budget-friendly SE. Each brings its own set of capabilities to your wrist, from basic activity tracking to advanced metrics like electrocardiogram (ECG) readings\u2014all while seamlessly integrating with your iPhone.\n\nBest Apple Watch\n\nThe latest generation of Apple Watches showcases the brand\u2019s most sophisticated features to date. The Series 10 is slimmer and faster than ever, with a new depth gauge for more accurate water activities, plus sleep monitoring that can detect potential breathing disruptions linked to sleep apnea. Meanwhile, the Ultra 2 builds on its predecessor\u2019s rugged foundation with a brighter display and more powerful processor, making it even more capable for athletes.\n\nThese three options, plus the still-excellent Series 9, make up Apple\u2019s strongest lineup to date. But which Apple Watch is right for you? Whether you\u2019re a casual user looking to track daily activity, training for your first marathon, or hitting mountain trails, there\u2019s an Apple Watch built for your lifestyle\u2014and with a myriad of Apple Watch bands, you can tailor to different routines. We\u2019ve done extensive research and real-world testing to help you choose the right one. Here\u2019s how they stack up in pursuit of the best Apple Watch.\n\nWhat to Consider\n\nDisplay and Size\n\nApple Watch sizes vary across the lineup, with larger models generally offering more features and better battery life (we\u2019ll dive into those details later). Finding the right fit matters\u2014not just for comfort, but for how easily you can read the display walking down the street or during workouts. The Apple Watch SE is the smallest of the bunch, featuring an aluminum case available in 40 and 44 millimeters. It boasts an OLED Retina display and a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits, allowing you to see information outdoors.\n\n\n\nThe Series 10 comes in 42 and 46mm and is available in aluminum or a rugged titanium (for a higher price). Despite being more compact than the Ultra 2\u2019s 49mm frame, the Series 10\u2019s wide-angle display is actually larger and easier to read from different angles. With an always-on screen that hits 2,000 nits of brightness, it\u2019s readable even in direct sunlight. In our review of the Series 10, senior editor Brett Williams, NASM-CPT, PES noted how easy it is to quickly glance at information on the watch face, even from funky angles.\n\n\n\nFinally, the Ultra 2 features a 49mm titanium case and an always-on Retina display that has a maximum brightness of 3,000 nits, making it the brightest display in Apple\u2019s lineup. The Ultra 2 isn\u2019t just the largest Apple Watch\u2014it features the most distinct design, with a raised lip to protect the flat display and an Action button that you can program to perform various activities.\n\nFitness and Health Tracking\n\nThe current Apple Watch lineup shares a strong foundation of health and fitness features across all models. Each watch tracks daily activity rings, workouts, heart rate, and sleep patterns. With water resistance up to 50 meters (100 meters for the Ultra 2), every model is swim-friendly. They also offer crucial safety features, including fall detection, crash detection, and emergency SOS, which allows you to quickly make an emergency call by pressing and holding the watch\u2019s side button.\n\n\n\nWhile they share certain core features, Apple reserves its more advanced capabilities for the Series 10 and Ultra 2. These models offer the ECG app (not found on the SE) and water-focused features such as a depth gauge and temperature sensor. For hiking, all three watches support waypoints, backtracking, and elevation views, though the Ultra 2\u2019s more precise dual-frequency GPS makes it the better choice for serious backcountry hikers. The Ultra 2 also has an edge for diving, measuring depths up to 40 meters versus the Series 10\u2019s 6-meter limit (the SE isn't made for diving).\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the Series 10 and Ultra 2 lack a blood oxygen sensor\u2014something earlier models offered\u2014due to a patent dispute with medical device maker Masimo.\n\nBattery Life\n\nSince you\u2019ll likely be wearing your Apple Watch all day, battery life is crucial. The good news is you shouldn\u2019t have a problem getting through a full day no matter which model you go with. That includes receiving several notifications, tracking workouts, using GPS navigation, and running various apps\u2014with enough power left for sleep tracking at night.\n\n\n\nWhile Apple rates the Series 10\u2019s battery life at 18 hours (same for the SE), our testing showed it can actually push beyond the 24-hour mark. When you do need to top off, a fast-charging feature can take it from 0\u201380 percent in about 30 minutes, giving you all-day battery in the time it takes to eat breakfast.\n\n\n\nThe Ultra 2\u2019s battery life is in a league of its own thanks to its larger case. Apple rates it at 36 hours, but our testing found it\u2019s possible to go more than 48 hours between charging when tracking workouts and other daily activities. Switch to low-power mode and you can stretch that even further to 72 hours. It also supports the same fast charging as the Series 10, though its larger battery means it takes about an hour (versus 30 minutes) to get from 0\u201380 percent. That said, your mileage will vary depending on how you use it.\n\nDurability\n\nThe latest Apple Watch models are designed for everyday wear, allowing each one to withstand bumps, heat, cold, and water. However, some are more durable than others. As you\u2019d expect, the affordable SE offers the least durability. While it features water resistance up to 50 meters, strong aluminum construction, and an Ion-X glass display, it\u2019s not protected against dust, so it could get damaged at the beach.\n\n\n\nThe Series 10 offers better durability, particularly the more expensive titanium model, with an Ion-X display and water and dust resistance. But it\u2019s the Ultra 2 that delivers the most durability in Apple\u2019s lineup, with a titanium case, water and dust resistance, EN13319 certification for recreational scuba diving up to 40 meters, and a MIL-STD 810H certification, meaning it\u2019s been tested to survive high altitude, extreme temperatures, blowing sand, vibration, and shock. If you\u2019re doing an ultramarathon in Iceland, the Ultra 2 offers the best chance of survival.\n\nPrice\n\nHow much are you willing to spend for a smartwatch that has the features you want? The Apple Watch SE is a great starting point at $249, though it\u2019s often for less than $200\u2014perfect for first-time users who want core fitness tracking at an affordable price. If you\u2019re after more advanced features, the Series 10 starts at $399 for the aluminum model (or $699 for titanium), while the rugged Ultra 2 sits at $799. The SE and Series 10 with cellular bumps the price up to $299 and $499, respectively.\n\nHow We Selected\n\nOur editors have tested every generation of the Apple Watch since the first model released in 2015, putting them through their paces for everything they\u2019re designed to handle: marathon training, cycling, surfing, hiking, sleep tracking, and daily fitness routines. To identify the best Apple Watch, we relied on our previous experience testing and owning various models, as well as prior expert coverage on Men\u2019s Health. We considered features like display and size, fitness and health tracking, battery life, and durability. Finally, the price of each model was another important factor, since the most expensive option isn\u2019t always the best fit for every user\u2019s needs and lifestyle.",

            "content": "Apple's introduction of the Dynamic Island in 2022 for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max was greeted with a combination of excitement, curiosity and laughter. The feature, which surfaces up system alerts and shows live updates on apps running in the background, was overshadowed by its name.\n\nOn social media, people poked fun at the name Dynamic Island saying it sounded like an offbeat tourist destination. Apple enthusiasts worried that name didn't have the finesse that other Apple feature names, like AirDrop or FaceTime, had. Popular YouTuber MKBHD even offered a backhanded compliment in a post on Twitter that said it was \"the most Apple thing they've ever Appled.\"\n\nWhatever your thoughts on the name, the Dynamic Island has managed to win over fans (apparently even some Android users, too). The pill-shaped cutout and alert interface replaced the much-maligned iPhone notch that housed the True Depth camera system required for Face ID.\n\nUnlike the notch, which was a static physical cutout, the Dynamic Island is an area on top of the iPhone's display, which serves as an interactive hub and shape-shifts depending on the context. Within the Dynamic Island, two discreet cutouts remain for the camera and sensors, but the surrounding area is an interactive canvas of sorts for various content.\n\nApple's decision to add the Dynamic Island as a now-signature feature on the iPhone marked a departure from its rival Android phone makers. The latter opted to replace the screen notches on their devices with hole-punch cutouts for the selfie cameras. Through the Dynamic Island, Apple found a way to use the area around its cutout for system alerts, app controls, and tracking live activities, among other functions.\n\nThe Dynamic Island shows different icons and animations. During a FaceTime call, it shows a green camera icon on the left side. Celso Bulgatti/CNET\n\nWhen idle, the Dynamic Island is a fairly unobtrusive black area that takes up about an inch of screen real estate, which is smaller than the previous notch. Depending on what apps you're using, any background activities running and iPhone system alerts, the Dynamic Island will change into one of three shapes: a long oval, a large pop-up window and a combination of medium-sized oval and circle.\n\nWhen using a single app like Apple Music, it becomes a long oval and shows an album cover on one end and a waveform for the song being played. In this state, if you tap on the Dynamic Island, it'll open the Music app to the current song. If you press and hold on the Dynamic Island, it'll pop out into a larger window spanning the top of your iPhone with mini-playback controls. Likewise, if you receive a call the pill-shaped cutout lengthens to display caller information.\n\nIf you have two apps open at once, like the Music app and Apple Maps, the Dynamic Island will look like a lowercase letter \"i\" on its side. One of the apps, Maps, has its own medium-sized oval to show turn-by-turn directions. The second app, Music (in this case) is off to the right in its own circle -- displaying the album artwork.\n\nThe form the Dynamic Island takes when receiving a call. Apple/Screenshot by Clifford Colby/CNET\n\nBecause it integrates with third-party apps, the Dynamic Island can also show a real-time estimate for your Uber's arrival as well as food delivery orders -- and when you press and hold on the Dynamic Island, it'll physically size up into a pop-up window to show that information.\n\nThe Dynamic Island also provides visual feedback for privacy indicators (such as when the microphone or camera is active), AirDrop file transfers, or Apple Pay transactions, among other system functions.\n\nHere are some of the things the Dynamic Island can show:\n\nSystem alerts\n\nTurn-by-turn navigation with Apple Maps or Google Maps\n\nContact information and call length for phone calls\n\nBattery percentage when your iPhone or AirPods are charging\n\nFind My Alerts\n\nScreen recording duration\n\nCover art when playing songs from Apple Music\n\nTransit card payments\n\nLive sport scores\n\nFlight information\n\nTimer length\n\nPayments with Face ID\n\nFiles sent with AirDrop\n\nMute icon\n\nLive activities for services like Uber\n\nThe ability to dynamically change shape and display relevant content enhances the overall user experience. Since its launch, Apple has trickled down the feature to its base models which means the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus also feature the shape-morphing cutout in addition to the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.

            "content": "The first half of 2025 is set to be a busy one for Apple. Here's all of the rumors so far, including the iPhone SE 4, M4 Ultra in a Mac Pro, and more!\n\nApple started off its Apple Silicon transition in the middle of a global pandemic, so those first couple of years were out of balance. As we enter 2025, a pattern has emerged along with a ton of the usual rumors.\n\nIt doesn't seem like there will be many surprises in 2025 as Apple bumps chipsets and releases updated versions of old products, but there's at least one device that could surprise us early in the year.\n\nHere's how the rumors have laid out 2025 so far. Timing is still a question, as Apple could always shove out most of these products at a single event in March and the rest in June, but for now, it seems they may be spread out a bit.\n\nJanuary to February: potential for M4 MacBook Air\n\nA rumor in late December 2024 suggests that Apple won't be taking its week-of-releases approach with its spring 2025 product lineup. Instead, the M4 MacBook Air will usher in the new year on its own.\n\nThe timing of this product is unknown other than being first, so given Apple's previous release patterns, it is expected to be a January or February release. The M4 MacBook Air will be released with a 13-inch and 15-inch model similar to the M3 generation released in March 2024.\n\nM4 in MacBook Air will make it an excellent entry model for most\n\nApple is at least testing the unannounced M4 MacBook Air models thanks to code discovered suggesting as much. The leak also showed evidence of the new models coming with ultra-wide webcams with Center Stage support.\n\nOutside of the webcam change, there's not much else expected beyond what the M4 provides like Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. The M4 has shown a 25% performance boost compared to the M3.\n\nApple is likely to keep the pricing structure identical, with the base model offering a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $1,099. Upgrades will likely max out with 32GB of RAM and 2TB of storage for $2,099.\n\nMarch: iPad and iPhone SE 4\n\nIf Apple makes it all the way to March without a new product announcement, then the M4 MacBook Air will likely arrive in early March. If that's the case, the following products will arrive in April or May, but for the sake of this article, let's assume we're on time for a March release.\n\nUp next would be the iPhone SE 4 and new iPad updates. We've already dug deep into the potential affordable Apple Intelligence powerhouse that iPhone SE 4 could be, not to mention the 48MP camera and OLED display, so let's dive into the iPads.\n\niPhone SE 4 would have an iPhone 14 design with a single rear camera\n\nThe base model iPad, officially called the 10.9-inch iPad, hasn't been updated since 2022. Rumors suggest Apple won't do much with this product other than add an Apple Intelligence-compatible chipset, perhaps the A18.\n\nHowever, there is a bit of a curveball with the iPad 11 \u2014 there may be two models. These models are represented by codes J481 and J482, and these could signify cellular and non-cellular models, or it could mean different sizes in the base model for the first time.\n\nThere have been rumors about an updated iPad Air with M4 ever since Apple put M2 in the product in May 2024. While it seems somewhat implausible that Apple would both short cycle the iPad Air and render parts of the M4 iPad Pro product line redundant, it isn't totally unheard of.\n\nApple has previously seen some overlap between the iPad Air and iPad Pro when it was transitioning the products to M-series chipsets, but both upgrades came at a more reasonable pace. The only reason Apple would introduce M4 in iPad Air so soon is if the rumored M5 iPad Pro is actually coming in the second half of 2025.\n\nNothing else would change with the new iPad Air beyond the M4 chipset and what that brings to the device.\n\nApril to May: iOS 18.4 and a potential Home Hub\n\nOur timeline for Apple's first half of 2025 is speculation, of course, so we could see any of the previously mentioned hardware as late as April or May. Otherwise, it could be a quiet lead-up to WWDC beyond final operating system updates in the iOS 18 cycle.\n\nThe Home Hub could actually be a standalone screen instead of a new HomePod\n\nRumors have previously indicated that the so-called Apple Home Hub could arrive in the first half of 2025, but one reliable source pushed that back to the second half of the year. If it is still due in the first half, it could be announced at any time through WWDC in June.\n\nThe initial Home Hub release would be a basic monitor with features and design similar but distinct from an iPad. The square-ish sub-10-inch OLED display would be carried around the home and placed on stands to display information, video, photos, or widgets.\n\nThe Home Hub could be revealed early in 2025, then the expensive AI-driven robotic arm stand could arrive later in 2025, which would meet both rumors' release windows. New HomePods and an Apple TV could also arrive any time in 2025, perhaps alongside the new Home Hub, and they all would have Apple-designed Wi-Fi chips.\n\nApple Intelligence is expected to get its final big feature release prior to WWDC in June. The iOS 18.4 and other parallel operating system updates will introduce app intent frameworks that will give Siri and Apple Intelligence much more context for requests.\n\nRecall WWDC 2024 when Apple first announced its AI initiatives and showcased an example where the user asks when their mother needs to be picked up from the airport. Siri was able to answer by gathering information from an email, a calendar event, and text conversations.\n\nDevelopers have been able to build for the new app intent system since iOS 18.2 was in beta in November. That said, it may be some time before users notice a drastic difference in their experience with Apple Intelligence.\n\nJune: WWDC 2025\n\nApple's Worldwide Developer Conference used to be almost exclusively used for software and operating system announcements. That has changed in recent years as Mac Studio, Mac Pro, and select other products are revealed during the event.\n\nMac Pro will likely stick to its old design for M4 Ultra\n\nWWDC 2025 will reveal iOS 19 and the rest of the new updates, but we're not getting into that here. All signs point to M4 Ultra, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro arriving in June during the event.\n\nM4 Max has proven to be quite the powerhouse, so hopes are high for M4 Ultra. There is a very high chance Apple will change very little about the Mac Studio and Mac Pro beyond the new chipset.\n\nSome still hope for new uses like proprietary graphics cards for the PCI-E slots in Mac Pro, or perhaps a miniaturized Mac Pro redesign. However, rumors haven't suggested anything like that for 2025.\n\nSecond half of 2025: iPhone 17, M5, and more\n\nEven after a packed first half of 2025, Apple will continue its fast pace of product releases through to the end of the year. The iPhone 17 and Apple Watch Series 11 upgrades will occur in September, followed by M5 Mac updates through the fall.\n\niPhone 17 could come in a new slim model\n\nThe Home Hub is a bit of a wild card for 2025, but it isn't the only product facing a potential reveal in the year. Apple Vision Pro has a slim chance of getting some kind of update or preview for what's next.\n\nEither Apple could quietly re-release the same headset with M5 for late 2025 or early 2026, or it could announce the lower-priced model for the same window. It is unclear even with the available rumors what Apple intends to do, but we expect Apple Vision Pro to remain a product in the lineup through to early 2026.\n\nFinally, an AirTag update is expected somewhere in 2025 with a new Ultra Wideband chip. It will likely retain the same coin shape and have better long distance precision tracking.\n\nStay tuned to AppleInsider as more rumors, leaks, and analysis come in to shine some light into Apple's busy 2025. It could be one of the most dense product release cycles yet.",

            "content": "Watching companies set individual records on revenue or earnings is always a great sign for investors, as it indicates the company is reaching new heights. However, there are also some metrics you don't want to see companies setting new records in, like debt or valuation.\n\nApple (AAPL -0.11%) has recently set a new record, but it's not for a good reason. I think this is a huge signal for investors to pay attention to in 2025 because it could result in a retreat for the stock price.\n\nApple's growth has slowed to a snail's pace\n\nApple has been among the top consumer brands for a long time. Its iPhones are in the hands of the majority of smartphone users in the U.S., who also wear Apple's watches and AirPods, and use Apple computers. While Apple has been dominant for some time, it seems to have peaked.\n\nApple hasn't released meaningful new products or technology for some time, which has caused the company to become fairly stagnant. iPhone sales, the company's largest segment by revenue, haven't increased at a rapid pace for some time.\n\nYear Q4 iPhone Revenue YOY Growth 2024 $46.2 billion 5.5% 2023 $43.8 billion 2.8% 2022 $42.6 billion 9.5%\n\nMid-single-digit percentage revenue growth is a key indicator that a company has reached maturity. This growth rate isn't likely to change unless Apple launches a new product or bumps its prices. However, the company is trading as if its revenue is growing a mid-20% pace or more.\n\nApple's stock has now reached a new decade-high valuation level despite not showing much growth. Although Apple's stock has traded for a higher price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio than this during its life as a public company, this is the first time it has traded this high in its modern state (when iPhone sales are a significant chunk of its revenue).\n\nI've also overlayed Apple's revenue growth rate to show that the previous time Apple was valued around 40 times trailing earnings, its revenue was growing at more than 50% year over year. With Apple's revenue now growing at a much slower rate, this valuation seems to be getting out of hand because it won't be able to grow its way into a more reasonable price tag.\n\nAs a result, Apple probably will return to a more historically normal valuation level through a price decline.\n\nHow much of a decline could investors expect?\n\nWith Apple growing at a slower pace than the broader market, there's no reason why Apple deserves a premium over the S&P 500 (^GSPC -1.71%). With the S&P 500 trading at a trailing P/E ratio of 25.2 and a forward P/E of 21.9, I'd expect Apple stock to trade around those levels if it continues to put up mundane growth.\n\nWall Street analysts project Apple's revenue will rise 6% in fiscal year 2025 (ending September 2025) and 8% in fiscal year 2026, so this slow but steady growth is expected to continue during the next few years.\n\nIf Apple's stock falls to a P/E ratio of 30, the stock price would need to decline by nearly 30%. A P/E ratio of 25 (around the S&P 500's valuation) would imply a fall of more than 40%. Now, these exact declines probably won't happen because Apple's earnings will grow each quarter, which will help its P/E ratio come down. However, there likely needs to be some amount of price correction, as years of growth have already been baked into the stock.\n\nThere aren't many reasons to own Apple over other big tech companies. It's growing slowly and is expensively valued. All it really has going for it as an investment is its name. Investors should think about moving on from Apple stock, as even some of its biggest proponents (like Warren Buffett) have started selling Apple shares during the past year.",

McConnell attained ace status after shooting down his fifth communist MiG-15 jet during the Korean War, according to the Air Force.\n\nNearly three months later, McConnell would have 16 confirmed kills to his credit and the title of the highest-scoring jet ace in American history.\n\nThe park comes via a 2021 Statewide Park Development and Community Revitalization Program (Proposition 68) grant from the state\u2019s Department of Parks and Recreation.\n\nLocated east of the school district's administrative offices on Navajo Road and north of Pah-Ute Road, the nearly $8.4 million park will include a running track with a synthetic surface, a football field with lighting, a baseball field, and two soccer fields, as well as an all-abilities inclusive playground and walkway.\n\nOther features include a small picnic shelter, large picnic shelter, dog park with big and small areas, restroom, parking lot with lighting, and landscaping and lighting throughout the park.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to bringing this incredible park to our community and plan to host a ribbon cutting on Veterans Day 2025,\u201d town officials said.\n\nIndustrial projects\n\nIn the North Apple Valley Industrial Specific Plan and beyond, the town has approved over 8 million square feet of industrial development.\n\nOn track to break ground first, Lecangs, a Loctek company, will soon construct a 1.2-million-square-foot warehouse distribution center.\n\n\u201cThese projects not only bring hundreds of jobs for our local workforce but extend critical infrastructure, spurring opportunities for more commercial and residential development,\u201d according to town officials.\n\nFostering the arts, hiring more deputies\n\n\u201cAs we welcome these new businesses to Apple Valley, we\u2019re also making strides to enhance the safety and well-being of our community. Measure P, which was approved in the November election, plays a key role in these efforts,\u201d the town said.\n\nBeginning in April 2025, Apple Valley residents will see a 1% sales tax increase. Although funding won\u2019t reach the town until July, the Town Council plans to allocate these funds to hire eight to 10 additional sheriff deputies for the Apple Valley Police Department.\n\n\u201cFrom fostering the arts, expanding recreational spaces, welcoming new businesses, and increasing public safety, we continue to grow together, keeping Apple Valley a place to live, work, and play,\u201d town officials said.\n\nDaily Press reporter Rene Ray De La Cruz may be reached at RDeLaCruz@VVDailyPress.com.

            "content": "Apple's first-generation Vision Pro headset may have now ceased production, following reports of reduced demand and production cuts earlier in the year.\n\n\n\nIn October, The Information's Wayne Ma reported that Apple had abruptly reduced production of the Vision Pro headset ahead of potential plans to stop making the current version of the device completely by the end of 2024. With the year now coming to an end, this means that the device may no longer be in active production.\n\nCiting multiple people \"directly involved\" in making components for the headset, the report said that the scaling back of production began in the early summer. This indicated that Apple now has a sufficient number of Vision Pro units in its inventory to meet demand for the device's remaining lifespan through to 2025. Historically, it is not unusual for Apple to do this with low-demand products, such as the iPhone 12 mini.\n\nThe Vision Pro is widely reported to have seen weak demand due to insufficient content and its high price point. The Information said that Vision Pro suppliers have now produced enough components for between 500,000 to 600,000 headsets. Some factories suspended production of Vision Pro components as early as May based on Apple's weak sales forecasts, and warehouses remain filled with tens of thousands of undelivered parts.\n\nApple is said to have told Luxshare, a Chinese company that serves as the Vision Pro's assembler, that it would need to wind down production in November. Luxshare was making around 1,000 Vision Pro headsets per day as of October, which was half that being produced at its peak. Apple will apparently still be able to resume Vision Pro production if sales pick up since the production lines are not yet due to be dismantled.\n\nMoreover, Apple has purportedly suspended work on the original second-generation Vision Pro for at least a year to focus on developing a lower-cost headset. Interestingly, Apple told suppliers to prepare to build four million low-cost headsets over the entire lifespan of the future product. This is half the total number of Vision Pros that Apple told suppliers to produce, suggesting that sales expectations are even lower for the cheaper headset.\n\nWeak demand for the Vision Pro has been attributed to its high $3,499 price point and insufficient content ecosystem. Apple CEO Tim Cook described the device as an \"early-adopter product,\" targeting users interested in cutting-edge technology rather than the broader mass market.\n\nAlthough Apple's work on the second-generation Vision Pro has apparently stalled, there are some indications that the company could release \"an incremental update to the product with limited changes to its physical design,\" such as a chip upgrade, according to The Information. Corroborating this, Kuo and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman have indicated that a more iterative second-generation Vision Pro is in active development, adding the introduction of an M5 chip and Apple Intelligence. Gurman has projected the device could launch between fall 2025 and spring 2026. This updated model is expected to reuse many components from the first-generation Vision Pro to offset the surplus inventory in Apple's supply chain.",

            "content": "ZDNET\n\nWearables are becoming an increasingly popular way to monitor your health. Smart rings like Oura can detect changes in vital signs that might indicate sickness, and smartwatches, including the Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy Watch, can identify sleep apnea. AirPods can now test your hearing; even irregular menstruation data collected by fitness bands can reveal early signs of bigger health issues.\n\nBut in some cases, wearables go beyond routine health monitoring to save users' lives. A 2023 study found that smartwatches are highly accurate when it comes to detecting arrhythmias. Through heart rate, emergency, and fall detection features, the Apple Watch helped several people in dire situations in 2024.\n\nAlso: The best Apple Watches\n\nHere are eight instances where the Apple Watch detected critical information in the nick of time.\n\n1. Unlikely heart failure\n\nMemphis-based Kamron Jones' Apple Watch frequently sent him alerts indicating his heart rate was abnormally high, which eventually prompted him to visit the hospital. At the time, he had assumed he was feeling low-energy due to a recent case of pneumonia. But after several tests, doctors determined he was experiencing heart failure.\n\nAt only 22, Jones didn't expect the diagnosis and wouldn't have considered it possible without his Apple Watch. Jones told Fox 13 that he would have ignored his mild symptoms if not for the watch's notifications -- at which point it may have been too late to get the help he needed.\n\n2. Surprise heart issue\n\nFrank Haggerty's Apple Watch SE sounded an alarm when he was asleep, warning him that his heart rate was around 30 beats per minute -- much lower than the normal range of 60 to 100 (when sleeping, heart rate usually doesn't drop below 40 or 50).\n\nDespite feeling fine, he was rushed to the emergency room, where a doctor found he had a \"complete heart block,\" or an electrical system malfunction of the heart, according to cardiologist Dr. Keith Wolfson. Haggerty didn't know he had a heart issue and wasn't experiencing any symptoms at the hospital, which shocked his doctors.\n\nAlso: The best smartwatches\n\n\"Quite frankly, had I not had the watch on, I wouldn't be sitting here today,\" he told CBS. \"It's my best friend, I say that in front of my wife.\"\n\n3. Carbon monoxide poisoning\n\nBut Apple Watches don't just catch heart issues -- they can also provide emergency care. Natalie Nasatka, a Delaware student, experienced a carbon monoxide leak in her apartment that rendered her unconscious. The gas is especially dangerous as it is odorless, colorless, and flavorless, making it almost impossible to identify without a carbon monoxide detector.\n\nNasatka told CBS that as she was fading, she hit the SOS button on her Apple Watch, which dialed 911. She woke up to firefighters entering her apartment, who were able to confirm the leak with their own detectors. Had she not been able to quickly contact emergency help, she may not have survived.\n\nLearn more about the warning signs of carbon monoxide poisoning and ensure you have a proper detector in place by reviewing the CDC guidelines.\n\n4. Stuck at sea\n\nAustralian surfer Rick Shearman was caught up in rough seas off the coast of Byron Bay, treading water more than half a mile from shore. Unable to see his partner on the beach, he used the SOS emergency call on his Apple Watch Ultra. Through his watch, he was able to speak to emergency services via 000, Australia's 911 equivalent, and direct a rescue helicopter to his location as he was getting pulled further out to sea.\n\n\"If it wasn't for being able to access that service in my watch, I'd probably be bobbing out somewhere in international waters by now,\" he told ABC North Coast.\n\n5. Mid-flight alarm\n\nGary Smith's Apple Watch acted up on a flight home to Nashville. As he told the Independent, Smith hadn't been feeling well recently and was often fatigued and out of breath, but doctors had only told him to keep an eye on his symptoms -- not that he was in any immediate danger. As he tried to rest on the flight, his Apple Watch warned him that his heart rate was fluctuating.\n\nSmith had been skeptical of the accuracy of the watch's heart-monitoring features, thinking of them as more of a \"gimmick.\" He assumed the watch was malfunctioning.\n\nAlso: Apple Watch Series 9 review\n\nBut once he got home, he ended up in emergency treatment and was told he needed an angiogram to diagnose his heart's activity. After that, his symptoms worsened; he was going cold and losing his vision in spurts. His watch continued to identify an irregular rhythm, which an electrocardiogram (ECG) had also confirmed.\n\nUltimately, Smith got a pacemaker -- which also conveniently syncs with his Apple devices.\n\n6. Irregular heartbeat\n\nOn his way to the airport, Peter Moore felt lightheaded. The Apple Watch wearer's phone pinged with a \"low heart rate\" warning, saying his heart rate had dropped to 32.\n\n\"It was insistent in its notifications that something wasn't right,\" Moore told KTLA. When he got to the hospital, his doctors were alarmed and immediately told him he needed a pacemaker.\n\n\"His watch had a big role in saving his life,\" Moore's cardiac electrophysiologist, Omid Yousefian, told KTLA. Like many other physicians, he advised that wearables are ideal for tracking signs like heart rate, but that they aren't equipped to detect larger events like heart attacks.\n\n7. Not exactly a panic attack\n\nIn another case of atrial fibrillation (AFib), Delhi-based Sneha Saha felt her heart rate accelerate one evening, thinking she was having a panic attack. But when slowing her breathing didn't help, she put on her Apple Watch 7 to see if it could offer any insights.\n\nThe wearable immediately advised her to see a doctor, which she initially ignored, but followed through when her heart rate continued to drop later in the evening.\n\nAlso: I finally found an Apple Watch band that fits my small wrist - and it's only $10\n\n\"I would not have gone to the hospital and would have lost my life if the Apple Watch had not alerted me of the serious condition around midnight,\" Saha told Times of India. \"Everything I had to tell the doctors was based on Apple Watch readings.\"\n\n8. A freak bike accident\n\nRiding a Citi Bike home in the rain in New York City, Eric Zollinger hit what he told the New York Post was an \"8 inch deep\" pothole full of water. He flew off his bike and onto the sidewalk. Though he made it home okay, he then experienced a serious nosebleed as a result of the crash that left him dizzy and caused him to faint in his bathroom, where he hit the side of the tub as he collapsed.\n\nThat triggered his Apple Watch's automatic fall detection feature. When he woke up, he heard a 911 operator speaking to him from his wrist.\n\n\"I don't know how things would have gone for me if the watch hadn't alerted me,\" Zollinger said.",

Future Publishing via Getty Images\n\nExperts recently urged Apple device users to update to the latest version of iOS 18 despite their fears of AI or otherwise, as a bug in the non-updated software could leave customers vulnerable to malicious actors.\n\nThe bug could be exploited by hackers to access users\u2019 sensitive data without a trace \u2014 and the longer people wait to update, the higher the risk.",

            "content": "My first Apple product pre-dates the internet; when I was in high school, our family computer was one of the first Macs. Since then, I've owned nearly every iPhone as well as numerous iPads, MacBooks, Apple Watches, AirPods, AirTags, and a HomePod mini. I've been writing and/or podcasting about Apple products since 2010, and I even worked a brief stint at the Apple Store.\n\nSo, yes, I'm firmly ensconced in Apple's walled garden \u2013 but that doesn't mean I don't feel some boredom with the iPhone's lack of originality from year to year.\n\nSame old, same old\n\nThe iPhone has looked the same for several years now, especially the Pro models in the most neutral colors. And sure, maybe you don't think form factor is that important, but the functionality of these devices hasn't changed a whole lot in recent years, either.\n\nIn 2024, Apple sought to drum up significant hype around Apple Intelligence in order to get people to upgrade to the iPhone 16, but its latest flagship device shipped with no Apple Intelligence features to speak of whatsoever. With each subsequent iOS update, a few new software features have been added, but Apple's AI rollout continues to be behind the curve.\n\nApple Intelligence has disappointed so far (Image credit: Future / Apple)\n\nI realize that we've reached a point where phones are pretty darn good, and we can no longer expect dramatic updates on an annual basis. But still, there's no denying that we're seeing more innovation from other mobile companies than we are from Apple right now. And I mean that in terms of both hardware and software. Allow me to explain.\n\nThe cameras question\n\nThe main reason I like to get my hands on the latest iPhone model (and the Pro version at that) is for its camera. Though, at this point, the technological improvements are incremental, each year's flagship model tends to offer some kind of meaningful upgrade over the previous one.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro, for example, has 5X optical zoom. This level of zoom was previously exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro Max, which I did purchase but found a bit large for my hands. For me, getting 5X zoom on a smaller phone was enough of a reason to upgrade this year, though I can't say I'd recommend that anyone else do the same.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nI say this because there are probably better camera phones out there, and certainly there are cameras with more advanced features than the flagship iPhone. The Google Pixel 9 Pro, for example, was selected as our best phone of 2024, and its great cameras and fully-formed AI software were a big part of our awarding it that distinction.\n\nI'd really like to get my hands on the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, too, which I hear is like having a complete camera bag in your pocket (indeed, the Ultra features prominently on our current list of the best camera phones).\n\nImages of the solar eclipse captured with an iPhone 15 Pro Max (left) and an Android phone (right) (Image credit: Karen Freeman / Future)\n\nI was in the path of totality for the 2024 eclipse, and a bunch of us sat in our driveways to observe the phenomenon. My neighbor used her Android phone (I'm not sure which one) to take eclipse photos, while I used my iPhone 15 Pro Max. We both took photos from our driveways and shared our best photos with one another. My iPhone photo is on the left, and my neighbor's Android photo is on the right. I realize that my neighbor's photo involved a lot of post-capture AI processing, but still, it was a much better rendition of what I actually saw with my own eyes than my iPhone photo was. I felt let down by my iPhone.\n\nWhere's your foldable, Apple?\n\n(Image credit: Lance Ulanoff / Future)\n\nAnother key distinction between Apple and rival Android phone makers is their approach to foldable phones. Apple, for its part, seems uninterested.\n\nI find myself intrigued by the foldable form factor. I like the idea of carrying a compact device that I can unfold to reveal a larger screen. Do I need one? No, but I'd still like to have the option of purchasing one from my brand of choice.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is our favorite Samsung phone overall, and its screen unfolds to the size of a tablet. I don't think I'd need a tablet at all if I had a phone like this, but Apple has so far appeared reluctant to join the foldable market (a foldable iPhone has been rumored for many years, but it's never materialized and doesn't look likely to do so until at least 2027).\n\nSo, why do I still have an iPhone?\n\n(Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)\n\nSo, if Apple's AI software is falling behind and there's no intriguing new iPhone design on the horizon, why do I continue to stick by the Cupertino giant? Well, as I alluded to in the introduction to this piece, it's all about the walled garden.\n\nWhile I'm definitely intrigued by other phones and a bit bored by the iPhone, there's no denying that the connection between my devices makes my life run more smoothly. I love my Apple Watch 10 for its fitness and sleep tracking capabilities, its convenient notifications, and, ahem, its ability to remind me where I left my iPhone. Without the iPhone, there's no Apple Watch.\n\nI also love my M2 MacBook Air, AirPods Pro 2, HomePod mini, AirTags, and iPad mini 6; nothing similar from other companies tempts me at all, and they all work together so seamlessly. Setting up each device is easy, and they all \"talk\" to each other to keep everything in my life organized and synchronized.\n\nSo, yes, I'll be sticking with Apple for some time yet \u2013 I'm just hoping that the company surprises and delights me with next year's iPhone models.",

            "content": "Wesley is back to being a full-time iPad Pro user, but there's a splash of Apple Vision Pro and a mountain of other tech involved in the day-to-day. Here's how he gets work done at AppleInsider.\n\nIf there's one thing I like writing about, it's my setup and workflows. There's a lot going on here, and unless you're new here, you might already know I'm all in on iPad and a little obsessed with Apple Vision Pro.\n\nMy setup and workflows don't reflect the rest of my colleagues, and that's fine. I'm happy that I get to figure out new and interesting ways to tackle problems that might otherwise be solved by simply using a Mac.\n\nIt's been a bit of a rollercoaster of tech these past few years, but regardless of my experiments, I always landed back at the iPad. Even as Apple Vision Pro attempts to prove its place in the lineup, the iPad has solidified as the future of computing, at least for me.\n\nA quick recap\n\nWhen I joined AppleInsider in 2019, I was already deeply involved in the \"iPad as a computer replacement\" mentality. Despite being incredibly into the idea, I fell in love with the Mac again after Apple Silicon took off, so I switched to a 14-inch MacBook Pro, at least until Stage Manager debuted.\n\nThings have come a long way since December 2019\n\nIf you're keeping score, that's two years of iPad followed by a year of Mac, and now another two years of iPad. Apple Vision Pro swung in but couldn't make a significant mark on my workflows, especially after the introduction of Apple Intelligence.\n\nToday, I've got several pieces of technology in my lineup, and each serves a specific purpose in my work and life. So, let's discuss each.\n\nM4 iPad Pro with Nano Texture and an iPad mini 7\n\nThe king of my setup is the M4 iPad Pro (check best prices), Apple's best take on the naked robotic core to date. Meaning, it can take on any form it needs based on what it is paired with.\n\niPads all the way down\n\nThe iPad Pro is an excellent tablet with its thin and lightweight design, large 13-inch display, and Apple Pencil Pro. I don't often use the iPad Pro as just a tablet, but being able to pull it close and manipulate work with a finger or stylus is excellent.\n\nAttach the Magic Keyboard (on sale at Amazon), and the iPad Pro becomes a laptop. That's when I get to take the iPad with me to the living room, my favorite brewery, a hotel room, or a picnic table and get work done with a trackpad and keyboard.\n\nSlap the iPad into one of many magnetic stands, and the iPad can become a floating display. I can pair it with a gamepad and use it as a little TV, or have it by my bedside for reading or watching media.\n\niPad Pro can be a tablet, laptop, or desktop depending on context\n\nSet iPad Pro into a magnetic stand and connect a Thunderbolt cable, and it becomes a desktop computer with a second 27-inch 5K monitor. I use a StarTech Thunderbolt 4 dock to connect the iPad Pro to a Studio Display, Magic Trackpad, ASUS TUF capture card, Keychron Q3 Pro SE mechanical keyboard, and a Samsung 1TB SSD.\n\nThe capture card was purchased as part of a greater experiment that didn't quite make it all the way to fruition. I wanted to see how streaming would work with iPad Pro as the managing computer, and it worked for the most part, but capturing audio, video, and microphone proved challenging, but possible with some workarounds. Perhaps I'll write about it one day.\n\nFor now, it still works as an excellent way to get a game console like Nintendo Switch or PlayStation 5 onto the Studio Display through the attached iPad. I can use the setup to capture incoming video and audio too, which would be great if I ever wanted to get into making videos of gameplay.\n\niPad Pro can even be a monitor for Nintendo Switch\n\nThe great thing about having a single cable connect to my entire desk setup was being able to easily swap the iPad Pro for the 14-inch MacBook Pro and record the AppleInsider Podcast. I traded that MacBook in for an M4 Mac mini, which I'll get into later.\n\nI love working from the iPad Pro despite Apple's continued insistence on kneecapping the operating system and software with arbitrary limits. Every year, Apple manages to address one or two pro user complaints, but it's not guaranteed.\n\nSince the 13-inch iPad Pro represents my workplace, I have taken to using a second iPad that's smaller, but still can do most of what I need. That tablet is the iPad mini 7, Apple's best iPad-as-a-tablet in its lineup thanks to its power and form factor.\n\niPad mini 7 is a great pocket companion\n\nThe iPad mini is my personal computer that goes with me everywhere. Its display is bigger and more square than the iPhone, so it's perfect for viewing media, reading text, or playing games.\n\nWhen I'm working, the iPad mini is with me at the desk, but it is often turned off. When I need a second display for whatever reason, that's when the iPad mini is pulled in.\n\nMy iPhone acts as a data viewer, like showing battery levels, rain, or now playing music on the office HomePods thanks to StandBy, so no, the iPad mini isn't doing that either.\n\nI'll admit, the iPad mini is a bit redundant at the desk, but I'm happy it's there when I need it. Plus, if I want to take a video I'm watching with me or something similar, I can grab it from its stand and walk away.\n\niPad mini would be great for handwritten Journal entries, hint hint Apple\n\nThat's four active displays at my desk in front of my eyes at any time. Honestly, that style of setup is a remnant of the pre-Apple Vision Pro that could change in the future.\n\nHaving two iPads becomes much more useful when I'm away from the desk. Since I don't have the Studio Display with me, I like having my primary work on the 13-inch iPad Pro and have the iPad mini as a secondary display.\n\nA desk-filled office\n\nThe desk setup is meant to be somewhat modular. I work from an L-shaped desk by Uplift that has proven to be a favorite. I turn to the right side of the desk to podcast, that way I'm facing a wall of foam.\n\nMy main desk offers plenty of space for spatial computing\n\nBehind me is a standing desk by Flexispot. I also use the C7 chair.\n\nThat second desk is my photography station. I place different mats and backdrops to provide different styles for my product photography that you've undoubtedly seen across AppleInsider. You'll usually notice it's mine because of my tendency to use darker color palettes and moody lighting.\n\nA third table, that I think is technically also a desk, is used to hold extra equipment, upcoming review products, and my printer. Below the desk is a bunch of storage containers filled with cables, HomeKit items, keyboard parts, and more. The rolling cart covered with stickers is more of the same.\n\nA bookshelf in the opposite corner of my office contains various Apple and video game memorabilia. But most importantly, it's where my Mac mini lives.\n\nM4 Mac mini\n\nFunny enough, there's not much to say about the M4 Mac mini (on sale now). It exists solely to record podcasts without hassle.\n\nMy M4 Mac mini exists almost solely for podcasting\n\nThe job was previously held by my 14-inch MacBook Pro, but I figured that display was being wasted in clamshell mode on a bookshelf.\n\nWhen I need to access the Mac mini, I wake it using a Magic Mouse that's on the far right side of my desk. My Apple Watch wakes it, provided it hasn't been too long since its last wake.\n\nThen, if I need to do anything with the Mac mini, I put on the Apple Vision Pro and interface from there. It's basically just for podcasts and testing functions for articles.\n\nA portable monitor sits at the base of the bookshelf behind closed doors so the Mac mini has some kind of display if needed. Although, even if it is awake, I almost never look at it.\n\nMaking Mac mini portable is simple with an external battery\n\nI'm happy to have the M4 Mac mini. It'll serve as a good access point to macOS, and at least it can run a Gamecube emulator if I want it to.\n\nOne thing I am experimenting with and will revisit in 2025 is the Mac mini and making it portable. It makes for a neat way to access the Mac through a Virtual Display without a need for an outlet.\n\nApple Vision Pro\n\nI've been dancing around Apple Vision Pro so far because it sits at an interesting spot in my workflow. It constantly competes for my favorite piece of technology versus the iPad Pro, but falls just short.\n\nApple Vision Pro is still a bit early for prime time\n\nWhen Apple Vision Pro was released in February, it quickly became my primary computer because it could do everything my M1 iPad Pro could. However, the M4 iPad Pro stole the spotlight after that through review needs, then Apple Intelligence sealed the deal.\n\nSee, Apple Intelligence still isn't available on Apple Vision Pro, and I need it for my workflow. I dumped Grammarly after Apple's Proofread function in Writing Tools got good enough and haven't looked back.\n\nIf I really want to, I could open Drafts in the Mac mini Virtual Display and run Proofread, but it's just not the same. The bit of friction there has brought me back to my favorite setup with iPad Pro.\n\nWhen I need to get something done as rapidly as possible, I still rely on the iPad for that. However, Apple Vision Pro is still my go-to device for long-form content. This story was written mostly in Apple Vision Pro.\n\niPad Pro is a bit more practical in public spaces and more portable\n\nI'm one of the few that can claim zero discomfort from using Apple Vision Pro and the Solo Knit Band. If more of my workflow could be accomplished via native apps in visionOS, I'd be there more often.\n\nUntil then, Apple Vision Pro has taken a back seat to iPad Pro. I use it a few times a week, sometimes for hours at a time, but it certainly isn't the primary machine.\n\nOne use you can count on is me wearing it while recording the AppleInsider Podcast. It lets me view my Mac display, Safari, and show notes without having a large piece of glass in front of my face, thus causing echoes.\n\nI think Apple has something special with Apple Vision Pro, and I can't wait to see more apps and experiences on the platform. We'll see what 2025 has to offer \u2014 perhaps I'll be writing about it overtaking the iPad before year's end.\n\nAn office in flux\n\nI'm never happy with my spaces. I'll continuously seek ways to tweak and optimize workflows as new products emerge and technologies improve.\n\nThe office is constantly changing, either for reviews or personal preference\n\nI believed and hoped Apple Vision Pro would have a larger impact on my office. In fact, I thought I might even clear off the desk to have a kind of empty platform for virtual objects and windows.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm still tempted to do that if and when the time comes, but Apple Vision Pro still needs to do everything without compromise, and that includes Apple Intelligence. I'm in a constant battle between my love of the iPad Pro and Apple Vision Pro, so for now, my office is a place that supports both.\n\nThis home is a rental, and if you haven't heard before, I'll tell you here \u2014 I'm getting married in October 2025. We plan to buy a home in 2026 if everything lines up, so that prospect sits constantly on the edge of my thoughts.\n\nSometimes it's nice just to get out of the office too\n\nI know my time in this space is limited, so I'm likely not to change too much over 2025. My setup has come a long way since my little corner desk in a Virginia Beach apartment.\n\nPerhaps my new home and new office will be built around the increased prominence of spatial computing. Only time will tell.\n\nTravel\n\nPart of what I love about my job is its portability. So, I wanted to talk a little about how I get work done outside of the office.\n\niPad Pro makes a great compact laptop\n\nI've got a bit of a weekly ritual, provided the weather holds. I like to hop on my e-bike and ride into town on Fridays so I can get work done somewhere other than my office.\n\nMy go-to bag for these outings is the Nomatic Navigator 10L. It carries my iPad Pro in the Magic Keyboard, a bike lock, iPad mini, game controller, and a battery pack with a kickstand.\n\nWhen I'm set up at a local place, it's usually just the iPad Pro, but I do like using the battery pack to hold the iPhone up so I can view StandBy. The iPad mini is more for playing games on the go than anything.\n\nMore serious outings require bigger bags. If I'm going to carry what's basically my entire office, I go for the AirPorter Backpack by Waterfield, which is a perfect companion for the Shield Case.\n\nThe Shield Case and Air Porter Backpack are great for long term travel\n\nThis big bag holds my iPads, Apple Vision Pro, Mac mini, batteries, controllers, chargers, and still leaves space after. It's an excellent option for my annual out-of-state trip.\n\nIt still scares me a bit carrying my Apple Vision Pro out of my home, not to mention using it in public. But I do have a cool solution for that when the Shield Case and Air Porter Backpack are overkill.\n\nThe Backpack for Apple Vision Pro by Waterfield is a great in-between. So far, I find it's best when I'm visiting a local friend and want to show them the headset.\n\nBackpack for Apple Vision Pro has a hammock for the headset\n\nThe coolest part of the Backpack are these two zipper bags included with it. They've become my travel companions regardless of what bag I'm carrying since they hold my cables and folding 3-in-1 iPhone charger.\n\niPhone 16 Pro Max and the rest\n\nI've mentioned my iPhone 16 Pro Max throughout this write-up, but I wanted to carve out a little spot for it here. It's the core of Apple's business, but funny enough, not really a big work tool for me.\n\nBeyond acting as a StandBy machine at my desk and abroad, my iPhone serves two specific purposes in my work. It's an amazing camera for product photography and a good video camera for recording the HomeKit Insider Podcast.\n\nSony a7II shooting the iPad mini with iPad Pro acting as a backdrop\n\nIf you see a photo taken in my office, in a light booth, or otherwise in my home, chances are those photos were taken with my trusty Sony a7II. Everything outside the house, like photos for my bike reviews or the outdoor shots of Apple Vision Pro in Virginia Beach, are taken with the iPhone.\n\nI've always loved iPhone photography, but it is incredible how powerful the camera has become. I mentioned in the iPhone 16 Pro Max review how important I believed Camera Control and reversible Photographic Styles were for a reason.\n\nWhile iPad mini 7 (check sale prices) is my go-to personal computer for entertainment or reading while I'm at home, the iPhone is my computer everywhere else. And of course, if I want to write in Apple Journal, I still have to do so from the iPhone only.\n\nApple's iPhone remains my go-to camera since it's always on me\n\nThe iPhone goes well beyond just entertainment too. It's how I log my calories, view health data, manage my home with Reminders, communicate with my friends and family, and so much more.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 is an extension of the iPhone, acting as a window into my activity and life. AirPods Pro 2 are always on my person, in my pocket or looped through my belt, and let me hide from the noise or enhance what I hear.\n\nThe iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch I keep with me all day every day ended up at the end of this list because it's honestly difficult to remember they are there. I didn't even get into Apple Home, HomePods, Apple TV, and the other tech that surrounds me and is part of my work.\n\nFor better or worse, technology surrounds us. It's why I'm in this profession, so I can explain it, criticize it, and be a part of the discussion about these life-changing products.",

            "content": "Who has access to your personal data? Apple thinks it should be you and you alone. In recent years, the tech titan has rolled out a slew of anti-tracking tools with the goal of helping you take back control of your personal information: This includes your activity, location and other sensitive data.\n\nApple's App Tracking Transparency feature offers Apple users a simple choice, to allow apps to track their activity or not. If you choose to opt out, Apple will prevent the app from accessing identifiers that link your device with your activity on an app, usually shared with advertisers to create targeted ads. Unless you give an app explicit permission to track you (including apps made by Apple), it can't use your data for targeted ads, including sharing your location data, advertising ID or any other identifiers with advertisers or third parties.\n\nThe feature was first unveiled at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in 2020 and was subsequently rolled out to users later that year in iOS 14.5. Since then, Apple has built on these efforts to increase transparency and privacy. In the new iOS 17, Apple made a change that lets users select their default search engine when in private browsing mode, giving users the option to choose a search engine other than Google while in a private Safari tab. Coming in a future iOS update, Apple recently previewed a feature that would make it harder for thieves to access sensitive information on stolen devices.\n\nThe impact of Apple's App Tracking Transparency feature has been wide-reaching across the tech industry. The feature drew support from privacy advocates but criticism from companies such as Meta, which said the move would hurt its ad business. Meta's concerns manifested across the board for social media platforms, with a 2021 investigation from the Financial Times estimating that the feature cost Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube a collective $9.85 billion in lost ad sales, as most Apple users opted out of tracking.\n\nEven if you didn't initially opt out, you can change whether or not to allow tracking at any time. Here's how to use the App Tracking Transparency feature.\n\nWatch this: 11 Hidden Features in iOS 18 06:44\n\nHow to turn off app tracking on new apps\n\nWhen you download and open a new app, you'll get a pop-up notification that asks if you want to let the app track your activity across other companies' apps and websites. You'll also see information about what the app would track. You can tap Ask App Not to Track to block that activity or Allow.\n\nWhen you download an app, you'll see a notification pop up giving you a choice of whether you want to give the app permission to track you. Apple\n\nYou can also opt out of app tracking across every app you download by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking and toggling off Allow Apps to Request to Track. This means any app that tries to ask for your permission will be automatically blocked from asking and informed that you have requested not to be tracked. All apps (other than those you've given permission to track in the past) will be blocked from accessing your device's information used for advertising, according to Apple.\n\nIt's important to note that this doesn't mean ads will disappear. It just means that you'll be more likely to see generic ads, not one for that pair of shoes you clicked on one time.\n\nHow to turn off app tracking on already downloaded apps\n\nYou can also turn app tracking permissions on or off on a per-app basis.\n\nTo do that, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking. You should see a list of apps that have requested to track you. Tap the toggle next to the apps you want to stop tracking you.\n\nAll app developers are required to ask for permission for tracking. If Apple learns a developer is tracking users who asked not to be tracked, they will need to either update their tracking practices or else potentially face rejection from the app store.\n\nApple believes that privacy features like these are a differentiator for its products, compared to other tech giants like Google and Samsung. Cook has said that because the company's business model isn't built on selling ads, it can focus on privacy, which he has called a \"fundamental human right.\"\n\nEven so, it's important to bear in mind that when you ask apps not to track you, what you're saying is that you don't want app developers to have access to your unique identifier that Apple creates specifically for advertisers -- your IDFA. Denying access to your iPhone's IDFA doesn't necessarily mean app developers won't track you through other means, so it's critical to be mindful of the apps you use and how you interact with them.\n\nFor more on security and privacy, check out the best VPNs of 2024 and how to stop Google from tracking your location.",

This decision follows regulations requiring electronic devices sold in these countries to feature USB-C charging ports, which these models lack.\n\nThe European \u201cCommon Charging\u201d Directive 2022/2380, which establishes new rules for radio equipment sold in the E.U., took effect on Dec. 28. Amongst other things, it mandates that most gadgets \u2014 including phones, tablets, and cameras \u2014 charge via USB-C in a bid to reduce e-waste and address market fragmentation.\n\nBeyond requiring USB-C ports, the directive mandates that devices supporting fast charging comply with the USB Power Delivery standard, enabling quicker charging speeds and up to 240W of power. Devices must also come with clear labelling that informs customers about the charging standards and capabilities.\n\nWhy is this directive needed?\n\nA universal charging standard ensures one charger can work for multiple devices, reducing the need to own or purchase different cables. It also prevents manufacturers from bundling their specific chargers with their products and adding its associated cost to the price.\n\nSEE: Apple Intelligence EU: Potential Mac Release Amid DMA Rules\n\nFurthermore, standardising USB-C creates a level playing field for accessory makers by removing proprietary technologies like Apple\u2019s Lightning Port, allowing them to design products compatible with all devices without restrictions or licensing fees.\n\nThe iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and iPhone SE \u2014 as well as the Magic Keyboard \u2014 all come with the Lightning Port that have now been removed from Apple\u2019s online stores across most E.U. countries, as reported by MacRumors. The phase-out started around Dec. 20, after the devices were discontinued in Switzerland.\n\nAs the U.K. left the E.U. in 2020, the devices can still be purchased in England, Wales, and Scotland; however, the devices are not available in Northern Ireland, as it operates in the E.U.\u2019s single market. These Apple devices are still available outside of Europe, such as in the U.S., India, and China.\n\nApple-authorized resellers in the E.U. will be able to continue selling the Lightning-enabled iPhones until they run out, according to French website iGeneration, which also broke news of the impending discontinuation on Dec. 13.\n\nThe tech giant initially claimed the E.U.\u2019s regulation \u201cstifles innovation\u201d in a statement to Reuters in 2020; Apple eventually relented, adding USB-C ports to the iPhone 15 series in 2023. Europe accounts for more than a quarter of Apple\u2019s total revenue, so the loss of its market would cost the company dearly.\n\nSEE: Apple Must Pay Back \u20ac13 Billion in Unpaid Taxes to Ireland, E.U. Court Rules\n\nDoes the new regulation affect customers who already own these models?\n\nThe new law does not impact customers who currently own these devices; however, it prevents manufacturers from selling non-USB-C enabled handsets in the bloc, even if they were on the market before Dec. 28. All iPads and AirPods sold by Apple are already USB-C only.\n\nWhile the directive does mean the cheapest iPhones are no longer available in the E.U., Apple\u2019s standard product timeline would have likely seen the iPhone 14 series being discontinued in September 2025 had it not come into force when it did. Indeed, a fourth-generation iPhone SE with USB-C connectivity has been slated for release in early 2025.",

            "content": "Key Takeaways Apple shares moved lower Monday morning, tracking a broader decline for U.S. stocks, but the company remains in striking distance of becoming the first ever to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization.\n\nA bearish evening star pattern has formed over the past three trading sessions, indicating a potential reversal in the stock.\n\nInvestors should watch key support levels on Apple's chart around $237 and $218, while also monitoring a chart-based bullish price target near $278.\n\nApple (AAPL) shares moved lower Monday morning, tracking a broader decline for U.S. stocks, but the company remains in striking distance of becoming the first ever to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization.\n\nLast Thursday, the company set a fresh record high just above $260 after Wedbush analysts led by Apple bull Dan Ives said that artificial intelligence (AI) demand sets the tech giant up for a \u201cgolden era of growth\u201d in 2025. This week, investors will be watching if Apple shares can hit $264.62, the price need to reach a $4 trillion market cap.\n\nThe company first unveiled its AI-software marketed as Apple Intelligence back in June, but the rollout has been slow, with investors watching if a major upgrade cycle to access the features drives 2025 sales.\n\nApple shares were down 1.2% at $252.50 in midday trading Monday. Since the start of the year, Apple shares have gained around 31%, handily outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s 24% increase over the same period.\n\nBelow, we take a closer look at Apple\u2019s chart and apply technical analysis to identify several important price levels that investors may be watching.\n\nEvening Star Pattern Emerges\n\nApple shares have trended higher since breaking out above a broad ascending triangle formation earlier this month. However, a bearish evening star pattern has formed on the iPhone maker\u2019s chart over the past three trading sessions, indicating a potential reversal.\n\nMoreover, as the stock climbed to a record high last week, the relative strength index (RSI) made a comparatively shallower high to create a bearish divergence, a technical signal pointing to weakening price momentum.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting volume spikes in the stock on June 21, Sept. 20, and Dec. 20, with these dates coinciding with triple witching days, suggesting portfolio rebalancing by larger market participants, such as institutional investors and hedge funds.\n\nLet\u2019s identify key support levels to watch if the stock undergoes a reversal, but also forecast a bullish price target to monitor if the shares continue their longer-term uptrend.\n\nKey Support Levels to Watch\n\nThe first level to eye sits around $237. This location on the chart could attract buying interest near the 50-day moving average and the ascending triangle\u2019s top trendline, an area that may flip from prior resistance into future support.\n\nA decisive close below this area could see Apple shares retrace to the $218 level, a region where investors may look for entry points near a trendline that links a range of comparable price action on the chart between June and September.\n\nBullish Price Target to Monitor\n\nInvestors can forecast a bullish price target by using the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes prior chart patterns to projects potential future moves.\n\nTo apply the tool to Apple\u2019s chart, we calculate the distance between the ascending triangle\u2019s two trendlines near their widest point and add that amount to the initial breakout area. For instance, we add $41 to $237, which forecasts a target of $278, a location where technical traders may look for exit points.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

            "content": "Apple had a busy year in 2024. From the Apple Vision Pro launch early this year to the latest M4 Macs, the company released almost 30 new products in total. This impressive mark might even be a burden for some of the company\u2019s biggest fans, as keeping up with the newest releases can be terribly expensive.\n\nThis is why BGR made this list with Apple\u2019s best products released in 2024, including the devices we think people should still buy as 2025 is about to kick off.\n\niPad Pro M4\n\nM4 iPad Pro OLED display. Image source: Jos\u00e9 Adorno for BGR\n\nThe iPad Pro M4 is undoubtedly one of Apple\u2019s best products released in 2024. The long-awaited revamp for the iPad Pro lineup was more than anyone could ever expect. The best OLED display available in the market, combined with an ultra-thin design and the powerful M4 chip exclusive to this tablet for almost half the year, made this device a must-have for any iPad lover.\n\nEven though iPadOS 18 didn\u2019t live up to the hype, this beautiful piece of hardware promises that this tablet will continue to be capable of the most challenging tasks for years to come.\n\nTech.

Image source: Christian de Looper for BGR\n\nThe new Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro M4 is one of Apple\u2019s best releases of 2024. After a few iterations of the Magic Keyboard, Cupertino was able to deliver a great combination of usability, premium design, and, most importantly, a well-optimized experience between the tablet and the keyboard, as previous iterations would completely drain the battery out of the iPad when it wasn\u2019t in use.\n\nThe aluminum material makes the accessory feel premium, the backlighted keys are great, and the function keys make the iPad more like a computer. Combine all of this with the different angles you can use to position your iPad, and you can be assured that this is one of the best products of 2024.\n\nNew MagSafe charger\n\nImage source: Maren Estrada for BGR\n\nApple\u2019s quietest release of 2024 is also a big deal, and third-party accessory makers will likely remember it in 2025. The new MagSafe charger is faster than ever and has 25W power.\n\nAccording to ChargeLab, the new MagSafe Charger can charge the iPhone 16 Pro Max to 50% in 34 minutes, 80% in 1 hour and 10 minutes, and 100% in 2 hours and 23 minutes (The previous iteration [15W], it will take longer, approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes.)\n\nThat said, the new MagSafe charger requires at least a 30W adapter, and only the newest iPhone 16 series can fully take advantage of this product.\n\niPhone 16\n\nImage source: Jos\u00e9 Adorno for BGR\n\nJust like in 2023, the best iPhone release was the regular model. The iPhone 16 has everything most Apple customers want: Top cameras, a beautiful design, a great display, and impressive battery life. In 2024, Cupertino went further and gave this lineup a new processor, the A18, a RAM boost, Apple Intelligence, and the newest Action Button and Camera Control functionalities.\n\nThe regular iPhone models come in fun colors and great storage options, and most iPhone users won\u2019t miss ProMotion, a third camera, or faster transfer speeds.\n\nM4 Mac mini\n\nImage source: Christian de Looper for BGR\n\nThe M4 Mac mini is definitely the best Apple product released in 2024 for Mac lovers. The cheapest Mac available to date has the powerful M4 chip, a Mac Studio-inspired design, at least 16GB of RAM, and it\u2019s great for anyone planning to switch to the macOS system.\n\nEven though its upgrades can be quite expensive, the base-model Mac mini offers the best specs at any computer\u2019s price. It\u2019s definitely one of Apple\u2019s greatest releases of all time.\n\nMacBook Pro M4\n\nImage source: Christian de Looper for BGR\n\nLastly, the MacBook Pro with the M4 chip is another product for the records. Built with the popular design of the 2021 MacBook Pro, this laptop offers a better chip, more ports for the base model, and, for the first time, a nano-textured option.\n\nApple also quietly improved the display on this MacBook Pro and, combined with the new processor, improved the battery life of all models, making them a better choice than the M3 MacBook Air versions.\n\nWrap up\n\nThese are the best Apple products released in 2024. They will certainly continue to be relevant in 2025 and for many years to come.",
