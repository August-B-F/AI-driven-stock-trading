This hybrid structure gives them both the stability and durability of inorganic materials and the flexibility and reactivity of organic ones. These properties make them promising for advanced technologies, such as electrochemical applications.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nA new study reports on a novel combination of materials with organic and inorganic properties. The material can be used in technologies that convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into a liquid fuel.\n\nResearchers aimed to create a surface that efficiently converts carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into methanol, a liquid fuel. Metal cones, a hybrid material, could play a key role in this purpose.\n\nResearchers decided to design a metalcone thin film that preserves its inorganic qualities, making it an effective interface between semiconductor materials and the surrounding liquid environment. Simultaneously, they sought to retain its organic traits, which enable efficient electron movement.\n\nHyuenwoo Yang, the paper\u2019s first author and a postdoctoral researcher at NC State, said, \u201cThe problem is that metal cones face a significant obstacle for practical use in this context. If you put metal cones in an aqueous solution, the organic properties allow the metal cones to dissolve \u2013 making them practically useless. If you anneal the metal cones at high temperatures, they become physically stable, but you lose the attractive electrochemical properties.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cBut now we\u2019ve demonstrated an approach that improves a metalcone\u2019s stability and electrochemical properties, making them very promising candidates for photoelectric chemical carbon dioxide reduction.\u201d\n\nResearchers used tincone \u2013 a tin oxide (SnO2), which is a component of organic oxide that replaces oxygen atoms. In simple terms, in tin oxide, oxygen atoms link tin oxide molecules together, while in tincone, the molecules are connected by a carbon chain instead of oxygen.\n\nConverting methane into methanol under ambient conditions using light\n\nSince high-temperature annealing removes desirable electrochemical traits, researchers experimented with annealing tincone at lower temperatures to preserve these properties.\n\nYang said, \u201cWe found that the sweet spot was a \u2018mild\u2019 annealing at 250 degrees Celsius. This made the tincone substantially more stable in an aqueous electrolyte, which is necessary for potential use in photoelectric chemical carbon dioxide reduction applications. In addition to improving its stability, the mild annealing also improved charge transport, making the electrochemical properties even more desirable for these applications.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur next steps involve binding carbon dioxide catalysts to this mild-annealed tincone and incorporating this engineered material into an application to see how efficiently it can convert atmospheric CO2 into methanol.\u201d\n\nJournal Reference\n\nHyuenwoo Yang, Christopher J.

            "content": "AI or bust: China chip sector to stage comeback at SEMICON China\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is now the primary growth driver for the global semiconductor industry. With AI-related demand expected to surge further in 2025, semiconductor equipment spending is on track for another major expansion. Against the backdrop of escalating US sanctions, China is positioning itself to leverage the AI boom as a possible rebound strategy, drawing intense global attention to its next move.\n\nChina is forecast to take nearly 40% of global semiconductor equipment orders, underscoring its role as a key demand driver. Whether Chinese companies can capitalize on AI momentum and navigate international restrictions will be in sharp focus at SEMICON China 2025, which opens on March 26 in Shanghai.\n\nKey international players retreat as Chinese manufacturers advance\n\nInterestingly, several key international players are skipping the event. US-based Applied Materials and Dutch lithography leader ASML will not be exhibiting. Applied Materials is participating only in affiliated forums and the CSTIC conference, while ASML continues its years-long absence from the show floor.\n\nHeld alongside SEMICON China, the ongoing CSTIC 2025 is running from March 24\u201325 in Shanghai, featuring ten technical symposiums spanning semiconductor science and technology.\n\nFilling the vacuum are Chinese homegrown equipment manufacturers such as Naura Technology, Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment (AMEC), and Acm Research (Shanghai), Inc. These firms are gaining momentum both in China's domestic substitution push and in global markets.\n\nGrowing financial strength of domestic suppliers\n\nChina's top equipment makers are posting robust double-digit growth. Naura projects 2024 revenue between CNY27.6 billion (US$3.81 billion) and CNY31.78 billion, representing a 25% to 43.93% year-over-year increase. Net profit is expected to reach CNY5.17\u20135.95 billion, up 32.6% to 52.6%.\n\nAcm Research (Shanghai) forecasts 2024 revenue of CNY5.618 billion, up 44.48% year over year. Net profit is projected at CNY1.153 billion, a 26.65% increase. Its core cleaning equipment segment is expected to generate CNY4.057 billion\u2014roughly 72.22% of total revenue\u2014with a 55.18% annual gain.\n\nHangzhou Changchuan Technology (CCTech), a specialist in IC testing equipment, expects 2024 net profit to soar between CNY400 million and CNY500 million\u2014representing explosive growth of 785.75% to 1,007.18%, driven primarily by expanded overseas shipments.\n\nAI wave propels industry-wide growth\n\nWith AI adoption accelerating, Chinese semiconductor equipment makers are riding a rising tide. Industry projections put global chip sales at over US$700 billion in 2025, with equipment investment forecast to hit US$112.8 billion. Chinese suppliers are well-positioned to capitalize on this uptrend.\n\nChina continues to be the world's largest market for semiconductor equipment. The domestic AI boom, led by startups like DeepSeek, is fueling demand for both chips and manufacturing tools.\n\nSEMI projects global semiconductor equipment sales will hit US$109 billion in 2024, up 18.7% from 2023. Momentum is expected to carry into 2025, with sales reaching US$128 billion\u2014another 18% annual gain. China is projected to account for nearly 40% of global demand.\n\nChina's expansion in domestic chip production\u2014especially in mature-node processes\u2014is a key driver of rising equipment investment and technology upgrades.\n\nAs geopolitical challenges and AI momentum converge, SEMICON China 2025 will be a critical litmus test for whether China's homegrown semiconductor equipment makers can translate ambition into execution.\n\nArticle edited by Jerry Chen",

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nThese novel hydrogen molybdenum bronze-molybdenum dioxide/carbon composite particles exhibit exceptional photothermal interface evaporation rate, wide-spectrum photocatalytic activity for the elimination of water pollutants, and sufficient adsorption capacities for heavy metal ions even in darkness. They could form the basis of large-scale, affordable water remediation technologies. Credit: Takashi Shirai from Nagoya Institute of Technology\n\nIn a recent study, a research team developed a novel method to synthesize multifunctional composite particles. These particles can single-handedly accomplish many essential functions for water remediation. The study was published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.\n\nReliable access to clean water is a basic human right and a central objective of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. Thus, securing technologies that can remove pollutants from water bodies is an essential step toward sustainability. Among several existing methods, harnessing solar energy represents an attractive option for water remediation without increasing carbon emissions.\n\nMany photocatalysts are currently being explored for degrading water pollutants via solar-driven reactions. Photothermal evaporation, on the other hand, uses solar energy to rapidly evaporate polluted water and condense it into fresh water. Unfortunately, photocatalytic and photothermal water remediation technologies tend to rely on expensive materials that are challenging to synthesize and implement at large scales, necessitating the development of a single and inexpensive composite material.\n\nFor their new study, the research team, comprising Dr. Kunihiko Kato, Dr. Yunzi Xin, and Yuping Xu, all from the Nagoya Institute of Technology (NITech), Japan, led by Associate Professor Takashi Shirai also from NITech, employed a planetary ball mill and optimized the milling parameters to transform a commercially available powdered mixture of molybdenum trioxide (MoO 3 ) and polypropylene into composite particles made of hydrogen molybdenum bronze (H x MoO 3\u2013y ), molybdenum dioxide (MoO 2 ), and activated carbon.\n\nScientists have developed a multifunctional all-in-one catalyst for water remediation that can efficiently absorb solar energy. This technology ensures water remediation and accessibility to clean freshwater in an energy efficient and cost-effective manner. Credit: Takashi Shirai from Nagoya Institute of Technology\n\n\"The proposed mechanochemical process surpasses other current approaches in terms of both energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness,\" says Dr. Shirai.\n\nThrough extensive experimentation, the research team demonstrated the many remarkable capabilities of their composites. First, these particles exhibited broad light absorption over the entire near-infrared\u2013visible\u2013ultraviolet range, allowing the photocatalytic degradation of a model organic pollutant. Interestingly, the composites also functioned as Br\u00f8nsted acid catalysts and removed water pollutants even in the absence of light.\n\nAdditionally, the proposed catalyst exhibited plasmonic properties, leading to a marked photothermal effect that enabled rapid heating using sunlight. This could be leveraged to drive the fast evaporation of water with exceptional photothermal conversion efficiency. Finally, oxygen-containing carbons that remained as milling byproducts could adsorb and remove heavy metal ions from wastewater.\n\nThe research team plans to refine their ball milling process to produce similar all-in-one catalysts for water remediation and other applications.\n\n\"Our developed technology has the potential to be applied to a wide range of oxides and plastics, and we anticipate that it will have varied applications, including enhancing the functionality of existing materials and upcycling waste plastics, to secure the availability of drinking water,\" concludes Dr. Shirai.\n\nMore information: Kunihiko Kato et al, Multifunctional HxMoO3\u2013y\u2013MoO2/Carbon Composite Particles for Water Remediation, ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2024).

While they offer high energy density and a long lifespan, they also come with large safety risks.\u201d\n\nZhao adds,\n\nOur research is motivated by this critical safety challenge,\n\n\u201cBy focusing on the early detection of electrolyte leakage, we aim to contribute to safer battery management systems, potentially preventing catastrophic failures and enhancing the overall reliability of lithium-ion battery-powered technologies.\u201d\n\nEthylene carbonate (EC) is a key component of a battery\u2019s electrolyte. The new sensor detects trace amounts of EC, flagging potential battery failures before they become disasters.\n\nThe highly sensitive and cost-effective gas sensor was developed using molecular structures called covalent organic frameworks (COFs). These can be engineered to selectively detect different gas molecules.\n\nThe COF screening process for the selective adsorption of ethylene carbonate vapour, using a computational-aided method.

            "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to grow in importance, thanks to its high potential to revolutionize industries.\n\nThis simulation of human intelligence in machines, after all, brings benefits such as increased efficiency and productivity, improved accuracy and decision-making, new job opportunities, and enhanced customer experience.\n\nAs a result, AI has become a key driver of corporate growth, with more than 70% of businesses adopting it. Estimates show the AI global market can reach trillions by 2030, driven by increased investment and technological advancements.\n\nJust this year alone, we have seen massive developments: OpenAI introduced a deep research agent with a 25%+ accuracy rate on Humanity's Last Exam benchmark; DeepSeek released DeepSeek-R1, which utilizes chain-of-thought reasoning; Baidu launched Ernie X1 and Ernie 4.5; and Stability AI unveiled a new model, Stable Virtual Camera, that enables photos to be turned into 3D scenes.\n\nMeanwhile, Google is collaborating with Taiwan's MediaTek to develop the next generation of Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to reduce production costs and reliance on current partners. At the same time, a consortium comprising OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank, and MGX announced The Stargate Project in collaboration with the US government.\n\nLast week, Nvidia announced a new lineup of \u201cAI personal supercomputers\u201d powered by its Grace Blackwell chip platform. CEO Jensen Huang unveiled DGX Spark and DGX Station at GTC 2025 to allow users to prototype, fine-tune, and run AI models of various sizes at the edge.\n\nSo, now, let's take a look at some of the most recent key breakthroughs researchers achieved through AI in different sectors.\n\nClick here to learn if AI is all hype or if there is a substance to its growth.\n\nAI Solving Its Own Learning Challenges\n\nAI is not only transferring other sectors but even contributing to itself by enabling the development of more sophisticated AI systems through advancements in data analysis, machine learning, and automation, leading to faster processing, more accurate predictions and better decision-making.\n\nThis month, researchers introduced novel memristive components that are far more robust, can operate in both analog and digital modes, and function across a wider voltage range.\n\nThese characteristics can help address the \u201ccatastrophic forgetting,\u201d which occurs when artificial neural networks forget what they previously learned. This typically happens when deep neural networks (DNNs), designed to mimic the human brain, are trained for a new task, and the new optimization overwrites what was learned before.\n\nOur brain doesn't have this problem, thanks to its ability to adjust the degree of synaptic change. Also, it is suspected that the different degrees of plasticity enable our brain to permanently learn new things without forgetting old ones. Researchers have accomplished something similar with their new memristor.\n\nMemristors behave much like brain cells and consume extremely little power. A type of resistance-switching memory device, memristors can change their resistance based on the applied voltage. Even after the voltage is turned off, their resistance value remains due to their ability to undergo structural changes.\n\nAccording to Ilia Valov from the Peter Gr\u00fcnberg Institute (PGI-7) at Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich, who led the research:\n\n\u201cMemristive elements are considered ideal candidates for learning-capable, neuro-inspired computer components modeled on the brain.\u201d\n\nWhile substantial progress has been made, components' commercialization is happening at a much slower pace due to the high failure rate in production, the product's short lifespan, and sensitivity to mechanical influences that can cause malfunctions during operation.\n\nThis requires research into better controlling nanoscale processes as well as new materials and switching mechanisms to reduce systems' complexity and increase their range of functionalities, said Valov.\n\nFor this very purpose, German and Chinese scientists came together and \u201cdiscovered a fundamentally new electrochemical memristive mechanism that is chemically and electrically more stable\u201d that will expand the horizon of neuroscience applications.\n\nClick here to learn how AI-enabled brain chips will pioneer the next leap in humanity's evolution.\n\nMemristor Breakthrough for AI's Continual Learning\n\nPublished in the journal Nature Communications1, the study identified two primary mechanisms for the functioning of bipolar memristors:\n\nElectrochemical Metallization (ECM) Valence Change Mechanism (VCM)\n\nECM memristors form a metallic filament between the two electrodes. This tiny \u201cconductive bridge\u201d changes electrical resistance and dissolves upon reversing voltage. While allowing for low switching voltages and fast switching times, the generated states here are variable and short-lived.\n\nVCM memristors change resistance through the movement of oxygen ions at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte by changing the Schottky barrier. While comparatively stable, this requires high switching voltages.\n\nWith each process having its own pros and cons, the team designed a memristor by combining the benefits of both types, which wasn't believed to be possible.\n\nSo, the new memristor uses a filament made of metal oxides (instead of being entirely metallic like ECM), which is formed by oxygen and tantalum ions' movement. It is very stable and never fully dissolves.\n\n\u201cYou can think of it as a filament that always exists to some extent and is only chemically modified.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Valov\n\nThe new, robust switching mechanism is referred to as a filament conductivity modification mechanism (FCM). Components based on this mechanism are more resistant to high temperatures, need lower voltages to produce, have a wider voltage window, and are chemically and electrically more stable. Their lifespan is also longer because fewer components burn out during production, leading to a lower rejection rate.\n\nThe different oxidation states further allow the memristor to operate in both binary and analog modes, which can help overcome the problem of \u201ccatastrophic forgetting.\u201d\n\nValov explained that the new two-terminal ohmic memristor's \u201cunique properties\u201d \u201callow the use of different switching modes to control the modulation of the memristor in such a way that stored information is not lost.\u201d\n\nResearchers have already implemented the new memristive component in an artificial neural network model in a simulation, achieving high pattern recognition accuracies on multiple image datasets.\n\nThe team will now explore other materials that may even be better and more stable. Valov is confident that their \u201cresults will further advance the development of electronics for \u2018computation-in-memory' applications.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft Corporation MSFT +0.47% )\n\nNow, one of the leading companies in the AI sphere is Microsoft (MSFT +0.47%), which has invested $12 billion in ChatGPT maker OpenAI and offers AI products like Copilot, Azure AI Studio, and AI-powered tools within Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Power Platform. The $2.9 trillion market cap tech giant's shares are currently trading at $394.58, down 7.17% YTD. For the quarter ended December 31, 2024, it reported a 12% increase in revenue to $69.6bln and diluted EPS of $3.23.\n\nAccording to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella:\n\n\u201cWe are innovating across our tech stack and helping customers unlock the full ROI of AI to capture the massive opportunity ahead. Already, our AI business has surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion, up 175% year-over-year.\u201d\n\nLatest on Microsoft\n\nAI In Healthcare, Improving Parkinson's Diagnosis\n\nIn the healthcare sector, AI is helping reduce costs and achieve better patient outcomes by enhancing diagnostics, treatment, and patient care through disease detection, personalized medicine, and improved efficiency in administrative tasks.\n\nNow, AI is going to help clinicians differentially diagnose Parkinson's disease and related conditions faster and with greater accuracy.\n\nThe diagnosis of Parkinson's disease currently stands between 55% and 78% in the first five years of assessment, in part due to its sibling movement disorders sharing similarities with it, which can make definitive diagnosis initially difficult.\n\nHowever, a new AI model developed by researchers at the University of Florida and the UF Health Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases boasts a precision rate beyond 96%.\n\nAs the study noted, applying an imaging-based approach to diagnose and differentiate between Parkinson's disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and multiple system atrophy (MSA) Parkinsonian variants has been particularly challenging. However, recent data has shown that it is possible with diffusion-weighted MRI paired with disease-specific machine learning (ML) algorithms.\n\nThe study, funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in JAMA Neurology2, detailed the Automated Imaging Differentiation for Parkinsonism (AIDP), an automated MRI processing and ML software featuring a noninvasive biomarker technique.\n\nMRI manufacturers, David Vaillancourt, a professor in the UF Department of Applied Physiology and Kinesiology, noted they do not communicate with each other because of marketplace competition and use their own software and sequences.\n\nSo, the researchers \u201cdeveloped novel software that works across all of them.\u201d The tool will help physicians increase their diagnostic efficacy between different disorders, said Vaillancourt.\n\nWhile diffusion-weighted MRI in AIDP helps identify where neurodegeneration is occurring by measuring how water molecules diffuse in the brain, the algorithm analyzes the brain scan to provide the results.\n\nThe algorithm has been rigorously tested against in-person clinic diagnoses and conducted across 21 sites, which includes two in Canada and 19 in the US.\n\n\u201cThis is an instance where the innovation between technology and artificial intelligence has been proven to enhance diagnostic precision, allowing us the opportunity to further improve treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Michael Okun, M.D., director of the Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases at UF Health.\n\nResearchers are now aiming to get approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nUsing AI to Predict Cardiovascular Risk through Mammograms\n\nYet another deep learning model showed potential in predicting cardiovascular risk based on mammogram images, an important cancer screening tool. This separate study presented at the American College of Cardiology's (ACC) Annual Scientific Session combines the power of AI with mammograms to analyze the buildup of calcium in the arteries within breast tissue.\n\nCalcium buildup in blood vessels is a sign of cardiovascular damage associated with aging or early-stage heart disease. Women with calcium buildup in the arteries, according to previous studies, face a 51% higher risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nDespite being a leading cause of death in the US, heart diseases in women actually remain underdiagnosed, which can change with AI-powered mammogram screening tools that take better advantage of tests many women routinely receive.\n\nIn the US, about 40 million mammograms are performed each year. These X-rays are used to screen for breast cancer. While these images show breast artery calcifications, the information is not reported to patients or their clinicians.\n\nThe new study used an AI image analysis technique not previously used on mammograms to show that the technology can help fill this gap by automatically assessing calcification and then providing a cardiovascular risk rating. According to the study's lead author, Theo Dapamede, MD, PhD, and a postdoc fellow at Emory University in Atlanta:\n\n\u201cWe see an opportunity for women to get screened for cancer and also additionally get a cardiovascular screen from their mammograms. Our study showed that breast arterial calcification is a good predictor for cardiovascular disease, especially in patients younger than age 60. If we are able to screen and identify these patients early, we can refer them to a cardiologist for further risk assessment.\u201d\n\nTo build the tool, researchers trained an AI model to segment calcified vessels in mammogram images. The model then uses these bright pixels to calculate the risk of cardiovascular events in the future based on the data of over 56,000 patients.\n\n\u201cAdvances in deep learning and AI have made it much more feasible to extract and use more information from images to inform opportunistic screening.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Dapamede\n\nThe study findings demonstrated that the new model performed well at identifying the cardiovascular risk of patients at low, moderate, or severe risk based on mammogram images.\n\nAs per them, the rate of serious cardiovascular events increases with the level of breast arterial calcification in women under 60 and those between 60 and 80 after calculating the risk of death from an acute heart attack, stroke, or any cause at two and five years.\n\nThis makes this tool specifically appropriate for providing early warning of heart disease risk in younger women, allowing for early interventions.\n\nThe study's results also demonstrate that those with the highest level of breast arterial calcification, above 40 mm2, had a considerably lower five-year rate of event-free survival than those with the lowest level, below 10 mm2.\n\nResearchers' next step is to obtain approval from the FDA and make it available for wider use. In the future, the plan is also to look into using similar AI models to analyze biomarkers for other conditions, like kidney disease, that might be extracted from mammograms.\n\nGE HealthCare Technologies Inc. GEHC +0.26% )\n\nNow, when it comes to companies advancing AI in healthcare, GE HealthCare Technologies (GEHC +0.26%) is heavily invested in the tech and integrating it across its products to improve patient care and enhance clinician workflows. The $37.26 bln market cap company's stocks are currently trading at $81.49, up 4.23%.

AI in this field is contributing by accelerating the discovery and design of new materials, optimizing existing ones, and improving manufacturing processes.\n\nResearchers from Tokyo University of Science (TUS), led by Professor Masato Kotsugi, have now utilized AI to optimize thin-film growth processes by predicting dendritic growth in them.\n\nThese processes play a key role in the development of semiconductor devices, communication technologies, and sensor technologies.\n\nNow, thin films are grown by laying down small layers of materials on a substrate. However, to fully utilize the performance of multilayer film devices, the substrate must be precisely fabricated as it has a considerable influence on the structural configuration, which then affects their function and performance.\n\nHowever, the structures are significantly influenced by growth process conditions such as composition, atmosphere, and surface defects. During the growth process of large-area fabrication, which is important for its commercial application, a major obstacle arises in the form of dendritic structures.\n\nThese tree-like branching patterns reduce thin films' flatness and are commonly observed in materials like graphene, copper, and borophene, especially in the early growth stage and multilayer films.\n\nGiven that microstructure directly influences the device's performance, it is critical to reduce dendritic formation. For that, we must first understand the condition that causes dendritic branching. Existing methods of studying dendrites, however, depend on simple visual analysis and subjective interpretation, requiring considerable trial and error.\n\nTo tackle these issues, researchers built an AI model to analyze dendritic structures. The innovative method integrates machine learning (ML) and persistent homology (PH) with energy analysis to bridge structure and process in dendritic growth.\n\n\u201cOur approach provides new insights into growth mechanisms and offers a powerful, data-driven pathway for optimizing thin-film fabrication.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Prof. Kotsugi\n\nCombining AI, PH, & Energy Analysis to Study Dendritic Growth\n\nPublished in Science and Technology of Advanced Materials: Methods3, the study details the model that uses persistent homology (PH) to capture the complex topological features of dendrite microstructures, often overlooked by traditional image processing techniques.\n\nWhile PH allows for the multiscale assessment of holes and connections within geometric structures, ML technique principal component analysis (PCA) helped reduce the essential dendrite morphology features extracted via PH to a 2D space.\n\nThis helped the team quantify structural changes in dendrites and establish a relationship between these changes and the free energy in the material that impacts the way dendrites are formed.\n\nUpon assessing this relationship, the team discovered the particular conditions and hidden growth mechanisms that affect dendritic branching.\n\n\u201cOur framework quantitatively maps dendritic morphology to Gibbs free energy variations, revealing energy gradients that drive branching behavior.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Kotsugi\n\nThe team then studied dendrite growth in a hexagonal copper (Cu) substrate and compared the results with data from phase-field simulations to validate their approach. Kotsugi noted:\n\n\u201cBy integrating topology and free energy, our method offers a versatile approach to material analysis. Through this integration, we can establish a hierarchical connection between atomic-scale microstructures and macroscopic functionalities across a wide range of materials, paving the way for future advancements in material science.\u201d\n\nThis method, according to him, can lead to the development of high-quality thin-film devices for high-speed communication beyond 5G and advancements in high-performance materials, nonequilibrium physics, and sensor technology.\n\nNow, if we look at a prominent name in the material science field that is utilizing AI to innovate, Applied Materials (AMAT +1.86%) is among the top. It leverages AI to enhance semiconductor chip manufacturing through its AI(x) platform, ExtractAI, and SEMVision\u2122 H20 System.

For 1Q25, it reported a 7% increase in revenue to $7.17bln while GAAP EPS was $1.45 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.38.\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. AMAT +1.86% )\n\n\u201cThe industry drive to accelerate the development of advanced compute and more sophisticated AI is gaining momentum. Applied Materials is enabling the major device architecture inflections critical for energy-efficient AI, and our focus on high-velocity co-innovation creates unique collaboration opportunities with our customers and partners, positioning Applied for continued growth and outperformance in the years to come.\u201d\n\n\u2013 CEO Gary Dickerson last month\n\nLatest on Applied Materials\n\nConclusion\n\nAI has already been transforming businesses across industries.

With these advancements, ranging from material science, medical diagnostics, and personal supercomputers to even solutions for AI's own learning challenges, we are stepping into an era that promises unprecedented transformation.\n\nAs AI continues to evolve, its ability to drive productivity, improve decision-making, and unlock new frontiers makes it one of the most powerful forces shaping the future.\n\nClick here to learn all about investing in artificial intelligence (AI).",

This innovation, detailed in a study published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, addresses a critical concern as lithium-ion batteries become ubiquitous in everything from smartphones and laptops to electric vehicles and large-scale energy storage systems.\n\nThe core challenge lies in the inherent risks associated with lithium-ion battery failures. Overheating or physical damage can lead to the release of volatile electrolyte vapors, which are highly flammable and can trigger catastrophic events. The increasing adoption of electric vehicles has amplified these concerns, with numerous incidents of EV fires linked to battery malfunctions.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, researchers focused on developing a highly sensitive, selective, and cost-effective gas sensor capable of detecting early signs of battery failure. The newly developed sensor utilizes covalent organic frameworks (COFs), meticulously designed molecular structures that can selectively target specific gases. In this case, the sensor is engineered to detect ethylene carbonate (EC) vapor, a key component of the battery\u2019s electrolyte.\n\n\"Our research is driven by the urgent need for safer batteries,\" explained lead researcher Zhao. \"By enabling early detection of electrolyte leaks, our work aims to improve battery management systems, prevent failures, and enhance the reliability of lithium-ion technology.\"\n\nThe researchers employed sophisticated computational methods to screen hundreds of potential materials, ultimately identifying COF-QA-4 as the optimal candidate. This material demonstrated exceptional sensitivity and selectivity, specifically targeting EC vapor while effectively ignoring other potentially interfering gases.\n\n\"We screened hundreds of potential materials using computational methods before identifying COF-QA-4 as the best candidate. It's highly sensitive and selective, targeting the harmful EC gas while ignoring other vapours. The sensor can detect leaks long before they become hazardous,\" Zhao added.\n\nThe sensor's performance was rigorously tested in laboratory settings, where it demonstrated the ability to detect EC vapor at concentrations as low as 1.15 parts per million (ppm). This high sensitivity allows for the detection of leaks at their very onset, providing a crucial window of opportunity for intervention before a critical failure occurs.\n\nThe implications of this technology extend far beyond electric vehicles. Researchers envision integrating the sensor into battery management systems for a wide range of applications, including smart home devices and industrial safety systems. By providing real-time alerts for hazardous gas leaks, the sensor can serve as an early warning system, preventing potentially devastating accidents.\n\nThe ease of integration into existing battery management systems is a key advantage. This would allow manufacturers to implement proactive safety measures, detecting potential failures long before they escalate into dangerous situations. By doing so, the sensor offers the potential to save lives and protect property.",

The prototype invention has the potential to be used on cars, helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles, per the study.\n\nAccording to SciTechDaily, gas-powered engines waste about 75% of their fuel as heat. This means only a quarter of this fuel is actually used for motion. That's a lot of dirty fuel effectively wasted as unused heat.\n\nWhile electric and hybrid vehicles help resolve this wasteful problem by curbing the need for dirty fuel, there's still a long way to go before new energy vehicles are the standard. In 2023, only 7.6% of new vehicles sold were electric vehicles. And that's not even to mention the significant time before electric aerial vehicles become the norm.\n\nAddressing transportation's dirty fuel problem is sorely needed. According to the EPA, transportation is the largest source of planet-warming pollution in the U.S., responsible for 28% of the country's annual environmental pollution. More than half of this transportation-based pollution \u2014 a whopping 57% \u2014 comes from passenger vehicles. That's why turning a vehicle's wasted heat and exhaust into energy could be game-changing, helping to give useless dirty fuel a new life.\n\nThermoelectric generators have admittedly been around for a while \u2014 but the tech tends to be bulky.\n\nAs Interesting Engineering explains, these generators use the temperature difference applied across a material and convert it into energy. Usually, these generators rely on a sizable water-based cooling system to help create that differential. But this new tech uses compact heat exchangers similar to those used in air conditioners to capture thermal energy from exhaust pipes.\n\nSciTechDaily reports that the prototype achieved an output power of 40 watts, enough to power an average lightbulb. In simulations mimicking the output of high-speed vehicles, the prototype achieved an output power of 56 watts for car-like exhaust speeds and 146 watts for helicopter-like exhaust speeds. That's the equivalent of the electricity needed to power five and 12 lithium-ion batteries, respectively.\n\nSciTechDaily highlights that this generator variation is \"lightweight and efficient\" unlike previous heavy systems that required extra cooling for adequate operation. Plus, the researchers report their practical system can be retrofitted into existing exhausts without major modification.\n\nWhile this innovation doesn't make dirty energy \"sustainable,\" it does help harness power from otherwise wasted planet-warming pollution. And that's undoubtedly a good thing.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

            "content": "The fact that multiple Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Applied Materials\n\nApplied Materials Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President, Gary Dickerson, sold US$99m worth of shares at a price of US$247 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$154). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.\n\nApplied Materials insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\n\nNasdaqGS:AMAT Insider Trading Volume March 20th 2025\n\nI will like Applied Materials better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of undervalued and small cap stocks with considerable, recent, insider buying.\n\nApplied Materials Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen a bit of insider selling at Applied Materials. VP, Corporate Controller & Chief Accounting Officer Adam Sanders only netted US$47k selling shares, in that period. It's not great to see insider selling, nor the lack of recent buyers. But the amount sold isn't enough for us to put any weight on it.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Applied Materials insiders own about US$312m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Applied Materials Tell Us?\n\nOur data shows a little more insider selling, but no insider buying, in the last three months. But the sales were small, so we're not concerned. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Applied Materials, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. Of course, the future is what matters most. So if you are interested in Applied Materials, you should check out this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.",

            "content": "As a common-sense rule, investors should avoid making wholesale decisions based on a single informational source.\n\nStill, if one had to make such a choice, it would be most practical to follow the smart money trail. That's the opportunity potentially available in semiconductor specialist Applied Materials Inc AMAT.\n\nUnlike so-called headline enterprises like Apple Inc AAPL or Nvidia Corp NVDA, Applied Materials represents the stagehand of the recent technological surge, which includes artificial intelligence and the proliferation of data centers. The company provides the wafer fabrication tools that are essential for AI chip production. While chipmakers have grabbed most of the attention, they couldn't operate without Applied Materials' advanced fabrication equipment.\n\nNevertheless, Applied Materials stock doesn't trade in a vacuum. With the Trump administration engaged in multiple trade wars and with recession fears rising, growth-oriented enterprises have struggled. AMAT has been no exception, slipping more than 5% since the beginning of the year.\n\nAt the same time, the red ink could offer forward-thinking investors with a compelling discount. First, management is making shareholder-friendly moves, recently hiking its dividend for the eighth consecutive year. Second, the leadership team greenlit a program to buy back $10 billion worth of AMAT stock over time.\n\nWhat could be most convincing, though, is the smart money trail.\n\nUnusual Options Activity Signals Upside\n\nOn Monday, Benzinga's options scanner identified unusual activity for Applied Materials stock derivatives. Since the options market often represents the playground of sophisticated investors, deciphering the underlying price action could potentially yield actionable insights.\n\nOverall, negotiations have been tight but with a slight edge toward the optimistic side of the spectrum. Yesterday, 46% of transactions carried bullish intentions while 40% were bearish, with the remainder representing neutral wagers. Still, it's the nuances that are arguably the most intriguing.\n\nPrimarily, the most bullish transaction in terms of dollar volume was for sold $150 puts with an expiration date of June 20, 2025. Essentially, major players \u2014 likely institutional participants \u2014 are underwriting the risk that Applied Materials\u2019 stock will not drop materially below the $150 strike price by June 20. If it does, these traders are at risk of assignment, meaning that the other side of the transaction (the put buyers) could exercise their options.\n\nNote that the bid of the aforementioned $150 puts was $9.85. This is the premium that the put writers (sellers) received for underwriting the risk that shares of Applied Materials will not fall significantly southward. By logical deduction, the intrinsic breakeven for the put writers is $140.15. Below this point at expiration, the put writers would lose money.\n\nOf course, options also have time or extrinsic value. Should AMAT stock fall sharply toward the breakeven threshold prior to expiration, the move would likely benefit put buyers. Therefore, retail investors reading Benzinga's options screener have good reason to believe that support should hold around $150.\n\nStated simply, there's too much money at risk for the sold puts to be a casual wager.\n\nImage by author\n\nFinally, AMAT stock benefits from an upward bias. Using data since January 2019, a long position held for any given eight-week period has a 65.3% chance of rising. Under dynamic conditions, this positive probability does not materially change. For example, AMAT is currently up around 1.5% over the trailing five days. In an eight-week hold following a weekly return of up to 5%, the chances of profitability dips only slightly to 63%.\n\nWhether following the smart money or playing the numbers game, AMAT stock appears to be offering a sensible discount.\n\nCharting a Way Forward with Applied Materials\n\nWith a relatively high degree of confidence that Applied Materials stock will be supported at around $150 and with statistical tides generally moving the security northward, speculative investors may consider an optimistic strategy known as the bull call spread. Specifically, the 155/160 spread expiring April 11 looks intriguing for aggressive traders.\n\nThis transaction involves buying the $155 call (at a time-of-writing ask of $630) and simultaneously selling the $160 call (at a bid of $390). The proceeds from the short call partially offset the debit paid of the long call, resulting in a net cash outlay of $240, the most that can be lost in the trade.\n\nShould Applied Materials stock hit or exceed the short strike price of $160 at expiration, the maximum reward is $260, a payout of 108.33%.\n\nAssuming the positive scenario, a four-week position historically features a median return between 6.5% and 8%. Granted, the negative outcome could also materialize, which would negate these implied return targets. However, the sold $150 put by major players suggests that the optimistic outlook may be the likelier one; hence, the deployment of the bullish strategy.\n\nNow Read:\n\nImage: Shutterstock",

However, their poor solubility and high crystallinity pose major challenges in processing and assembly, despite their favourable electronic properties. The strategic arrangement of these molecular structures is crucial for achieving high-performance organic semiconductive materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c0-Electronic systems are molecular structures with delocalized \u03c0-electrons, arising from the overlapping of \u03c0-orbitals in conjugated systems. These systems allow efficient charge transport with electronic interactions and are most commonly applied in organic semiconductors. However, their application is hindered owing to their low solubility. The researchers used a novel technique involving ion pairing of the \u03c0-electronic cation-based system, which improves interactions for solubility and reduces the electrostatic repulsion while stacking into structures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLow solubility of expanded \u03c0-electronic systems is often a challenge in fabricating assembled structures for organic electronic materials. In our study, we have introduced a new approach to enhance the solubility of expanded \u03c0-electronic cations by combining them with appropriate bulky counteranions,\u201d says lead author, Prof. Maeda.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharge segregated systems are where positively and negatively charged \u03c0-electronic molecules form distinct molecular stacking arrangements. This allows for efficient charge transfer and conductivity. To build these charge-segregated systems, the researchers first synthesized a benzoporphyrin AuIII complex, which serves as an expanded \u03c0-electronic cation. The expansion of the \u03c0-system increases dispersion forces (weak intermolecular forces arising due to a change in electron distribution), which helps overcome electrostatic repulsion between identically charged molecules. Further, the researchers paired these expanded \u03c0-electronic cations with bulky counterions, forming soluble ion pairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe introduced four different bulky counteranions, including PF\u2086\u207b, FABA\u207b, BArF\u207b, and PCCp\u207b, evaluating each ion pair for their structural properties and conductivity,\u201d reports Dr. Yohei Haketa.\n\nWant more breaking news?

Subscribe for FREE\n\nOn the basis of the stacking of the benzoporphyrin AuIII complex, the ion pairs are assembled in two different polymorphic states: single-crystal and less-crystalline (LeC) states. The single-crystal states were formed in controlled crystallization conditions and exhibited a high-ordered stacking with a rigid crystalline structure. Alternatively, the LeC states, which were formed via recrystallization in particular solvents, exhibited a less ordered arrangement of the ion pairs. The structural properties were confirmed through advanced techniques, including X-ray diffraction and solid-state NMR measurements, along with molecular dynamics simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe observed that although the pseudo polymorphs exhibited different structural stacking, both types of structures exhibited electrical conductivity with tunable conductive properties, allowing their use in a broad range of applications,\u201d explains Prof. Maeda.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe findings of the study were remarkable. The combination of the planar expanded \u03c0-electronic cation and bulky anions resulted in the formation of soluble ion pairs, which in turn led to the ordered arrangement of charged \u03c0-electronic systems. The formed ion pairs can therefore be used for a solution-processed fabrication of conductive materials, enabling the development of novel electronic materials and devices.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study therefore paves the way for solution-processed conductive materials, which could potentially lead to next-generation organic semiconductors. Furthermore, the researchers will focus on refining molecular designs to optimize charge transport properties and explore applications in electronic circuits, sensors, and energy storage technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussing the significance of their findings, Prof. Maeda remarked, \u201cOur study demonstrates new aspects of molecular assemblies and their functionalities through molecular design and synthesis, which are essential for the future applications of \u03c0-electronic materials.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on previous findings, their research pushes the limits of molecular assembly and electronic materials, shaping the next generation of electronic technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: Haketa Y, Nakajima R, Maruyama Y, et al.

Some of the prominent names are Toll Brothers , DICK'S Sporting Goods , KornFerry International , Banco Santander and Applied Materials . Companies that pay out dividends consistently indicate a healthy business model. Stocks that have raised dividends recently exhibit a sound financial structure and can counter market upheavals. Stocks that tend to reward investors with a high dividend payout outperform non-dividend-paying stocks in a highly volatile market.\n\nPersistent inflation is another major negative for the market as it will leave less room for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, currently in the range of 4.25-4.50%. There is huge uncertainty regarding rate cuts in the changed scenario from earlier expectations of two to three rate cuts by the Fed at the beginning of this year. The labor market remains stable, but immigration policies, widespread layoffs of federal workers, and an escalating global trade war threaten its stability.\n\nAccording to the Department of Labor report, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.2% in February after rising 0.5% in January, much cooler than expected. On an annual basis, CPI dropped 2.8% from 3% in January. Trump's tariff moves with key trading partners have stroked fears of rising inflation and a slowdown in economic growth among market participants.\n\nMajor U.S. indexes have been extremely volatile so far this year.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nResearchers use tellurium to fabricate 2d semiconductors, a step toward a future where atom-thick electronics redefine speed, efficiency, and versatility.https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsami.4c14865. Credit: Carnegie Mellon College of Engineering\n\nA group of Carnegie Mellon University researchers recently devised a method allowing them to create large amounts of a material required to make two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors with record high performance. Their paper, published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces in late December 2024, could lead to more efficient and tunable photodetectors, paving the way for the next generation of light-sensing and multifunctional optoelectronic devices.\n\n\"Semiconductors are the key enabling technology for today's electronics, from laptops to smartphones to AI applications,\" said Xu Zhang, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering. \"They control the flow of electricity, acting as a bridge between conductors (which allow electricity to flow freely) and insulators (which block it).\"\n\nZhang's research group wanted to develop a certain kind of photodetector, a device capable of detecting light and which can be used in a variety of applications. To create this photodetector, the group needed to use materials that were an atom's-width thick, or as close to 2D as is possible.\n\nToday's semiconductor industry relies heavily on CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) technology, which uses two types of semiconductor materials to enable energy-efficient electronic circuits, called p-type (or \"positive-type\") and n-type (or \"negative type\") materials.\n\n\"Making a good p-type semiconductor is not only important for this photodetector work, it is fundamentally important for almost all electronics,\" Zhang said.\n\nWhile there are many kinds of 2D n-type materials available, 2D p-type materials are rarer\u2014until now. CMU researchers seek a powerful new p-type semiconductor material, which could solve a critical bottleneck in the field of ultra-thin electronics.\n\nLuckily, they did know of a fitting material: tellurium. Tellurium is the 52nd element on the periodic table, located in group 16 a few periods (rows) below oxygen. It is a conductive metalloid, but most importantly, it acts like a p-type material.\n\n(a) Optical image of the as-fabricated four-point Te FET. (b) AFM scanning image of the Te FET. (c) AFM height profile of the Te FET channel (along a white dashed line). (d) I\u2013V transfer curve of the Te FET (using the two electrodes in the middle as source and drain contacts, V ds = 0.5 V) in both linear (blue line) and logarithmic (red line) scales.

(g) SEM image of one representative Te-MoS 2 heterojunction diode. The shape of the MoS 2 flake is indicated by the white dashed line.

(i) Calculated rectification ratio as a function of gate voltage V g at V D = 2 V. Credit: ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2024). DOI: 10.1021/acsami.4c14865\n\nEven better, of the materials they tested, 2D tellurium had the highest mobility, or fastest conducting speed, at 1450 cm2/Vs, meaning that devices built with it can act extremely quickly. It also is much more stable in the air than the leading alternative, black phosphorus, so it does not easily degrade and stays fast and efficient for longer.\n\n\"This physical vapor deposition growth tellurium greatly enriches the 2D semiconductor material family,\" said Tianyi Huang, graduate student in mechanical engineering and first author of the paper.\n\n\"Its p-type property and outstanding electrical performance made it a strong candidate in various potential applications such as high-speed CMOS circuits, high-frequency RF [radio frequency] circuits, photodetectors, energy harvesting, and so on.\"\n\nBesides the ultra-light weight of the device, the tellurium-enabled photodetector is highly tunable, allowing its parameters to be changed so it can be used in a variety of applications, a property that is not true of other photodetectors. The researchers look forward to further developing this work to find its limits and best applications.\n\nThis interdisciplinary work was done through close collaboration with Sheng Shen, professor of mechanical engineering, and his group.\n\n\"With its unique properties, 2D p-type tellurium holds great promise for applications in photodetection and electronics. We are excited to further explore its potential in the near future,\" Shen said.\n\nAs researchers continue to push the boundaries of 2D materials, this discovery marks a significant step toward a future where atom-thick electronics redefine speed, efficiency, and versatility.\n\nMore information: Tianyi Huang et al, Physical Vapor Deposition of High-Mobility P-Type Tellurium and Its Applications for Gate-Tunable van der Waals PN Photodiodes, ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2024).

            "content": "A fresh $10 billion buyback program doesn't hurt either.\n\nWhen you're young, your investment goals revolve around growth. In retirement, those goals change to income. But if you are, say, a decade or two from retirement, your priorities are balanced between the two.\n\nThus, the decades leading up to retirement is a great time to buy dividend growth stocks. If a company is profitable and has a path to a decade or more of growth ahead, the compounded dividend payouts can become quite large once you hit retirement age.\n\nThe catch is that dividend growth stocks often have current yields that don't exactly wow investors. However, the recent pullback in the market has increased some companies' yields significantly, merely by virtue of their stocks going down. That makes the following company look like an ultimate retirement stock for Gen X and millennial investors today.\n\nApplied Materials is a cash flow machine\n\nSemiconductor stocks have been long-term winners in the stock market, though investors have to be selective. Chip designers' fortunes can change drastically if and when there's a big technology shift and competition emerges. Meanwhile, chip manufacturing can be quite capital-intensive, limiting the amount those companies can return to shareholders.\n\nBut semiconductor equipment stocks -- the companies that make machines that manufacture chips -- have less risk than chip designers and lower capital intensity than foundries. \"Semicap\" equipment providers usually grow along with the semiconductor industry, which should be well above GDP over the long term. Meanwhile, this sub-sector is also highly concentrated to just a few big players with high margins and cash flows.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT -0.10%) is the most diversified of the equipment suppliers, and just announced a big dividend hike and share repurchase program. Yet the stock is also down some 40% from its highs last summer, and its current dividend yield has risen above 1%. With years of AI-fueled growth ahead of it, the stock is making a good case for dividend growth investors to scoop up shares today.\n\nApplied delivers a 15% dividend increase, $10 billion buyback\n\nLast Monday, Applied announced it would increase its quarterly dividend from $0.40 to $0.46 per share, an increase of 15%, which will be made on June 12 to shareholders of record as of May 22. In addition, Applied's board of directors approved a new $10 billion repurchase program, in addition to the $7.6 billion remaining on its already-existing program.\n\nThat's a big hike in shareholder payouts, even though management's enthusiasm is at odds with the current market sentiment. In fact, Applied's stock is down about 40% from its July 2024 highs. That's a pretty severe decline, especially since Applied is still reporting consistently good numbers. Last quarter, the company grew revenue 7% and adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share by 12%. And analysts project nearly 10% earnings growth over each of the next two years.\n\nApplied's yield has spiked, making for a nice entry point\n\nThe dividend hike coinciding with Applied's stock price decline has grown its forward dividend yield to about 1.25%, its highest yield in a while. Usually, when Applied's dividend yield spikes in such a fashion, it has typically been a good time to buy the stock (note: the dividend yield below doesn't take into account the recent increase.)\n\nMoreover, that dividend yield is very well-covered by earnings. In fiscal 2024, Applied earned $8.65 per share, covering the new $1.84 dividend 4.7 times over.\n\nAnd not only that, but Wall Street expects the next two years to see earnings growth as well, with an average EPS estimate of $9.37 this year and $10.11in fiscal 2026.\n\nApplied's business should continue to grow with AI\n\nApplied has a strong position in etch and deposition equipment, which is important to producing today's most leading-edge logic chips, as well as high-performance DRAM. The AI revolution needs lots and lots of both, which should bolster Applied's growth in the medium-term and its dividend along with it.\n\nIn addition, Applied makes metrology equipment that tests all kinds of chips, and ion implant equipment used in the production of lagging-edge power chips for autos and industrial end-markets.\n\nWith a diversified portfolio and a strong services business, Applied looks set to profitably grow along with the chip industry, all while reducing its share count via share repurchases. That's a recipe for dividend growth well above the rate of inflation for many years. Looking past the current volatility and out 10 to 20 years from now, Applied' payout could become substantial.",

AI stocks have started to tumble quickly, with AI-related companies like Palantir Technologies and Tesla trading down over 30% from all-time highs.\n\nInvestors are worried about slowing spend for these companies along with the general broad market weakness that has come with rising concerns about a possible recession as well as the Trump administration's various proposed and enacted tariffs.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nThis price drop among AI-related stocks has presented some attractive buy-the-dip opportunities for investors focused on the long term. Here are two AI stocks to buy the dip on right now.\n\nAlphabet: Pushing the boundaries of innovation\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has a manic-depressive reputation with Wall Street. Some days, it seems like the owner of Google, YouTube, and Google Cloud is lifted up as the most innovative AI company in the world. On other days, the narrative shifts to pessimism around upstart competition from the likes of OpenAI and others.\n\nTo start 2025, the pessimism is taking the lead and it has provided a buying opportunity for this high-quality business. Alphabet's revenue grew 15% year over year in 2024 to $350 billion. Operating income grew 33% to $112.4 billion. If Alphabet is feeling the pain from AI competition, it isn't showing up in its financials. The company is innovating rapidly across its sprawling technology operation. It is bringing AI to the masses by embedding new tools in Google Search, selling cloud computing to third parties through Google Cloud, and expanding its robotaxi service, called Waymo, in major U.S. cities.\n\nThat is just the tip of the iceberg. At its Google Deepmind division, researchers are working on cutting-edge AI advancements, such as embedding language models in humanoid robots. There is even work on quantum computing. If Alphabet is losing in AI, I see no evidence of that.\n\nWith the stock down 20% from all-time highs, Alphabet now trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 20, which is well below the S&P 500 average of 28. Even if there are new competitive threats and macroeconomic risks with tariffs in the short term, now looks like a great time to load up on Alphabet shares and hold for the long haul.\n\nApplied Materials: The AI base layer\n\nUnlike Alphabet, which almost every person in the world has interacted with, Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) is not a consumer-facing business. It develops and sells machines to help in the semiconductor manufacturing process, which is vital for AI innovation. Without advanced computer chips, it would be uneconomical to operate these advanced AI tools that companies like Alphabet have developed.\n\nAlong with a wider group of semiconductor equipment companies, Applied Materials helps manufacturers shape, process, and analyze tiny transistors on semiconductors. Without these machines, you wouldn't get tiny 3-nanometer lengths between transistors, making the company a vital part of the AI supply chain.\n\nApplied Materials has grown along with the semiconductor market in the last few decades and is now a global giant. Analysts expect the industry to continue growing faster than global GDP, which will be helped by the boom in AI spending. This should lead to even more growth for Applied Materials. In the last 10 years, Applied Materials has grown its sales by close to 200%.\n\nWith a consistent share buyback program, management has reduced shares outstanding by 34% in the last 10 years and plans to deploy at least 80% of its free cash flow to dividends and buybacks in the future. An additional $10 billion buyback authorization and 15% dividend increase was recently approved by the company's board of directors.\n\nWith the P/E now below 20, Applied Materials looks like a cheap growth stock with an attractive capital returns program, making it a perfect stock to buy and hold for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it\u2019s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nNvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you\u2019d have $315,521 !*\n\nif you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, !* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you\u2019d have $40,476 !*\n\nif you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, !* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you\u2019d have $495,070!*\n\nRight now, we\u2019re issuing \u201cDouble Down\u201d alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nContinue \u00bb\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of March 14, 2025\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

            "content": "AI stocks, once soaring, have plummeted over 30% from their highs, reflecting a shift in market sentiment amid recession fears and economic challenges.\n\nDespite the downturn, opportunities exist for savvy investors to buy the dip in promising companies like Alphabet and Applied Materials.\n\nAlphabet, a leader in AI innovation, showcases resilience with a 15% revenue growth in 2024, driven by advancements in Google Search, Google Cloud, and Waymo\u2019s robotaxi services.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s stock trades 20% below its peak, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 20, suggesting long-term investment potential.\n\nApplied Materials plays a critical role in the semiconductor industry, essential for AI technology, boasting 200% sales growth over a decade.\n\nThe company supports strategic growth with a $10 billion share buyback and a 15% dividend increase, demonstrating robust investor returns.\n\nBoth companies exemplify innovation and reliability, presenting attractive buy-and-hold options for investors navigating market uncertainty.\n\nThe glitz surrounding artificial intelligence stocks was radiant, almost blinding, between 2023 and 2024. AI seemed like an unsinkable titanic in the stock market world, with companies like Palantir Technologies and Tesla soaring to unimaginable heights. But as the gullible optimism of the sunny days gives way to 2025\u2019s gray skies, a stark shift has pulled these high-flying stocks down by over 30% from their all-time highs.\n\nInvestors now find themselves gripped by anxiety. Amidst the fluctuating winds of recession\u2014a term being whispered more frequently than ever\u2014and cloudy economic policies, the market\u2019s exuberance has turned cautious. Yet, where there\u2019s risk, there often lies opportunity. The downturn of AI stocks presents an intriguing prospect for discerning investors looking to buy the dip. Two notable players are ripe for attention: the omnipresent Alphabet and the industry backbone Applied Materials.\n\nConsider Alphabet, the powerhouse behind Google, YouTube, and Google Cloud. Wall Street\u2019s enthusiasm often oscillates between fervent praise and cautious concern for this tech mammoth. Despite the emergence of fearsome competitors like OpenAI, Alphabet remains a symbol of AI innovation. Its 2024 revenue metrics tell a compelling story, with a 15% year-over-year growth reaching a staggering $350 billion, and an impressive operating income growth of 33% to $112.4 billion.\n\nAlphabet is not just surviving; it\u2019s transforming. Its AI penetration into everyday life is evident through groundbreaking enhancements in Google Search, expansive Google Cloud services, and the ambitious rollout of Waymo\u2019s robotaxi services across major U.S. cities. The shadow of AI competition does not seem to touch the bright horizons Alphabet is navigating towards, as cutting-edge advances in Google DeepMind and ventures into quantum computing indicate a relentless push forward.\n\nThe stock has slipped to 20% below its all-time highs, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 20, which bodes well for long-term investors.\n\nMeanwhile, in the less glamorous but utterly essential realm of semiconductor machinery, stands Applied Materials. Unlike Alphabet, this titan isn\u2019t at the tip of everyone\u2019s tongue, yet its significance is palpable. Applied Materials crafts the foundation on which AI is built, engineering the machines essential for semiconductor production. These semiconductors power the AI innovations we witness today.\n\nA quiet giant, Applied Materials has burgeoned alongside the semiconductor sector, achieving nearly 200% sales growth over the past decade. Its commitment to strategic growth shines with a resolute share buyback program and a robust dividend policy. Recently, an extra $10 billion buyback authorization and a 15% dividend increase were greenlit, offering a nod to investors eyeing substantial capital returns.\n\nBoth Alphabet and Applied Materials represent a paradoxical blend of innovation and reliability, offering compelling buy-and-hold potential.\n\nAs the market navigates this period of uncertainty, those keen on the alchemy of risk and reward might find these AI stocks as promising harbingers of future profit. The trickle of today\u2019s investments could become the rivers of tomorrow\u2019s wealth\u2014if acted upon timely and wisely.\n\nUnlocking Hidden Potential: Why Now Might Be the Perfect Time to Invest in AI Stocks\n\nThe buzz around AI stocks has seen dramatic highs and lows from 2023 to 2025. Initial enthusiasm made them appear invincible in the stock market, with companies such as Palantir Technologies and Tesla reaching impressive peaks. However, recent challenges have caused these stocks to experience significant dips, shedding over 30% from their all-time highs. As investors face uncertainty, some see this downturn as an opportunity to buy the dip, specifically concerning companies like Alphabet and Applied Materials.

She lived in Columbus, Ohio, and I lived in Pennsylvania.\n\nWhen we met in person for the first time, she flew down to Atlanta from Columbus, where I was visiting family. I had been at my family's home for a week and was working remotely.\n\nShe flew down on a Friday evening, and I picked her up at the hotel the next day. On our first date, we went to Helen, Ga, and had a wonderful time. The following day, she went back home.\n\nThe following weekend was Labor Day weekend. I planned to head back to Lancaster on Sunday, but she asked me if I could go to Columbus instead and spend Labor Day with her. Although I wasn't off on the Tuesday after Labor Day, I only had meetings and could take those on the road back home.\n\nThat was the start of our unique long-distance relationship. My now-fianc\u00e9 travels for work, so we had to get creative building something special.\n\nWe knew that if we wanted this to work, we would have to make our work arrangements work for us. Since I had the most flexibility as a remote worker, I decided to travel wherever she worked to spend time together and build our relationship.\n\nOur relationship became a story written across many adventures\n\nSince that decision, we have been to many places. One of the most memorable was a two-week stay in Miami in February 2023. I flew to Miami for the first time and stayed with her in the hotel. During the day, we both worked, but in the evenings and on weekends, we would explore. From beach trips to Miami Beach to enjoying local restaurants, we enjoyed every minute of South Florida.\n\nIn April 2023, we spent a week together in California. On one day, she had to drive to different client sites. I could attend my work conference calls while on the road.\n\nOne of our memorable stops was an overnight stay in Monterey. We went to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and had lunch at the Fish Hopper, where it is the best Bloody Mary I have ever had.\n\nThat same year, in September, I joined her in Phoenix. I was able to visit the Grand Canyon for the first time. It was the most fantastic experience I've had to this day. As I looked across the canyon, I was in awe of its beauty and how fortunate I was to enjoy one of the world's wonders with my now-fianc\u00e9 \u2014 all because of our work arrangement.\n\nIn 2024, we spent the whole month of January in an Airbnb in Rincon, Puerto Rico. Since her job is seasonal, she was off, and I worked remotely during the day. We enjoyed everything that Rincon had to offer.\n\nEntering the long-distance relationship was the best decision of my life\n\nThe coordination of our schedules wasn't complicated. In the rare chance that I had to travel for work, I simply adjusted my travel to wherever she was at a time that worked for me but still gave us plenty of time together. It was a lesson in communication and coordination.\n\nTypically, a long-distance relationship would be an obstacle. But my remote status and her work travel were reasons our relationship flourished.\n\nIn the end, if I wanted our relationship to work, I needed to see our work arrangement as an opportunity to enjoy each other's company and spend time together doing fun things committed couples do.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

            "content": "Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, and others all boast stronger policies for chip-related manufacturing, photo Le Toan\n\nDuring the ASEAN Future Forum 2025 held in Hanoi late last month, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar bin Ibrahim stated that member states need to cement cooperation in manufacturing semiconductors to turn Southeast Asia into a major hub for such products.\n\n\u201cMalaysia is leading the region in semiconductor manufacturing and the country\u2019s leaders fully support the development of this industry,\u201d PM Ibrahim told Vietnamese counterpart Pham Minh Chinh.\n\nMalaysia began to develop semiconductor products about 20 years ago, with the participation of high-tech investors from the US, China, South Korea, and Japan. This success needs to be shared among other ASEAN nations, according to PM Ibrahim.\n\nMalaysia is the world\u2019s sixth-largest exporter of semiconductors, accounting for 13 per cent of the global assembly, testing and packaging market. It aims to lure in $115 billion worth of investments by 2030.\n\nLast week, British chip company Arm Holdings inked a deal with Malaysia to bolster its efforts to produce high-end semiconductors. The deal will see Softbank-owned Arm provide chip designs and other technology, helping Malaysia to move into more value-added production such as wafer fabrication and integrated circuit design. Malaysia reported to be paying $250 million over a decade to receive support from Arm Holdings.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s national semiconductor strategy aims to invest over $100 billion in advanced technologies. In May 2024, the Malaysian government committed to invest at least $5.6 billion in the semiconductor industry, with the goal of being self-sufficient in chip manufacturing within the next 5\u201310 years.\n\n\u201cIndonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand also want to develop semiconductors, so all of us need to stay united and boost cooperation in this industry. Malaysia stands ready to support Vietnam in this endeavour,\u201d PM Ibrahim said.\n\nThe global semiconductor industry is undergoing a significant transformation, with ASEAN emerging as a prominent player. Geopolitical tensions have opened opportunities for the region, with key contributors like Singapore and Malaysia leading the way.\n\nASEAN, in its effort to diversify the global supply chain, has recorded impressive growth. Total semiconductor exports from the region reached $268.8 billion in 2023, accounting for almost one-quarter of the global market. A 41.6 per cent increase in exports from 2018 to 2023 underscores the industry\u2019s growth in this area.\n\nVietnam\u2019s semiconductor industry is led by strategic government policies, raising foreign investment, and a growing demand for chips in various industries. With a projected market value of $31.28 billion by 2027 and a compound annual growth rate of 11.6 per cent from 2023 to 2027, Vietnam is steadily positioning itself as a key player in the global semiconductor supply chain, according to Dezan Shira & Associates.\n\nAfter Vietnam and the US forged a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2023, the former\u2019s semiconductor industry has been beefed up, with larger participation from global semiconductor giants such as Intel, OnSemi, Hana Micron, and Amkor. They are particularly found in outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) facilities in the northern region, and research and development centres in the south.\n\nUnder Vietnam\u2019s semiconductor strategy towards 2030, with a vision extending to 2050, the country will centre on talent development, manufacturing capacity, and global integration. According to the strategy, the country will establish at least 100 design companies, one small-scale manufacturing facility, and 10 packaging and testing plants, with annual revenue in the semiconductor industry of $25 billion, all by the end of this decade.\n\nThose revenues will aimed to be doubled by 2024 and, from there to mid-century doubled again to $100 billion, with Vietnam seeking to boast 300 design companies, three fabrication plants, and 20 OSAT plants.\n\nHowever, experts said a lack of high-quality personnel, underdeveloped infrastructure, and administrative hurdles need to be addressed.\n\nOther ASEAN countries, such as Indonesia and Singapore, are also ramping up efforts.\n\nSingapore is expanding its wafer fabrication zones and enhancing business support services. According to Singapore\u2019s Economic Development Board, over the past decades, Singapore has become a semiconductor powerhouse, holding 10 per cent of the global chip production and about a fifth of the world\u2019s chip-making gear.\n\nSingaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong in his budget speech late last month said that Singapore has attracted global AI and quantum computing firms. He pledged to spend around SGD1 billion ($747 million) on a new chip research facility.\n\nSingapore already houses plants for blue-chip US manufacturers including memory chip specialist Micron, outsource manufacturer GlobalFoundries and fabrication-equipment supplier Applied Materials.\n\nMeanwhile, Indonesia, with its abundant raw materials, is developing a supply chain from raw material extraction to production. This regional competition not only elevates ASEAN\u2019s position in the global semiconductor market but also fosters collaboration to create an integrated value chain.\n\n\u201cTo strongly develop the semiconductor industry successfully, we need to pay special attention to training high-quality personnel,\u201d Malaysian PM Ibrahim said.\n\nVietnam is aiming to train 50,000 skilled engineers for the industry by 2030 and about 100,000 by 2040.\n\nJapan-Vietnam tie-ups evident in semiconductors Strengthening Vietnam-Japan cooperation in training personnel and developing the semiconductor supply chain is expected to significantly accelerate the growth of the industry.\n\nEducation a major cog for semiconductor advances In a bid to provide more talent for Vietnam in high-tech industries, the government will establish a training system that will be the first of its type in the country.\n\nHigh-tech transition plans reach new stage Chip and semiconductor manufacturers as well as 5G network infrastructure developers in Vietnam will be entitled to various incentives from the government.",

[Photo = Courtesy of Clean Country]\n\nClean Nara, a life innovation solution company, announced on the 13th that it has successfully developed a new material for polystyrene (plastic made of styrene) with semi-combustible performance that is resistant to fire and has applied for a patent.\n\nThis study is a result of cooperation between Clean Nara and NDTec for about three years from 2022 with the aim of establishing a resource circulation system. Enditech is a manufacturing company that produces building material materials through recycling. The two companies overcame the shortcomings of the existing semi-non-combustible (material with fireproof performance comparable to non-combustible materials) polystyrene and developed new materials by recycling waste plastics.\n\nIn fact, the main insulation materials used at construction sites are polystyrene-based materials such as foamed polystyrene (styrofoam) and extruded foamed polystyrene, and although they have excellent insulation performance, the problem has been continuously raised that flames spread rapidly in the event of a fire and release a large amount of harmful gases. A semi-non-combustible polystyrene material with flame retardant liquid applied to the surface of the polystyrene material was also developed, but there was a limit to the flame retardant liquid being peeled off in case of fire and the material itself caught fire.\n\nTo improve this problem, Clean Nara has developed a semi-non-combustible polystyrene material that combines polystyrene and non-combustible drugs. The semi-non-combustible polystyrene material is characterized by reducing combustibility compared to the existing semi-non-combustible polystyrene material and reducing the amount of toxic gas generated to minimize the possibility of human damage in the event of a fire.\n\nAfter completing the performance test, Clean Nara aims to commercialize it in earnest within this year. In particular, it plans to apply new materials not only to the semi-non-combustible insulation market but also to various industrial sites such as automobiles, ships, and aircraft.\n\nCho Doo-young, head of Clean Nara's Future Strategy Office, said, \"We will not only secure a competitive advantage in various markets through new materials applied for patents this time, but also gradually upgrade the technology through subsequent R&D.\"",

(WKRN) \u2014 Some Canadians are canceling their trips to the United States over President Donald Trump\u2019s recent tariffs and his push for Canada to become the 51st state. The declining relationship between the two nations is impacting the tourism industry, even in Tennessee.\n\nTennessee has a vibrant tourism industry that spans the entire state, with attractions like Nashville\u2019s Lower Broadway, Dollywood, and the Tennessee Whiskey Trail. Travel experts believe the drop in Canadian tourists will be felt in the Volunteer State.\n\nTrump pauses Canadian tariffs for 30 days in deal with Trudeau\n\n\u201cWe actually saw that have an immediate impact on travel to the United States through our organization,\u201d Travel Alliance Partnership CEO Nicole Mahoney said. \u201cWe have members who are tour operators and travel providers who sell trips to Canadians into the U.S., and one of our tour operators told us immediately she lost about 30% of her business trips that she had already booked to the U.S.\u201d\n\nThe Travel Alliance Partnership, a leader in the tourism industry, helps organizations grow and thrive. Mahoney believes this trend of canceled trips to the U.S. could continue if relations with Canada don\u2019t improve.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump agreed to pause the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Still, some Canadians believe their country is being disrespected.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks on Canada becoming the 51st state raise a lot of questions\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like, politically, what\u2019s going on,\u201d Canadian Neil Anderson said. \u201cThey\u2019re attacking my country.\u201d\n\nAnderson and his family were planning a trip to Nashville and Memphis this weekend. However, he decided to cancel those travel plans and vacation in Mexico instead.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Travel Association, Canadians spend more than $20 billion a year in the United States, and 140,000 American jobs depend on those travelers. The airline industry could also be affected as fewer Canadians book flights.\n\n\u23e9 Read today\u2019s top stories on wkrn.com\n\nTravel experts believe relations between both countries has to improve to fix this current issue.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Airbnb: Lock on global travel demand\n\nAirbnb took the world by storm with its innovative short-term rental and travel platform. It is now a major presence in the global travel market and is considered the third-largest online travel agency after competitor Booking Holdings.\n\nCustomers spent $81.8 billion on the Airbnb platform in 2024, up 12% year over year. It generated $2.6 billion in net income last year.\n\nThe stock is now in a 22% drawdown from recent highs despite posting strong earnings as investors worry about a consumer recession caused by the Trump administration tariffs and geopolitical conflicts. Recently, Delta Air Lines reduced its guidance for the first quarter, citing slowing consumer confidence and willingness to spend on travel compared to just a few months ago. This has people worried that Airbnb's growth will slow.\n\nWhile this could occur, Airbnb is a robust platform that hundreds of millions of people have used. It has 5 million people hosting lodging services. If the travel industry goes through a slowdown, Airbnb's revenue growth will go down.\n\nBut over the long term, it is clear that people enjoy its model and will do so on the other side of any downturn. Generating revenue by taking a cut of every dollar that flows through its marketplace, Airbnb is protected from inflation as well. This makes the business model a take rate on global travel.\n\nIf you believe spending on travel will grow over the long term -- especially considering inflation -- then it is highly likely that Airbnb's revenue will grow as well.\n\nRight now, Airbnb trades at a market cap of $78 billion. This is a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 30 when compared to its 2024 net income, which doesn't look dirt cheap. Investors should remember, though, that Airbnb is reinvesting aggressively to expand its marketplace with new offerings set to come out this year.\n\nAt maturity, there is no reason Airbnb's margins can't reach the same level as Booking Holdings. Take this into account and Airbnb looks like a cheap stock to buy during this stock market drawdown.\n\n2. Applied Materials: Navigating the semiconductor landscape\n\nThe modern world runs on computer chips. Applied Materials is one of the pillars of this market, and yet few people outside of the industry have ever heard of the business. It builds and sells machines to semiconductor manufacturers that help them make advanced computer chips.\n\nThese machines give manufacturers the ability to analyze, modify, and shape semiconductor designs at the microscopic level, which is how a chip designer such as Nvidia can sell computer chips with transistors only 3 nanometers apart.\n\nWithout Applied Materials' machines and services, advanced computer chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing could not be built. With few competitors in this market, Applied Materials has grown along with the overall demand for semiconductor manufacturing. Revenue was $27.6 billion over the last 12 months and is up close to 200% in the last 10 years.\n\nWith the massive spending on computer chips relative to AI, Applied Materials should see even more growth in the years ahead. For decades, the world has used more and more advanced computer chips. I see no reason for this trend to stop anytime soon.\n\nAt this writing, you can buy Applied Materials stock at a P/E of just 19, which is well below the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 index averages. Despite this sharp correction, the S&P 500 still trades at an average P/E of 28, which is well above its historical average.\n\nApplied Materials should maintain its dominant position in semiconductors for years to come, and create wealth for shareholders who hold on for the long term. This makes the stock an easy buy for your portfolio today.",

            "content": "Applied Materials (AMAT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of chipmaking equipment have returned -18.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -7.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, which Applied Materials falls in, has lost 20.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Applied Materials is expected to post earnings of $2.30 per share, indicating a change of +10.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $9.36 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8.2%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.98 indicates a change of +6.7% from what Applied Materials is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.8%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Applied Materials is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Applied Materials, the consensus sales estimate of $7.11 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7%. The $28.77 billion and $30.39 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5.9% and +5.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nApplied Materials reported revenues of $7.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.8%. EPS of $2.38 for the same period compares with $2.13 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.15 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.18%. The EPS surprise was +4.39%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApplied Materials is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Applied Materials. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nZacks' Research Chief Names \"Stock Most Likely to Double\"\n\nOur team of experts has just released the 5 stocks with the greatest probability of gaining +100% or more in the coming months. Of those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian highlights the one stock set to climb highest.\n\nThis top pick is among the most innovative financial firms.

As a result, automakers are being encouraged to invest in advanced materials that can help meet these ambitious environmental targets.\n\nRestraints\n\nHigh Cost of Advanced Materials in the Food Industry\n\nOne of the key restraining factors for the growth of the advanced materials market is the high cost associated with these materials, particularly in the food industry. Advanced materials, which include high-performance plastics, composites, and bio-based materials, are often more expensive to produce compared to traditional materials. This cost burden makes it challenging for food manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to adopt these materials on a large scale.\n\nFor example, the use of high-quality biodegradable packaging made from advanced materials like polylactic acid (PLA) or plant-based polymers can increase packaging costs significantly. According to the European Bioplastics association, while biodegradable plastics can reduce environmental impact, their production costs are currently 2 to 3 times higher than conventional plastics. This price gap presents a challenge for food manufacturers trying to balance cost-efficiency with sustainability goals. In fact, the overall cost of using such advanced materials in packaging can sometimes outweigh the potential savings in waste disposal and environmental impact.\n\nIn addition to production costs, there are also expenses related to the research and development (R&D) of advanced materials. R&D efforts to create more sustainable food packaging materials often require significant investment in both time and resources. The high costs involved can limit the ability of smaller companies to innovate and integrate new materials into their processes.\n\nDespite these challenges, governments and organizations are working to mitigate the cost factor through initiatives and funding.

As consumers become more environmentally conscious, the pressure on food companies to adopt eco-friendly packaging materials has escalated. Advanced materials, such as biodegradable plastics, plant-based polymers, and recycled materials, are emerging as alternatives to traditional plastic packaging, offering an effective solution to the growing environmental concerns.\n\nThe shift towards sustainable packaging is not only driven by consumer preferences but also by stricter government regulations. For example, the European Union\u2019s Green Deal includes measures aimed at reducing plastic waste and promoting the use of recyclable or biodegradable materials. The EU aims to ensure that all plastic packaging is reusable or recyclable by 2030, creating a strong incentive for food companies to explore advanced packaging materials.\n\nIn line with this, the European Bioplastics association projects that the demand for bioplastics, including packaging for food, will grow at an annual rate of 20% over the next few years, with the market potentially reaching over 2.3 million tons by 2025. This growth presents a significant opportunity for manufacturers and innovators in the advanced materials space.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is also exploring new materials that are both safe for food use and environmentally sustainable. The FDA has been actively supporting research into food-safe bioplastics, which could replace conventional plastics in food packaging. The growing support from both governmental bodies and consumers is expected to drive innovation in the food packaging sector, presenting lucrative opportunities for companies specializing in advanced materials.\n\nTrends\n\nAdoption of Plant-Based and Biodegradable Materials in Food Packaging\n\nA significant trend in the advanced materials sector, especially in the food industry, is the growing shift towards plant-based and biodegradable materials for packaging. This trend is fueled by both consumer demand for environmentally friendly products and stricter government regulations aimed at reducing plastic waste. As sustainability becomes a major concern for both consumers and businesses, food companies are increasingly seeking alternatives to traditional plastic packaging.\n\nAccording to the European Bioplastics association, the global market for bioplastics is expected to grow at an annual rate of 20%, with the bioplastics market reaching 2.3 million tons by 2025. A significant portion of this growth is driven by the food packaging industry, where demand for eco-friendly materials is rising. In particular, bioplastics like polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are being used to create packaging that is not only biodegradable but also safe for food contact. These materials help reduce the environmental impact of food packaging while ensuring that safety and quality standards are met.\n\nGovernments worldwide are also supporting the use of sustainable packaging materials through various initiatives. In the United States, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has launched programs to promote the use of bioplastics in food packaging, including providing grants to companies researching and developing plant-based alternatives. Similarly, the European Union\u2019s Green Deal aims to reduce plastic waste and increase the use of recyclable and biodegradable packaging materials by 2030. These government initiatives, combined with growing consumer awareness, are driving the widespread adoption of plant-based materials in the food industry.\n\nRegional Analysis\n\nIn 2024, North America held a dominant position in the advanced materials market, capturing more than 39.30% of the market share, valued at approximately USD 27.6 billion.

            "content": "Applied Materials announced a notable 15% increase in its quarterly dividend, marking the eighth consecutive year of rising dividends, which may have offset some broader market pressures and contributed to its 2% price increase over the past week. This positive development comes amid a challenging week for technology stocks, with the Nasdaq dropping 4% due to concerns over tariffs and the economic outlook. The 1% drop in major indexes, including the Nasdaq, reflected widespread apprehension about potential inflation and global trade impacts. Despite the predominantly negative sentiment in the tech sector, which saw significant declines in stocks like Tesla and Apple, the dividend announcement likely provided investor confidence in the company's commitment to shareholder returns. While the broader market faced a turbulent period, causing major indexes to give back some of their earlier gains, Applied Materials managed to distinguish itself with its latest dividend policy update.\n\nDig deeper into the specifics of Applied Materials here with our thorough analysis report.\n\nNasdaqGS:AMAT Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nThe last five years have seen Applied Materials deliver a robust total return of 302.14%, including share price and dividends, illustrating strong shareholder value creation. While the company's earnings have grown at 15.6% annually, it recently faced a decline in net income, dropping from US$2.02 billion to US$1.19 billion in Q1 2025. Despite those recent challenges, Applied Materials maintained a high return on equity at 34.1%, emphasizing its operational efficiency and capital utilization.\n\nFurther strengthening investor confidence, the company entered a US$2 billion revolving credit facility, providing financial flexibility and enhancing its capital structure. Additionally, Applied Materials completed a significant share buyback program, repurchasing 13.3 million shares totaling US$2.42 billion by early 2025. Although it underperformed compared to the broader US market and its industry over the past year, these strategic financial maneuvers underscore its focus on rewarding investors and sustaining long-term growth prospects.",

(NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against the other oversold blue chip stocks.\n\nThe uncertainty related to the tariff announcements continues to influence Wall Street. Reuters reported that the S&P 500 is down 4.3% since Trump took office on January 20, and tariffs are the main concern for investors as they believe that can adversely impact the economic growth and be inflationary. While Trump believes that tariffs can increase the country's revenue, fuel broad-based growth, and can be used as a negotiating tool with other countries, the investors believe that trade policies can weaken consumer confidence and limit the capital spending from companies.\n\nLong Term Outlook Remains Intact\n\nAs per Franklin Templeton, the US equities have managed to provide strong gains over the past few years, with the S&P 500 repeatedly touching record highs, thanks to the Magnificent Seven\u2019s dominance in AI. Despite elevated valuations, the broader market outlook is positive. Innovation and investment continue at a pace, sales growth has been accelerating, and earnings are expected to see a double-digit rise this year. Also, the US economy has a more business-friendly administration. That being said, there are risks, mainly related to the US trade policy and the expected impact of tariffs on critical sectors, including technology.\n\nAmidst such uncertainties, Franklin Templeton believes that investor confidence in the US equities is expected to remain strong. While the risks might be elevated, the new administration\u2019s policy changes are expected to finally result in long-term positives for the broader US economy.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nBlue Chips to Provide Shelter\n\nWhile the Mag 7 stocks are well-placed for the long-term growth, the market leadership is expected to broaden as and when acceleration in innovation occurs, says Franklin Templeton. The investment firm believes that active management is of utmost importance. The pivot from AI infrastructure to platforms remains well underway. Therefore, identifying the right companies at the right time\u2014ones possessing the technology, strategy, and adaptability to maintain and sustain long-term growth\u2014are expected to be critical to investment success.\n\nThe US equities, mainly large caps, have been performing strongly, courtesy of the innovation and investment. Notably, over the past 6 months, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has seen an increase of over ~4.5%. Even though the Mag 7 stocks continue to support the market momentum, the investment firm sees growing opportunities beyond such market leaders. With the continuation of AI-driven cycle, the competitive landscape remains dynamic and has been creating new growth areas.",

Innovation and investment continue at a pace, sales growth has been accelerating, and earnings are expected to see a double-digit rise this year. Also, the US economy has a more business-friendly administration. That being said, there are risks, mainly related to the US trade policy and the expected impact of tariffs on critical sectors, including technology.\n\nAmidst such uncertainties, Franklin Templeton believes that investor confidence in the US equities is expected to remain strong. While the risks might be elevated, the new administration\u2019s policy changes are expected to finally result in long-term positives for the broader US economy.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nBlue Chips to Provide Shelter\n\nWhile the Mag 7 stocks are well-placed for the long-term growth, the market leadership is expected to broaden as and when acceleration in innovation occurs, says Franklin Templeton. The investment firm believes that active management is of utmost importance. The pivot from AI infrastructure to platforms remains well underway. Therefore, identifying the right companies at the right time\u2014ones possessing the technology, strategy, and adaptability to maintain and sustain long-term growth\u2014are expected to be critical to investment success.\n\nThe US equities, mainly large caps, have been performing strongly, courtesy of the innovation and investment. Notably, over the past 6 months, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has seen an increase of over ~4.5%. Even though the Mag 7 stocks continue to support the market momentum, the investment firm sees growing opportunities beyond such market leaders. With the continuation of AI-driven cycle, the competitive landscape remains dynamic and has been creating new growth areas.\n\nAmidst these trends, let us now have a look at the 11 Oversold Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 11 Oversold Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we used a screener and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF to shortlist the companies that have declined over the past year.

Edison International (NYSE:EIX)\n\n% Decline Over Past One Year: ~18.7%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 38\n\nMarket Cap as on March 7: $21.7 billion\n\nEdison International (NYSE:EIX) is engaged in generation and distribution of electric power. Mizuho Securities analyst Anthony Crowdell reiterated the bullish stance on the company\u2019s stock, providing a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on February 27. The analyst\u2019s rating is backed by factors such as the company\u2019s healthy 2025 guidance and its efforts to address wildfire-related challenges. Edison International (NYSE:EIX) has revised its 2025 core EPS guidance of $5.94-$6.34.\n\nDespite uncertainties, the company\u2019s management reflected prudent actions that can potentially mitigate financial impacts. Looking ahead, Edison International (NYSE:EIX)\u2019s management exhibited confidence in achieving 2025 EPS guidance, with projections of 5% \u2013 7% core EPS compound annual growth rate through 2028. Edison International (NYSE:EIX) remains focused on continuing its investments in grid hardening and distribution system expansion.\n\nThe company\u2019s growth strategy focuses on California\u2019s clean energy transition and electrification goals. Edison International (NYSE:EIX) is well-placed to benefit from the expansion of electric vehicles (EVs) and overall electrification trends within SCE\u2019s service territory. ClearBridge Investments, an investment management company, released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cFrom a sector perspective, meanwhile, our utilities overweight was positive, with Edison International (NYSE:EIX) our top individual contributor. The company reached a tentative deal to recoup $1.7 billion of wildfire and mudslide expenses in California, bolstering its balance sheet, increasing earnings and demonstrating the favorable regulatory environment in California, benefiting both Edison as well as Sempra, our largest utility holding. Another rate-sensitive area \u2014 real estate \u2014 was the second-best sector performer as rate cuts boosted valuations in this area. Our REITs underweight, however, was a headwind during the period.\u201d\n\n% Decline Over Past 1 Year: ~17.5%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 54\n\nMarket Cap as on March 7: $84.7 billion\n\nAirbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is engaged in operating a platform that enables hosts to offer stays and experiences to guests.

(NASDAQ:ABNB)\u2019s revenue came in at $2.5 billion, reflecting an increase of 12% YoY. As per the analyst, while the outlook was a bit below expectations, mainly because of calendar effects and FX headwinds, management demonstrated that favourable demand trends continued into 2025.\n\nElsewhere, Bernstein increased the target price to $185 from $158, keeping an \u201cOutperform\u201d rating on Airbnb, Inc.

Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cAirbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is an online marketplace to list, discover and book unique accommodations worldwide. The company benefits from a strong network effect between its guests and hosts. We believe there is a long growth runway as global travel is an attractive market, and alternative accommodations have been taking share. We anticipate Airbnb will drive further growth by creating more valuable services for both sides of its network, which includes the potential for paid placement, which has created significant economic value for comparable market places. In our view, management is aligned shareholders and well qualified to lead Airbnb as the company attempts to capture these growth opportunities. Short-term concerns about the macro travel environment and declining margins stemming from growth investments allowed us to purchase shares at a discount to our estimate of business value.\u201d\n\n9. Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS)\n\n% Decline Over Past 1 Year: ~20%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 59\n\nMarket Cap as on March 7: $66.6 billion\n\nCadence Design Systems, Inc.

The rating was backed by factors affecting the company\u2019s future performance. As per the analyst, the specific segments such as IP and SD&A are projected to outperform Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS)\u2019s average growth rate, demonstrating potential for high-teens and mid-teens growth, respectively. Despite the expectation of core EDA segment underperforming, and the China market outlook remaining flat, the overall business trajectory remains positive, opines Shi.\n\nElsewhere, analyst Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the company\u2019s stock. This rating stems from the factors highlighting Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS)\u2019s strategic positioning in the broader market. One of the critical reasons is its unique leverage in addressing the chip complexity and surge in AI design processes, which remain critical growth areas in the semiconductor industry. The analyst further added that Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS)\u2019s strong backlog, strength of its hardware portfolio, and the integration of recent acquisitions continue to paint a favourable outlook. Also, the company has been expanding its FCF margins, which can grow further, highlighting its financial resilience and efficiency.\n\n8. First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR)\n\n% Decline Over Past One Year: ~14.2%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 65\n\nMarket Cap as on March 7: $14.8 billion\n\nFirst Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) is a solar technology company, which is engaged in providing photovoltaic (PV) solar energy solutions. Analyst Ameet Thakkar from BMO Capital reiterated a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the company\u2019s stock. The rating stemmed from factors reflecting the company\u2019s potential for growth and value. As per the analyst, the favourable outlook on revenue is expected to help take some pressure off First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR)\u2019s stock price over the short term. Furthermore, the analyst opines that the factors impacting margins, including increased logistics costs, are temporary.\n\nElsewhere, analyst Jeff Osborne of TD Cowen also maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the company\u2019s stock, retaining the price objective of $275.00. As per the analyst, First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR)\u2019s CuRe launch continues to progress as planned, and there is stability in the average selling price in the backlog, aiding future revenue. Overall, the analyst believes that any sort of weakness in the stock can be considered as a buying opportunity, considering First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR)\u2019s strategic initiatives and long-term growth potential.\n\nThe solar industry, mainly First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR), is significantly influenced by government policies and regulations.

(NASDAQ:REGN) has also announced that the European Medicines Agency\u2019s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending conditional marketing authorization of linvoseltamab to treat adults having relapsed and refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM). Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) highlighted that there are more than 35,000 new cases of MM diagnosed in Europe and 187,000 new cases of MM diagnosed globally every year. The company\u2019s financial and commercial strength enables it for continued investment in its industry-leading R&D pipeline.\n\nBaron Funds, an investment management company, released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cWe purchased Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN), a biopharmaceutical company that was built on a foundation in basic scientific research and antibody development. The company has successfully developed several blockbuster medicines, including Eylea and Eylea HD for retinal diseases (such as wet age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, and diabetic retinopathy) and Dupixent for immunological and inflammatory diseases (such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, and COPD). While Eylea is nearing the end of its patent life and faces potential biosimilar competition, the company has been transitioning patients to Eylea HD, which is a higher dose, longer-acting formulation of Eylea, and Dupixent is growing rapidly through indication expansion. Beyond the current product portfolio, Regeneron has an exciting new product pipeline with over 35 candidates in various stages of development, including a novel treatment for treating severe food allergy, a combination checkpoint inhibitor therapy for melanoma, lung cancer and other solid tumors, biospecific antibodies for blood cancers, and Factor XI antibodies for blood clot prevention, among others. Based on Regeneron\u2019s track record of success discovering and developing new drugs, we are optimistic the pipeline will deliver some successes, which we think will drive upside in the stock.\u201d\n\n% Decline Over Past 1 Year: ~20%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 72\n\nMarket Cap as on March 7: $69.7 billion\n\nSynopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) offers electronic design automation software products used to design and test integrated circuits. Needham analyst Charles Shi has maintained the bullish stance on the company\u2019s stock, giving a \u201cBuy\u201d rating. The analyst\u2019s rating is backed by factors that revolve around its recent performance and future outlook. Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) has maintained its financial guidance. For FY 2025, it expects revenue in the range of $6,745 million \u2013 $6,805 million.\n\nAs per the analyst, the consistency is regarded as a positive indicator, even as Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) expects a decrease in revenue from China. The analyst also noted the market\u2019s current pricing of Intel-related risks into the company\u2019s stock. The pricing adjustment results in enhancing the stock\u2019s risk/reward profile, making it attractive. Elsewhere, Morgan Stanley analyst Lee Simpson maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS)\u2019s stock, setting a price target of $590.00.\n\nThis rating highlights the company\u2019s strong performance and strategic positioning. As per the analyst, despite the slowing growth in China, Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) demonstrated strength in other areas, mainly in its hardware segment, which supported it in maintaining its FY 2025 guidance. Parnassus Investments, an investment management company, released the Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cSynopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) plays a crucial role in optimizing semiconductor processing power beyond physical design limits. It benefits from companies like Google and Amazon designing their own chips and the proliferation of AI accelerator development. Its proprietary EDA technology and rising demand for custom chips and AI accelerators should drive durable revenue and earnings growth.\u201d\n\n5. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)\n\n% Decline Over Past 1 Year: ~12.6%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\n\nMarket Cap as on March 7: $83.6 billion\n\nCVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) offers health solutions in the US. The company had its stock upgraded by an analyst after it surpassed the quarterly profit expectations by a wide margin, and as it continues to make strides in its pharmacy-benefit-manager business. Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny upped the rating on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)\u2019s stock to \u201cBuy\u201d from \u201cMarket perform,\u201d increasing the price target to $75. As per the analyst, the company continues to benefit from stabilization in its Aetna health-insurance and pharmacy-benefits businesses.

The company\u2019s integrated healthcare model offers a unique value proposition in the market. By owning several components of the healthcare value chain, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) can realize cost savings and operational efficiencies which the standalone competitors cannot match.\n\nAriel Investments, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cLastly, American healthcare company, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) underperformed in the period. The company preannounced a third-quarter preliminary profit estimate materially below consensus expectations and pulled its 2024 guidance due to continued medical cost pressures. Investor concerns around the recently proposed Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) legislation further weighed on shares. Despite these challenges, management reiterated its focus on improving margins and enhancing its positioning in Medicare Advantage (MA). CVS believes the program can remain an attractive business for Aetna and CVS Health over time as it implements a multi-year repricing strategy across plan level benefits. Meanwhile, CVS continues to take actions to drive long-term success including the appointment of longtime company executive David Joyner as President and CEO as well as adding four new board members.\u201d\n\n4. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)\n\n% Decline Over Past 1 Year: ~22%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 80\n\nMarket Cap as on March 7: $126.4 billion\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is engaged in the provision of manufacturing equipment, services, and software to the semiconductor, display, and related industries. Stifel analysts reiterated the \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the company\u2019s stock, maintaining a price target of $235.00. There are expectations of stability in advanced foundry and logic segments. Brian Chin, an analyst of Stifel, remains optimistic about Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)\u2019s outlook, lauding the potential to sustain growth amidst the current challenges.\n\nFor Q2 2025, the company is encouraged by the trends aiding continuing customer investments to enable leading-edge technology inflections, while taking into consideration export control related headwinds. For Q2 2025, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) expects total net revenue of $7,100 million (+/- $400 million), and a non-GAAP gross margin of ~48.4%. Overall, the semiconductor equipment industry continues to experience a period of transformation fueled by the higher demand for advanced chips throughout various sectors. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)\u2019s competitive advantage revolves around its broad portfolio of technologies enhancing chip efficiency and enabling advanced packaging solutions.\n\nVltava Fund, an investment management company, published its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cIn the quarter just ended, we added to the portfolio two new companies from the technology sector: Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Lam Research. Both are in the same industry as is another of our investments that we have held for some time, KLA Corporation. This industry is termed semiconductor devices and materials. One chapter in Hidden Investment Treasures is devoted to investing in technology companies and, among other things, the controversy over what really constitutes a technology company. As investors, we try to view technology companies not according to the industry into which they are formally classified but by whether the technologies and technological processes used in the production of their products and services are an essential element in value creation or if they are a source of long-term, sustainable competitive advantage. Among the companies that are formally categorized as technology-based and fall into either the Information Technology or the Communications Services sector, we find some that can be said to be just that but also others for which this classification is at least debatable. Similarly, among companies that do not formally belong to these two sectors, we find many that clearly are built to a large extent on technology and base their market positions and competitiveness on it. In the cases of Applied Materials and Lam Research, there can be no doubt that these are technology companies not only as a formality but also in fact. Applied Materials provides manufacturing equipment, services, and software for the semiconductor, display, and related industries. Its principal business activities are semiconductor systems and Applied Global Services. Its largest customers are Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors, but its overall clientele is more diversified than is that of Lam Research. At first glance, it would appear that Applied Materials has a somewhat less tangible and definable competitive advantage compared to KLA Corporation and Lam Research, but the numbers do not support such a view. Net margins likewise in the neighborhood of 27% and ROCE around 30% are outstanding. Basically, it can be said that all three companies we own have very similar underlying profitability metrics. Even their valuations, growth, and potential are similar. All have strong free cash flow and strong balance sheets, and they are regularly buying back their own shares over the long term and in large volumes\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\n3. Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)\n\n% Decline Over Past 1 Year: ~15.1%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 84\n\nMarket Cap as on March 7: $101.4 billion\n\nLam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) designs, manufactures, markets, refurbishes, and services semiconductor processing equipment utilized in the fabrication of integrated circuits. Needham analyst Charles Shi has maintained the bullish stance on the company\u2019s stock, giving a \u201cBuy\u201d rating. The rating is backed by the company\u2019s recent strategic plans. It has recently unveiled its 2028 and 2030 target models. Amidst the potential risks, the analyst remains optimistic about these targets, and believes in its capability. With respect to CY 2028 financial model, Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) expects revenue in the range of $25 billion \u2013 $27 billion.\n\nA critical highlight of the target models is the strong gross margin target of ~50%, which the analyst views positively. Additionally, there is confidence in Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)\u2019s operational expenditure planning and conservative share buyback strategies, which can aid strong growth in EPS. The company\u2019s strong position in the NAND market offers a significant growth opportunity. With the demand for high-capacity storage solutions rising, thanks to the data-intensive applications and cloud computing, Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)\u2019s expertise in NAND technologies can result in significant revenue growth.\n\nVltava Fund, an investment management company, recently released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cIn the quarter just ended, we added to the portfolio two new companies from the technology sector: Applied Materials and Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX). Both are in the same industry as is another of our investments that we have held for some time, KLA Corporation. This industry is termed semiconductor devices and materials.

Similarly, among companies that do not formally belong to these two sectors, we find many that clearly are built to a large extent on technology and base their market positions and competitiveness on it. In the cases of Applied Materials and Lam Research, there can be no doubt that these are technology companies not only as a formality but also in fact. Dozens of companies are directly or indirectly involved in the production of semiconductors. Within this broad group of companies, there are several without which it would not be possible to produce advanced types of semiconductors in the world today. These include a group of five very well-known companies, each of which has a dominant global position in its particular field, and which together operate more or less as oligopolies. These are Lam Research, Applied Materials, KLA Corporation, ASML, and Tokyo Electron. At the end of the year, we benefited from a significant correction in the share prices of Applied Materials and Lam Research, and, together with KLA Corporation, we now own three of them. We view these as one collective investment into a critical point within a very important segment of the global economy that is growing and will continue to grow over the long term. Lam Research manufactures wafer fabrication equipment for the semiconductor industry and also provides related services. The company is a market leader in plasma etching, thin film deposition platforms, photoresist systems, as well as wet and plasma-based cleaning products for individual wafers. Its main customers are the four major semiconductor manufacturers Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, and Taiwan Semiconductors. Lam Research is a business with net margins of around 27% and ROCE of about 30%. Capital outlays are relatively small. The company has good capital allocation with a preponderance of share buybacks\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\n2. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\n% Decline Over Past 1 Year: ~22%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 91\n\nMarket Cap as on March 7: $239.0 billion\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) operates as a healthcare company. Nico Chen, an analyst from DBS, maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the company\u2019s stock and the associated price target remains the same at $100.00. The rating is backed by factors highlighting the company\u2019s healthy market position and growth potential. The analyst further added that a significant driver of this favourable outlook is Keytruda, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\u2019s blockbuster drug, which has placed the company as a leader in oncology.\n\nFurthermore, another critical factor is the promising development of sac-TMT, which is an antibody-drug conjugate for treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer, which has received a Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the US FDA. The analyst opines that this designation is expected to expedite its market entry and drive Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\u2019s share price. Overall, the rating stems from the company\u2019s strong financial outlook, with an anticipated ramp up of net income growth and a comparatively low risk of patent expiries versus the industry peers.\n\nGreensKeeper Asset Management, an investment management company, released its Q3 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) was our second-largest detractor this quarter, declining -8.3%. MRK\u2019s leading HPV vaccine, GARDASIL 9, faced challenges internationally due to inventory buildup within its Chinese distributor, which is expected to reduce shipments for the remainder of 2024. Despite this short-term impact, the long-term outlook for GARDASIL 9 remains promising. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s $27 billion Keytruda cancer juggernaut continues to grow at a healthy clip, powering earnings growth.\u201d\n\n1. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\n% Decline Over Past 1 Year: ~19.8%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 117\n\nMarket Cap as on March 7: $195.6 billion\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) operates as a technology company. Keith Bachman, an analyst from BMO Capital, maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the company\u2019s stock. The associated price target remains the same at $515.00. The rating was backed by factors including the company\u2019s consistent performance and market leadership. As per the analyst, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\u2019s robust position in its core product categories, such as Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud, continues to reinforce its growth potential. The integration of AI and Adobe Express can contribute positively to net new ARR and overall growth, aiding the analyst\u2019s rating.\n\nElsewhere, Michael Turrin, an analyst from Wells Fargo, maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\u2019s stock. The rating stemmed from the company\u2019s promising start to the year in both the Digital Media and Digital Experience segments. Additionally, the valuation of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\u2019s shares appears attractive, which suggests growth potential. The analyst also believes that the company can capitalize on multiple AI-enabled product cycles, aided by its robust market position and expected product developments.\n\nPolen Capital, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cWe added to several existing positions in the quarter including Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Workday, Shopify, MSCI, and Paycom Software. We feel Adobe is poised for re-accelerating revenue and earnings growth partially due to the monetization of its Firefly GenAI product embedded in its creative software.\u201d\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of ADBE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against other most undervalued high quality stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nIs a Market Rally Around The Corner?\n\nIn one of our recent articles, titled 11 Best Undervalued Stocks to Invest in Now, we talked about how the recent tariffs have caused a slowdown in the market and are likely to cause inflation. Here\u2019s a piece from the article:\n\n\u201cToday, Richard Fisher, former Dallas Fed president, appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the recent tariffs and their impact on the market. Fisher stated that a tariff is a cost factor that goes into producing and distributing a product, making it a form of tax. Business operators of all sizes have to figure out a way to protect their margins against the impact. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve has to gauge the amount of revenue it would generate from these tariffs considering it is slowing down the economy and can cause inflation as the companies will have to raise prices to maintain their margins. Moreover, Richard Fisher noted that such tariffs take a long to be digested, as businesses don\u2019t change something overnight. The only way for companies to maintain their margins without increasing prices is by increasing productivity, which again does not happen overnight and takes time.\u201d\n\nOn March 6, Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about how the market is likely to proceed forward from here. Lee stated that he is still optimistic about the market, he acknowledged that investors are sitting out at the moment as they are trying to assess the severity of these tariffs. However as a result the market is seeing a big price correction and a decline in sentiment. Moreover, Lee noted that we also had a bad ADP jobs report and the market is going up on bad news which he believes is good for the market.\n\nLee explained what has happened during the six weeks essentially represents a bear market that has swept through sentiment and positioning because if we look at the hedge funds positioning it has almost gone neutral. Lee believes because of this the current and two upcoming months can be huge rally months, where the market can be rallying as much as 10% to 15%.\n\nWhile answering the question of whether this slowdown is a Buy, Lee noted that the 10 best days happen every year for the market. Last year the 10 best days of the year added up to 21% to the S&P 500, excluding these 10 days the market was only up 4%. He explained that markets don\u2019t get 20% gains throughout the year, it is those 10 best days where the market rallies the most. Lee thinks that these 10 best days for 2025 are near because if the economy is near stall speed, the \u201cTrump Put\u201d will come back, otherwise, the market has to unwind all this austerity. Moreover, if the job market is soft, the \u201cFed Put\u201d comes back into play, because the Fed does not want the stall speed to linger. Lee thinks these two things are going to be the positive catalysts in the next couple of weeks.",

That is because the Mar 21, 2025 $90 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Applied Materials shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Applied Materials is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Electronics - Semiconductors industry that ranks in the Top 25% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while six analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.33 per share to $2.30 in that period.\n\n\n\nGiven the way analysts feel about Applied Materials right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\n\nLooking to Trade Options?\n\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

(NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against the other cheap tech stocks.\n\nIt seems that technology stocks have had a tough start to 2025. On March 4, 2025, CNBC reported that since President Donald Trump took office in January, the S&P 500 technology sector has dropped 7.5%. Tech stocks have slumped largely due to new tariffs that have set off a trade war and added fuel to the risk-off sentiment on Wall Street.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Worst Performing Crypto Stocks to Buy Now and 10 Unrivaled Stocks of the Next 5 Years.\n\nEconomists had cautioned that tariffs could lead to a rise in inflation and create global economic disruptions. Many leading tech companies assemble and manufacture products outside the US and as a result of the tariffs these companies could see manufacturing costs rise.\n\nSemiconductor stocks have also been hit hard. On March 3, Trump cleared the way for new 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada and smashed hopes of a potential last-minute deal. According to the US President, there was \u201cno room left\u201d for further negotiations after weeks of talks. Trump also put an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports.\n\nIn response, Canada said it would impose retaliatory tariffs. Mexico said it will be looking to announce a plan on Sunday. China retaliated with tariffs of up to 15% on some US goods. These developments have added to the uncertainty surrounding the tech sector.\n\nThe tech sector has experienced a decline due to economic uncertainty and trade tensions and this might present buying opportunities for some investors. Despite current challenges, some tech stocks show strong potential for growth.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 10 cheap tech stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz stock screener and Yahoo Finance. To find cheap tech stocks, we looked for stocks with a forward P/E ratio of less than 20. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 25 technology companies trading at under 20 times their forward earnings as of March 3, 2025. Next, we focused on the top 10 cheap tech stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database of more than 1,000 elite hedge funds. Finally, the 10 cheap tech stocks to buy were ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q4 2024.",

Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nGrowth investors, on the other hand, are more concerned with a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score examines things like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will experience sustainable growth over time.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum traders and investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.\n\nVGM Score\n\nIf you like to use all three kinds of investing, then the VGM Score is for you. It's a combination of all Style Scores, and is an important indicator to use with the Zacks Rank. The VGM Score rates each stock on their shared weighted styles, narrowing down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.\n\nInvestors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nWith more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nTo maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\n\nThe direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.\n\nFor instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: Applied Materials (AMAT)\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, Applied Materials is one of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of equipment for the fabrication of semiconductor, flat panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and solar photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules. The company also offers deployment and support services related to the equipment supplied.\n\nAMAT is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.\n\nAdditionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. AMAT has a Growth Style Score of A, forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 8.4% for the current fiscal year.\n\nFive analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.01 to $9.38 per share. AMAT also boasts an average earnings surprise of 5.6%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, AMAT should be on investors' short list.\n\nShould You Invest in Applied Materials, Inc.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nAbstract. Credit: ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2025). DOI: 10.1021/acsami.4c15381\n\nCement manufacturing and repair could be significantly improved by using biocement-producing bacteria, but growing the microbes at construction sites remains a challenge. Now, researchers report a freeze-drying approach in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces that preserves the bacteria, potentially allowing construction workers to ultimately use powder out of a packet to quickly make tiles, repair oil wells or strengthen the ground for makeshift roads or camps.\n\nSoil stabilization and concrete repair are major challenges facing civil engineers. Recently, researchers have shifted their attention to a tiny bacterium called Sporosarcina pasteurii that can produce a form of calcium mineral called biocement. The microbes break down urea and form ammonium and carbonate. Then, with the addition of calcium, the result is calcium carbonate, which glues sand and soil particles together or repairs cracks in existing concrete structures.\n\nTo make biocement for construction projects, the bacteria currently must be grown onsite with special equipment and technical know-how. So, Maneesh Gupta and colleagues wanted to develop a way to preserve S. pasteurii in a shelf-stable format that would be easy for construction workers to use.\n\nGupta's team was inspired by manufacturers who freeze-dry biological components and add them to fertilizers. The researchers suspended the bacteria in different solutions and tested how well the microbes survived freezing. They found that sucrose protected the microbes best compared to other types of protectants. After freezing, the bacteria were dried and then stored in resealable plastic bags. Sucrose-treated S. pasteurii remained viable for at least three months.\n\nField-based biocementation of soil using lyophilized cells as inoculum for ground improvement.

Credit: ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2025). DOI: 10.1021/acsami.4c15381\n\nFurther laboratory testing showed that the sucrose-preserved, freeze-dried bacteria could be used to cement sand in 3D-printed cylindrical molds. The researchers prepared separate columns with play sand, like that used in children's sandboxes, and natural sandy soil taken from the ground. Then, when the columns were sprayed several times with calcium chloride and urea, the bacteria produced biocement. The biocement in the columns made with play sand was stronger than the biocement formed with soil, and most of the biocement samples could be removed from the play sand molds.\n\nIn another lab test, the team prepared columns of freeze-dried bacteria with natural sandy soil inside PVC pipes but did not remove the biocement from the pipes. The PVC columns made of both play sand and natural soil were stronger with exposure to more calcium chloride and urea.\n\nIn field tests, freeze-dried bacteria were applied to the surface of 3-foot by 3-foot (about 1-meter by 1-meter) plots, and urea and calcium chloride were sprayed on top. The freeze-dried bacteria made the top 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of the ground stronger within 24 hours.\n\nAlthough more work is needed, the researchers say this is the first demonstration that freeze-dried S. pasteurii remains viable and can make biocement, and it could be feasible for future deployment in the field.\n\nMore information: Matthew J.

Credit: ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2025). DOI: 10.1021/acsami.4c17922\n\nA small team of materials engineers at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, working with Wuliangye, a manufacturer of baijiu, has developed a carbon-source anode using baijiu sediment for use in a sodium-ion battery. In their study published in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, the group treated the sediment to make it useful as an anode.\n\nBaijiu is an alcoholic beverage that is popular in China. It is made from wheat or rice and has a high alcohol content. The researchers noted that sediment left over from the distillation process, which is normally sold as a fertilizer or livestock feed base, has ingredients that could be used to make a carbon anode.\n\nOver the past several years, lithium-ion batteries have become the standard for use in handheld devices and for larger applications such as backing up solar power installations and even powering electric cars. Unfortunately, such batteries are costly and represent a fire risk, and scientists have been looking for a replacement.\n\nOne such possibility is the sodium-ion battery. To make it a viable alternative, scientists need to find a way to improve its charge density and thus its efficiency, and also to address micropore collapse of the carbon in the anode. In this new effort, the research team has addressed the latter issue.\n\nMaking a carbon-based anode suitable for use in a sodium-ion battery from baijiu sediment required significant treatment. They started by washing and drying it and then subjecting it to acid leaching and pre-carbonizing. Next, to get rid of the silica, they soaked it in sodium hydroxide at a high temperature and mixed it with ethyl orthosilicate. The final steps were blasting it with ultrasound and baking it in an oven. The result was a silicon-doped hard carbon. The research team calls it HC-1100Si-1.\n\nOnce their anode was complete, the team put it in a standard sodium-ion battery to see how well it worked. They found it had a reversible capacity of 281.5 mAh/g at 1\u00b0C and held onto 91.9% of its charge capacity after 100 cycles. This is not as good as batteries currently in use, the team acknowledges, but they believe it could be used in applications that involve frequent charging.\n\nMore information: Xinrui Wang et al, A Generic Si-Doped Strategy for Hard Carbon Derived from Wuliangye Distillers' Grains to Achieve High-Performance Sodium Ion Batteries, ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2025).

            "content": "Cement manufacturing and repair could be significantly improved by using biocement-producing bacteria, but growing the microbes at construction sites remains a challenge. Now, researchers report a freeze-drying approach in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces that preserves the bacteria, potentially allowing construction workers to ultimately use powder out of a packet to quickly make tiles, repair oil wells or strengthen the ground for makeshift roads or camps.\n\nSoil stabilization and concrete repair are major challenges facing civil engineers. Recently, researchers have shifted their attention to a tiny bacterium called Sporosarcina pasteurii that can produce a form of calcium mineral called biocement. The microbes break down urea and form ammonium and carbonate. Then, with the addition of calcium, the result is calcium carbonate, which glues sand and soil particles together or repairs cracks in existing concrete structures. To make biocement for construction projects, the bacteria currently must be grown onsite with special equipment and technical know-how. So, Maneesh Gupta and colleagues wanted to develop a way to preserve S. pasteurii in a shelf-stable format that would be easy for construction workers to use.\n\nGupta\u2019s team was inspired by manufacturers who freeze-dry biological components and add them to fertilizers. The researchers suspended the bacteria in different solutions and tested how well the microbes survived freezing. They found that sucrose protected the microbes best compared to other types of protectants. After freezing, the bacteria were dried and then stored in resealable plastic bags. Sucrose-treated S. pasteurii remained viable for at least three months.\n\nFurther laboratory testing showed that the sucrose-preserved, freeze-dried bacteria could be used to cement sand in 3D-printed cylindrical molds. The researchers prepared separate columns with play sand, like that used in children\u2019s sandboxes, and natural sandy soil taken from the ground. Then, when the columns were sprayed several times with calcium chloride and urea, the bacteria produced biocement. The biocement in the columns made with play sand was stronger than the biocement formed with soil, and most of the biocement samples could be removed from the play sand molds. In another lab test, the team prepared columns of freeze-dried bacteria with natural sandy soil inside PVC pipes but did not remove the biocement from the pipes. The PVC columns made of both play sand and natural soil were stronger with exposure to more calcium chloride and urea.\n\nIn field tests, freeze-dried bacteria were applied to the surface of 3-foot by 3-foot (about 1-meter by 1-meter) plots, and urea and calcium chloride were sprayed on top. The freeze-dried bacteria made the top 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of the ground stronger within 24 hours.\n\nAlthough more work is needed, the researchers say this is the first demonstration that freeze-dried S. pasteurii remains viable and can make biocement, and it could be feasible for future deployment in the field.\n\nThe authors acknowledge funding from the U.S. Air Force Laboratory Seedlings for Disruptive Capabilities Program.\n\n###\n\nThe American Chemical Society (ACS) is a nonprofit organization chartered by the U.S. Congress.

Now, researchers reporting in ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces have made artificial wings that are actually powered by the sun. The tiny wings, which can flap even faster than those of butterflies, could someday be used in sun-powered robots or devices for solar energy harvesting.\n\n\n\nLight-driven actuators are devices that convert light into mechanical work. However, they usually require light much brighter than the sun that cycles on and off or additional hardware to keep them going in natural sunlight. Ningyi Yuan, Jianning Ding, and colleagues wanted to develop artificial wings that convert natural sunlight into a flapping motion without the need for additional hardware. So they coated a thin polymer sheet, the FEP substrate shown here, with a nano-crystal and metallic layer.\n\n\n\nWhen the team fixed one end of the artificial wing to a support and shown simulated sunlight onto it, the temperature of the strip increased. The polymer layer on the bottom expanded more from the heat than the metal layer on the top, causing the wing to curl. Then, the curved part of the wing shaded itself, causing the temperature to drop and the strip to unfold. Continuous cycles of bending and unfolding produced a flapping motion.\n\n\n\nThe team demonstrated the flapping wings in several applications. For example, they fashioned a light-driven whirligig that rotated continuously without any wind. They also made a toy boat that sailed across water outside in natural sunlight and a device that converted simulated sunlight into an electric current. The team also demonstrated light-driven motors that fold, roll, travel over obstacles, and wriggle. The researchers say that the artificial wings could someday be used to help small robots move or fly without the need for batteries.\n\n\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]",

The pixel define layer (PDL) is also replaced with a black PDL.\n\nThe removal of the polarizer plate increases light transmittance and lowers power consumption. It also makes the panel thinner. Samsung Display applied OCF for the first time on the Galaxy Z Fold 3 in 2021, making the foldable phone thinner than before.\n\nAt an on-pixel ratio of 10%, application of OCF allowed it to reach the maximum luminance of 5,000nit, which is 1.5 times higher than the latest flagship smartphones, Samsung Display said. OCF will shine at desert-like outdoor environments thanks to its high brightness and low power, the company said.\n\nOther new panels that Samsung Display showed off at the industry show include an 18.1-inch flexible briefcase concept product.

After the seminar, there will be chances for participants to meet with the NAATBatt delegation.\n\nNAATBatt Vice President Fred Lee, in a statement, said the US, unlike Europe where the industry is facing difficulties, plans to continue to foster the battery industry as it sees it as a matter of hegemonic competition.

With a market cap of $128.4 billion, Applied Materials operates through Semiconductor Systems, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets segments.\n\nCompanies worth $10 billion or more are generally described as \"large-cap stocks,\" Applied Materials fits right into that category, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, reflecting its substantial size and influence in the semiconductor equipment & materials industry. AMAT is the leader in materials engineering solutions used to produce virtually every new chip and advanced display in the world.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nDespite its notable strengths, AMAT has slipped 38.2% from its all-time high of $255.89 touched on Jul. 10, 2024. AMAT stock has plunged 7.7% over the past three months underperforming the Nasdaq Composite\u2019s ($NASX) 1.1% dip during the same time frame.\n\nOver the longer term, AMAT\u2019s performance looks even grimmer. AMAT has plummeted nearly 20% over the past 52 weeks and 18.1% over the past six months, underperforming the NASX\u2019s 18.2% gains over the past year and 7.4% gains over the past six months.\n\nTo confirm the downturn, AMAT stock has remained below its 50-day moving average since mid-July 2024 and below its 200-day moving average since mid-October 2024 with slight fluctuations.\n\nDespite delivering better-than-expected results, Applied Materials\u2019 stock plunged 8.2% in the trading session after the release of its Q1 results on Feb. 13. The company reported a notable 6.8% year-over-year growth in net revenues to $7.2 billion, exceeding the Street\u2019s expectations by 18 basis points. Meanwhile, its adjusted EPS increased 11.7% year-over-year to $2.38, surpassing the consensus estimates by 4.4%. Furthermore, the company observed notable improvement in margins with its adjusted gross margin expanding 1% compared to the year-ago quarter to 48.9% and its adjusted operating margin expanding 1.1% to 30.6%.\n\nHowever, the company observed a massive drop in cash flows, its non-GAAP free cash flow for the quarter dropped by a staggering 74% year-over-year to $544 million. Moreover, in Q2, the company expects its adjusted gross margin to contract 50 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 48.4%, which unsettled investor confidence.\n\nApplied Materials has also underperformed its peer Lam Research Corporation\u2019s (LRCX) 16.8% decline over the past 52 weeks and a 4.7% dip over the past six months.\n\nNonetheless, analysts remain optimistic about the company\u2019s prospects. Among the 34 analysts covering the AMAT stock, the consensus rating is a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d Its mean price target of $209.91 indicates a notable 32.8% upside potential from current price levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

At the same time, many of the top tech stocks are still trading near their all-time highs -- so value-seeking investors might still shy away from the heated sector.\n\nBut value-seekers shouldn't give up, there are still plenty of promising tech stocks trading at discount valuations. These three stocks check those boxes: DigitalOcean (DOCN -0.47%), Applied Materials (AMAT 1.41%), and Lumen Technologies (LUMN 2.26%). Let's see why these three cheap tech stocks are potential buys right now.\n\n1. DigitalOcean\n\nDigitalOcean is a cloud infrastructure platform provider that rents out tiny \"droplets\" of its servers to small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) for lower fees than enterprise-oriented cloud giants like Amazon and Microsoft generally charge. It also added GPU-powered artificial intelligence (AI) processing capabilities to its servers through its acquisition of Paperspace in 2023.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2024, DigitalOcean grew its revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25%. It also turned profitable in 2023, and it more than quadrupled its net income and EPS in 2024. Those robust growth rates indicated its niche market was growing and that it could keep expanding in the shadow of its larger industry peers.\n\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect DigitalOcean's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 14% and 19%, respectively. Its business is maturing, but it still looks like a bargain at 22 times its forward adjusted earnings and 4 times next year's sales.\n\n2. Applied Materials\n\nApplied Materials is one of the world's top suppliers of semiconductor equipment. From fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2024 (which ended last October), its revenue and EPS increased at a CAGR of 13% and 25%, respectively, even as the semiconductor sector was rocked by the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, trade tensions, and other macroeconomic headwinds.\n\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Applied Materials' revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 6% and 8%, respectively. Its near-term growth could be throttled by the tighter export curbs on its equipment sales to China, but it expects its long-term growth to be driven by the market's robust demand for more powerful AI chips, new energy-efficient chips, and denser memory chips. It also plans to lock in its customers with more integrated solutions that merge multiple steps (such as material deposition, etching, and material modification) into single systems.\n\nApplied Materials is a cyclical stock, but it looks undervalued at 16 times forward earnings and 4 times next year's sales. It also pays a forward dividend yield of 1% and remains committed to plowing its free cash flow into big buybacks.\n\n3. Lumen Technologies\n\nLumen, the telecom company once known as CenturyLink, was in serious trouble when its stock sank below $1 last June. Its revenue was plunging, it was racking up steep losses, and it had eliminated its dividend in late 2022. Its strategy of doubling down on wireline connections instead of expanding into the wireless market had backfired as the ongoing decline of its business wireline division offset the stronger growth of its fiber business.\n\nFortunately, a series of AI infrastructure deals with Microsoft and other cloud giants pulled Lumen back from the brink last year. Those big clients all hired Lumen to upgrade their data centers with more fiber optic cables to handle the surging usage of cloud and AI applications, and the cumulative value of those multi-year deals hit $8.5 billion at the end of 2024.\n\nAnalysts still expect Lumen's annual revenue to decline through 2027 as it stays unprofitable, but its AI deals and the growth of its consumer-facing fiber business could stabilize its long-term growth. It isn't out of the woods yet, but its enterprise value of $20.4 billion is less than twice its projected revenue for 2025. That discount valuation might limit its downside potential and set it up for a decent recovery over the next few years.",

            "content": "\uc0ac\uc9c4 \ud655\ub300\n\nFrom wood to titanium to carbon, new materials have revolutionized golf clubs. But this is not the end. Golf equipment companies continue to find and apply advanced new materials used in aerospace and special machines to create new products that are lighter, stronger, and better.The new material plays a major role in increasing distance and accuracy by reducing the weight of golf clubs, improving rigidity, and optimizing the center of gravity. Thanks to this, golfers are excited. Even if you swing as usual, your swing speed becomes faster, and even with a slight miss shot, you can have a happy round where the ball flies straight away.Let's find out what new materials are in the golf club I use and what characteristics they have.Ping Golf Driver, a 'national driver', is gaining popularity by applying new materials to the driver face. It is 'T9S+ forging titanium', a high-strength titanium alloy. The T9S+ forged titanium face, which was also applied to the G440 driver series introduced this year, has excellent resistance and durability. First of all, T9S+ titanium is stronger than conventional titanium, so the face can be designed thinner. The thinner face provides higher repulsion in case of impact, resulting in improved ball speed and distance.In addition, it minimizes ball speed loss even in case of a miss shot by optimizing repulsive performance not only in the center of the face but also in the periphery. It maximizes the so-called \"trampoline effect\" to simultaneously improve distance and tolerance. Soft batting is a bonus because it has consistent density and strength through a forging process. This is why Ping Golf drivers, which apply smart new materials, are loved not only by amateurs but also by top golfers such as Lydia Ko (New Zealand) and Kim Arim.In recent years, the competition for finding new materials for lighter, more straight-forward drivers has been more intense than ever.Titleist changed the driver face material from the previous TSi series. ATI425, a high-strength titanium alloy used in the aviation and defense industries. The material is characterized by high durability and elasticity, resulting in improved ball speed.The GT series, which was introduced late last year, found and applied new materials used in the aerospace industry. Titleist has independently developed and applied 'proprietary matrix polymer', an ultra-lightweight new material used in the aerospace industry. The material, which withstands extreme environments, is three times lighter than titanium and stronger in strength than regular carbon. Thanks to this, the driver head structure can be completely renewed to increase distance and accuracy. Titleist completely changed the existing head structure thanks to the new material, PMP material was made to surround the head, reducing weight, and making the center of gravity lower and deeper to improve tolerance and distance.When it comes to 'carbon', we can't leave out TaylorMade. The Qi35 driver introduced this year uses carbon that has evolved to a higher level. Chromium carbon is a lightweight material used in the aerospace industry. This material is lighter and stronger than conventional carbon fibers.The Elite driver that Callaway ambitiously introduced this year is also made of Thermoposed Carbon, an \"evolutionary next-generation carbon.\" Thanks to the new material, which is lighter and stronger than conventional carbon fibers, elite drivers maximize moment of inertia (MOI), providing excellent distance and tolerance. In addition, thermopod carbon was lighter than conventional materials, so it played a key role in reducing spin volume and optimizing the center of gravity and launch angle of the club.Drivers are not the only ones focusing on finding new materials that are lighter, stronger, and more durable. Distance and tolerance are desperate points in all clubs, including Iron and Wedge.Mizuno Golf, nicknamed Iron Master, is most active in introducing new high-tech materials to solve the best taste and distance concerns at the same time.First, S25CB (1025 boron) material was applied to JPX S30 Poseid and T24 wedges. It is a new material mixed with 0.0003% boron (boron) in S25C wrought iron forging, and the strength is 30% harder, so the face can be made thinner. Thanks to this, the suite area without distance loss has been widened, improving tolerance. In addition, Mizuno Pro 243 and JPX925 Pose are applied with materials called \"Chromoli 4120, 4135.\" It is mainly applied to pipes or frames that require rigidity such as cars, airplanes, and bicycles because of its tensile strength of 1.8 times better and corrosion resistance compared to premium wrought iron. In addition, Chromoly 4120, 4135 is a special material used to make high-pressure gas containers and gun heat.This is not the only one. CrMo4335+, which is 35% stronger than regular chromoly, is a material used in areas that require extreme durability, such as airplanes, military landing gears, and transmission gears. It is a high-strength alloy with chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), and nickel (Ni) added to iron, and Mizuno applied nickel chromoly to create a thin face that maximizes repulsive performance, improving ball speed and durability. The nickel chromoly-applied product line is named 'hot metal'.Recently, wedges have also evolved by applying new materials. It is a Cleveland RTZ wedge that has created a soft batting texture and at the same time durability. RTZ Wedge has adopted a new alloy material, Z-ALLOY. It is a new material that has increased its carbon content by 10% compared to the existing model. The weight can also be lightened by 6g, optimizing the center of gravity to create optimal spin.[Reporter Cho Hyosung]",

            "content": "There's a lot of growth left in artificial intelligence, and these three stocks still offer great value.\n\nOne trend has dominated the market for over two years now: artificial intelligence (AI). Companies have collectively added trillions of dollars to their market caps thanks to the massive spending on AI and the investor excitement around its potential. Despite the massive run the market is currently on, there could be a lot more AI spending yet to come.\n\nResearch firm IDC expects businesses to spend $307 billion on AI solutions this year, and that number is projected to more than double to $632 billion by 2028. Of course, not every company will be a winner from all that spending on AI. And even if a company has great prospects, its stock must still present attractive value, which is increasingly difficult among the run-up in stocks.\n\nBut investors with just $200 can still find great opportunities among AI stocks in today's market. Here are three no-brainer buys right now.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (GOOG 1.82%) (GOOGL 1.87%) is the parent company of Google, and it plans to spend a massive amount on building AI infrastructure in 2025. Management expects to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures this year, primarily for servers.\n\nThat speaks to the opportunity management sees in AI, and it's already showing strong signs of capitalizing on that opportunity. The company started incorporating AI-generated responses to search queries in 2023. By the end of 2024, those AI Overviews were available in 100 countries and drive higher satisfaction and engagement than traditional search results. Importantly, Google isn't cannibalizing its advertising business. \"We actually see monetization at approximately the same rate,\" SVP of Google Philipp Schindler said on Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nAI is also behind advances in products like Google Lens and the Circle to Search feature on Android devices. Generative AI has the potential to improve Google's advertising business, making it easier for marketers to develop new creatives and test ad campaigns.\n\nGoogle Cloud has been a big beneficiary of the increased AI spending from other businesses. Its revenue grew 30% last year while its operating margin expanded to 14%. It could see significant growth in the years to come as management noted it remains capacity-constrained and its competitors sport higher operating margins.\n\nWhile Alphabet is spending heavily on AI, it's seeing strong returns on its investment. Earnings per share grew 39% last year and analysts expect 12% further growth this year. Still, shares trade for just $170 as of this writing, less than 19 times analysts' 2025 consensus earnings expectation. That's an incredible bargain for investors and well-deserving of your $200.\n\n2. Applied Materials\n\nProducing high-end AI chips requires a lot of specialized equipment, and one of the largest equipment manufacturers in the world is Applied Materials (AMAT 1.41%). Unlike most other semiconductor equipment manufacturers, Applied has a broad portfolio of equipment that can serve a range of customers.\n\nAs chip production expands and becomes increasingly complex, the demand for Applied's products will continue to grow. And there are a couple of factors that ensure Applied will win the majority of new contracts with foundries.\n\nFirst, it benefits from a virtuous cycle, whereby foundries spend more money with Applied than any other equipment maker, giving the company more to invest in R&D. It spent $3.2 billion on research and development to create more advanced equipment in 2024 capable of high-end chip production and lowering error rates in that production. That budget absolutely dwarfs its competitors, ensuring it can continue to offer better equipment than anyone else in the market for years to come.\n\nSecond, foundries can't afford the downtime required to switch equipment providers. On top of that, there's risk that other equipment won't be able to keep up with advances in technology, which is an unnecessary risk for any manager to take. In other words, the switching costs to move away from Applied's equipment are very high.\n\nApplied also operates a high-margin service business to ensure its equipment operates as expected. That business is expected to grow quickly as the complexity of chip manufacturing increases and foundries ramp up production of their next-generation chips.\n\nWith the stock trading for just $158 as of this writing, it looks like a great bargain for anyone looking to get started investing in AI stocks with just $200. That stock price translates into a forward PE of about 17 and an enterprise-value-to-sales multiple of less than 5. Whichever way you look at it, it's a great value for a company with the competitive position of Applied Materials.\n\n3. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD 4.17%) is often seen as playing second fiddle to Nvidia (NVDA 6.43%) when it comes to making all-important GPUs for AI servers. Indeed, AMD disappointed investors when it forecasted a 7% sequential decline in revenue for 2025's Q1, and affirmed its data center business would experience a similar decline. By comparison, Nvidia forecasts a 9% sequential increase in revenue in its comparable quarter.\n\nStill, investors may be discounting the value of AMD's GPU business alongside its progress in taking market share in the x86 CPU market for both servers and consumer PCs. While Nvidia has a significant advantage over AMD with its CUDA software and advanced hardware, AMD provides an important resource for hyperscalers as a secondary source of compute power.\n\nManagement expects the total addressable market for AI accelerator chips will be more than $500 billion in 2028. Even a small share of that market would be huge for AMD, which generated $12.6 billion in revenue from its data center segment last year.\n\nImportantly, AMD has a lot of upside to its margins right now. It increased its gross margin from 45% to 53% in 2024. And while it might not have the pricing power of Nvidia, it should benefit from scaling its operations. That should lead to meaningful operating margin expansion over the next few years toward management's long-term target in the mid-30s from 24% last year.\n\nAt a price of about $100 per share, investors with $200 could pick up two shares of AMD, and it's certainly worth the price. Shares currently trade for just 21 times analysts' estimate for this year's earnings. On top of that analysts expect earnings to grow another 34% in 2026. With the potential growth ahead for the company, it deserves a higher multiple, and it could end up being a great investment for anyone just getting started with AI stocks.",

(NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against other tech stocks with high upside potential.\n\nAs per Forrester Research, Inc., despite persistent inflation, the US real GDP is expected to increase 2.7% in 2025 and the US tech spending is projected to see growth of 6.1% to touch a staggering $2.7 trillion. The software spending in the US is expected to increase by 10.7% in 2025. With the escalation in cybersecurity risks, companies continue to leverage cloud and GenAI technologies to fuel future growth and innovation.\n\nAI to Drive Growth in Tech Sector in 2025\n\nThe largest US stocks, also referred to as the Magnificent 7, have seen a strong run over the previous 2 years, mainly due to the buildout of AI infrastructure, says Goldman Sachs. Sung Cho, co-head of US Fundamental Equity in Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Cho believes this buildout can significantly benefit data and security companies, and software companies successfully integrating AI in their existing product set. As the Fed continues to cut rates, the smaller tech companies \u2013 which saw contraction in their multiples because of higher rates \u2013 might see a favourable macro backdrop.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nRobust AI Investments are On the Horizon\n\nUBS has highlighted how AI has and will continue to drive the growth of the broader technology sector. As per the firm, since the rollout of ChatGPT in November 2022, the total market capitalization of companies listed on the US technology exchange NASDAQ increased to ~US$13.5 trillion. Notably, around two-thirds of this value increase has been directly caused by the AI sector. Moving forward, the decisive factor is expected to be the extent to which significant investments in AI-based infrastructure can be translated into profitable business models.\n\nWhile highlighting the consensus estimates, UBS stated that the 4 major US technology corporations are projected to invest ~US$280 billion in AI this year. Given the increased usage of this key technology across industries, value creation processes are expected to be optimized. This can lead to significant productivity gains. One such area is the market for robotics and automation, which is expected to reach a sales volume of ~US$350 billion in 2025, says UBS analysts. Notably, humanoid robotics will be the key area of particular interest because of the innovations.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 10 Tech Stocks with High Upside Potential, we used a screener and shortlisted the stocks catering to the broader technology sector. Next, we filtered out the stocks having an average upside potential of at least ~30%, as of February 28. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: ~29.6%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 80\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is engaged in the provision of manufacturing equipment, services, and software to the semiconductor, display, and related industries. Morningstar expects 8% compound annual sales growth for the company through fiscal 2029. However, it expects robust growth for Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in fiscal 2025 and 2026, driven mainly because of strong capacity expansions at chipmakers to supply AI demand.\n\nFurthermore, the firm expects mid-cycle growth in the mid-to-high single digits. As per Morningstar, this growth is expected to be aided by more advanced chip designs at chipmakers relying on Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)\u2019s equipment to manufacture gate-all-around transistors, chiplet designs, and high-bandwidth memory. The company is expected to earn returns on invested capital well above its cost of capital for the upcoming 20 years. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) will benefit from drivers of chip complexity, such as gate-all-around transistors and advanced packaging.\n\nAs per Morningstar, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)\u2019s proficiency in wafer fabrication equipment stems from top-notch design expertise, while its embedded services business and long-term customer roadmaps remain sticky. Vltava Fund, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cIn the quarter just ended, we added to the portfolio two new companies from the technology sector: Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Lam Research. Both are in the same industry as is another of our investments that we have held for some time, KLA Corporation. This industry is termed semiconductor devices and materials. One chapter in Hidden Investment Treasures is devoted to investing in technology companies and, among other things, the controversy over what really constitutes a technology company. As investors, we try to view technology companies not according to the industry into which they are formally classified but by whether the technologies and technological processes used in the production of their products and services are an essential element in value creation or if they are a source of long-term, sustainable competitive advantage. Among the companies that are formally categorized as technology-based and fall into either the Information Technology or the Communications Services sector, we find some that can be said to be just that but also others for which this classification is at least debatable. Similarly, among companies that do not formally belong to these two sectors, we find many that clearly are built to a large extent on technology and base their market positions and competitiveness on it. In the cases of Applied Materials and Lam Research, there can be no doubt that these are technology companies not only as a formality but also in fact. Applied Materials provides manufacturing equipment, services, and software for the semiconductor, display, and related industries. Its principal business activities are semiconductor systems and Applied Global Services. Its largest customers are Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors, but its overall clientele is more diversified than is that of Lam Research. At first glance, it would appear that Applied Materials has a somewhat less tangible and definable competitive advantage compared to KLA Corporation and Lam Research, but the numbers do not support such a view. Net margins likewise in the neighborhood of 27% and ROCE around 30% are outstanding. Basically, it can be said that all three companies we own have very similar underlying profitability metrics. Even their valuations, growth, and potential are similar. All have strong free cash flow and strong balance sheets, and they are regularly buying back their own shares over the long term and in large volumes\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, AMAT ranks 9th on our list of tech stocks with high upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of AMAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than AMAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "\u201cI really think we are onto something at Brioni. This is a luxury that is not empty.\u201d Norbert Stumpfl\u2019s first look book image in this expanded Brioni women\u2019s collection finely illustrated the something that Brioni is onto: a gorgeously cut tuxedo beneath which was layered a top made by subtracting the shoulders and sleeves from a tailored jacket.\n\nAfforded by Brioni owner Kering Group the time to take a considered approach, which has included consulting with Gigliola Savini Perrone, daughter of the house cofounder, Gaetano Savini, Stumpfl\u2019s vision for womenswear has developed from cautious caterpillar to increasingly confident chrysalis. Its identity is shaped by Brioni\u2019s 80-year heritage of excellence in masculine tailoring: However, what\u2019s crucial to its potential is that while Brioni\u2019s masculine DNA defines its process, it does not dictate this product.\n\nThus Brioni\u2019s highly evolved menswear catalog of canonical cuts, materials, and methods were taken as raw materials before being applied to shaping garments for women. A safari suit was transformed by lengthening the shirt into a dress and transforming the shorts into pants. Pencil skirts in pale fil coupe of cashmere were given movement-affording range by applying the same single vent normally cut into the back of a men\u2019s jacket into the front of the garment. A version of that opening tuxedo top was flipped into an evening dress by switching it from black to white, cutting it full length, and hand-applying black floral embellishments.\n\nThere were plenty of tailored jackets cut with the hand-hewn precision and ease that you would absolutely expect here. However, both their architecture and length were recast by application to a block crafted for the shape of their destined wearers. Furthermore, the jackets were sometimes accessorized with a belt\u2014something near sacrilegious in the masculine sphere of tailoring\u2014and layered over garments deracinated from shirts to blouses by the raglan-style shoulder shapes and the dis-imposition of collars.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t care about being known for wearing any particular brand,\u201d said Stumpfl when asked to profile the female client for whom he and his teams are manifesting these clothes. \u201cShe just wants her clothes to work beautifully in order to let her work.\u201d In this, at least, Brioni\u2019s womenswear and menswear are in harmony. Stumpfl\u2019s opening definition of the house\u2019s luxury as \u201cnot empty\u201d seemed on the money. This cosmopolitan-not-cosplay approach to apex dressing seems full of potential.",

Jamie Davis Smith\n\nI accidentally booked a stay at a resort in India that had very limited WiFi access.\n\nI panicked at first, especially since I planned on doing some work at night.\n\nSurprisingly, I adjusted quickly, and I'm thinking about ways to unplug on future trips.\n\nSome people disconnect when they travel, but that's never been my style.\n\nAs a freelancer, I usually have to work while I'm on the move, and I also like having a way to stay in touch with family and friends back home.\n\nI knew we'd be traveling to remote locations when my family did a tour of India with Intrepid Travel.\n\nBut when we arrived at the Desert Resort in Mandawa, I realized I'd failed to notice the fine print that WiFi would be extremely limited at this stop.\n\nSurprisingly, I adjusted much more quickly than I expected\n\nInitially, I panicked a little about the lack of internet connection. Jamie Davis Smith\n\nMy first instinct was to panic when I learned that the resort intentionally doesn't provide WiFi in any of its guest rooms.\n\nEven though we were there for only a couple of days, I was convinced my stay would be stressful and difficult without 24/7 access to the internet.\n\nShortly after arriving, I learned there were a few small areas with WiFi on the property and quickly scoped one of them out to answer a few emails that couldn't wait.\n\nThen, instead of hunkering down to do more work like I might have otherwise, I put my computer back in my room and explored the resort.\n\nTo my surprise, my stress about the WiFi melted away quickly.\n\nWhile my kids swam, I walked around the resort and marveled at its lovely buildings made out of mud and hand-painted by local artisans. I checked out the resort's collection of vintage cars, and before dinner, my kids joined me to get henna tattoos from a local artist.\n\nAlmost everyone else from our tour group was also out of their rooms \u2014 something that hadn't happened at any of our other stops.\n\nIt took being forced to unplug for me to really unwind and be present\n\nI saw a peacock while I was exploring the resort and watching the sunrise. Jamie Davis Smith\n\nAt first, I wasn't prepared to give up my evening routine of responding to emails and catching up on work.\n\nIt may not be the most relaxing way to end the night on vacation, but I find that it's usually worth the trade-off so I don't fall too far behind when I get home.\n\nI wouldn't be able to travel as much as I do if I couldn't work, at least a little, almost every day.\n\nAfter dinner, instead of settling into my laptop, I grabbed a book and started reading under the stars. The kids played soccer and took turns on the resort's swings instead of heading off to scroll on their devices.\n\nAfter a relaxing and restful evening where I was truly unplugged, I slept better than I had in a while. The next morning, without the pull of my computer calling to me, I woke up early to enjoy the sunrise.\n\nI went on a short hike before waking my kids up for breakfast \u2014 it was the perfect way to start the day.\n\nUnplugging ended up being such a gift\n\nI can't wait to try other unplugged vacations in the future. Jamie Davis Smith\n\nThough I was at the Desert Resort for only two days, it was enough to remind me that I don't need to be tethered to a phone or computer all the time.\n\nI left vowing to be more intentional about when and how I use WiFi, especially while traveling. While I haven't been perfect, I have a new understanding of the hold my devices really have over me and what I'm missing out on as a result.\n\nBecause of my career, I can't necessarily make staying in places with limited WiFi a habit, but I'm already eyeing another short stay at an unplugged resort this summer.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

That\u2019s according to a new report on the industry from Research and Markets, which says the market will be worth $155.09 billion by 2029, but more immediate headwinds remain.\n\nKey Moment for Semis\n\nWhile the report highlights the growth potential of the sector, it comes as the industry is facing challenges from weakening demand for electric vehicles in some markets as well as pressure from tariffs and export restrictions.\n\nNotably this week, President Donald Trump was reportedly looking to tighten up chip export controls on China introduced by the previous Biden administration, in order to limit the country\u2019s artificial intelligence capabilities, Bloomberg reported. Dutch and Japanese officials met U.S. counterparts to discuss ASML\u2019s and Tokyo Electron\u2019s chipmaking operations, with Bloomberg saying the talks looked at restricting their engineers from maintaining semiconductor equipment in China.\n\nThe White House appears to want allies to impose same sort of restrictions on China as the U.S. has already placed on American chip equipment companies, including Lam Research, KLA, and Applied Materials.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has said he will impose 25% tariffs on semiconductor imports to the U.S., which could seriously hamper growth in the chip equipment market.\n\nEVs Play Key Part\n\nAccording to the market research report, expansion will be primarily fueled by the \u201cbroadening of semiconductor fabrication facilities, a noticeable surge in the auto semiconductor sector, and a growing demand for more sophisticated and efficient chips,\u201d the report says. Breakthroughs in advanced packaging technologies and a rise in government support for the semiconductor industry at a national level are seen helping to aid growth.\n\nIs AMAT a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nOverall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy rating on AMAT stock, based on 16 Buys, six Holds and one Sell. The average AMAT price target of $206.31 implies about 30% upside potential.\n\nSee more AMAT analyst ratings\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

            "content": "Internal combustion engines have long received flack for how wasteful they are. And while you can't argue about how inefficient they may be, the truth is that internal combustion has led the way for modern transportation since time immemorial.\n\nDid you know that combustion engines squander up to 75% of their energy, which is either released as engine heat or released through an exhaust pipe? But what if ICE could become more efficient and greener? Would that cast a dent in EV sales?\n\nResearchers from Pennsylvania State University claim to have discovered a technique for converting exhaust heat into energy using a small device that can be mounted on an automobile's tailpipe, according to a report published in the scientific journal ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces. It is called a thermoelectric generator (TEG).\n\nAlthough thermoelectric (also known as heat-recovery) devices that use temperature gradients to turn heat into energy already exist, the technology is very complicated and hefty. What's more, these devices often need cooling water to maintain the necessary temperature differential.\n\nThis is exactly where the new thermoelectric generator system comes in \u2013 and it\u2019s rather ingenious. But I must warn you: it might get a little nerdy, so bear with me.\n\nA diagram of the exhaust-mounted TEG Adapted from ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 2025, DOI: 10.1021/acsami.4c18023\n\nThermoelectric generators (TEGs) work on the principle of absorbing heat and transforming it into electrical power. When positioned close to a heat source, like a tailpipe, electrons bounce from the hot side to a cold side, generating an electrical current. Bismuth-telluride, a semiconductor material that effectively promotes this electron flow, has been used in TEGs by the researchers.\n\nMaintaining a temperature differential between the device's two sides without compromising efficiency is the difficult part of this equation. In order to address this issue, the researchers developed a heatsink device with fin-like protrusions that are wrapped around the tailpipe, dissipating heat through forced convection. Think of a big fan hooked to the CPU in a gaming computer \u2013 it's the same concept.\n\nThe prototype produces a maximum output of 40 Watts, which is enough for low-power applications such as charging your phone. The team was able to generate 56 W of electricity when they ran simulations with a car going at a high speed.\n\nThen came the helicopter. When connected to a helicopter's exhaust vents, the system produced 146 W of power. I must admit, it's a minuscule amount of energy in the grand scheme of things, but considering this energy is being recovered and used instead of simply being let go, it's a sizable feat.\n\nHere's what's brilliant about the system: It could easily be installed in the tailpipes and other exhaust vents of existing cars without the need for extra cooling systems, guaranteeing increased efficiency and cleaner energy sources. Although this technology was created especially for cars, it's clear that it has the potential to be used in other kinds of transportation.\n\nTwo-wheelers could especially could benefit from this tech, since their exposed exhausts enable more effective heat dissipation KTM\n\nOff-road ATVs and two-wheelers could benefit even more, since their exposed exhausts enable more effective heat dissipation without increasing system complexity or weight. Additionally, this technology could potentially be best employed in hybrid vehicles, which would use the electricity produced to boost battery range.\n\nThis breakthrough indicates that ICE energy efficiency can still be improved, regardless of its many shortcomings. Sure, electric vehicles might seem like the way of the future, but any advancement that increases the efficiency of combustion engines today is worth the effort.\n\nSource: American Chemical Society",

This is the first time that trade sanctions have been officially invoked against domestic companies since the inauguration of the second Donald Trump administration.\n\nAccording to the \"final decision on bypass exports\" obtained by the Mail Business on the 28th, the U.S. Department of Commerce said on January 27, shortly after President Donald Trump took office, \"As a result of an investigation into the assembly and completion of Chinese AWC raw materials to the U.S., it determined that it bypassed anti-dumping and countervailing tariffs imposed on Chinese AWCs.\"\n\nOther companies, including Dongil Cable, can be exempted from tariffs if they submit separate proof that they did not use Chinese raw materials, but five companies, including Daewon Cable, Gaon Cable, LS Cable, Taehwa, and TMC, will not be able to be exempted from tariffs as they apply \"unfavorable available information (AFA)\" because the U.S. Department of Commerce judged that it was uncooperative to the investigation. LS Cable & System explained, \"We are not producing aluminum cables using Chinese raw materials.\"\n\nIn a situation where Korean manufacturing is highly dependent on China, U.S. protection trade risks are in full swing. Not a few domestic companies import raw materials and parts from China, assemble and process them in Korea, and then export them, making them a target of U.S. trade sanctions. Korean companies subcontracted by China are also subject to regulation as they can be used for China's bypass exports.\n\nThe Ministry of Industry explained that there is currently no impact on our companies. Currently, there are two places that export the product, one of which was exempted by submitting certification, and the other is a subsidiary with a 100% stake in a Chinese company.\n\nIn addition to the United States, several countries, including the United Kingdom, the European Union (EU), and Turkiye, are reportedly judging that Korean exports are actually \"made in China.\"\n\nAccording to the industry, seven out of eight trade sanctions, including anti-dumping and countervailing tariffs related to bypass exports, which are currently imposed on Korean exports, are related to bypass exports of Chinese products through Korean companies. These include aluminum wires and cables, aluminum foil, hinges, decorative chains, steel ropes and cables, and silicon metals.",

He\u2019s been vocal about the costs of the project, as well as the decision that was presented at the Feb. 10 regular council meeting to go with a three-phase loop system rather than a single-phase loop feed system, which he said would be more cost-efficient and solve a grounding problem that caused the Jan. 1 power outage.\n\nReplacing the electrical infrastructure in Valley Heights has been in the works for years, but the project became a priority after a power outage on Jan. 1 that left 20 homes without power for around 30 hours. Since then, the city council has been exploring options to replace it. Decisions have already been made to keep the underground electrical system as the original neighbourhood design included few external power lines and poles obstructing views of the valley, as well as protecting infrastructure from high winds that frequently blow from the mountains.\n\nCouncil ultimately supported the project and it was included in the draft 2025-2029 Financial Plan.\n\nReplacing the Valley Heights Electrical Infrastructure was also identified as a 2025-26 strategic goal.",

Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) is an epicenter of innovation, where finding practical solutions to real-world problems is at the heart of every degree program and research lab.\n\nAt SEAS, researchers led by Conor Walsh have made and commercialized wearable robots that can help stroke survivors regain mobility and independence. Materials scientist and 3D printing expert Jennifer Lewis and her team have pioneered programmable assembly of functional and living matter, enabling printed electronics, vascularized human tissues and more. Steven Wofsy\u2019s group developed spectroscopic imaging technology to power the world\u2019s most advanced methane-tracking satellite, now orbiting Earth. And Joanna Aizenberg\u2019s team has developed new materials inspired by nature, enhancing buildings with bio-inspired fluidic windows, and creating a building \u201cskin\u201d that can control indoor climate.\n\nFifteen years ago, Federico Capasso\u2019s lab was seeking to disrupt centuries of lens-making technology and reported their first key insights into metasurface optics, a field that reimagines the reading and manipulation of light. Their breakthrough invention, the metalens, is a perfectly flat, thin lens composed of subwavelength nanostructures that promises to replace or enhance conventional lens-based optics in cameras, sensors and mobile devices today.\n\nSEAS\u2019 culture of innovation existed long before its establishment in 2007 as a standalone Harvard school.\n\nAmong inventions associated with SEAS or its predecessors:\n\nKeeping time: George Washington Pierce, who received his Harvard Ph.D. in 1900 and later taught here, is credited with inventing the quartz-crystal Pierce oscillator, which is the timekeeping element of quartz wristwatches. The device was also used to improve radio technology, greatly stabilizing radio transmissions and solving the problem of frequency drift, and it made multiple phone calls over a single line possible.\n\nWireless comms: Ronold W.P. King joined the Harvard engineering faculty in 1938. He is the designer of the inverted F-antenna, which he originally intended for missile telemetry, but today is the most widely used antenna in wireless communications and mobile phones.\n\nMRI: Physicist Edward Mills Purcell, who got his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1938 and later taught here, shared the 1952 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance in liquids and solids. In experiments with Robert Pound, Nicolaas Bloembergen and others, he demonstrated how the spinning nuclei inside atoms could be manipulated with an external magnet and used to read out chemical information. This fundamental breakthrough is the basis of today\u2019s magnetic resonance imaging, which generates images from inside the body using radiation.\n\nVirtual reality: Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering Ivan Sutherland invented one of the earliest virtual reality headsets in 1968 with graduate student Bob Sproull. Sutherland is widely considered the father of computer graphics and went on to teach and mentor the likes of Edwin Catmull, co-founder of Pixar, and John Warnock, co-founder of Adobe Systems.\n\nReeldown: During the early 1980s, SEAS atmospheric chemistry professor James Anderson led a groundbreaking project called Reeldown, a high-altitude balloon experiment that measured minute concentrations of ozone-depleting, human-made chemicals in the Earth\u2019s stratosphere. His work led to the U.S. joining the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty banning chlorofluorocarbons.\n\nFor more on these and other inventions from SEAS, visit the school\u2019s history and innovation timeline.",

( ) has performed reasonably well recently. In light of this performance, CEO compensation will probably not be the main focus for shareholders as they go into the AGM on 6th of March. However, some shareholders may still want to keep CEO compensation within reason.\n\nComparing Applied Materials, Inc.'s CEO Compensation With The Industry\n\nOur data indicates that Applied Materials, Inc. has a market capitalization of US$134b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$28m for the year to October 2024. That's just a smallish increase of 3.5% on last year. While we always look at total compensation first, our analysis shows that the salary component is less, at US$1.0m.\n\nOn comparing similar companies in the with market capitalizations above US$8.0b, we found that the median total CEO compensation was US$21m. Hence, we can conclude that Gary Dickerson is remunerated higher than the industry median. What's more, Gary Dickerson holds US$185m worth of shares in the company in their own name, indicating that they have a lot of skin in the game.\n\nComponent 2024 2023 Proportion (2024) Salary US$1.0m US$1.0m 4% Other US$27m US$26m 96% Total Compensation US$28m US$27m 100%\n\nSpeaking on an industry level, nearly 12% of total compensation represents salary, while the remainder of 88% is other remuneration. Investors may find it interesting that Applied Materials paid a marginal salary to Gary Dickerson, over the past year, focusing on non-salary compensation instead. It's important to note that a slant towards non-salary compensation suggests that total pay is tied to the company's performance.\n\nApplied Materials, Inc.'s Growth\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 2.5% a year over the past three years. In the last year, its revenue is up 4.3%.\n\nWe're not particularly impressed by the revenue growth, but we're happy with the modest EPS growth. So there are some positives here, but not enough to earn high praise. Historical performance can sometimes be a good indicator on what's coming up next but if you want to peer into the company's future you might be interested in\n\nHas Applied Materials, Inc. Been A Good Investment?\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. has served shareholders reasonably well, with a total return of 30% over three years. But they would probably prefer not to see CEO compensation far in excess of the median.\n\nIn Summary...\n\nApplied Materials primarily uses non-salary benefits to reward its CEO. Given that the company's overall performance has been reasonable, the CEO remuneration policy might not be shareholders' central point of focus in the upcoming AGM. Still, not all shareholders might be in favor of a pay raise to the CEO, seeing that they are already being paid higher than the industry.\n\nCEO compensation is one thing, but it is also interesting to\n\nArguably, business quality is much more important than CEO compensation levels.

Listen to this article using the player above. \u2716\n\nRead time: 2 minutes\n\nGas sensing technologies play a vital role in our modern world, from ensuring our safety in homes and workplaces to monitoring environmental pollution and industrial processes. Traditional gas sensors, while effective, often face limitations in their sensitivity, response time, and power consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo account for these drawbacks, recent developments in gas sensors have focused on carbon nanomaterials, including the ever-popular graphene. This versatile and relatively inexpensive material can provide exceptional sensitivity at room temperature while consuming minimal power. Thus, graphene holds the potential to revolutionize gas detection systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgainst this backdrop, a research team led by Associate Professor Tomonori Ohba from the Graduate School of Science, Chiba University, Japan, explored a promising avenue to improve graphene\u2019s sensing properties even further. As reported in their latest paper, which was published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, the team investigated how and why graphene sheets treated by plasma with different gases can lead to enhanced sensitivity for ammonia (NH3), a toxic compound. The study was made available online on December 26, 2024, and was published on January 8, 2025, in Volume 17, Issue 1. This study was co-authored by Mr. Sogo Iwakami and Mr. Shunya Yakushiji, also from Chiba University.\n\nWant more breaking news?

This treatment \u201cfunctionalized\u201d graphene, meaning that it modified the surface of the graphene sheets by attaching specific chemical groups and creating controlled defects, serving as additional binding sites for gas molecules like NH3. After treatment, the researchers employed a variety of advanced spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations to shed light on the precise chemical and structural changes the graphene sheets underwent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team found that the gas used during plasma treatment led to the creation of different types of defects on the graphene sheets. \u201cThe O2 plasma treatment induced oxidation of the graphene, producing graphoxide, whereas the H2 plasma treatment induced hydrogenation, producing graphane,\u201d explains Assoc. Prof. Ohba, \u201cSpectroscopic analysis suggested that graphoxide had carbon vacancy-type defects, graphane had sp3-type defects, and Ar-treated graphene had both types of defects.\u201d To clarify, an sp3-type defect is a structural change where a carbon atom in graphene shifts from having three bonds in a flat plane to forming four bonds in a tetrahedral arrangement, often due to hydrogen atoms attaching to the surface.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, introducing these defects into the graphene sheets greatly enhanced their performance for sensing NH3. Since NH3 binds more easily to defects rather than to pristine graphene, the electrical conductivity of functionalized sheets changed more noticeably when exposed to NH3. This property can be leveraged in gas-sensing devices to detect and quantify the presence of NH3. Graphoxide, in particular, exhibited the greatest changes in sheet resistance (the inverse of conductivity) when exposed to NH3\u2014these changes were as high as 30%.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorth noting, the team tested whether functionalized graphene sheets could withstand repeated exposure to NH3 without degrading their gas-sensing performance. Although some irreversible changes in sheet resistance were observed, some significant changes were fully reversible and cyclable. \u201cThe results showed that functionalizing graphene structures with plasma generated noble materials with a superior NH3 gas-sensing performance compared with pristine graphene,\u201d concludes Assoc. Prof. Ohba.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, this study serves as an important stepping stone toward next-generation gas-sensing devices. Excited about their findings, Assoc. Prof. Ohba remarks: \u201cAs graphene is among the thinnest possible sheets with gas permeability, the functionalized graphene sheets developed in this work could be used in daily wearable devices. Thus, in the future, anyone would be able to detect harmful gases in their surroundings.\u201d Hopefully, further work in this field will make this vision a reality and push graphene-based technology forward.\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: Iwakami S, Yakushiji S, Ohba T.

In January 2025, the Weizmann Institute of Science, based in Rehovot, signed an agreement with Enlight to supply all of the Institute's electricity needs for the next 12 years.\n\nThe agreement with Enlight will help NTA, which is building the light rail and metro networks in the Tel Aviv metropolitan region, to reduce its electricity costs significantly. It will also reduce annual carbon emissions equivalent to the planting of approximately 380,000 new trees per year or removing about 9,000 private fuel-powered vehicles from the road annually.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nItamar Ben Meir, CEO of NTA, commented, \"We welcome this important agreement with Enlight. The mass transit system being built by NTA is good news for the congested Tel Aviv region, and is similar to advanced countries around the world in its use of renewable energy. Green power dramatically cuts air pollution as well as representing a significant cost savings. Each light rail train removes more than 100 private cars from the road, reducing traffic congestion and wasted time, while increasing comfort and safety.\u201d\n\nGilad Peled, CEO of Enlight MENA, commented, \"Enlight congratulates NTA on its transition to clean and environmentally friendly energy. The deal with Enlight will allow NTA to save millions of Shekels of public funds on its electricity bill, while simultaneously serving as an environmental leader. The agreement drives Enlight MENA's growth further after doubling our revenues in Israel last year to over $150m. This agreement further reinforces the fact that today, clean energy is also the cheapest form of energy. Moreover, clean energy's rising share of the deregulated power market leads to greater competition and lower electricity prices for all Israeli consumers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout NTA\n\nNTA is a government-owned company building metropolitan Tel Aviv's mass transit network as part of the largest infrastructure project ever initiated in Israel. The network comprises three light rail lines, including the Red Line, which already transports millions of passengers every month, and the Green and Purple Lines, which are expected to begin commercial operation in the coming years. The light rail network will be joined by three metro lines that will connect into the Tel Aviv region from Rehovot in the south and Kfar Saba in the north. With an annual expected ridership of 850 million passengers and 2 million trips per day, the project's total cost is estimated at approximately ILS 200bn.\n\nAbout Enlight Renewable Energy\n\nFounded in 2008, Enlight develops, finances, constructs, owns, and operates utility-scale renewable energy projects. Enlight operates across the three largest renewable segments today: solar, wind and energy storage. A global platform, Enlight operates in the United States, Israel and 10 European countries. Enlight has been traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange since 2010 (TASE: ENLT) and completed its U.S. IPO (Nasdaq: ENLT) in 2023.

According to Bloomberg, Trump plans stricter controls while urging key allies to impose similar limits on China\u2019s chip industry. However, the new U.S. regulations may take months to materialize, and allied cooperation remains uncertain.\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving strong buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nTrump Pushes to Restrict Tech Support to China\n\nBloomberg also reported that Trump officials recently held talks with their Japanese and Dutch government representatives to discuss new restrictions. These measures would limit engineers from Tokyo Electron Ltd. (TOELY) and ASML Holding NV (ASML) from servicing semiconductor equipment in China. This will make it harder for China to access technical support for their critical manufacturing tools.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. government wants its allies to put the same kind of restrictions on China that it has already put in place. These restrictions prevent certain U.S. semiconductor equipment firms like Lam Research (LRCX), KLA Corp. (KLAC), and Applied Materials (AMAT) from selling advanced chip-making equipment to China. This would prevent China from bypassing U.S. export controls by obtaining technology from allied countries.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump officials are reportedly pushing for tighter restrictions on chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) as part of broader efforts to curb China\u2019s chip industry. Sources say they aim to further limit the quantity and types of Nvidia chips allowed for export to China without a license.\n\nWhich is the Best Semiconductor Equipment Stock?\n\nUsing TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, we compared semiconductor equipment stocks to identify the one with the highest upside potential, according to Wall Street analysts.\n\nAnalysts see the most upside in ASML stock, with a $735.96 target, implying a 24.37% gain. AMSL stock also carries a Moderate Buy rating based on five Buy and two Hold recommendations. On the other hand, KLAC has the lowest expected upside at 13%, with a $737.57 price target.\n\nDisclosure",

This move is seen as an extension of efforts initiated under the Joe Biden administration to curb China\u2019s technological advancement.\n\nWhat Happened: Trump officials have been in talks with their Japanese and Dutch counterparts to limit the activities of engineers from Tokyo Electron Ltd. and ASML Holding NV ASML in China, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe aim is to get allies on board with the U.S. in imposing similar restrictions on China that have been placed on American semiconductor companies, including Lam Research Corp. LRCX, KLA Corp. KLAC, and Applied Materials Inc. AMAT.\n\nThe Trump administration is also exploring stricter controls on the global export of AI chips without a license. Washington\u2019s broader objective is to hinder China\u2019s advancement in building a domestic semiconductor industry that could enhance its AI and military capabilities.\n\nAccording to the publication, implementation of these new regulations may take several months as the Trump administration selects staff for key federal agencies.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to Benzinga\u2019s request for comment.\n\nSEE ALSO: Bitcoin Down 7%, Ethereum, XRP, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Plunge Over 10% As $1.48 Billion Liquidation Tsunami Hits\n\nWhy It Matters: In response to these reports, Lin Jian, from the Chinese foreign ministry, stated that such actions will obstruct the growth of the global semiconductor industry and also backfire, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, it also remains to be seen if Japan and the Netherlands echo the same thoughts as Trump.\n\nThis development comes on the heels of President Trump\u2019s recent announcement of his intention to impose a 25% tariff on auto imports, chips, and pharmaceuticals. These tariffs, expected to take effect as early as April 2, have already caused a stir in international trade. The latest move to tighten restrictions on China\u2019s tech sector is seen as a continuation of Trump\u2019s aggressive trade policies, and could potentially escalate trade tensions between the U.S. and China.\n\nAnother report by the South China Morning Post suggests that Tencent Holdings TCEHY, Alibaba BABA and ByteDance have significantly increased demand for Nvidia's NVDA H20 AI chip, driven by the surging popularity of DeepSeek's affordable AI models. This development also comes ahead of the tariffs and chip curbs likely to be imposed by the Trump administration.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.",

REUTERS\n\nSemiconductor giants have argued that stronger restrictions would hamper business and set them behind globally.\n\nBut Chinese firms have seemingly found ways to skirt around the US\u2019 current restrictions, boosting the argument for tougher rules.\n\nUS officials are currently investigating whether China-based DeepSeek \u2013 which shook the stock market and threatened American dominance in the artificial intelligence race \u2013 bought Nvidia chips through third parties in Singapore, Bloomberg earlier reported.\n\nIt could take months before the early-stage talks lead to any new regulations. It\u2019s also unclear how allies will respond to the Trump administration compared to Biden.\n\nThe Biden administration had secured a handshake agreement with Dutch officials to limit gear maintenance in China. Without regular maintenance, chip-making equipment can quickly lose the ability to produce semiconductors and turn obsolete.\n\n4 China\u2019s DeepSeek caused a massive sell-off as investors panicked over the rival\u2019s claims that it took less time and money to create its chatbot. REUTERS\n\nBut the Netherlands pulled back on the curbs after Trump won the election, two senior Biden officials said.\n\nBiden\u2019s team passed on several other priorities to the Trump administration, like a proposal to block Chinese memory chipmaker ChangXin Memory Technologies from buying American tech, according to the report.\n\nSome Trump officials also want tougher restrictions on Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., which is smartphone maker Huawei\u2019s main chipmaking partner. Huawei last year overtook Apple\u2019s share of the phone market in China.\n\n4 Trump officials are reportedly weighing several additional curbs on chip exports to China. REUTERS\n\nThe new administration is also tackling an AI diffusion rule imposed during Biden\u2019s final week in office.

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump\u2019s administration is sketching out tougher versions of US semiconductor curbs and pressuring key allies to escalate their restrictions on China\u2019s chip industry, an early indication the new US president plans to expand efforts that began under Joe Biden to limit Beijing\u2019s technological prowess.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump officials recently met with their Japanese and Dutch counterparts about restricting Tokyo Electron Ltd. and ASML Holding NV engineers from maintaining semiconductor gear in China, according to people familiar with the matter. The aim, which was also a priority for Biden, is to see key allies match China curbs the US has placed on American chip-gear companies, including Lam Research Corp., KLA Corp. and Applied Materials Inc.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe working group-level meeting between US, Japanese and Dutch officials took place last week on the sidelines of a summit in Japan, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nRelated: Applied Materials Falls as Export Controls Weigh on Outlook\n\nSubscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nThat comes in addition to early discussions in Washington about sanctions on specific Chinese companies, other people said. Some Trump officials also aim to further restrict the type of Nvidia Corp. chips that can be exported to China without a license, Bloomberg News has previously reported. They\u2019re also having early conversations about tightening existing curbs on the quantity of AI chips that can be exported globally without a license, said some of the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private.\n\nShares in Japanese chip firms fell after Bloomberg News\u2019s report, led by Tokyo Electron\u2019s 4.9% slide. Nvidia shares fell 1% on Tuesday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe broad goal in Washington is to prevent China from further developing a domestic semiconductor industry that could boost its AI and military capabilities \u2014 and Trump appears to be picking up where Biden left off. In some areas, that means pursuing agreements with allies that never came to fruition in the prior administration. In others, it means adopting the priorities of the more hawkish members of Biden\u2019s team, who were unable to build internal consensus on their more aggressive policy aims.\n\nA White House representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Dutch foreign trade ministry and Japanese ministry of economy, trade and industry declined to comment.\n\nDespite the US government\u2019s efforts, Chinese firms have achieved key technological breakthroughs, often using chips and equipment purchased ahead of a crackdown from Washington. There\u2019s also concern that restricted technology is still making its way to the Asian nation. The latest potential example: Bloomberg News reported last month that US officials were probing whether the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek bought advanced Nvidia chips through third parties in Singapore, circumventing export controls.\n\nIt could take months before the talks produce any new US regulations, as Trump makes staffing decisions at key federal agencies. It also remains to be seen whether allies will be more receptive to the new leadership in Washington. The prior administration had reached a handshake agreement with the Hague on limiting gear maintenance in China, but the Dutch demurred after Trump won the election, two senior Biden officials said. Without regular maintenance and servicing, chip-making equipment from ASML and others can quickly lose its ability to meet the rigorous demands of producing semiconductors.\n\nBiden\u2019s team also handed off several other priorities to officials on Trump\u2019s national security council, one of those officials said, and the new team was receptive. One key measure is blocking Chinese memory chipmaker ChangXin Memory Technologies Inc. from buying American technology, a step that Biden officials seriously considered but ultimately did not pursue due to opposition from Japan.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome officials on Trump\u2019s team also want to intensify restrictions on Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., the main chipmaking partner to Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co. Biden effectively blocked shipments to some SMIC facilities but established a case-by-case review for others, which the officials worry could allow SMIC to purchase tools that are ultimately used at restricted plants. SMIC\u2019s shares closed down 1.45% in Hong Kong.\n\nThe new administration is also eyeing curbs on sales of chips that Nvidia designed specifically for China, Bloomberg has reported. Some of Biden\u2019s NSC officials wanted to impose those tighter measures before leaving office, several people said, but then-Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo declined to pursue them.\n\nThen there\u2019s the so-called AI diffusion rule, imposed in the final week of Biden\u2019s term. The measure divided the world into three tiers of countries and set maximum thresholds for the AI computing power that can be shipped to each. It also established mechanisms for companies to validate the security of their projects and access higher compute limits.\n\nThe rule, which will have an impact on data center development everywhere from Southeast Asia to the Middle East, drew harsh rebuke from companies including Nvidia, where Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang expressed optimism that the Trump administration would opt for a lighter regulatory touch.\n\nThe White House is discussing how to streamline and strengthen that framework, according to several people familiar with the conversations, although what that entails is still in flux.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne idea favored by some in the administration would be to reduce the computing power that can be exported without a license. Under the current restrictions, chipmakers only have to notify the government before exporting the equivalent of as many as 1,700 graphic processing units to most countries. Some Trump officials want to reduce that threshold, people familiar with the matter said, which would expand the scope of the license requirement.\n\n(Updates with context on meeting in third paragraph and Nvidia shares in fourth paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) applications will likely be a key determinant of economic growth for the next decade and beyond. However, the burgeoning AI industry is anything but static. Just last month, China's DeepSeek R1 model was a watershed moment, which showed that a top-performing large language model could be built at very low cost.\n\nThe exact effect of DeepSeek on the industry is still not known today, but it does appear that AI is on its way to becoming cheaper, but also more pervasive. In that light, here are two companies that look to be in good position right now as the industry moves forward.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT 0.74%) has been a huge long-term winner, but has actually dramatically underperformed the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 1.22%) over the past year, up just 1.5% versus the Nasdaq's 23%-plus gain. Still, there's nothing fundamentally wrong with Microsoft. The past year's underperformance merely appears to be a consolidation period after a couple of years of strong gains. Likely, there will be another period of outperformance in the future, perhaps the near future.\n\nIt may seem odd to recommend Microsoft now. After all, in late 2022 and early 2023, Microsoft was perceived as an early leader in AI thanks to its investment in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.\n\nHowever, over the past year, Microsoft's cloud computing competitors appear to have caught up in the AI races, either through building their own competitive large language models or investing in other strong AI start-ups.\n\nFurthermore, OpenAI appears to be distancing itself from Microsoft. According to a recent report by The Information, OpenAI now plans to get three-quarters of its compute from Stargate by 2030, rather than Microsoft. Stargate is a massive data center project unveiled last month by OpenAI and SoftBank.\n\nBut this doesn't appear to be an indictment of Microsoft's technical capabilities. Rather, it's merely that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella isn't willing to spend tens of billions of dollars without a high probability of getting returns on those investments. Nadella has also previously noted Microsoft's massive AI investments have better corresponding demand signals than others'. This is because Microsoft's Azure cloud tends to serve large enterprises that will likely use AI at scale, rather than riskier start-ups.\n\nIn fact, in a recent interview, Nadella predicted that by 2027 to 2028, there will likely be an AI \"overbuild.\" But that doesn't particularly bother Nadella, as he says Microsoft will be able to then lease computing capacity at low rates. Nadella also said he doesn't give much credit to terms like \"artificial general intelligence,\" or other nontangible milestones, but rather views AI success in terms of tangible financial improvements, such as increased efficiency and faster economic growth.\n\nThis is all really encouraging to Microsoft investors. The last thing investors would want is for the company to spend huge amounts of money without a tangible payoff. Moreover, Nadella understands Microsoft's position as a cash-rich company with the ability to take advantage of other's mistakes.\n\nWhile Microsoft's stock hasn't really moved over the past year, it should still be a long-term AI winner and a safe tech stock to own through this transition.\n\n2. Applied Materials\n\nAnother longtime tech winner that has underperformed recently is Applied Materials (AMAT 1.41%). In fact, Applied's stock is down over 9% over the past year. This is despite Applied beating revenue and earnings expectations every quarter over that time period.\n\nSo, like Microsoft, Applied's recent stock performance merely seems like the business growing into its valuation after a couple of very strong years. But at just 22.5 times trailing earnings, this is a pretty solid value today for this long-term compounder.\n\nApplied is the largest, most diversified semiconductor equipment maker, with a big concentration in etch and deposition. Etch and deposition intensity is only going up for leading-edge chips, as innovations such as gate-all-around transistors and backside power delivery are just beginning to be implemented by leading-edge chipmakers. As AI logic chips incorporate these new innovations, Applied should outgrow the overall semiconductor industry, which itself should outgrow the overall economy.\n\nIn addition, Applied has a strong position in lagging-edge chip equipment as well. Those segments are currently going into a downturn after a strong past of couple years. Moreover, Applied noted that about $400 million of its China sales will go away in the year ahead, due to newer restrictions that just came out in December. The combination may have caused Applied to sell off after its recent earnings report.\n\nBut these headwinds are really a drop in the bucket; Applied has made over $27.6 billion in revenue over the past year. Management also guided to 6.8% year-over-year revenue growth in the current second fiscal quarter. That's not bad at all, considering the China headwind.\n\nMeanwhile, Applied's strong margins enable it to shower cash on shareholders via share repurchases and dividend increases. All in all, the recent pullback offers an excellent opportunity for long-term investors to add to their stakes.",

            "content": "For years, the U.S. chip sector complained that Washington\u2019s chip controls would hurt their business and spur the creation of a Chinese competitor\u2014yet these warnings rang hollow as revenue kept hitting records thanks to the AI boom.\n\nBut recent earnings reports from equipment manufacturers like Applied Materials and Lam Research show the U.S.\u2019s broadside against China\u2019s chip sector may be starting to bite.\n\nApplied Materials, the largest U.S. chip equipment manufacturer, issued a lukewarm revenue forecast last week, citing the risk of new export controls from Washington. Revenue from China, the company\u2019s largest market, dropped 25% in the most recent quarter to reach $2.2 billion, out of a total $7.2 billion.\n\nChina\u2019s contribution to Applied Materials\u2019 revenue has dropped from 45% a year ago to 31% today.\n\nAnd the company thinks it\u2019ll drop even further. \u201cFor Q2, we expect that China as a percentage of total revenue will be about five percentage points lower than in Q1,\u201d CFO Brice Hill told analysts last week.\n\nEquipment manufacturers, for now, are still reporting an increase in overall revenue, as the tech industry piles into the AI boom. But analysts warn these companies will sorely miss what China has: a lot of semiconductor manufacturing, and a consumer market eager to snap up the products that use those chips.\n\n\u201cChina is not just a semiconductor manufacturing hub,\u201d says Moonsup Shin, head of hardware, semiconductor, and data centers for Asia-Pacific at Bain & Company. \u201cAround or more than 50% of the semiconductors manufactured by Chinese manufacturers are consumed in China.\u201d\n\nAnd worse, there\u2019s no ready-made alternative waiting. Regions like Southeast Asia are investing in local manufacturing to position themselves as neutral territory in a chip war. Yet in practice, these up-and-comers lack both China\u2019s manufacturing and consumer demand.\n\nDownward slide\n\nApplied Materials isn\u2019t the only manufacturer of chipmaking equipment worried about China controls. Lam Research\u2019s China revenue over the last three months of 2024 dropped 10% year on year to reach $1.4 billion. China\u2019s revenue contribution also dropped, from 40% a year ago to 31% now.\n\n\u201cOur sales to customers in China, a significant region for us, have been impacted and are likely to be materially and adversely affected by export license requirements and other regulatory changes, or other governmental actions in the course of the trade relationship between the U.S. and China,\u201d Lam Research warned in its earnings report.\n\nThe dips and warnings come after the mainland Chinese market grew to form a significant part of these companies\u2019 revenues.\n\nChina revenue at KLA Tencor, another major American equipment maker, is largely holding up, which David Chuang, a senior research analyst at Isaiah Research, credits to the company\u2019s metrology tools. China doesn\u2019t yet have a domestic alternative for KLA Tencor\u2019s products, used in measurements and inspections, meaning Chinese foundries \u201cwill do anything to acquire metrology tools,\u201d Chuang says.\n\nWhy does China matter?\n\nWhile China\u2019s chip industry doesn\u2019t yet make the most cutting-edge semiconductors, it dominates in what the industry calls \u201cmature\u201d chips, older-generation components used in everything from electric vehicles to home appliances.\n\n\u201cChina remains a major region for manufacturing of legacy node logic and memory chips, adding to its role as the world\u2019s largest consumer of ICs [integrated circuits],\u201d wrote KLA Tencor in its earnings statement.\n\nThe flood of Chinese shoppers snapping up consumer electronics means a huge demand for chips, which in turn sustains China\u2019s chip sector. Overseas demand for devices from companies like Huawei, Xiaomi, and Transsion only adds to China\u2019s demand for chips.\n\nChip export controls\n\nSince 2019, the U.S. has aggressively policed chip sales to China, slapping sanctions on individual companies like Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC).\n\nThe U.S then introduced export controls in 2022 that not only restricted China\u2019s access to advanced chips, but also to the equipment needed to make those chips. The U.S. later tightened those restrictions, and pushed other countries like the Netherlands and Japan to impose their own rules.\n\nIronically, regulations helped equipment companies, at least initially. Chinese chip manufacturers rushed to stockpile machinery owing to fears that Washington might impose tougher export controls later.\n\nBut that rush of demand may start to ease, as Beijing pours more money into the chip sector in a drive for self-sufficiency. China is now encouraging firms to use domestic equipment where possible, shrinking the available market for foreign companies.\n\nThat, Chuang says, creates a \u201cdouble negative\u201d as American chipmakers are squeezed by both Washington\u2019s and Beijing\u2019s policies.\n\nChina doesn\u2019t yet have the ability to produce the cutting-edge machines made by U.S. and other non-Chinese firms. Yet Shin points out that Chinese companies have had some success in substituting noncritical equipment.\n\nAnalysts have also previously suggested that manufacturers have been able to use older equipment in innovative ways to create more advanced chips.\n\nThe U.S. and Japan, more developed markets, are both investing in new onshore chip plants in a bid to decouple their supply chains from China. Yet both Shin and Chuang think these markets won\u2019t grow to the same extent as China.\n\nShin suggests India could be a replacement for China, given its large consumer population and ambitions to be a tech powerhouse. But it\u2019ll take a long time for the country to catch up: India needs to build its ecosystem almost entirely from scratch.\n\nBut even then, there may not be a replacement for the Chinese chip sector. \u201cIt\u2019ll be hard to replace what the Chinese companies buy,\u201d Chuang says.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

            "content": "While internal combustion engines (ICE) are losing ground to electric vehicles, innovation in gasoline and diesel engine efficiency continues. A new thermoelectric generator (TEG) could help make these engines less wasteful by harnessing exhaust heat to produce electricity.\n\nCurrently, about 75% of the energy generated by a combustion engine is lost as heat, dissipating through the exhaust and engine block. Researchers recently published a study in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces about an innovative TEG that, when mounted on the exhaust, can recover some of this energy. The prototype demonstrated the ability to generate up to 56 watts of power at normal driving speeds and impressive 146 watts in high-speed applications, such as in helicopters.\n\nThe operation of this system is based on a bismuth telluride semiconductor, which converts temperature differences into electricity. Unlike other similar devices that require bulky water cooling systems, this TEG uses a finned heat sink that passively dissipates heat through airflow\u2014a particularly effective solution for motorcycles and off-road vehicles (ATVs and UTVs), where wind is always present.\n\nAlthough initially developed for automobiles, the potential of this technology for other types of vehicles is evident. Two-wheeled and off-road vehicles may benefit even more, as their exposed exhausts allow for more efficient heat dissipation without adding weight or complexity to the system. Furthermore, hybrids could also integrate this system, using the generated electricity to slightly charge the battery and increase range.\n\nWhile not representing a revolution for combustion engines, this development shows there is still room for improvement in ICE energy efficiency. The future may be electric, but as long as combustion engines exist, any innovation that makes them more efficient deserves attention. If this technology reaches production, it could offer a smart way to recover wasted energy, making vehicles slightly more sustainable and efficient.\n\nSource: Rideapart",

His boss sent him to De Anza College in Cupertino for formal training as a machinist, where he eventually became one of the school\u2019s lab technicians.\n\nDe Anza College, along with five other local schools, plans to uplift students similar to Espino with the Silicon Valley Advanced Manufacturing Program. The four-year program is funded by a $5.6 million U.S. Department of Labor grant and will train up to 725 students in sectors ranging from automation to semiconductors, when it launches in April. Its goal is to train Latino, Black and female students \u2014 often underrepresented in the manufacturing field \u2014 through supportive programs such as English as a second language courses. White employees make up about 69% of the manufacturing workforce nationwide, and about 71% are men, according to 2022 data.\n\nParticipating schools include De Anza, Foothill, Ohlone, Evergreen Valley and Mission colleges and San Jose State University. Students can take courses across colleges. Major Bay Area manufacturers are backing the initiative, including Applied Materials, Sanmina Corporation, Infinera Corporation, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, FM Industries, Association of Manufacturers Bay Area, NextFlex and Enablence. The companies could employ students after they\u2019re certified.\n\nEspino said as someone who speaks English as a second language, the program would\u2019ve helped him as a student. He said students of color often face barriers in education others don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cHaving the support of somebody who can be there so that you don\u2019t lose focus or patience (is essential) because it\u2019s hard (not speaking English),\u201d he told San Jos\u00e9 Spotlight.\n\nStudents are selected through workforce programs such as San Jose\u2019s work2future and high school dual enrollment programs. Dual enrollment allows students to take community college courses while attending high school. The program will cover some of the cost of books and materials.\n\nThe program\u2019s funding is part of the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Strengthening Community Colleges Training Grants Program, which awarded $65 million to 18 schools in December. That funding is somewhat uncertain under President Donald Trump\u2019s initiatives to freeze federal grants.\n\nBut Teresa Ong, Foothill College associate vice president of workforce and career technical education, is cautiously optimistic. She said the national attitude is to make more products in the U.S. rather than outsourcing to other countries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that folks see this area and this place that had long been like a stronghold in manufacturing, that they see it that way again,\u201d she told San Jos\u00e9 Spotlight.\n\nThe effort speaks to the need for manufacturing employees in the Bay Area.\n\nSan Jose recently ranked No. 1 for U.S. cities with the highest concentration of manufacturing jobs in its workforce. The city has roughly 77,000 manufacturing jobs accounting for 18% of the overall workforce, according to city data \u2014 and employees are paid an average of $79,300 a year.\n\nMatthew Kenny, program manager for Manufacture San Jose, said the manufacturing industry has low barriers to entry and provides job security, as it will never go away entirely.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really great pathway to a well-paying career for someone that may have had barriers to traditional four-year degrees or traditional white collar employment,\u201d Kenny told San Jos\u00e9 Spotlight.\n\nDespite that, industry professionals said a workforce shortage is leading to hundreds of vacancies.\n\nMike Appio, department chair of De Anza\u2019s design and manufacturing department, said those vacancies make it the perfect time for students to enter the field. His goal for the program is to get students trained and certified as fast as possible so they can land jobs. The time it takes to get certified varies.\n\n\u201cExpand your mind. Come visit. You have to experience it in real life to understand what this is,\u201d Appio told San Jos\u00e9 Spotlight. \u201cThere\u2019s great careers out there.\u201d\n\nEspino said interested students should check the program out, adding there\u2019s nothing like the magic of making something you can hold.\n\n\u201cWhen you ended up finally making a part (you need), you\u2019ve been working on so passionately, that is what\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d he said.\n\nContact Annalise Freimarck at annalise@sanjosespotlight.com or follow @annalise_ellen on X.\n\nThis story originally appeared in San Jos\u00e9 Spotlight.",

            "content": "Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) has underperformed the broader semiconductor sector over the past six months, dropping more than 18% compared to flat performance for the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index over the same period. The company's latest quarterly results aren't going to help change its fortunes, either.\n\nThe supplier of chip manufacturing equipment announced results for its fiscal 2025's first quarter (ended Jan. 26) on Feb. 13. Though its revenue and earnings outpaced Wall Street's expectations, the company's tepid guidance sent the stock down 8% the following day. Let's see why that was the case.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nExport controls are going to hurt, but growth is still solid\n\nThe restrictions announced by the previous U.S. administration in the past couple of months have hampered Applied Materials' Chinese business. In the words of CEO Gary Dickerson on the latest earnings conference call:\n\nThe ability of U.S. companies to serve the China market is constrained and has been further limited by updated trade rules announced in December and January. We estimate the incremental impact of these new rules will be around $400 million of revenue in fiscal 2025, approximately half of which is service revenue.\n\nThis explains why Applied Materials' revenue guidance of $7.1 billion for the current quarter is lower than the $7.22 billion consensus estimate. The good part is that Applied Materials' guidance suggests that its top line is on track to jump by almost 7% year over year in the current quarter despite the headwinds. That will be an improvement over the flat performance it delivered in the year-ago period.\n\nWhat's more, the midpoint of the earnings per share guidance of $2.30 points toward a double-digit jump from the year-ago period, when Applied Materials reported an increase of just 5% in its bottom line. The company's growth in the current quarter is almost in line with what it reported in the fiscal first quarter.\n\nInvestors, therefore, seem to be missing the bigger picture. Applied Materials is navigating the restrictions on providing sales and service support to China nicely and is clocking better results than it was last year. Moreover, Applied Materials' management sees \"China being a smaller portion of global wafer fab equipment spending in 2025.\"\n\nIndustry association SEMI is forecasting a 7% increase in semiconductor manufacturing equipment spending this year following last year's jump of 6.5%. The forecast for 2026 is even better, with an expected jump of nearly 15%. So, Applied Materials seems to have enough opportunity beyond China to grow its sales and earnings in the current fiscal year and beyond.\n\nThis is probably why Applied Materials expects its services business to clock low double-digit growth over the long run, even though its ability to serve the Chinese market is now limited. Meanwhile, the increased spending on wafer and fabrication equipment led to a 9% year-over-year increase in Applied Materials' semiconductor systems business to $5.4 billion.\n\nAs this business produces a major chunk of the company's overall revenue, it should remain a healthy growth driver going forward, thanks to the improved semiconductor spending environment discussed above.\n\nThe valuation makes the stock an attractive bet\n\nApplied Materials trades at just 21 times trailing earnings. That's well below the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index's earnings multiple of 34 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). The company has been delivering double-digit earnings growth of late, and the pickup in semiconductor spending could allow it to sustain such growth going forward.\n\nThis probably explains why analysts are forecasting slightly stronger growth in the company's bottom line following a 7% increase in the previous fiscal year to $8.65 per share.\n\nProspects for the end market that Applied Materials serves suggest that it may be able to eventually outperform consensus estimates in the future, and that could lead investors to reward the stock with more upside. All this makes Applied Materials an attractive semiconductor stock to buy right now following its latest dip, as the bigger picture suggests that it has the potential to do better in the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Applied Materials right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Applied Materials, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Applied Materials wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "For benchmarking the performance of JAX-CPFEM, we first tested three numerical examples using Kalidindi\u2019s phenomenological constitutive law65, which considers various crystal structures and boundary conditions. Each case was solved with various levels of mesh resolution using JAX-CPFEM with both CPU-only mode and GPU mode, and MOOSE with MPI for parallel programming. To showcase the inherent efficiency of JAX-CPFEM, leveraging advanced features of JAX, we compare computational performance of JAX-CPFEM on CPU (1 core) with MOOSE using MPI (8 cores). Then in section \u201cAD-based Sensitivity Analysis\u201d, to demonstrate the differentiable capabilities of JAX-CPFEM, we introduced and verified a sensitivity analysis concerning the grain orientation of each grain in the CPFEM simulation, realized through automatic differentiation (AD). Finally, in section \u201cInverse Design of Grain Orientations via AD-based Sensitivities\u201d, based on the verified AD sensitivities, we conducted the inverse design of grain orientations of each grain in a polycrystal featuring targeted mechanical properties using gradient-based optimization.\n\nCase Study 1: single crystal tantalum (BCC)\n\nWe simulated a classic single-crystal tantalum with BCC crystal structure under compressive loading, as shown in Fig. 1a. The domain dimensions are 0.1 mm \u00d7 0.1 mm \u00d7 0.1 mm, with a strain rate of 0.001 s\u22121 and quasi-static compressive strain from 0 to \u22121.25% applied in 50 steps along the x-axis on the right surface. All the other five faces are subject to corresponding constraints. The materials parameters used for Kalidindi\u2019s self and latent hardening law were sourced from recent literature about calibration40, including latent hardening coefficient, saturated slip system strength, hardening constants, and so on. These parameters are summarized in Supplementary Note 2. We first mapped the microstructure of Case 1 to the mesh (163), as mentioned in Fig. 1b, and computed the volume-averaged von Mises stress versus applied strain from both JAX-CPFEM (GPU mode) and MOOSE running with eight processes of MPI parallel programming. Both JAX-CPFEM and MOOSE employed the line search method68 to determine a suitable step size for Newton iteration, which is used for the CP constitutive relationship. In Fig. 1b, the points and the solid line represent the results obtained from JAX-CPFEM and MOOSE, respectively. The results matched exactly with each other, validating the accuracy of our software in a single crystal.\n\nFig. 1: Comparison of the CPFEM results between JAX-CPFEM and MOOSE for Case study 1: single crystal tantalum (BCC). In (a), we show the boundary condition: the compressive experiment compresses the right surface with a prescribed displacement condition and applies constraints on the other five faces. b A comparison of simulation results of the same problem between JAX-CPFEM (points) and MOOSE (line). Full size image\n\nFor performance benchmarking, this case was solved at various levels of mesh resolution (23, 53, 103, 163, 203, and 253 mesh) using different software. Wall time measurements relative to the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) are shown in Fig. 2. JAX-CPFEM running on GPU demonstrated a significant advantage for moderate to larger-size problems. For instance, for a problem with 52,728 DOF (253 mesh), JAX-CPFEM on CPU and GPU took 1908 s and 629 s, respectively, while MOOSE on CPU with MPI (8 cores) took 2812 s. JAX-CPFEM achieved 1.5\u00d7 (CPU mode) and 4.5\u00d7 (GPU mode) acceleration compared to MOOSE with MPI. The computing platforms used for those numerical experiments are summarized in Supplementary Note 3.\n\nFig. 2: Performance test for Case study 1 with different levels of mesh resolution (23, 53, 103, 163, 203, and 253): single crystal tantalum (BCC) under compressive loading boundary condition. Here, \u201cMOOSE CPU MPI 8\u201d means MOOSE runs with eight processes of MPI parallel programming. Full size image\n\nNotably, even without MPI acceleration, JAX-CPFEM on CPU (1 core) outperformed MOOSE with MPI (8 cores) when the problem scales up to 17,783 DOF (203 mesh). The superior performance is due to the XLA compiler infrastructure backend of JAX, which generates optimized code, and the domain-specific tracing just-in-time (JIT) compiler that further allows for high-performance acceleration69. Also, MOOSE\u2019s MPI acceleration is less effective for larger DOF problems due to message passing delay when transient variables exceed the CPU memory limit. Specifically, transient variables, especially from the global stiffness matrix for solving momentum balance, are stored on local storage, leading to delays. Conversely, JAX-CPFEM on GPU exhibits better performance, particularly in more nonlinear cases, as highlighted in the subsequent polycrystal simulation case.\n\nIn addition to the computational reasons for the seen speed improvement, another possible reason comes from the numerical aspects. MOOSE uses the Jacobian-Free Newton\u2013Krylov (JFNK) method to solve the nonlinear system of equations of FEM, as detailed in ref. 46. JFNK approximates the effect of the Jacobian through finite differences of the residual vector, which avoids the need to compute and store the Jacobian matrix explicitly and, hence, can handle complex nonlinear problems70. For the CPFEM case study of tantalum mentioned in ref. 46, it was found that JFNK is approximately seven times faster compared to Newton\u2019s method with a numerical Jacobian. Despite these advantages of JFNK used in MOOSE, the method inherently has truncation errors because the Jacobian-vector product is approximated using a first-order difference, which is directly related to the choice of the perturbation parameter. These truncation errors make MOOSE more sensitive to time integration errors, especially at the point of plastic yielding, where the largest error occurs due to the highly nonlinear solution46. Thus, beyond the line search algorithm71 (the same as JAX-CPFEM), MOOSE also employs a sub-increments algorithm72, which allows a smaller time step size to be used at the transition region of plastic yielding to reach convergence. This algorithm enhances solver robustness but increases computational time because it needs more time steps to finish simulations. In contrast, JAX-CPFEM employs AD to get precise Jacobian matrixes (up to machine precision), and thus, it needs fewer time steps at the transition region and further enhances efficiency.\n\nCase Study 2: single crystal copper (FCC)\n\nTo further validate JAX-CPFEM for different crystal structures and boundary conditions, we simulated a single-crystal copper with an FCC crystal structure under tensile loading (Fig. 3a). The domain dimensions were 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm with a strain rate of 0.1 s\u22121 and quasi-static incremental loadings from 0 to 0.005 mm applied in 50 steps to the top surface along the z-axis. In this scenario, both the top and bottom surfaces were under-constrained, which had more strict applied constraints. Materials parameters were sourced from the MOOSE benchmark and literature65 (see Supplementary Note 2).\n\nFig. 3: Comparison of the CPFEM results between JAX-CPFEM and MOOSE for Case study 2: single crystal copper (FCC). In (a), we show the boundary condition: the tensile experiment fixes the bottom side and pulls the top surface with a prescribed displacement condition. b A comparison of simulation results with different levels of mesh resolution (53, 103, 163, 203, and 253) between MOOSE (lines) and JAX-CPFEM (points). Full size image\n\nThe plot of the z-z component of volume-averaged stress versus applied strain is shown in Fig. 3b, comparing results from JAX-CPFEM (GPU mode) and MOOSE (CPU MPI), solving the Case 2 with different levels of mesh. Similarly, in Fig. 3b, the points and lines represent the results obtained from JAX-CPFEM and MOOSE, respectively. The mesh-dependent results match perfectly, validating our software\u2019s accuracy in simulating a single crystal under more constraints. This case demonstrated mesh sensitivity compared to the previous case. Although quantitative mesh convergence tests are vital for CPFEM scenarios like this one, they are often overlooked. As Lim et al.73. noted, mesh convergence in the single crystal is influenced by initial crystal orientation, boundary conditions, intragranular heterogeneity, and the hardening model. However, due to computational cost and the need for explicit discretization of individual grains using many finite elements, mesh convergence studies in CPFEM models are more challenging compared to conventional FEM, which is impossible to obtain reasonable estimates of mesh sensitivity in single crystals. Fortunately, GPU-accelerated JAX-CPFEM offers a potential solution for these challenges, since it has the ability to generate enough output results for study, taking a lot of different factors into account while finishing in an acceptable amount of time.\n\nWall time measurements for different mesh resolutions were also conducted using different software. Figure 4 shows the wall time measurements with respect to the number of DOF, of those last five columns of data points correspond to the problems mentioned in Fig. 3b. JAX-CPFEM on GPU maintained a significant advantage for larger problem sizes. For a problem with 52,728 DOF (253 mesh), it took 6965 s and 1268 s for JAX-CPFEM on CPU and GPU, respectively, compared to 4923 s for MOOSE on CPU with MPI (8 cores). JAX-CPFEM on GPU achieved 1.4\u00d7 acceleration compared to MOOSE with MPI. Although JAX-CPFEM on CPU/GPU did not scale as well as in Case 1 (4.5\u00d7) due to the increased applied constraints, large CPFEM problems can still be readily solved using JAX-CPFEM on GPU. To further demonstrate the computational advantage of JAX-CPFEM, we consider a case study of bi-crystal with two different microstructures (BCC + FCC), as detailed in Supplementary Note 6.\n\nFig. 4 Performance test for Case study 2 with different levels of mesh resolution (23, 53, 103, 163, 203, and 253): single crystal copper (FCC) under a tensile loading boundary condition. Full size image\n\nCase Study 3: polycrystal 304 steel (FCC)\n\nCPFEM is a crucial tool in ICME for investigating the structure-property relationship of polycrystals, bridging microscale microstructure and macroscale performance. Based on recent work on 304 steel (FCC)40, we validated JAX-CPFEM software for a general polycrystal simulation. The average equiaxed grain size was set as 8.0 \u00b5m, with randomly generated crystallographic texture and crystal orientation due to the lack of experimental data. Using Neper74, an open-source software package for polycrystal generation and meshing, an RVE of 0.016 mm \u00d7 0.016 mm \u00d7 0.016 mm was constructed, and crystallographic texture was generated using a seed from a random number generator for computing the initial seed position. Crystal orientations for each grain were represented by quaternion rotation and were generated randomly through SciPy75, an open-source package used for statistics, optimization, and so on. In this section, simulations were conducted on a polycrystal case with ensured crystallographic texture and crystal orientations with various mesh resolutions, as shown in Fig. 5a. A quasi-static tensile strain from 0 to 1% with 50 steps was applied along the z-axis at a strain rate of 0.1 s\u22121, while the bottom surface and a corner were constrained. The plot of the z-z component of volume-averaged stress versus applied strain is shown in Fig. 5b, comparing results from JAX-CPFEM (GPU mode) and MOOSE (CPU MPI), based on the same levels of mesh resolution (163 mesh). Both showed similar results, validating our software for polycrystal simulations.\n\nFig. 5: Comparison of the CPFEM results between JAX-CPFEM and MOOSE for Case study 3: polycrystal 304 steel (FCC). In (a), we show the boundary condition: the tensile experiment fixes the bottom and a corner and pulls the top surface with a prescribed displacement condition. b A comparison of simulation results with the same level of mesh resolution (163) between JAX-CPFEM (points) and MOOSE (line). Full size image\n\nBesides homogenized behavior, such as volume-averaged stress, JAX-CPFEM can capture detailed local microstructural information. Utilizing ParaView76, an open-source post-processing software, JAX-CPFEM can generate various visual outputs. For instance, grain distribution and von Moses equivalent stress field can be mapped onto the deformed sample (Fig. 6). A comparison of visualization of the deformed sample between JAX-CPFEM and MOOSE is summarized in Supplementary Note 5, which further validates the accuracy of our software. Such detailed visual outputs can also provide the examination of thresholding, clipping, and slicing of microstructural field for analysis. These visualizations provide additional insights into the local fields within the microstructure, offering a deeper understanding of material behavior and enhancing CPFEM studies.\n\nFig. 6: Visualization of local microstructure information of polycrystal 304 steel mapped to deformed sample (scale factor: 15) utilizing ParaView . a Grain distribution. b von Mises equivalent stress. The microstructure of the sample is generated using Neper and simulated using conforming FEM discretization scheme with hexahedral elements. Full size image\n\nPerformance tests with different levels of mesh resolution were conducted, considering 53, 103, 163, 203, and 253 mesh, with wall time measurement comparisons shown in Fig. 7. Compared to the previous single crystal case study, JAX-CPFEM on GPU exhibited a more predominant advantage for polycrystal problems from small to large sizes. For a problem with 52,728 DOF (253 mesh), JAX-CPFEM on CPU and GPU took 6712 s (~1.9 h) and 2203 s (~0.6 h), respectively, compared to 85,892 s (~1 d) for MOOSE on CPU with MPI (8 cores). JAX-CPFEM achieved 12.8\u00d7 (CPU mode) and 39.0\u00d7 (GPU mode) acceleration compared to MOOSE with MPI, drastically reducing computation time from days to less than an hour. Polycrystalline simulations in MOOSE with MPI took longer than single-crystal simulations, primarily due to the complexity of polycrystalline materials, including material anisotropy, grain boundary effects, and micromechanical interactions. These factors require more iterative steps for convergence. Each iteration involves solving larger sets of nonlinear equations, increasing computation time. Also, they need to store and manage larger amounts of data related to each grain, such as grain orientations, stress-strain states, etc., increasing memory demands. As mentioned previously, the transient variables exceeding the CPU memory limit are stored in local storage and lead to delays. These factors decrease performance of MOOSE MPI acceleration. JAX-CPFEM on GPU offers a superior alternative; in summary, this degree of acceleration shows great potential to enhance both forward and inverse design in smart manufacturing.\n\nFig. 7 Performance test for Case study 3 with different levels of mesh resolution (53, 103, 163, 203, and 253): polycrystal 304 steel (FCC) under a tensile loading boundary condition. Full size image\n\nAD-based sensitivity analysis\n\nInverse design problems are critical in various engineering applications, such as processing design, microstructure design, and property design. Mathematically, these problems can be formulated as PDE-constrained optimization (PDE-CO) problems77. The key to solving these challenges lies in computing the \u201csensitivity\u201d (gradient of the objective function to design parameters) accurately and efficiently, which is essential for gradient-based optimization algorithms43. To demonstrate the differentiable capabilities of JAX-CPFEM, we first introduced and verified a sensitivity analysis concerning the grain orientation of each grain in the CPFEM simulation, realized through automatic differentiation (AD). Through these AD sensitivities, we could conduct the inverse design of grain orientations of each grain in a polycrystal featuring targeted mechanical properties using gradient-based optimization, which will be shown in the next section.\n\nIn this section, we consider a general copper (FCC) subjected to tensile loadings. The domain dimensions are 0.1 mm \u00d7 0.1 mm \u00d7 0.1 mm, discretized with 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mesh. Figure 8a shows the boundary conditions and crystallographic geometry. Here, we assume the eight mesh/cells represent different grains of the polycrystal metal, and each with its own crystal orientation represented by three Euler angles (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3). These angles define a three-dimensional rotation based on sequential rotations around the Z, Y, and X axes relative to its starting position. For the sensitivity analysis of a polycrystal targeting mechanical properties with respect to the grain orientation of each grain, the material response \\(\\hat{O}\\left(\\theta \\right)\\) is defined as the local mechanical status under deformation. Specifically, the average stress \u03c3 zz is extracted from the corner mesh/cell labeled \u201c1\u201d, located at the bottom-left corner in the x-y plane of the domain, adjacent to the origin (0, 0, 0), as shown in Fig. 8a. The stress status is computed under a 2% applied deformation. The input parameters are summarized and flatten into a vector \\({\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} =[{\\theta }_{1},\\,{\\theta }_{2},\\ldots ,{\\theta }_{24}]\\), comprising 24 variables, including the three Euler angles \\(\\left[{\\alpha }_{i},\\,{\\beta }_{i},{\\gamma }_{i}\\right]\\,\\) applied on all eight mesh/grains. The material response and its corresponding sensitivity are expressed as follows:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{c}\\hat{O}\\left({\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\right)={\\left.{\\sigma }_{{zz}}\\right|}_{\\epsilon =2 \\% }\\left({\\alpha }_{1},\\,{\\beta }_{1},{\\gamma }_{1},\\ldots ,{\\alpha }_{8},\\,{\\beta }_{8},{\\gamma }_{8}\\right)={\\left.{\\sigma }_{{zz}}\\right|}_{\\epsilon =2 \\% }\\left({\\theta }_{1},\\,{\\theta }_{2},\\ldots ,{\\theta }_{24}\\right)\\,,\\\\ {\\rm{and}}\\,{\\boldsymbol{J}}=\\frac{\\partial {\\hat{O}}\\left({\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\right)}{\\partial {\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} }.\\end{array}$$ (1)\n\nFig. 8: Case study for sensitivity analysis with respect to crystal orientation of each cell. In (a), we show the boundary condition: a polycrystal copper (FCC) with 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mesh/grains under a tensile loading along the z-axis. The tensile experiment fixes the bottom surface and a corner and pulls the top surface with a prescribed displacement condition. b The simulation result of the z-z component of stress \u03c3 zz extracted from the corner mesh/cell labeled \u201c1\u201d versus applied strain, obtained from JAX-CPFEM. Three Euler angles \\(\\left[{\\alpha }_{i},\\,{\\beta }_{i},{\\gamma }_{i}\\right]\\) applied to each mesh/grain are \\([30^{\\circ} ,\\,40^{\\circ} ,\\,50^{\\circ} ]\\). The color contour bar in the figure represents the value of Euler angle. Full size image\n\nThis sensitivity analysis can help us understand the mechanical effect of slight angular deflection of all eight mesh/grains after applying rotation on initial microstructure, additionally, the analysis facilitates automatic inverse design through gradient-based optimization based on experimental mechanical tests. The total derivative of \\(\\hat{O}\\left({\\boldsymbol{\\theta }}\\right)\\) with respect to parameter variables \\({\\boldsymbol{\\theta }}\\) can be calculated through chain rules, see Supplementary Note 4 for details. However, CPFEM involves complicated nonlinear constitutive relations, and the derivation of the sensitivity by deriving analytical expressions through chain rules is quite non-trivial, tedious and error prone. A possible approach is based on numerical differentiation such as finite-difference-based numerical (FDM) derivatives, which is a kind of numerical method for approximating the value of derivatives78. The FDM method is easier to implement. However, it is computationally expensive because it needs to execute the forward CPFEM simulation multiple times, especially when the size of the input parameters is larger than that of the objective function. Furthermore, in situations requiring precise sensitivities, such as in material bifurcation analysis, numerical approximations may introduce significant errors, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions51. In contrast, JAX-CPFEM computes these derivatives at once in a fully automatic manner, which is not only efficient but also feasible for general users.\n\nFor comparison, a case study with three Euler angles \\(\\left[{\\alpha }_{i},\\,{\\beta }_{i},{\\gamma }_{i}\\right]=[30^{\\circ},\\,40^{\\circ},\\,50^{\\circ}]\\) applied to each mesh/grain was used for verification, as shown in Fig. 8b, which also plots the z\u2013z component of average Cauchy stress extracted from the corner cell versus applied strain. The sensitivity calculations for each mesh/cell (No. 1\u20138) using both AD and FDM-based methods are summarized in Table 1 for sanity check if the derivative is computed correctly. As shown in Table 1, the difference in sensitivity calculations between the two methods is less than 1%, confirming the accuracy of JAX-CPFEM\u2019s differentiability and its ability to utilize AD for precise analytic derivatives even in highly non-linear problems.\n\nTable. 1 Comparison between AD and FDM sensitivity calculations for all cells with rotation \\(\\left[{\\alpha }_{i},\\,{\\beta }_{i},{\\gamma }_{i}\\right]=[30^{\\circ},\\,40^{\\circ},\\,50^{\\circ} ]\\) Full size table\n\nWhile the primary benefit of AD in handling complex non-linear models was often highlighted, the computational cost comparison between AD and non-AD approaches is equally important, yet frequently overlooked. In this CPFEM problem, the number of crystal orientations in each cell typically exceeds that of the objective function, necessitating running forward CPFEM models twice as many times as the number of design parameters. For instance, in the case study in Table 1, 48 forward CPFEM runs (2 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 3) are required, taking ~4790 s with JAX-CPFEM on GPU. In contrast, AD with differentiable JAX-CPFEM required only 100 s to obtain the sensitivity vector, achieving a 48\u00d7 acceleration over FDM even on GPU. This efficiency is promising for grain orientation design in CPFEM using gradient-based optimization, which will be elaborated in the next section.\n\nInverse design of grain orientations via AD-based sensitivities\n\nMicrostructure optimization, such as considering the effect of grain size summarized by the traditional Hall-Petch relationship79,80,81, is crucial for overcoming the well-known strength-ductility tradeoff. However, although simulations excel at mapping an input material microstructure to its resulting property, their direct application to inverse design has traditionally been limited by their high computing cost and lack of differentiability35. This section presents a pipeline for inverse design, combining our end-to-end differentiable JAX-CPFEM with gradient-based optimization. We illustrate the power of this approach with an example of the inverse design of initial grain orientations in a polycrystalline metal, aiming to achieve targeted mechanical properties after a specific manufacturing process.\n\nThe problem domain is a 0.1 mm \u00d7 0.1 mm \u00d7 0.1 mm polycrystal copper, discreated with 8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8 hexahedral mesh under the same boundary conditions as shown in Fig. 8a. The objective is to perform an inverse design of the initial crystal orientations of this 512 mesh, each representing different grains. The desired mechanical property is defined by a set of n points representing the local mechanical status (stress-strain curve), extracted from the corner cell adjacent to the origin (0, 0, 0). Let x i and y i represent the n points at different applied strain stages and the stress \\({\\sigma }_{{zz}}\\,\\) extracted from the corner cell. The input parameters are summarized and flatten into a vector \\(\\theta =[{\\theta }_{1},\\,{\\theta }_{2},\\ldots ,{\\theta }_{1536}]\\), including three sequential rotations of Euler angles (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) applied on all 512 mesh/grains around the Z, Y, and X axes from the starting position, representing the initial crystal orientation of each grain before deformation. The targeted mechanical properties \\({y}_{i}\\,\\) are the average stresses \\({\\sigma }_{{zz}}\\) of the corner cell at different applied displacement stages, as shown by the black points in Fig. 9a. In summary, the discretized PDE-CO problem is formulated as\n\n$$\\begin{array}{c}{\\min }_{\\theta \\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{M}}\\,{\\hat{O}}\\left({\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\right)\\\\ {\\rm{s}}.{\\rm{t}}.\\,{\\boldsymbol{R}}\\left({\\boldsymbol{U}},{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\right)=0,\\end{array}$$ (2)\n\nwhere \\({\\boldsymbol{R}}\\left({\\boldsymbol{U}},{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\right){{{:}}\\,{\\mathbb{R}}}^{N}\\times {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{M}\\to {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{N}\\) represents the direct consequence of discretizing the weak form and imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions, and \\({\\boldsymbol{U}}\\in {{\\mathbb{R}}}^{N}\\) is the FEM solution vector of DOF. The objective function \\({\\hat{O}}\\left({\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\right)\\) is the implicit function that arises from solving the PDE, representing the difference between the targeted and simulated mechanical property:\n\n$$\\hat{O}\\left({\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\right)=w\\times \\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{({y}_{i}-{f}_{{sim},i}({\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} ))}^{2},$$ (3)\n\nwhere \\({f}_{{sim},i}(\\theta )\\) is the optimized simulation (sim) results at different applied displacement stages obtained from JAX-CPFEM, and \\(w\\) is the weight value. It is important to clarify that the sensitivity analysis and subsequent gradient-based optimization are not dependent on the specific choice of the cell as long as the location is consistent in the inverse design pipeline regardless of whether the cell is at the corner or the center cell.\n\nFig. 9: Inverse design of the crystal orientation in polycrystalline copper. Subfigure (a) shows the targeted local mechanical properties (ground truth) of \\({\\sigma }_{{zz}}\\) extract from the corner cell under different deformation stage x i , represented by black dots. The red dashed line indicates the JAX-CPFEM simulation outputs based on the initial guess for optimization, which significantly deviates from the targeted properties. The purple line represents JAX-CPFEM simulation results based on the crystal orientations designed by gradient-based optimization. The purple line closely aligns with the targeted properties, demonstrating the robustness of our pipeline. Subfigure (b) illustrates the percentage reduction in the objective function value falls within 0.4% with 32 steps. Full size image\n\nThe overall workflow for solving inverse design problems uses gradient-based optimization, utilizing search directions defined by the gradient of the function at the current point. The \u201coptimizer\u201d in the algorithm can use any off-the-shelf gradient-based optimization algorithms; for this problem, we used the limited-memory BFGS algorithm82 provided by the SciPy package75 as the optimizer, which is designed for efficiently handling large-scale optimization problems. Based on the chain rule, we can efficiently and automatically compute the tedious and error-prone derivatives \\(\\frac{\\partial \\hat{O}\\left({\\boldsymbol{\\theta }}\\right)}{\\partial {\\boldsymbol{\\theta }}}\\) using the AD function in JAX called \u201cjax.vjp\u201d, which stands for vector-Jacobian product, which has been verified in the above section.\n\nThe gradient-based optimization begins with an initial guess with a same rotation for each mesh/grain, meaning the same Euler angles (\\(\\alpha =30^{\\circ},\\,\\beta =30^{\\circ},\\,\\gamma =30^{\\circ}\\)) for each mesh, as shown in the first row of Fig. 10. The corresponding stress \\({\\sigma }_{{zz}}\\) of the corner cell for this initial guess is shown as the red dashed line in Fig. 9a, which is far from the targeted mechanical properties represented by black dots. Figure 9b shows the optimization iterations, where the objective value is defined in Eq. (3), and each optimization step corresponds to each time the gradient information is queried by the optimizer. Based on the AD-based derivatives calculated at each optimization step, the percentage reduction in the objective function value falls below 1% with only 26 steps, while is about 0.4% when the optimization is completed after 32 steps. Using the designed parameters obtained after 32 gradient-based iterations, we ran JAX-CPFEM to perform a sanity test, ensuring the inverse workflow was processed correctly. The stress-strain curve obtained based on designed parameters, represented by the purple line in Fig. 9a, closely matches the targeted mechanical properties, verifying our inverse design pipeline based on our differentiable JAX-CPFEM. The designed parameters, Euler angles \\(\\left[{\\alpha }_{i},\\,{\\beta }_{i},{\\gamma }_{i}\\right]\\) for the 512 mesh/grains, are shown in the second row in Fig. 10. The corresponding inverse pole figures depicting the designed crystallographic orientation of grains are shown in the third row, while the initial guess of crystallographic orientation of grains is labeled by black boxes. This information can provide insights for future microstructure design via smart manufacturing.\n\nFig. 10: Inverse design of the initial crystal orientation of polycrystalline copper under deformations, involving three sequential rotations of Euler angles ( \\({\\alpha }_{i},\\,{\\beta }_{i},{\\gamma }_{i}\\) ) around the Z, Y, and X axes relative to their initial position, applied across all 512 mesh/grains using the differentiable JAX-CPFEM . The first row shows the initial guess for the gradient-based optimization, where each mesh is assigned the same Euler angles (\\(\\alpha =30^{\\circ},\\,\\beta =30^{\\circ},\\,\\gamma =30^{\\circ}\\)). The second row displays the Euler angles designed for each cell after 32 iterations of gradient-based optimization. Inverse pole figures depicting the designed crystallographic orientation of grains for targeted properties, corresponding to a specific direction in the reference frame of crystal, are shown in the third row. The crystallographic orientations of initial guess are also identified on inverse pole figures by black dashed boxes. Full size image\n\nIn summary, this section proposed an inverse design of crystal orientations in polycrystalline materials as an example, demonstrating the robustness and efficiency of our pipeline, which integrates differentiable JAX-CPFEM with a general optimizer. We highlight three key contributions of our pipeline that distinguish it from others:",

            "content": "Plasmonic nanostructures are known for their distinct optical characteristics that facilitate advanced applications in sensing, optoelectronics, and quantum technologies alike.1 These structures concentrate light into sub-wavelength dimensions, improving electromagnetic fields at nanoscale \"hot spots.\"\n\nWhile planar plasmonics has been widely studied, extending it to 3D architectures unlocks new possibilities, such as vertical mode coupling and spatially tailored resonances for multifunctional systems. However, the shift to 3D plasmonics presents significant challenges.\n\nAt such small scales, even the smallest deviations in geometry could significantly change the targeted plasmonic behavior. To fully realize the potential of 3D plasmonics, precise characterization, and rigorous simulations are essential for verifying functionality and ensuring reliable performance as originally intended.\n\nFEBID: Unlocking 3D Nanoprinting\n\nOver the past decade, Focused Electron Beam Induced Deposition (FEBID) has emerged as a versatile and precise additive manufacturing technology for nanoscale 3D structures. By using a focused electron beam to locally dissociate precursor molecules (Figure 1A), FEBID enables the direct-write fabrication of complex architectures (Figure 1B\u2013C) with spatial resolutions down to just a few nanometers.2\n\nIts flexibility allows for the creation of 3D geometries that conventional lithographic techniques cannot achieve (Figure 1D). However, FEBID structures often contain a high proportion of carbon due to incomplete ligand dissociation.\n\nAs a result, purification processes are essential for removing this carbon while preserving the structures' geometry and enabling functional properties such as plasmonic activity.3 This highlights the crucial relationship between fabrication, purification, and characterization in ensuring successful outcomes.\n\nFigure 1. 3D nanoprinting using focused electron beams (A) facilitates the flexible fabrication of plasmonic structures from simple (B) to intricate geometries (C), and even fully free-standing 3D architectures (D). Following purification, the material transforms into pure gold, enabling distinct plasmonic responses, as illustrated by the colored STEM-EELS maps. The objective of this study was to achieve full optimization to completely align with simulation predictions, as shown right in panel (D). Image Credit: Quantum Design UK and Ireland Ltd\n\nThe Challenge of Accurate Characterization\n\nPurified FEBID structures require precise characterization to validate their design and optimize functionality, a task that becomes especially challenging at the nanoscale. One of the most effective techniques for visualizing plasmonic activity with spatial and energy resolution is Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) combined with Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS).\n\nWhile highly effective, experimental measurements can be further complemented by simulations, which are crucial for assessing whether the designs perform as intended (Figure 1D). However, accurate morphological data is essential at this scale, as even slight variations can significantly influence simulation outcomes.\n\nWhile AFM characterization of such nanostructures on bulk substrates would be easy to carry out, it lacks comparability as growth and purification on ultra-thin sub-3 nm carbon grids, needed for STEM, is completely different. Thus, the only reliable approach for both characterization and simulation are primary STEM-EELS assessments, followed by AFM characterization of the same structures.\n\nAlthough AFM characterization would be straightforward for nanostructures on bulk substrates, it lacks comparability. This is because growth and purification conditions on ultra-thin, sub-3 nm carbon grids\u2014required for STEM\u2014differ significantly from those on bulk substrates.\n\nMissing this correlation, simulations founded on assumptions as opposed to real geometries are at risk of introducing considerable inaccuracies, which compromise the reliability of experimental outcomes and predictions.\n\nWhile AFM assessments on such membranes are very challenging, the benefits of this technique are considerable and widely applicable. This approach can be used in any scenario demanding combined TEM and AFM.\n\nFigure 2. Comprehensive workflow for 3D plasmonic nanostructure analysis. After 3D nanoprinting, STEM- EELS characterization is performed to evaluate the plasmonic functionality (top left box). The FusionScope then begins with SEM overviews to locate the region of interest and identify the specific nanowires of interest (red, top right). Next, the SEM guides the precise approach of the AFM cantilever (blue, bottom row) for high-resolution morphological characterization on ultra- thin membranes. The resulting cross- sectional profiles (bottom left) are used as input for simulations, enabling optimization of the fabrication process [4]. Image Credit: Quantum Design UK and Ireland Ltd\n\nStrategy: Bridging the Morphology Gap with the FusionScope\u00ae\n\nTo resolve the challenges of accurate characterization and simulation, Quantum Design UK and Ireland used a detailed approach that incorporates morphological characterization into the whole workflow.\n\nAt the center of this technique is the FusionScope by Quantum Design, which merges the imaging capabilities of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) for nanoscale feature identification with the accurate surface analysis abilities of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM).5 The workflow (see Figure 2) follows these key steps:\n\nFabrication and Initial Characterization: Following 3D nanoprinting on sub-3 nm membranes, STEM-EELS was used for comprehensive functional characterization of the plasmonic nanowires. Correlative Morphology: The FusionScope facilitated the localization and analysis of the same nanowires. SEM-guided positioning enabled precise nanowire identification, ensuring accurate AFM measurements. Simulation Validation: Quantitative AFM cross-sectional data provided input parameters for plasmonic simulations, ensuring that the modeled geometries closely matched the actual structures. This significantly improved the predictive accuracy of the simulations.\n\nThis approach demonstrated that direct morphological correlation is not just beneficial but essential for achieving reliable, reproducible results\u2014serving as a crucial step toward full process optimization.\n\nExperimental Success: FusionScope in Action\n\nThe FusionScope was found to be the optimal tool for this high-precision workflow (Figure 2). Its integrated SEM-AFM abilities enabled the location and characterization of nanowires on fragile, ultra-thin sub-3 nm films\u2014a considerable achievement demonstrating the tool's sensitivity and stability.\n\nSEM-guided navigation was essential, enabling the AFM probe to precisely approach structures without causing damage. As shown in Figure 3, AFM measurements closely matched TEM data, confirming the FusionScope\u2019s reliability and accuracy for nanoscale imaging.\n\nThe direct correlation between TEM and AFM data allowed for the refinement of simulation inputs and the optimization of both fabrication and purification processes, paving the way for predictable 3D plasmonic structures. This high level of predictability transformed the entire workflow into a deductive design process\u2014starting with simulations and progressing to fabrication.\n\nUltimately, this approach fulfilled the long-standing potential of FEBID as a dependable method for creating 3D plasmonic architectures.\n\nFigure 3. TEM-validated AFM data, demonstrating very good agreement in morphological characterization. This comparison highlights the exceptional sensitivity, stability, and reliability of the FusionScope, even when analyzing structures on ultra-thin sub-3 nm membranes, reinforcing its credibility for high-precision nanoscale analysis. Image Credit: Quantum Design UK and Ireland Ltd\n\nConclusion: A New Standard in Correlative Microscopy\n\nThe FusionScope has transformed applicable workflows for activities in 3D plasmonic nanostructures by bridging the important gap between fabrication and simulation for the first time in both a consistent and reliable way.6,7,8 In a field where nanoscale precision is critical, this instrument establishes a new benchmark for next-generation correlative microscopy, delivering capabilities that surpass those of alternative systems.\n\nBeyond this specific use case, the FusionScope has reimagined the potential of correlated microscopy. Its seamless integration of SEM-guided AFM with sophisticated operational modes makes it invaluable for pre- and post-characterization workflows even on highly exposed surface areas.9\n\nThe tool is ideally suited for assessing difficult surfaces, as shown on sub-3 nm membranes, and consistently delivers outstanding sensitivity, precision, and stability with an easy-to-use operation philosophy.\n\nFor researchers standing at the forefront of nanotechnology, the FusionScope provides unequaled flexibility and reliability, representing a key technological advancement in nanoscale characterization.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis article is based on materials originally authored by Harald Plank, Department Head for Functional Nanofabrication / FIB / AFM at the Graz Centre of Electron Microscopy.\n\nReferences and Further Reading\n\nGu, P., Zhang, W. and Zhang, G.

            "content": "For the past hundred years or so, internal combustion has ruled the road. But with EVs gradually stealing away the spotlight, it's easy to think gas-powered engines are on their way out. And while you could argue that this is true, there\u2019s no denying that some brands are still driving ICE innovation.\n\nTake Porsche, for example. The German automotive giant has been tinkering with a six-stroke engine to boost efficiency. Toyota\u2019s all in on the sustainability game, too. They\u2019re working on hydrogen combustion, and personally, I think Toyota has the biggest shot at future-proofing internal combustion.\n\nThat said, it isn\u2019t just big auto that\u2019s innovating around ICE. Independent researchers have come up with a clever way to make ICE-powered machines more efficient by turning wasted exhaust heat into electricity.\n\nPhoto by: Toyota Toyota and the Japanese big four teamed up to make a hydrogen combustion-powered Dakar racer.\n\nOne of the biggest problems with internal combustion engines is that they're pretty damn wasteful. Around 75% of the energy they burn is lost as heat, either through the tailpipe or radiant heat from the engine. But a new thermoelectric generator (TEG) aims to address that. Mounted on the exhaust pipe, this device captures heat and converts it into electricity.\n\nDeveloped by a research team and published in the science journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, the prototype generated up to 56 watts of power at regular driving speeds and a fairly impressive 146 watts in high-speed applications like helicopters.\n\nBut how does it work? It uses a semiconductor made of bismuth-telluride to create electricity from temperature differences. Most similar systems need bulky water cooling, but this one relies on a finned heatsink that passively sheds heat using airflow\u2014perfect for motorcycles and powersports where wind is pretty much always in play.\n\nAnd while the team tested the tech on automobiles, it\u2019s clear that it isn\u2019t just for cars. Powersports vehicles like motorcycles, UTVs, and ATVs could benefit\u2014perhaps even more. These machines have exposed exhausts that see plenty of airflow, meaning the system could work efficiently without added weight or complexity. Plus, they don\u2019t get caught up in gridlock traffic as much as cars do.\n\nBut taking this tech a bit further into the future, I think hybrids could also get a boost. The electricity generated could trickle charge the battery, squeezing out a little extra range. It\u2019s not a game-changer, but every bit of recovered energy helps.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a smart way to make combustion engines more efficient, but let\u2019s be real\u2014it\u2019s not going to bring ICE roaring back to dominance. The future is electric, and while innovations like this can stretch out the life of gas-powered machines, they won\u2019t stop the shift toward EVs.\n\nStill, for those of us who love motorcycles and off-road machines, any tech that makes ICE more efficient is worth a look. If this TEG tech finds its way into production, it could make our rides just a little bit more powerful and efficient. And that\u2019s a win in our book.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

Applied Materials, which integrates Besi\u2019s HB equipment into its systems, also confirmed last week it has received several volume orders for HB.\n\nThe exact timing of growth is unknown, but we believe investors with a three-year time horizon will see a meaningful uptick in sales driven by HB and complemented by other technologies.\n\nWe model a 50% CAGR in hybrid bonding revenue in the next five years, with the largest inflection occurring in 2026 to 2028. According to the CEO, utilization rates in mainstream applications (excluding HB) are approaching 80%, the level at which customers normally consider new capacity expansions, so this should help with revenue growth.\n\nGrowth in research and development investment and planned capacity expansions in 2025 reinforce our optimistic view.

They completed stock splits last year to reset their soaring share prices, but certain Wall Street analysts still anticipate significant gains for shareholders in the coming year.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now?

That implies 22% upside from its current share price of $90.\n\nRyan Koontz at Needham has set Arista with a target price of $145 per share. This implies 45% upside from its current share price of $100.\n\nThe analysts above are among the most bullish on Wall Street where Lam Research and Arista are concerned, so investors should treat their forecasts skeptically. But the stocks still warrant consideration given that both companies should benefit as AI infrastructure spending increases.\n\n1. Lam Research\n\nThe first step in semiconductor manufacturing is called deposition, which involves layering a silicon wafer with conducting and insulating materials. A light-sensitive coating is then applied to the silicon, and lithography machines print complex circuitry patterns on the wafer surface. Finally, etch systems are used to selectively remove materials added during deposition to reveal the pattern.\n\nLam has a strong presence in two wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) categories. It is the leading supplier of etch systems, and it ranks second behind Applied Materials in deposition systems. Lam products are heavily used in memory chip production, but foundry customers like Taiwan Semiconductor also use its systems to make logic chips like central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). In all cases, Lam should benefit as artificial intelligence (AI) increases demand for semiconductors.\n\nLam reported reasonably good financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended in December 2024. Revenue increased 5% to $4.3 billion, and non-GAAP net income increased 6% to $0.91 per diluted share. Importantly, AI is driving demand for more sophisticated semiconductor designs at the chip and packaging level. Lam is leaning into those opportunities, and management told analysts the company is on pace to gain WFE market share this year.\n\nWall Street estimates Lam's adjusted earnings will increase at 10% annually through fiscal 2026, which ends in June 2026. That makes the present valuation of 26 times adjusted earnings a little expensive. But analysts in the past have regularly underestimated earnings. Lam beat the consensus by an average of 7% in the last six quarters. If that continues, the current price would look sensible.\n\nAs a warning, Chinese customers accounted for about one-third of revenue in the recent quarter, making it Lam's most important geographic region. Trade tensions between the U.S. and Chinese governments could put downward pressure on that figure. Personally, I would feel more comfortable buying the stock if its price dropped 10% or so. But investors should definitely keep Lam on their watchlists.\n\n2. Arista Networks\n\nArista provides high-performance networking solutions for enterprise and cloud data centers. The company complements its hardware portfolio, which includes switches and routers, with adjacent software for network automation, monitoring, and security. Arista is the leader in high-speed categories of the Ethernet switch market (i.e., 100+ Gigabit), with more than twice as much share as the closest contender, Cisco.\n\nArista says two key innovations let it disrupt the market. First, it provides a single version of its Extensible Operating System (EOS) that runs across all its hardware and simplifies network management. Second, it relies entirely on merchant silicon (chips built by third parties) rather than designing its own chips. That lets Arista focus R&D spending on software development and affords customers flexibility in selecting chips.\n\nArista reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 19% to $7 billion, and non-GAAP net income increased 31% to $2.27 per diluted share. The stock declined following the report because management said Meta Platforms accounted for 15% of revenue, down from 21% in the previous year. But Apple, Microsoft, and Oracle represented a greater percentage of total revenue.\n\nData centers in the future will need to modernize their network infrastructure to keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence. Arista is ideally positioned to capitalize on demand for faster networking equipment given its leadership position in high-speed Ethernet switches. Wall Street expects the company's adjusted earnings to increase at 14% annually through 2026.\n\nThat makes the current valuation of 44 times adjusted earnings look a little pricey, but Wall Street has regularly underestimated its earnings. Arista beat the consensus forecast by an average of 15% in the last six quarters. If that continues, its current valuation would look quite reasonable in hindsight. Investors with a time horizon of at least three years should consider buying a small position today.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "Read time: 2 minutes\n\nRapid, localized heat management is essential for electronic devices and could have applications ranging from wearable materials to burn treatment. While so-called thermoelectric materials convert temperature differences to electrical voltage and vice versa, their efficiency is often limited, and their production is costly and wasteful. In a new paper published in Science, researchers from the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) used a 3D printing technique to fabricate high-performance thermoelectric materials, reducing production costs significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\nThermoelectric coolers, also called solid-state refrigerators, can induce localized cooling by using an electric current to transfer heat from one side of the device to another. Their long lifetimes, invulnerability to leaks, size and shape tunability, and the lack of moving parts (such as circulating liquids) make these devices ideal for diverse cooling applications, such as electronics. However, manufacturing them out of ingots is associated with high costs and generates lots of material waste. In addition, the devices\u2019 performance remains limited.\n\nWant more breaking news? Subscribe to Technology Networks\u2019 daily newsletter, delivering breaking science news straight to your inbox every day. Subscribe for FREE\n\nNow, a team at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA), led by Verbund Professor for Energy Sciences and Head of the Werner Siemens Thermoelectric Laboratory Maria Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, with first author and ISTA postdoc Shengduo Xu, developed high-performance thermoelectric materials out of the 3D printer and used them to build a thermoelectric cooler. \u201cOur innovative integration of 3D printing into thermoelectric cooler fabrication greatly improves manufacturing efficiency and reduces costs,\u201d says Xu. Also, in contrast to previous attempts at 3D printing thermoelectric materials, the present method yields materials with considerably higher performance. ISTA Professor Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez adds, \u201cWith commercial-level performance, our work has the potential to extend beyond academia, holding practical relevance and attracting interest from industries seeking real-world applications.\u201d\n\nPushing the boundaries of thermoelectric technologies\n\nWhile all materials demonstrate some thermoelectric effect, it is often too negligible to be useful. Materials exhibiting a high enough thermoelectric effect are usually so-called \u201cdegenerate semiconductors,\u201d i.e., \u201cdoped\u201d semiconductors, to which impurities are introduced intentionally so they behave like conductors. Current state-of-the-art thermoelectric coolers are produced using ingot-based manufacturing techniques\u2014expensive and power-hungry procedures requiring extensive machining processes after production, where a lot of material is wasted. \u201cWith our present work, we can 3D print exactly the needed shape of thermoelectric materials. In addition, the resulting devices exhibit a net cooling effect of 50 degrees in the air. This means that our 3D-printed materials perform similarly to ones that are significantly more expensive to manufacture,\u201d says Xu. Thus, the team of ISTA material scientists proposes a scalable and cost-effective production method for thermoelectric materials, circumventing energy-intensive and time-consuming steps.\n\nPrinted materials with optimized particle bonding\n\nBeyond applying 3D printing techniques to produce thermoelectric materials, the team designed the inks so that, as the carrier solvent evaporates, effective and robust atomic bonds are formed between grains, creating an atomically connected material network. As a result, the interfacial chemical bonds improve the charge transfer between grains. This explains how the team managed to enhance the thermoelectric performance of their 3D-printed materials while also shedding new light on the transport properties of porous materials. \u201cWe employed an extrusion-based 3D printing technique and designed the ink formulation to ensure the integrity of the printed structure and boost particle bonding. This allowed us to produce the first thermoelectric coolers from printed materials with comparable performance to ingot-based devices while saving material and energy,\u201d says Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez.\n\nMedical applications, energy harvesting, and sustainability\n\nBeyond rapid heat management in electronics and wearable devices, thermoelectric coolers could have medical applications, including burn treatment and muscle strain relief. In addition, the ink formulation method developed by the team of ISTA scientists can be adapted for other materials to be used in high-temperature thermoelectric generators\u2014devices that can generate electrical voltage from a temperature difference. According to the team, such an approach could broaden the applicability of thermoelectric generators across various waste energy harvesting systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe successfully executed a full-cycle approach, from optimizing the raw materials\u2019 thermoelectric performance to fabricating a stable, high-performance end-product,\u201d says Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez. Xu adds, \u201cOur work offers a transformative solution for thermoelectric device production and heralds a new era of efficient and sustainable thermoelectric technologies.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: Xu S, Horta S, Lawal A, Maji K, Lorion M, Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez M.

The new equipment comes with the fab equipment maker\u2019s second-generation cold fusion emission (CFE) technology, which allows it to provide analysis three times as fast compared to thermal fusion emission (TFE) equipment, Applied Materials Director Mansoo Jang said at a press conference during Semicon Korea.\n\nThe second-generation CFE is also two times faster than the first generation, which was announced in 2022.\n\nCFE uses more electron compared to TFE to form a narrower beam. This allows the beam to penetrate deep into the chip and inspect the bottom most surfaces.\n\nThis kind of process is a must for advanced nodes such as logic under 2-nanometer scale as well as high density DRAM and 3D NAND, Jang said.\n\nThere are areas in inspection and chip defect review that prior optical technologies can solve, the director said.\n\nWith more advanced nodes being applied by chipmakers, the area where eBeam is applied is also expanding, he said.\n\nApplication of deep learning AI algorithm has also increased the speed by three times, he said. The equipment not only provides speed but can analyzes trend to find the \u201creal defect\u201d, ultimately contributing to increased yield rate for chip-makers, he added.

Up to 75 percent of the energy created by combustion engines is wasted as it\u2019s given off as engine heat or expelled via an exhaust pipe. If only we could find a way to harness that wasted energy and turn it into something useful. Well, somebody may have done that.\n\nAccording to a study published in the scientific journal ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, a team of researchers claim they\u2019ve found a way to turn exhaust heat into electricity with a nifty little device that can be attached to a car\u2019s tailpipe.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe system is designed around thermoelectric generators, which capture heat and convert it into electricity. When placed near a heat source, like a tailpipe, electrons bounce around from a hot side to a cold side, thus creating an electrical current. The researchers used a semiconductor material made of bismuth-telluride, which efficiently facilitates this electron movement.\n\nThe challenge here is maintaining a temperature difference between the two sides of the device without losing efficiency. To solve this problem, the researchers created a heatsink system with fin-like protrusions wrapped around the tailpipe that promotes heat dissipation through forced convection. Anybody with a big chunky fan attached to the CPU in their gaming PC might already be familiar with this concept.\n\nThe prototype device produces a maximum output of 40 Watts, which may not sound like much, but it\u2019s enough to power a lightbulb. When the team ran simulations with a car running at a high speed, the system could produce 56 W of power. When attached to exhaust vents on a helicopter, it generated 146 W of power. That\u2019s a pretty impressive amount of energy being recaptured and put to good use rather than just disappearing into the ether.\n\nWho knows what will come of this innovation, if anything at all, but it is impressive to see somebody finally addressing all of the wasted energy produced by terribly, egregiously inefficient gas-powered vehicles.",

The company\u2019s SEMVision\u2122 H20 system combines the industry\u2019s most sensitive electron beam (eBeam) technology with advanced AI image recognition to enable better and faster analysis of buried nanoscale defects in the world\u2019s most advanced chips.\n\neBeam imaging has long been an important tool for examining defects that are too small to be seen with optical techniques.

Process control engineers increasingly need defect review systems that can analyze exponentially more samples while maintaining the speed and sensitivity required for high-volume production.\n\n\u201cOur new SEMVision H20 system allows the world\u2019s leading chipmakers to better separate the signal from the noise amidst massive amounts of data provided by inspection tools,\u201d said Keith Wells, Group Vice President of Imaging and Process Control at Applied Materials. \u201cBy combining advanced AI algorithms with the superior speed and resolution of our innovative eBeam technology, our system enables rapid identification of the smallest defects buried deep in 3D device structures, delivering faster and more accurate inspection results that can improve factory cycle time and yield.\u201d\n\nApplied\u2019s new eBeam technology is critical for complex 3D architecture inflections required to manufacture logic chips at the 2nm node and beyond \u2013 including new Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistors \u2013 as well as the formation of higher-density DRAM and 3D NAND memories. Applied\u2019s SEMVision H20 defect review system has been adopted by leading logic and memory chipmakers for emerging technology nodes.\n\nThe new SEMVision H20 system leverages two significant innovations to classify defects with remarkable accuracy, while delivering results as much as 3X faster than today\u2019s most advanced techniques.\n\nNext-generation CFE technology : Applied\u2019s \u201ccold field emission\u201d (CFE) technology is a breakthrough in eBeam imaging that enables sub-nanometer resolution for identifying the smallest buried defects. Operating at room temperature, CFE produces a narrower beam with more electrons, thereby increasing nanoscale image resolution by up to 50 percent and imaging speed by up to 10X compared to conventional thermal field emission (TFE) technology.

As the track height in conventional standard cells scales down to 3-track standard cell, the distance in-between the BPR metal and the bottom parasitic channel is required to be 13 nm or narrower. Consequently, a strong lateral electric-field, induced by the BPR, is applied to the substrate parasitic channel, resulting in a substrate leakage current. To address this issue, various materials for barrier/liner in the BPR structure are explored and evaluated using TCAD simulation. It turned out that the BPR-induced field effect was suppressed as the dielectric constant of the barrier material and the work function of TiN liner decreased. The proposed BPR structure demonstrates the potential to mitigate device leakage current without increasing the doping concentration in substrate.\u201d\n\nFind the technical paper here.

            "content": "Predicting band gap with neural networks\n\nResearchers from Kyoto University developed a machine learning model to predict the band gap of novel semiconductor materials.\n\nUsing data from almost 2,000 semiconductor materials, the team tested six different neural networks. They found that the incorporation of conditional generative adversarial networks (CGAN) and message passing neural networks (MPNN) increased the accuracy of band gap predictions.\n\n\u201cOur model enables prediction based solely on the composition of a compound,\u201d said Katsuaki Tanabe, a professor at Kyoto University, in a statement. \u201cThe computational load of the ensemble learning model is light and can be performed within a few hours on a typical laptop PC. And we can confidently say that this method enables fast and highly accurate forecasting. We are also developing other ways of interpreting the correlation between the properties of various materials and band gaps.\u201d [1]\n\nPlasma-resistant ceramics for etching equipment\n\nResearchers from the Korea Institute of Materials Science and Pusan National University developed transparent plasma-resistant high-entropy ceramics with the potential to extend the lifespan of internal components in semiconductor etching equipment.\n\nPlasma used in the etch process gradually wears away at the equipment\u2019s ceramic components, leading to contamination. The new ceramic has an etch rate of 8 nm/h, resulting in fewer contamination particles and higher durability compared to sapphire and the plasma-resistant ceramic yttria.\n\nThe ceramic was created using a sintering process for high-density solid-state materials, resulting in a density of 99.9%. By controlling porosity, it is also capable of transmitting visible and infrared light. [2]\n\nCharge injection in mixed 2D and silicon materials\n\nResearchers from the University at Buffalo, Central South University, Shandong Normal University, Sungkyunkwan University, TU Wien, and University of Salerno found that integrating 2D materials like molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with silicon can improve device efficiency and provide control over how an electrical charge is injected and transported.\n\n\u201cThe 2D material mainly affects charge injection, or how the charge enters the material, but doesn\u2019t really affect charge collection, or how the charge exits the material,\u201d said Huamin Li, associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at UB, in a press release. \u201cThis happens regardless of the specific properties of the 2D material. So, whether you use semiconducting MoS2, semi-metal graphene or insulator h-BN (hexagonal boron nitride), they can play different roles in the charge injection, but all behave similarly when it comes to the charge collection. Essentially, the 2D material in this special condition acts almost like it\u2019s invisible or has zero resistance for collecting charge.\u201d\n\nLi anticipates that complex devices like three-terminal transistors could benefit from the approach but noted that significant challenges remain in understanding and engineering charge transport where the 2D material meets the 3D material.

In addition, the U.S. import price index rose +0.3% m/m in January, weaker than expectations of +0.4% m/m.\n\n\u201cThe consumer sentiment report showed people were getting nervous and [Friday\u2019s] weak retail sales number confirmed it. However, the resulting slack is good news for the Fed and tilts the balance a little bit more toward rate cuts,\u201d said David Russell at TradeStation.\n\nIn this holiday-shortened week, investors will be closely watching the Federal Reserve\u2019s minutes from the January 28-29 meeting, scheduled for release on Wednesday, for further indications that rate cuts remain unlikely in the foreseeable future amid expectations that inflation may remain elevated for longer. Market participants will pay particular attention to any comments on the potential inflationary impact of President Trump\u2019s proposed policies, including trade tariffs.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. rate futures have priced in a 97.5% probability of no rate change and a 2.5% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at the conclusion of the Fed\u2019s March meeting.\n\nMarket watchers will also focus on several economic data releases this week, including the U.S. S&P Global Manufacturing PMI (preliminary), the S&P Global Services PMI (preliminary), Building Permits (preliminary), Housing Starts, the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index, Initial Jobless Claims, Crude Oil Inventories, Existing Home Sales, and the University of Michigan\u2019s Consumer Sentiment Index.\n\nIn addition, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem will be making appearances this week.\n\nFourth-quarter corporate earnings season is winding down, but several notable companies are due to report this week, including Walmart WMT, Arista Networks ANET, Medtronic MDT, Analog Devices ADI, Booking BKNG, Rivian Automotive RIVN, and Occidental Petroleum OXY.\n\nToday, investors will focus on the Empire State Manufacturing Index, which is set to be released in a couple of hours. Economists, on average, forecast that the February Empire State manufacturing index will come in at -1.90, compared to -12.60 in January.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.506%, up +0.67%.\n\nThe Euro Stoxx 50 Index is down -0.05% this morning, with investors closely monitoring geopolitical developments. Chemical, technology, and real estate stocks underperformed on Tuesday. At the same time, defense stocks continued to rise. Data from the Office for National Statistics released on Tuesday showed that wages in the U.K. grew at a faster pace last quarter, while the unemployment rate unexpectedly remained unchanged, potentially complicating the case for further monetary easing by the Bank of England. Separately, final data from the statistics agency Insee showed that France\u2019s annual inflation rate was revised higher to 1.7% in January from the preliminary reading of 1.4%. In addition, the ZEW Economic Research Institute said that the gauge of economic sentiment for Germany improved to a 7-month high in February. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Europe are expected to remain a focal point for investors this week as the U.S. and Russia meet to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, with officials in Kyiv and Europe excluded from the talks. European leaders convened an emergency summit in Paris on Monday to discuss their exclusion from peace talks, agreeing to increase defense spending. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk stated that new defense funding measures are set to be presented ahead of the upcoming March 20-21 summit. In corporate news, Capgemini (CAP.FP) slumped over -8% after the French IT consulting giant posted a 1.9% drop in full-year revenue.\n\nU.K.\u2019s Average Earnings ex Bonus, U.K.\u2019s Unemployment Rate, France\u2019s CPI, Germany\u2019s ZEW Economic Sentiment Index, and Eurozone\u2019s ZEW Economic Sentiment Index were released today.\n\nU.K. Average Earnings ex Bonus stood at 5.9% in the three months to December, in line with expectations.\n\nU.K. Unemployment Rate was 4.4% in the three months to December, stronger than expectations of 4.5%.\n\nThe French January CPI came in at +0.1% m/m and +1.7% y/y, stronger than expectations of -0.1% m/m and +1.4% y/y.\n\nThe German February ZEW Economic Sentiment Index arrived at 26.0, stronger than expectations of 19.9.\n\nEurozone February ZEW Economic Sentiment Index has been reported at 24.2, weaker than expectations of 24.3.\n\nAsian stock markets today closed mixed. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed down -0.93% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed up +0.25%.\n\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index ended lower today as optimism surrounding President Xi\u2019s meeting with tech CEOs and the recent AI enthusiasm faded. Consumption and media stocks led the declines on Tuesday. At the same time, semiconductor and technology stocks outperformed. The benchmark index initially surged following a meeting between President Xi Jinping and business leaders on Monday. Xi urged the business community to \u201cshow their talent\u201d and be confident in the strength of China\u2019s model and market. Meanwhile, Zheng Bei, deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission, stated on a CCTV program broadcast on Tuesday that China\u2019s political, economic, and social environment is \u201cvery conducive\u201d to the development of the private economy and that policies will be enacted to help alleviate challenges faced by private firms. China will continue to break down investment barriers and update its negative list for market access, which limits investment in certain sectors, as soon as possible, Zheng noted. Still, investors seem to be waiting for the \u201cTwo Sessions\u201d meeting in early March to assess Beijing\u2019s economic growth plan for this year. In corporate news, Alibaba rose over +3% in Hong Kong after CCTV broadcast footage of its founder Jack Ma and President Xi shaking hands during Monday\u2019s meeting.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed slightly higher today. Financial stocks led Tuesday\u2019s gains on expectations of further interest rate hikes from the Bank of Japan after data on Monday showed that the nation\u2019s economy grew more than expected in the fourth quarter. Defense stocks also advanced after their European counterparts rose on Monday, as investors factored in the potential for increased military spending in the region. Meanwhile, Japanese government bond yields climbed to their highest levels in over a decade on Tuesday. Former BOJ official Nobuyasu Atago said he sees a possible rate hike as early as the April 30-May 1 meeting, noting that rising bond yields indicate markets are pricing in the risk of an earlier move. In corporate news, Nissan Motor gained more than +3% after the Financial Times reported that rival Honda Motor is prepared to renew merger discussions if Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida resigns. Investor attention this week centers on comments from BOJ board member Hajime Takata on Wednesday and the CPI report on Friday. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed down -2.58% to 20.00.\n\nPre-Market U.S. Stock Movers\n\nIntel INTC climbed over +5% in pre-market trading after the Wall Street Journal reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Broadcom are each exploring deals that would break up the chip giant.\n\nConstellation Brands STZ surged about +8% in pre-market trading after Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a new stake in the company.\n\nSnowflake SNOW rose more than +2% in pre-market trading after Wolfe Research upgraded the stock to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $235 price target.\n\nDelta Air Lines DAL dropped over -1% in pre-market trading after one of its jets spun out of control after landing in Toronto.\n\nToday\u2019s U.S. Earnings Spotlight: Tuesday - February 18th\n\nGrupo Aval (AVAL), Arista Networks (ANET), Medtronic (MDT), Cadence Design (CDNS), Occidental (OXY), Vulcan Materials (VMC), Baidu (BIDU), EQT (EQT), CoStar (CSGP), Devon Energy (DVN), IFF (IFF), Watsco (WSO), RB Global (RBA), Genuine Parts (GPC), Expeditors Washington (EXPD), Toll Brothers (TOL), Penumbra Inc (PEN), Shift4 Payments Inc (FOUR), Flowserve (FLS), Fluor (FLR), Celanese (CE), Halozyme (HALO), Matador (MTDR), Valmont Industries (VMI), Axsome Therapeutics Inc (AXSM), Element Solutions (ESI), Comstock Resources (CRK), Sonoco Products (SON), Franklin Electric (FELE), Magnolia Oil (MGY), Compass (COMP), Blackbaud (BLKB), TRI Pointe Homes (TPH), Genworth (GNW), Innospec (IOSP), Chemours Co (CC), iQIYI (IQ), ReNew Energy Global (RNW), Visteon (VC), Siriuspoint (SPNT), MasterBrand (MBC), GeneDx Holdings (WGS), Hillman Solutions (HLMN), Star Bulk Carriers (SBLK), Donnelley Financial Solutions (DFIN), Sandstorm Gold Ltd N (SAND), La-Z-Boy (LZB), CVR Energy (CVI), Perdoceo Education (PRDO), SSR Mining (SSRM), NeoGenomics (NEO), Ingevity (NGVT), Sapiens (SPNS), Adeia (ADEA), The Andersons (ANDE), Select Energy Services (WTTR), JBG SMITH Properties (JBGS), MFA Financial (MFA), Brookdale Senior Living (BKD), Centerspace (CSR), Bumble (BMBL), The Hackett (HCKT), BlueLinx (BXC), Brightspire Capital (BRSP), Great Lakes Dredge&Dock (GLDD), Gladstone Commercial (GOOD), TPG RE Finance (TRTX), Community Healthcare Trust Inc (CHCT), Unisys (UIS), Semler Scientifc (SMLR), Community Health Systems (CYH), Tactile Systems (TCMD), Quad Graphics (QUAD), Arteris (AIP), Safe Bulkers (SB), Truecar Inc (TRUE), Industrial Logistics Properties (ILPT), Seven Hills Realty Trust (SEVN).\n\nOn the date of publication, Oleksandr Pylypenko did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

            "content": "Applied Materials (AMAT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of chipmaking equipment have returned -11.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, which Applied Materials falls in, has gained 2.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Applied Materials is expected to post earnings of $2.32 per share, indicating a change of +11% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $9.39 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8.6%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.06 indicates a change of +7% from what Applied Materials is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Applied Materials.",

Progress and breakthroughs in this industry are expected to directly influence all subsequent technologies.\n\nGiven the industry\u2019s tailwinds, investors could consider buying fundamentally sound semiconductor stocks, Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT, ASML Holding N.V. ASML, and Photronics, Inc. PLAB, which are chasing the chip boom.\n\nThe increasing demand for discrete devices, power semiconductors, and high-power modules for various end users is expected to drive the semiconductor manufacturing equipment market growth. Therefore, the global semiconductor manufacturing equipment market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 10.6% by 2032.\n\nAdditionally, the United States has decreased its imports of semiconductors from China by 10% due to geopolitical factors, such as trade relations between the two countries. This move has prompted an expansion in domestic production supported by the U.S. CHIPS Act, which is giving out $52 billion to help boost the American semiconductor industry.\n\nConsidering these encouraging trends, let\u2019s take a look at the fundamentals of the three best Semiconductor & Wireless Chip stocks, starting with #3.\n\nStock #3: Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT)\n\nAMAT engages in the provision of manufacturing equipment, services, and software to the semiconductor, display, and related industries. The company operates through three segments: Semiconductor Systems; Applied Global Services; and Display.\n\nAMAT\u2019s trailing-12-month EBIT and levered FCF margins of 29.22% and 13.28% are 438.2% and 11.4% higher than the respective industry averages of 5.43% and 11.93%.\n\nAMAT\u2019s revenue for the first quarter that ended January 31, 2025, was reported at $7.17 billion. Its non-GAAP net income came in at $1.95 billion, up 9% from the year-ago quarter.

            "content": "Have you assessed how the international operations of Applied Materials (AMAT) performed in the quarter ended January 2025? For this maker of chipmaking equipment, possessing an expansive global footprint, parsing the trends of international revenues could be critical to gauge its financial resilience and growth prospects.\n\nIn the current global economy, which is more interconnected than ever, a company's success in penetrating international markets is crucial for its financial health and growth journey. Investors must understand a company's dependence on overseas markets, as this offers a window into the company's earnings stability, its ability to benefit from varied economic cycles and its potential for long-term growth.\n\nBeing present in foreign markets serves as protection against local economic declines and helps benefit from more rapidly expanding economies. Yet, such expansion also introduces challenges related to currency fluctuations, geopolitical uncertainties and varied market behaviors.\n\nOur review of AMAT's last quarterly performance uncovered some notable trends in the revenue contributions from its international markets, which are commonly analyzed and tracked by Wall Street experts.\n\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $7.17 billion, marking an increase of 6.8% from the year-ago quarter. We will next turn our attention to dissecting AMAT's international revenue to get a clearer picture of how significant its operations are outside its main base.\n\nUnveiling Trends in AMAT's International Revenues\n\nKorea generated $1.67 billion in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 23.26% of the total. This represented a surprise of +40.93% compared to the $1.18 billion projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, Korea accounted for $1.17 billion (16.64%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $1.23 billion (18.35%) to the total revenue.\n\nOf the total revenue, $1.18 billion came from Taiwan during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 16.51%. This represented a surprise of +12.39% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $1.05 billion to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $1.28 billion, or 18.23%, and $559 million, or 8.33%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\n\nChina accounted for 31.30% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $2.24 billion. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of -16.07%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $2.67 billion. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, China contributed $2.14 billion (30.32%) and $3 billion (44.68%) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nDuring the quarter, Europe contributed $330 million in revenue, making up 4.61% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $379.51 million, this meant a surprise of -13.05%. Looking back, Europe contributed $405 million, or 5.75%, in the previous quarter, and $410 million, or 6.11%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nJapan accounted for 7.54% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $540 million. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of -4.72%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $566.72 million. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Japan contributed $581 million (8.25%) and $565 million (8.42%) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nOf the total revenue, $286 million came from Southeast Asia during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 3.99%. This represented a surprise of -4.57% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $299.68 million to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $314 million, or 4.46%, and $186 million, or 2.77%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\n\nProspective Revenues in International Markets\n\nWall Street analysts expect Applied Materials to report a total revenue of $7.13 billion in the current fiscal quarter, which suggests an increase of 7.2% from the prior-year quarter. Revenue shares from Korea, Taiwan, China, Europe, Japan and Southeast Asia are predicted to be 16.4%, 16.6%, 36.2%, 5.2%, 7.9% and 4.6%, corresponding to amounts of $1.17 billion, $1.18 billion, $2.58 billion, $370.14 million, $565.5 million and $329.54 million, respectively.\n\nFor the full year, a total revenue of $29.1 billion is expected for the company, reflecting an increase of 7.1% from the year before. The revenues from Korea, Taiwan, China, Europe, Japan and Southeast Asia are expected to make up 16.5%, 16.1%, 35.4%, 5.3%, 8% and 4.6% of this total, corresponding to $4.79 billion, $4.69 billion, $10.3 billion, $1.54 billion, $2.32 billion and $1.33 billion respectively.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nRelying on international markets for revenues, Applied Materials faces both prospects and perils. Thus, tracking the company's international revenue trends is essential for accurately projecting its future trajectory.\n\nIn an era of growing international interdependencies and escalating geopolitical disputes, Wall Street analysts are vigilant in tracking these trends for businesses with a global reach, in order to refine their predictions of earnings. It should be noted, however, that a multitude of other elements, such as a company's domestic position, also play a significant role in shaping the earnings forecasts.\n\nHere at Zacks, we put a great deal of emphasis on a company's changing earnings outlook, as empirical research has shown that's a powerful force driving a stock's near-term price performance. Quite naturally, the correlation is positive here -- an upward revision in earnings estimates drives the stock price higher.\n\nThe Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating mechanism, demonstrates a notable performance history confirmed through external audits. It effectively utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions to act as a predictor of a stock's price performance in the near term.\n\nApplied Materials currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating that it could perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Applied Materials Inc., the largest US maker of chip-manufacturing equipment, fell after issuing a lukewarm revenue forecast for the current period, citing the risk of export controls crimping its business.\n\nSales will be about $7.1 billion in the fiscal second quarter, which runs through April, the company said in a statement Thursday. That compares with an average Wall Street estimate of $7.22 billion. Profit will be $2.30 a share, Applied Materials said, in line with projections.\n\nChief Financial Officer Brice Hill said the company was \u201ctaking into account export control related headwinds.\u201d China makes up roughly a third of the company\u2019s sales, and stricter trade curbs from the US have made it harder to sell in that country.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares were down 5.3% on Friday at $174.53. Through Thursday\u2019s close, the stock had been up 13% for the year.\n\nExport rules adopted in the final months of the Biden administration will knock about $400 million off fiscal 2025 revenue, the company said.\n\nAbout half of the reduction will come in the current period, with much of it hitting Applied Materials\u2019 service business. That\u2019s because the company will have to stop servicing equipment at some customer sites in China, Chief Executive Officer Gary Dickerson said on a conference call with analysts. In the long term, he expects its service operations to resume healthy growth.\n\nChina accounted for 31% of sales last quarter, down from 45% a year earlier. A surge in orders from Chinese memory makers hasn\u2019t continued into this year, the company said.\n\nMeanwhile, Applied Materials is enjoying high demand for the most advanced types of equipment needed for artificial intelligence components, he said. That\u2019s making up for weaker demand from makers of less complicated chips.\n\n\u201cThe biggest driver for the whole industry is AI,\u201d he said. The amount of silicon going into data centers \u2014 facilities that handle much of the AI workload \u2014 will soon surpass the level consumed by personal computers and smartphones. Those have traditionally been the two biggest markets for chipmakers.\n\nFirst-quarter profit was $2.38 a share, excluding some items, compared with an estimate of $2.28. Revenue gained 6.8% to $7.17 billion. Analysts projected $7.15 billion. The company is facing tax changes in Singapore, resulting in an expense of $644 million, or 79 cents a share, during fiscal 2025.\n\nApplied Materials\u2019 management has maintained confidence in the overall growth of the industry. The rapid spread of semiconductors to new products and the AI boom will help maintain demand, Dickerson argued. The sheer complexity of chips also has added pressure on customers to upgrade their equipment.\n\nApplied Materials\u2019 customer ranks include some of the biggest names in the chip industry, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung Electronics Co. and Intel Corp. Those manufacturers order gear well ahead of starting production, making Applied Materials\u2019 forecasts a barometer for future demand.\n\n(Adds Friday share move in fourth paragraph)\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com",

            "content": "APPLIED Materials, the largest US maker of chip-manufacturing equipment, fell after issuing a lukewarm revenue forecast for the current period, citing the risk of export controls crimping its business.\n\nSales will be about US$7.1 billion in the fiscal second quarter, which runs to April, the company said on Thursday (Feb 13). That compares with an average Wall Street estimate of US$7.22 billion. Profit will be US$2.30 a share, Applied Materials said, in line with projections.\n\nChief financial officer Brice Hill said the company was \u201ctaking into account export control related headwinds\u201d. China makes up roughly a third of the company\u2019s sales, and stricter trade curbs from the US have made it harder to sell in that country.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares were down 5.3 per cent on Friday at US$174.53. Till Thursday\u2019s close, the stock had been up 13 per cent for the year.\n\nExport rules adopted in the final months of the Biden administration will knock about US$400 million off fiscal 2025 revenue, the company said.\n\nAbout half of the reduction will come in the current period, with much of it hitting Applied Materials\u2019 service business. That\u2019s because the company will have to stop servicing equipment at some customer sites in China, chief executive officer Gary Dickerson said on a conference call with analysts. In the long term, he expects its service operations to resume healthy growth.\n\nBT in your inbox Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox. Sign Up Sign Up\n\nChina accounted for 31 per cent of sales last quarter, down from 45 per cent a year earlier. A surge in orders from Chinese memory makers has not continued into this year, the company said.\n\nMeanwhile, Applied Materials is enjoying high demand for the most advanced types of equipment needed for artificial intelligence (AI) components, he said. That\u2019s making up for weaker demand from makers of less complicated chips.\n\n\u201cThe biggest driver for the whole industry is AI,\u201d he said. The amount of silicon going into data centres \u2013 facilities that handle much of the AI workload \u2013 will soon surpass the level consumed by personal computers and smartphones. Those have traditionally been the two biggest markets for chipmakers.\n\nFirst-quarter profit was US$2.38 a share, excluding some items, compared with an estimate of US$2.28. Revenue gained 6.8 per cent to US$7.17 billion. Analysts projected US$7.15 billion. The company is facing tax changes in Singapore, resulting in an expense of US$644 million, or 79 US cents a share, during fiscal 2025.\n\nApplied Materials\u2019 management has maintained confidence in the overall growth of the industry. The rapid spread of semiconductors to new products and the AI boom will help maintain demand, Dickerson argued. The sheer complexity of chips also has added pressure on customers to upgrade their equipment.\n\nApplied Materials\u2019 customer ranks include some of the biggest names in the chip industry, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Samsung Electronics and Intel. Those manufacturers order gear well ahead of starting production, making Applied Materials\u2019 forecasts a barometer for future demand. BLOOMBERG",

Reported EPS is $2.38, expectations were $2.28.\n\nOperator: Welcome to the Applied Materials First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Afterwards, there will be a question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Liz Morali, Vice President of Investor Relations. Liz, you may begin.\n\nLiz Morali: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for today\u2019s call. With me today are Gary Dickerson, President and CEO, and Brice Hill, CFO. Before we continue, let me remind you that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including predictions, estimates, projections, or other statements about future events. Actual results may differ materially from those mentioned in these forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is discussed in our most recent Form 10-K and 8-K filing with the SEC. We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements. During today\u2019s call, we will also reference non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nReconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today\u2019s earnings press release in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on our Investor Relations website at ir.appliedmaterials.com. I will now turn the call over to Gary.\n\nGary Dickerson: Thanks, Liz. In our first fiscal quarter of 2025, Applied Materials delivered record revenues surpassing the prior high we set last quarter. The major technology trends reshaping the global economy are made possible by advanced semiconductors, underpinning long-term secular growth for the industry and especially Applied Materials. We are providing our customers a unique and connected portfolio of solutions to accelerate the technology roadmap, positioning us for continued growth and outperformance in the years to come. In my prepared remarks, I\u2019ll share our latest market insight, I\u2019ll describe how our innovations are enabling the major device architecture inflections that are critical to advancing energy-efficient AI, and I\u2019ll talk about why high-velocity co-innovation is more important than ever as the industry races to bring next-generation technology to consumers faster and at lower cost.\n\nStarting with the market, AI remains central to our outlook. With almost infinite possible uses, AI is the most transformative technology change of our lifetimes and a major catalyst for innovation and growth across the technology sector. Early deployment of AI supported approximately 20% year-on-year growth of global semiconductor sales in 2024, and the market remains on track to exceed $1 trillion of annual revenues by 2030. We\u2019re only at the beginning of what\u2019s possible. And as we look ahead, we expect disruptive innovations to significantly improve the energy efficiency and cost of AI, opening up new applications and growing the overall market opportunity. To unlock this potential, innovation is required across the technology stack from the models and software, as we\u2019ve seen in recent weeks with DeepSeq, to data center architecture, chip design, and how those chips are made.\n\nAdvancements in foundational semiconductor technologies will have a dramatic impact on system-level energy and cost reduction in the AI data center. I\u2019ve previously described four critical areas the industry is currently focusing on: leading-edge logic, high-performance DRAM, DRAM stacking referred to as high bandwidth memory or HBM, and advanced packaging to connect the logic and memory chips together in an integrated package. There\u2019s also a fifth theme emerging, as we are seeing major innovations in power electronics. These innovations can address data transfer energy consumption within the data center as well as significantly reduce grid-to-data center power losses. Applied has strong leadership in all these areas, and we\u2019re best positioned at future device architecture inflections including next-generation gate-all-around transistors, backside power delivery, 4F squared, and 3D DRAM.\n\nAdvanced packaging, compound semiconductors for power electronics, and silicon photonics. These device architecture inflections in logic, compute memory, packaging, and power devices grow the market for wafer fab equipment, increase the relative mix of materials engineering technologies, and provide opportunities for Applied to gain market share. Taking leading-edge foundry logic as an example, the transition from the most advanced generation of FinFET to the first nodes with integrated gate-all-around and backside power delivery grows our total available market by more than 15% to around $14 billion for every 100,000 wafer starts per month of capacity. At the same time, we expect related Applied revenues to grow in the 30% range for the equivalent wafer fab capacity.\n\nWhile the bulk of spending for these inflections is ahead of us, we are already seeing a positive impact on our business. In 2024, we believe we outperformed the market in aggregate across leading-edge foundry logic, DRAM, advanced packaging, and the ICAPS markets outside of China. The ability of US companies to serve the China market is constrained and has been further limited by updated trade rules announced in December and January. We estimate the incremental impact of these new rules will be around $400 million of revenue in fiscal 2025, approximately half of which is service revenue. We also see China being a smaller portion of global wafer fab equipment spending in 2025. At Applied Materials, our strategy is to develop and commercialize the most enabling technologies for the industry across leading-edge logic, memory, advanced packaging, and ICAPS.\n\nWe have focused our investments on these high-growth inflections that allow us to create and capture more value. One of the ways we are implementing our strategy is to provide our customers unique and connected solutions that take advantage of our broad portfolio of technologies, capabilities, and partnerships. Our co-optimized and integrated solutions address higher-value device challenges for customers and are difficult for competitors to replicate. A good example is our integrated hybrid bonding interconnect solution that combines six technologies, including one module from a partner, into a single integrated system. In the past quarter, we successfully completed important qualification milestones and received volume orders from multiple leading-edge customers.\n\nOur integrated hybrid bonding system is one of our next-generation solutions that is allowing us to extend our leadership in advanced packaging. In 2024, our packaging business captured more than half of the market we serve, and we remain on track to double our revenues over the next several years. Another key pillar of our strategy is high-velocity co-innovation. We believe this is key for Applied and our customers to bring next-generation technology to market faster and at lower cost. By speeding up cycles of learning through tighter ecosystem collaborations, we are accelerating new chip architectures, driving higher mutual success rates, and optimizing R&D efficiencies. Among our accomplishments in the past quarter, we launched our EPYC advanced packaging strategy at a technical summit we hosted in Singapore that brought together R&D leaders representing more than 20 global companies.\n\nWe were part of two teams that received CHIPS Act grants to develop advanced packaging substrates for 3D integration. We are leading the team for silicon substrates, and we have a long-term partnership and investment in the company that won the grant for glass core packaging. We made significant progress with the construction of the EPIC Center in Silicon Valley, which is on track to come online in 2026 and will become the centerpiece of our global EPIC collaboration platform. And we partnered with TPG to transition Applied Thin Film Battery business into an independent company. We\u2019re also evolving our collaborative model and services where we are helping customers manage increasing complexity in their business as they ramp next-generation technology into high-volume manufacturing.\n\nWe are deploying our advanced service products, including our Actionable Insight Accelerator data platform or AIX, to help accelerate customers\u2019 R&D programs, reduce technology transfer times, and optimize device performance, yield, output, and cost in their fabs. Through these closer working relationships, a high percentage of our service revenues is generated from subscriptions in the form of multiyear agreements. While our near-term service growth is negatively impacted by trade restrictions, we remain confident that we will still grow AGS at a low double-digit annualized growth rate over the longer term. Before I hand over to Brice, I\u2019ll quickly summarize. As major technology trends reshape the global economy in the semiconductor industry, Applied continues to deliver strong financial performance in the near term.\n\nWe are best positioned at major device architecture inflections in fast-growing areas of the market that are critical to energy-efficient AI, and we are focused on high-velocity co-innovation with our customers and partners to bring breakthrough technology to market faster than ever before. Brice?\n\nBrice Hill: Thanks, Gary. And thank you to everyone joining us for today\u2019s call. We had a strong start to the fiscal year, with healthy revenue growth and meaningful margin expansion, which helped drive a 12% year-over-year increase in non-GAAP earnings per share. In addition, we distributed $1.6 billion to shareholders with $1.3 billion of share repurchases and $326 million of dividends. For fiscal Q1, our results were largely in line with our expectations with total net sales of approximately $7.2 billion, up 7% year over year with growth in both semiconductor systems and applied global services. Non-GAAP gross margin was 48.9%, up 100 basis points year over year and our highest quarterly gross margin since fiscal year 2000.\n\nThe strong margin performance in Q1 was the result of a very favorable mix and increasing adoption of our leading-edge technologies and advanced integrated systems. In addition, we progressed on our value-based pricing initiatives and cost reductions. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.31 billion with increased R&D investments to support our technology growth areas. Non-GAAP EPS was a record $2.38, up 12% year over year given the revenue growth, better profitability, and share repurchases. Moving to the segments, semiconductor system sales were $5.36 billion for Q1, up 9% year over year driven by 20% growth in foundry logic, partially offset by an expected decline in DRAM sales as prior year sales to customers in China did not repeat. Non-GAAP operating margin of 37.3% was up 160 basis points year over year.\n\nSales for the ICAPS nodes, which serve customers across the IoT, communications, automotive, power, and sensor markets, were down slightly year over year, flat quarter over quarter. Moving to applied global services, AGS delivered revenue of $1.59 billion in Q1, up 8% year over year with healthy growth in services partially offset by a decline in sales of 200-millimeter equipment. Non-GAAP operating margin of 28% was down 30 basis points year over year. Lastly, our display business delivered revenue of $183 million. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flows, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $6.3 billion and debt of $6.3 billion. Cash from operations in the quarter was $925 million, capital expenditures were $381 million, and free cash flow was $544 million.\n\nWe distributed $1.6 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $326 million in dividends. As of the end of the quarter, approximately $7.6 billion remains available under our share repurchase authorization. Turning to our outlook, we are seeing strong momentum for leading-edge foundry logic where we are particularly well positioned as our customers ramp the most advanced technology nodes with gate-all-around transistors into high-volume manufacturing. Offsetting leading edge is a more measured level of investment in the ICAPS nodes following strong spending in 2023 and 2024. In DRAM, we are seeing healthy demand but face tough year-over-year comparisons given the purchases from Chinese customers in 2024 that do not repeat this year.\n\nWe are also seeing growth in NAND, albeit from historically low levels. As Gary mentioned, as a result of the expanded export controls announced in December and January, we expect to face a headwind to revenue of approximately $400 million in fiscal 2025. Nearly half of that impact will be in Q2. The impacts in the second half of the fiscal year will be more weighted to AGS as we are no longer able to service certain customers, and following the step down in revenue in Q2, we would anticipate a return to growth in Q3 for AGS. Based on these trade restrictions and our view of our business, for Q2, we expect that China as a percentage of total revenue will be about five percentage points lower than in Q1. This is below the normalized level of approximately 30%.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account for fiscal Q2, we expect total revenue of $7.1 billion, plus or minus $400 million, which represents a 7% increase year over year, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.30, plus or minus $0.18, which represents a 10% increase year over year. We expect semiconductor systems revenue of approximately $5.3 billion, up 8% year over year, AGS revenue of approximately $1.55 billion, up 1% year over year, and display revenue of approximately $250 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.3 billion. We are modeling a tax rate of approximately 13%. In closing, our business is strong, and we remain confident in our growth opportunities across all of our business segments. We are making significant investments in R&D to grow our share at the leading edge, and we are increasing our capital investments to be the leader in high-velocity co-innovation with our customers.\n\nThis is an important indicator of the confidence we have in the growth, and with our differentiated technology, unique insights, and deep industry relationships, we are poised to benefit from the technology transitions and semiconductor growth that is expected over the coming years. Liz, we\u2019re now ready to begin the Q&A.\n\nLiz Morali: Thanks, Bryce. To help us reach as many people as we can on today\u2019s call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have an additional question, please re-queue, and we\u2019ll do our best to come back to you later in the session.\n\nQ&A Session\n\nFollow Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ:AMAT) Follow Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ:AMAT) or Subscribe with Google We may use your email to send marketing emails about our services. Click here to read our privacy policy.\n\nOperator: And our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.\n\nToshiya Hari: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. I know you guys aren\u2019t or haven\u2019t been giving specific WFE numbers, but at a high level, Gary and or Bryce, I was hoping you could provide a little bit of context on how you\u2019re thinking about the year. I know you gave a couple of comments, but by application, by geography, you know, how is 2025 likely to shape up in your view and more importantly, your outperformance vis-a-vis the market, you know, where key drivers that we should be focused on and if you could speak to the magnitude of outperformance relative to what you achieved in 2024, that would be really helpful. Thank you.\n\nBrice Hill: Okay. Thanks, Toshiya. Nice to hear from you. So first, we\u2019d say that, you know, our Q2 guide gives a really good indication. So leading edge with all the strength that you see in AI and, you know, pulling DRAM, advanced logic, and HBM. That factors into what we see in the market today. So leading edge is growing. We\u2019ve been thinking it will be accelerating through the course of the year, and we do see that growing strongly in Q2. And we highlighted that we\u2019ve also been watching the ICAP market after the significant build-out the last couple of years in China. And that is lower in Q2. So those things offset consistent year-over-year growth in the overall market. So that\u2019s the big change from a market perspective.\n\nIf you look at the memory side, our memory is roughly flat quarter over quarter. We do see some additions on the NAND side, and that\u2019s offset by a slight reduction in DRAM. NAND\u2019s growing, but, of course, that\u2019s from a smaller level. The last thing I would share is when you think about advanced packaging, we had a significant amount of capacity adds last year in the HBM side for the initial burst of capacity. And we\u2019re still, you know, selling into HBM, still adding equipment into that market, but it\u2019s at a slower rate. So that\u2019s part of the outlook also. So the key thing there is we\u2019ve all been waiting to see if Advanced Logic would ramp strongly enough to offset any slower rate of investment in ICAPS, and that is what we\u2019re seeing in Q2, and that\u2019s, you know, our best what we try to do is share what we\u2019re seeing today, and we think that\u2019s our best indication on how you can think about the year at this point.\n\nGary Dickerson: Yeah. Toshiya, relative to the outperformance questions. Over the last four years, including last year, we outperformed in aggregate across leading-edge foundry logic, DRAM, high bandwidth memory, advanced packaging, and ICAPS markets outside of China. And we\u2019ve been talking about this a lot. We\u2019re focused on major device architecture inflections critical to AI energy-efficient computing. When we\u2019re meeting with all of our customers, that\u2019s where they\u2019re all focused. So, you know, for us, we\u2019re on track to capture greater than 50% share of our served market in gate-all-around and backside power and foundry logic. We gained 10 points of DRAM share, and we\u2019re positioned to gain share as 4F squared and 3D DRAM architectures are adopted.\n\nPackaging was around $1.7 billion in 2024, up 3x in four years. And as we\u2019ve said many times, we\u2019re positioned to double this business in the coming years. In ICAPS, we gained several points of share since we formed the group six years ago. We brought several new products to market. We have a strong pipeline of new products that will grow our available market and position us well in this segment. And materials engineering intensity, where Applied has clear leadership, is increasing in next-generation chip architectures. So, you know, going forward, I like how we\u2019re positioned to win these major inflections. Again, we\u2019ve been outperforming in all of these segments over the last four years, and we\u2019re well-positioned to continue to outperform going forward.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Your question, please.\n\nAtif Malik: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Bryce, I appreciate the color on the April quarter. The still consistent down a little bit explained by the China impact. And you\u2019re talking about the return to growth in AGS. Can you also comment on the silicon systems? Do they return to sequential growth in the July quarter, or will we have to wait and see?\n\nBrice Hill: Yeah. Thanks, Atif. I think we\u2019ll have to wait and see on the semiconductor systems, but what we\u2019re sharing is we\u2019ve been expecting the leading edge to accelerate. When you think about the gate-all-around and backside power nodes in the market and the advantages of those nodes for leading-edge architectures, we expect a significant amount of capacity to be put in place in those nodes, and that is what you see in Q2. And we expect that, you know, that is a good indication of where the market will be going. And then on the offset for that, we highlighted the ICAPS, and we\u2019ve been watching that, but I\u2019ll just say that market. Our forecast for ICAPS and for ICAPS China seems to change every single quarter. And so we\u2019ll see how that evolves through the rest of the year.\n\nAnd then on the services business, yes, this will be similar to 2022 when there were new trade rules. We\u2019ll have a step back, as you can see in our guide in Q2, but we expect to grow from there at the low double-digit rate as we continue to add new types of services, and the new customers and new locations will make it more likely that the services business is utilized by the customers.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.\n\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. You said that the China impact in the second half will be weighted to AGS, but you also said AGS returns to growth in Q3. So, like, how do I square that circle on what\u2019s offsetting the China impact in the second half? And just, like, broadly, if I were to add the $200 million-ish or so that AGS is getting hit by the China sanctions, if you added that $200 million back in, would it still grow double digits this year?\n\nBrice Hill: Yes. That\u2019s a good question. Thank you, Stacy, for the question. So on the AGS side, the way to think about it is approximately half of the impact will be taken in Q2, and then it\u2019ll be a continued impact in the following quarters. But we don\u2019t expect it to be a sequential reconciling line item. In other words, whatever business we can\u2019t support in Q2, that\u2019s the same business or less in Q3 and Q4. So there is an impact in Q3 and Q4, but we think you shouldn\u2019t worry about it from a modeling perspective. We\u2019ll just begin to add from there, and we\u2019ll grow at the rate that we\u2019ve described, you know, low double digits as we continue to add installed base and tools to support. And then, didn\u2019t do the calculation. I guess what I would say is from a core AGS perspective, if you take the 200-millimeter out, we\u2019re absolutely growing at low double digits or higher.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.\n\nCJ Muse: Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you could speak a bit to gross margins. You talked about base pricing starting to come in in the January quarter. Would love to hear more about, you know, how you see that going through the model throughout all of calendar 2025. And I guess as part of that, how should we be thinking about kind of evolving mix in terms of modeling gross margin either first half, second half, or kind of exit rate for calendar 2025 would be very helpful.\n\nBrice Hill: Okay. Thank you, CJ. Good to hear from you. So on the gross margin, 48.9% and 48.4% in our guide in Q2, very strong mix. In both quarters, obviously, with the China impacts for Q2, it\u2019s a little bit lesser mix strength. We\u2019re still going to reiterate our 48% underlying rate. So we think, you know, when we don\u2019t have those quarters with ultra-strong mix, that\u2019s still about the ballpark for our normalized rate. So think in the second half that unless we maintain the exact same mix, which we likely don\u2019t expect, we will be closer to that 48% gross margin for the year or not for the year. Sorry. We\u2019re not giving a guide for the year, but that is our underlying baseline rate to think of as you think about where the business is normally.\n\nAnd then if you think about the pricing, you know, there I think of two dynamics with pricing. One, the solutions that we\u2019re developing that Gary has pointed the company toward, those are increasingly valuable solutions for the customers. And so there\u2019s an increasing value proposition for the equipment itself. Then our pricing mechanism is to make sure that we\u2019re including that in our thinking with respect to the pricing, and we also have a disciplined infrastructure to have those discussions with customers. So as we allocate our R&D, we\u2019re, of course, allocating to the areas that we think are most valuable in the market. And we think, you know, it\u2019s a matter of execution to achieve that value in the marketplace, which is what we\u2019re trying to do.\n\nSo I said third inning last quarter on the process for pricing, and I think that\u2019s still accurate.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question, please.\n\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I actually had a longer-term conceptual question for Gary related to LIDHO versus HNEP intensity. You know, if let\u2019s say overall WFE intensity stays around mid-teens, it means WFE will grow in line with semiconductor industry sales over the next several years. And if that happens, do you think, Gary, LIDHO takes more share, or do you think edge or depth take more share and hence grow faster or slower than overall semiconductor industry sales? I\u2019ve heard arguments on both sides, but would appreciate your thoughts.\n\nGary Dickerson: Oh, hi, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So if I look at the major inflections that we\u2019re focused on, leading-edge foundry logic, gate-all-around, and backside power, you know, our customers have talked about being able to achieve and backside power 30% area scaling benefit, but beyond power and performance benefits, with really no change in feature size. So, you know, that\u2019s basically what we\u2019re seeing in foundry logic. And we think that continues going forward. In DRAM, if you look at what our customers have talked about in 4F squared, they also talk about significant area savings as they implement that new architecture. And, of course, again, for all of these things, we\u2019re incredibly well-positioned. And then we get to 3D DRAM.\n\n3D DRAM is more similar, not the same materials, but a similar impact where the relative spending for materials engineering goes up significantly versus lithography. And then, of course, another area that we\u2019re focused on and the entire industry is focused on is advanced packaging. And, you know, when we look at what the AI servers look like three or four years from now, the architectures are going to be very different. And the way the data is connected in those architectures, there\u2019s just going to be tremendous innovation again around materials innovation. So when I look across any of these different markets, and, of course, ICAPS is really all driven through materials innovation, we\u2019ve talked about this before in our master classes. We see the percentage of materials engineering relative spending to be increasing going forward around all of these different architecture inflections.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS Securities. Your question, please.\n\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Bryce, do you think as you look at, you know, I know that you\u2019re not gonna give us a WFE number for last year, but do you think you gained WFE share? That\u2019s the first question. And then how do you kind of assess, Gary, headwind from these, you know, from these, you know, incumbent companies in China because I know that they have delayed rev rec, so it makes it hard to sort of, you know, measure year to year. But they\u2019re about 5% now of WFE. It\u2019s up, like, 400 basis points over the past four to five years, and that\u2019s all definition. You know, you\u2019ve done a, you know, great job, you know, holding share and gaining share. But how do you sort of think about that headwind from China? Because so much of the income model spending is from there. Thanks.\n\nBrice Hill: Okay, Tim. Nice to hear from you. Thank you. On the share in 2024, of course, we don\u2019t know yet in terms of the final measures there, but you heard in Gary\u2019s script, he talked about, we think we\u2019ve gained share in all the markets except for, likely China. So we\u2019ll just have to see what the, you know, what that reading is once all the share numbers are in. So we feel well-positioned from that perspective. And even in China, we feel good about the way we compete. It\u2019s just, yes, the local Chinese vendors have some advantages with the trade rules that have been put in place. And then on the headwinds for China, I think, you know, we do have lower visibility, but we continue to add customers. And, you know, we think that\u2019s a huge market.\n\nIt\u2019s our largest ICAPS market, and ICAPS is the largest market for Applied. We expect that to grow over time, you know, at the device level, mid to high single digits, as you know. The equipment investments in the last couple of years have been ahead of the market, so we\u2019ve expected it to moderate for some period of time. So we\u2019ll see how that plays out. But for us, that continues to be one of the most important markets for the company.\n\nGary Dickerson: Yeah. Tim, just so I would add, and again, I talked about this a little bit earlier. Leading-edge foundry logic, we\u2019re incredibly well-positioned for those inflections. DRAM, we\u2019ve gained 10 points of share. And again, really well-positioned for 4F squared and 3D DRAM. Bandwidth memory, you know, that\u2019s another one where we have a very strong leading position. And advanced packaging is another area where it\u2019s up 3x in four years, and we anticipate that we\u2019ll double that business. And then that\u2019ll keep going into the future. And again, we\u2019re just really well-positioned for all those inflections. In ICAPS, we have room to grow in PDC and H, and we have momentum in those segments. And I talked earlier about the pipeline of ICAPS innovations.\n\nAgain, we formed this group six years ago. We brought 20 new products to market, and we have new products in the pipeline that will expand our total available market. We have new products for cost-competitive applications, and we have innovations to enable new ICAPS device architectures that we\u2019re co-innovating with leading customers. So as Bryce said, in the areas where we can compete, I feel really good about our positions and our pipeline going forward.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question, please.\n\nHarlan Sur: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You know, we track many of your end customers in the semiconductor industry, both fabulous and IDMs, and two nanometers. Design starts appear to be we\u2019re tracking their design starts, especially at accelerating since the second half of last year, especially in areas like AI, accelerated compute, mobile. Is the team in talking with your customers, is the team getting a sense on how big the upcoming two-nanometer node transition and more importantly, volume production potential could be relative to three nanometer?\n\nBrice Hill: Hi, Harlan. Gary might also add on to this. You know, I\u2019ve seen various estimates for two nanometers based on the performance benefits of two nanometers. I think we\u2019re expecting that to be a large node. If you look at some of the third-party estimates, you know, that should be a good landing spot for designs just like seven nanometers in the past was a good landing spot for designs. So we\u2019re expecting it to be, you know, on the large side from a node perspective.\n\nGary Dickerson: Yeah. Harlan, I would just add that, you know, everybody\u2019s focused on energy-efficient computing for AI, and if you look at what our customers are saying, they\u2019re very bullish about the size of that two-nanometer node.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question, please.\n\nKrish Sankar: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Gary, I had a question on gate-all-around. You\u2019ve spoken about getting over 50% share of the incremental TAM there. It seems like the Epi stack is one of the more critical ones, and your Epi taxi competitor seems to be making some strides. I\u2019m just kinda curious. Can you talk a little bit about your IP market share and if you still feel confident in the 50% share gain of the overall gate-all-around opportunity? Thank you.\n\nGary Dickerson: Yeah. I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re in deep partnerships with all of our customers focused around this concept of high-velocity co-innovation. And, you know, we\u2019re working with every one of our customers out a decade into the future on multiple technology nodes. For gate-all-around, we still are on track to do what we had talked about earlier with gaining more than 50% of the incremental spending for gate-all-around, and Epi is part of that. We\u2019re in a very strong position. I think 85% of those Epi steps are selective Epi where we have tremendous strength. We have new innovations we\u2019re bringing to market in Epi, and so we still feel very confident in our outperformance going forward.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question, please.\n\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. My question is on China. I think, Bryce, you said for Q2 outlook, you use the word, you know, China will be below normal in terms of percentage exposure. I would think that the export restrictions, those are permanent. I\u2019m just curious as to when you say below normal, are you expecting China to recover to, like, 30% level that you previously communicated? And then when do you think we might get to that level? And then maybe for Gary. Gary, you know, for over the last 90 days, excluding the export restrictions, can you talk to, you know, how the demand conditions are within China?\n\nBrice Hill: Okay. Thanks, Srini. So first of all, 30%, we still think will be a good long-term rate for us or a good long-term estimate of the share to China. You know, when you think about the market, of course, for us now, that\u2019s an ICAPS market. We can\u2019t serve the leading edge. That will be a growing market over time. The devices will grow mid to high single digits, if not more, heading to, you know, the one helping to get to the $1.3 trillion semiconductor market by 2030. So that market will continue to grow. We may pause a little bit less. We may have a little bit lower rate of investment as we go, you know, through the next short period of time, will that adjust? But that\u2019s a very strong market for us. So 26% in Q2 and 30% is a good estimate for the company, and, of course, that includes all of our businesses, AGS, and display also. And then, Gary, on what we\u2019re seeing with respect to demand.\n\nGary Dickerson: Yeah. I think I\u2019ll just make a comment on that. It\u2019s still our largest market. So you see leading edge accelerating, but ICAPS is still our largest market, and China is, you know, the largest country inside that market. And so when you\u2019re thinking about it and you\u2019re thinking about what we\u2019re describing as a step back in the rate of investment, you should still think about it as just, you know, a very large opportunity and growth opportunity going forward. And so we think the rate slows down a little bit after two huge years of investment. But we expect that market to grow over time. We\u2019ve continued to add customers. We\u2019re tracking a large number of projects that are underway. We expect capacity to be added every single year, and, you know, that forms the backbone of our expectations.\n\nGary Dickerson: Yeah. The one thing I would add is that, you know, we believe that the ICAPS market over the longer term will grow kinda mid to high single digits. And as I mentioned earlier, we have new products in the pipeline that expand our total available market, new products for cost-competitive segments, and opportunities to grow in large segments where we have momentum. So I think, you know, longer term, we\u2019re positive on the market and positive on our position in the market.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel. Your question, please.\n\nBrian Chin: Hi there. Good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a few questions or maybe one question. Maybe for Bryce, I think you previously disclosed that $549 million reduction in backlog for the fiscal year in a filing. You\u2019re quantifying a $400 million impact for the year. Did you revise what that actual impact would be, or is there some maybe a residual amount of $149 million that sits outside of the 12-month horizon?\n\nBrice Hill: You\u2019ve got it exactly right, Brian. So it\u2019s not much of a change. That $549 million was our backlog, and it covered, you know, more than just the year. And so we shared, I think, what was in the 12 months, and if you did that math, I think it was about $380 million. So we\u2019re still very close in terms of what we\u2019re thinking the impact is for the year.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\n\nJoe Quatrochi: Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your expectations for DRAM growth. If we were to exclude just the benefit of China DRAM spending in the comparison a year ago, how should we think about the growth in your business this year?\n\nBrice Hill: Yeah. Thanks, Joe. I\u2019ll start on this one. I think we\u2019ve seen, you know, two record years of DRAM. And, of course, 2024 was buoyed by the extra China demand that we saw in, you know, I can\u2019t call the year here, but we see the rate of investment in DRAM continuing in the rest of the world. So there\u2019s a lot of pull, you know, for the HBM solution, and there\u2019s a lot of pull in for DRAM in the advanced, you know, compute performance systems. So I would expect continued momentum in DRAM, and that\u2019s included in our outlook in Q2.\n\nGary Dickerson: Yeah. Joe, I would just say that I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re more bullish on compute memory than we are in storage memory. And then what our customers have said is it takes three times the number of wafers to produce the same number of bits for HBM. So that\u2019s gonna certainly help the growth rate over the longer term.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Charles Shi from Needham and Company. Your question, please.\n\nCharles Shi: Hi. Yes. Good afternoon. I have a question about the expected revenue from gate-all-around nodes. You previously said more than $2.5 billion in fiscal, I mean, in probably calendar 2024, and they expect to double that number? And has the 2025 number moved up or down or any changes? Maybe the other part of the question, I think, that you previously said, last year\u2019s gate-all-around revenue plus this year is kinda implies a 100k global capacity built on two nanometers by the end of this year. Do you see potentially that that gate-all-around spending could actually accelerate further into 2026? Because we were trying to think about what the end capacity could be in 2026, but do you wanna get your early thoughts on 2026 if possible? Thank you.\n\nBrice Hill: Okay, Charles. Thanks for the question. So first thing, yes, we have not changed our expectations for growth looking into 2025 with the gate-all-around related equipment. So $2.5 billion in 2024 and then the opportunity to double that in 2025. And if you put those together, you know, that\u2019s just over $7 billion. And when we describe the SAM for us with gate-all-around and backside power, yeah, you can back in and say that implies that there\u2019s approximately 100,000 wafer starts of, you know, pilot in HBM or HVM, excuse me, high-volume manufacturing capacity being put in place in the beginning. And then, of course, you know, you\u2019ll have to do your own research to see what size you think the node would be. I would just suggest that nodes are generally larger than that. So we would expect that to continue and the ramp to continue beyond 2025 for sure.\n\nGary Dickerson: I would say the one thing incrementally is that as you go forward, you\u2019re going to add in backside power. That also is growing our available market, and we have a very strong share there. So once you have gate-all-around and backside power together, our opportunity grows significantly.\n\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.\n\nChris Caso: Yes. Thank you. Good evening. I guess the question is regarding sort of where your level of confidence is in your customer forecast right now. And I know you haven\u2019t given us guidance for the full year obviously, but I know the customers have generally given you pretty good visibility on the forecast. Maybe you could talk about the different segments, and you sound, you know, pretty constructive with regard to foundry logic spending for the year. Your comments suggested that ICAP, the forecasts have been changing a lot, so I\u2019d imagine that there\u2019s some uncertainty there. Perhaps you could speak in those terms for the different segments.\n\nBrice Hill: Sure. Thanks for the question, Chris. So I think, you know, I would put the level of confidence for larger customers is fairly high. So especially since COVID and, you know, the inflation events that we saw, we\u2019ve asked for longer perspectives from all of our customers. So we have more visibility with the larger customers. So if you think about leading logic, more visibility, certainly for DRAM, certainly for NAND. And then I would split up ICAPS. It would be the same sort of observation for the more mature, longer-standing companies in the ICAPS space. Good visibility, same practices. And then just much less experience there on both sides. And the visibility gets lower, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve seen a lot of volatility in our forecast.\n\nI think in the past couple of years, we\u2019ve continually increased our China forecast as we\u2019ve gone through the year. And so you just have less visibility, and the plans change as that goes forward. And then just a last comment, you know, thinking about foundry logic, because there\u2019s lots of questions about the various foundries. Our perspective there is, not only do we have the market expectations, and so, you know, we think we\u2019re pretty comfortable with our forecast for leading logic being driven by, you know, data center, PC, smartphone, and understanding what the end demand is for those markets. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And as a reminder, if you have a question at this time, our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your question, please.\n\nVijay Rakesh: Yeah. Hi. Just a question on the packaging side. I know packaging is gonna be one of the more important and on the memory side. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s a way to look at what the mix of, you know, just packaging was of total WFE. If we were to look at 2025 and how you see that mix of WFE growing as packaging becomes a bigger and bigger chunk of both memory and logic. Thanks.\n\nBrice Hill: I\u2019ll try, Vijay. We said last year that in 2024 that our packaging-related revenues in advanced packaging were $1.7 billion. And so, you know, that we have an advantage share in that space. So you probably have to do some backward math to imply what packaging is. And it\u2019s growing at a strong rate. I think just thinking about the, you know, what\u2019s behind that, we all know that there\u2019s, Gary calls it a race for performance on these leading-edge systems. Getting the highest utilization out of GPUs, CPUs, accelerators, etcetera. And that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the increased demand for these packaging technologies. So we expect that to grow significantly over the coming years.\n\nGary Dickerson: Yeah. Vijay, we also talked about doubling again our packaging revenue over the next few years. There\u2019s just tremendous innovation happening in this space. We talked about CHIPS grants on new substrate technologies for silicon and glass. How you connect the AI server and that architecture in three or four years is gonna be very different than what it looks like today. So, you know, I believe this is a great opportunity for Applied where the leader in wiring on the front of the wafer, back of the wafer, and in advanced packaging. And this segment is going to see a significant compound annual growth rate because it\u2019s so important for energy-efficient computing.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna. Your question, please.\n\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. One question, two parts. Based on the last, okay, the SSG backlog of $8.3 billion down 23% year over year. And then AGS backlog of $6.8 billion up 32%. When do you expect backlog for SSG to show the inflection point and show growth? And on the AGS, the $200 million that is gonna come out because of the restriction in China, that seems a very small part of the AGS backlog. Is that a reflection of, yeah, the AGS backlog is the multi-year or any color you can add here would be great.\n\nBrice Hill: Yes, Mehdi. Thanks for the question. You\u2019ve got it right on the AGS. We\u2019ve got multi-year contracts in AGS that tend to make that backlog look, you know, larger and your book-to-bill look much larger when we sign those contracts. So the average contract life, I think, is in the 2.9-year region, and we\u2019re signing some that are longer than that. So that really is what distorts the, you know, the backlog or makes it larger for AGS. And then on the equipment side, you know, since the supply chain and COVID, on the equipment side. So we stopped reporting that on a quarterly basis because it\u2019s not a very good indication of our, you know, the underlying business changes. We\u2019re working to get longer visibility with our customers, and we\u2019re working to get longer commits on the builds. And so there\u2019s a lot of movement in that. So I wouldn\u2019t have anything to share other than what you\u2019ve seen in our 10-K.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Schultz Milander from Redburn Atlantic. Your question, please.\n\nTim Schultz Milander: Yeah. Hi there. Thanks very much for taking my question. Maybe one for Gary and one for Bryce, please. Gary, you mentioned advanced packaging and you referenced volume orders from multiple leading-edge customers. Maybe could you share a little bit of color in terms of what kind of device applications they are and when you\u2019d expect volume manufacturing to begin? And then, Bryce, just a modeling question. On that tax asset revaluation. Could you maybe just provide a little more color on that? And is there any read across or implication for the remaining $2.4 billion of deferred tax assets on the balance sheet? Thank you.\n\nGary Dickerson: Yeah. Tim, relative to packaging revenue, it\u2019s really coming from all of the different packaging architectures. We have a very strong position, broad, unique connected portfolio. So, you know, I wouldn\u2019t say that again, for us, including in HBM or we were at $700 million in revenue this last year. We have strength across all of those different architecture types. I don\u2019t really wanna comment. I\u2019ll let customers comment on, you know, which architecture is ramping. I would say, as I mentioned earlier, there\u2019s going to be tremendous innovation in this space with very different architectures than what are in the market today. This is gonna be very important for energy-efficient computing. Applied has been investing to be positioned to win those architecture inflections.\n\nBrice Hill: Okay. And then, Tim, thanks for the tax question. So, yeah, good to point out that on our GAAP net income, you\u2019ll see a significant difference. And what is happening there, it\u2019s one of those situations where good news is bad news. So we\u2019ve just renewed our incentive rates in Singapore, and so the tax asset that we have in Singapore that, you know, was created years and years ago when we moved assets to Singapore, that is essentially less valuable because it will protect from lower taxes, if that makes sense. So our tax rate goes down, which is good news. And then the asset that you have to protect from taxes is a little bit less valuable than what it was with higher tax rates. And so that $674 million, I think that number is a revaluation of that tax asset.\n\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t look, you know, we\u2019re amortizing the benefits of that tax move of years to go. That\u2019s always in our reconciliation, but this particular event that we\u2019re talking about, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any look forward on that.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And as a reminder, if you do have a question, please press star one one on your phone. And this does conclude the question and answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to Bryce for any further remarks.\n\nBrice Hill: Thank you. To recap, we believe we\u2019re well-positioned for leading-edge technology inflections, together with our efforts to accelerate industry collaboration, set us up to benefit from the semiconductor growth as expected over the coming years. Thank you for attending today. And, Liz, please close the call.\n\nLiz Morali: Thank you, Bryce. And thank you to everyone for joining the call today. A replay of today\u2019s call will be available on the Investor Relations website by 5 PM Pacific time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.\n\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today\u2019s call. Conference. This does conclude the program.

We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Applied Materials\n\nIf a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Applied Materials paid out just 21% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. The good news is it paid out just 21% of its free cash flow in the last year.\n\nIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nNasdaqGS:AMAT Historic Dividend February 15th 2025\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nStocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That's why it's comforting to see Applied Materials's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 22% per annum for the past five years. Applied Materials earnings per share have been sprinting ahead like the Road Runner at a track and field day; scarcely stopping even for a cheeky \"beep-beep\". We also like that it is reinvesting most of its profits in its business.'",

            "content": "Why Applied Materials (AMAT) Shares Are Getting Obliterated Today\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nShares of semiconductor machinery manufacturer Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) fell 6.8% in the afternoon session after the company reported mixed fourth quarter results: Its revenue guidance for next quarter slightly missed and its inventory levels slightly increased. The company also acknowledged \"export control-related headwinds\" during its earnings release, highlighting the significance of the recent trade war and tariffs on its business and likely raising further concern among cautious investors.\n\nOn the other hand, Applied Materials beat analysts' EPS expectations and its adjusted operating income outperformed Wall Street's estimates. Overall, this was a softer quarter.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $169.20, down 8.2% from previous close.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Applied Materials? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nApplied Materials\u2019s shares are quite volatile and have had 19 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 12 months ago when the stock gained 13% on the news that the company reported strong fourth-quarter results that exceeded analysts' revenue and EPS expectations, which is especially impressive given how many semis companies missed and talked about macro headwinds this earnings season. Free cash flow also improved significantly from the previous quarter. Revenue guidance for the next quarter also came in ahead of consensus.\n\nManagement highlighted some of the drivers of the strong outlook. Firstly, the AGS (applied global services) segment, which grew 8% during the quarter and stands at a $6 billion annual run rate, has the potential to achieve double-digit growth in the coming quarters. Also, the DRAM business continued to contribute strongly to the semiconductor systems segment as the company continued to gain market share.\n\nUnderpinning the company's growth thesis for the coming quarters are three broad assumptions. 1.) A semiconductor market growing faster than GDP 2.) An equipment market growing even faster than the semiconductor market 3.) AMAT's equipment business outgrowing the market.\n\nApplied Materials is up 3.6% since the beginning of the year, but at $169.66 per share, it is still trading 33.5% below its 52-week high of $254.97 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Applied Materials\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,539.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.",

As of 2:15 p.m. ET, Applied Materials stock was down 6% and is now down more than 30% from its high.\n\nGuidance came in lighter than expected\n\nApplied Materials' equipment enables semiconductor manufacturing. And in Q1, the company's revenue of $7.17 billion hit management's guidance square on the nose. Moreover, its Q1 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were ahead of guidance, growing 12% year over year to $2.38. So there weren't really any problems in the Q1 numbers.\n\nFor the upcoming second quarter, Applied Materials expects revenue of $7.1 billion. While that would be up on a year-over-year basis, investors had hoped for more. There isn't a demand problem but rather an export problem. New trade restrictions represent a $400 million headwind for fiscal 2025, with half of this coming in the second quarter, according to management.\n\nIn other words, investors are resizing the opportunity with Applied Materials stock based on real changes in macroeconomic conditions.\n\nThis could be a buying opportunity\n\nApplied Materials is an important company in the semiconductor space. Generally speaking, it's hard to see long-term demand going anywhere but up. Historically, the stock price has pulled back just prior to stagnation in revenue growth and profits -- given the complexities of the changing landscape in 2025, that could be what we're seeing here.\n\nThis does present a headwind. But Applied Materials can push past the headwind over the long haul, thanks to its position in a resilient and growing space. Therefore, this stock could be worth buying in the coming year, especially as the valuation becomes more attractive. But investors will need to take a long-term view and look past a potentially bumpy ride.",

            "content": "Key Takeaways Shares of Applied Materials declined on Friday after the company's sales projections outweighed a first-quarter earnings beat.\n\nSales and adjusted profits each came in better than expected for the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nThe company also said it expects recent export limits to China will negatively impact sales by about $400 million in fiscal 2025.\n\nShares of Applied Materials fell Friday morning after the company's projections for current quarter sales left room for disappointment.\n\nApplied Materials' (AMAT) results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 came in after the bell Thursday, with the company's reported $7.17 billion in revenue and $2.38 in adjusted earnings per share\u2014each topping estimates.\n\nDespite the estimate-topping quarter, the maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment said its sales could be negatively impacted by recent limitations on exports. The company said it expects second-quarter revenue of $7.1 billion, roughly in line with the $7.16 billion analyst consensus, though the company set the sales range at $400 million above or below that midpoint.\n\nApplied Materials Predicts Export Limits Will Hurt China Sales\n\n\"The ability of U.S. companies to serve the China market is constrained and has been further limited by updated trade rules announced in December and January,\" CEO Gary Dickerson said in Thursday's earnings call. Dickerson said the company expects to face a headwind of about $400 million in sales in fiscal 2025 because of the new rules, according to a transcript of prepared remarks published ahead of the earnings call.\n\nIn December, the U.S. government announced new restrictions on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and software, citing possible military and national security concerns.\n\nSales in China were $2.24 billion in the quarter, nearly a third of the company's total revenue compared to $3 billion in sales for 45% of revenue the same time last year. China sales also declined last quarter, after analysts had said a slowdown in demand for certain tech hardware products in China could affect Applied Materials and other companies.\n\nApplied Materials shares were down more than 5% Friday morning.",

            "content": "Applied Materials expects tepid Q2\n\nBloomberg\n\n\n\n\n\nApplied Materials Inc, the largest US maker of chip-manufacturing equipment, on Thursday gave a lukewarm revenue forecast for the current period, citing the risk of export controls crimping its business.\n\nSales would be about US$7.1 billion in the fiscal second quarter, which runs through April, the company said in a statement.\n\nThat compares with an average Wall Street estimate of US$7.22 billion.\n\nA smartphone on a motherboard displays Applied Materials\u2019 logo in an arranged photograph taken on March 6, 2023. Photo: Reuters\n\nProfit per shares would be US$2.30, Applied Materials said, in line with projections.\n\nApplied Materials chief financial officer Brice Hill said the company was \u201ctaking into account export control related headwinds.\u201d\n\nChina makes up about one-third of the company\u2019s sales and stricter trade curbs from the US have made it harder to sell in that nation.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares fell about 5 percent in extended trading following the announcement. They had earlier closed at US$184.27, up 13 percent this year.\n\nExport rules adopted in the final months of the administration of former US president Joe Biden would knock about US$400 million off revenue this fiscal year, the company said.\n\nAbout half of the reduction would come in the current period, with much of it hitting Applied Materials\u2019 service business.\n\nThat is because the company would have to stop servicing equipment at some customer sites in China, Applied Materials chief executive officer Gary Dickerson said on a conference call with analysts.\n\nIn the long term, Dickerson said he expects the company\u2019s service operations to resume healthy growth.\n\nChina accounted for 31 percent of sales last quarter, down from 45 percent a year earlier.\n\nA surge in orders from Chinese memorychip makers has not continued into this year, the company said.\n\nMeanwhile, Applied Materials is enjoying high demand for the most advanced types of equipment needed for artificial intelligence (AI) components, Dickerson said.\n\nThat is making up for weaker demand from makers of less complicated chips, he said.\n\n\u201cThe biggest driver for the whole industry is AI,\u201d he said.\n\nThe amount of silicon going into data centers \u2014 facilities that handle much of the AI workload \u2014 will soon surpass the level consumed by personal computers and smartphones.\n\nThose have traditionally been the two biggest markets for chipmakers.\n\nFirst-quarter profit was US$2.38 per share, excluding some items, compared with an estimate of US$2.28. Revenue gained 6.8 percent to US$7.17 billion. Analysts projected US$7.15 billion.\n\nThe company is facing tax changes in Singapore, resulting in an expense of US$644 million, or US$0.79 per share during this fiscal year.\n\nApplied Materials\u2019 management has maintained confidence in the overall growth of the industry.\n\nThe rapid spread of semiconductors to new products and the AI boom would help maintain demand, Dickerson said.\n\nThe sheer complexity of chips has also added pressure on customers to upgrade their equipment, he said.\n\nCustomers of Applied Materials include some of the biggest names in the chip industry, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (\u53f0\u7a4d\u96fb), Samsung Electronics Co and Intel Corp. Those manufacturers order gear well ahead of starting production, making Applied Materials\u2019 forecasts a barometer for demand.",

            "content": "Applied Materials, Inc. ((AMAT)) has held its Q1 earnings call. Read on for the main highlights of the call.\n\nThe recent earnings call of Applied Materials, Inc. reflected a generally positive sentiment, highlighting record-breaking revenue and growth, significant advancements in AI and packaging, and substantial shareholder returns. Despite these successes, the company faces challenges such as trade restrictions with China and a decline in DRAM sales. The company\u2019s strong innovation and market positioning were emphasized, although geopolitical and market-specific challenges were noted as potential headwinds.\n\nRecord-Breaking Revenue and Growth\n\nApplied Materials achieved record revenues in Q1 FY2025, surpassing the previous high set last quarter. The company reported total net sales of approximately $7.2 billion, marking a 7% increase year over year, showcasing its robust growth trajectory.\n\nStrong Performance in Leading-Edge Foundry Logic\n\nThe company experienced a 20% growth in foundry logic, which propelled semiconductor system sales to $5.36 billion for Q1, reflecting a 9% year-over-year increase. This indicates a strong demand for leading-edge foundry logic solutions.\n\nAdvanced Packaging and AI Innovations\n\nApplied Materials captured more than half of the advanced packaging market and is on track to double its revenues in this segment over the next several years. Significant innovations in energy-efficient AI solutions have been a key driver of this success.\n\nPositive Outlook for Non-GAAP Earnings\n\nThe company reported a 12% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP earnings per share, reaching a record $2.38. This growth was driven by increased revenues, improved profitability, and strategic share repurchases.\n\nIncreased Shareholder Returns\n\nIn Q1 FY2025, Applied Materials distributed $1.6 billion to shareholders, including $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $326 million in dividends, underlining its commitment to returning value to shareholders.\n\nImpact of Trade Restrictions with China\n\nThe company faces constraints in serving the China market due to updated trade rules, with an estimated $400 million revenue impact expected in fiscal 2025. This has resulted in anticipated declines in service revenue.\n\nChallenges in DRAM Sales\n\nSemiconductor system sales were partially offset by a decline in DRAM sales, as sales to Chinese customers from the previous year did not repeat, highlighting ongoing challenges in this segment.\n\nModerate Investment in ICAPS\n\nFollowing strong spending in 2023 and 2024, there has been a more measured level of investment in the ICAPS nodes, leading to a decline in sales for this segment as the company adjusts its strategy.\n\nForward-Looking Guidance\n\nApplied Materials reported record revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, with total net sales reaching approximately $7.2 billion, a 7% year-over-year increase. Despite a $400 million revenue impact due to trade restrictions with China, the company anticipates continued growth, with Q2 revenue projected at $7.1 billion, representing another 7% year-over-year rise, and non-GAAP EPS expected at $2.30, up 10%. The company is focusing on leveraging its leadership in advanced semiconductors and materials engineering to navigate major technology inflections in AI, foundry logic, DRAM, and advanced packaging.\n\nIn summary, Applied Materials\u2019 earnings call highlighted a robust performance with record-breaking revenues and strategic advancements in AI and packaging. While challenges such as trade restrictions with China and DRAM sales persist, the company\u2019s commitment to innovation and shareholder returns remains strong. Forward-looking guidance suggests continued growth, supported by strategic investments and market leadership.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

            "content": "Semiconductor equipment giant Applied Materials (AMAT) late Thursday beat expectations for its fiscal first quarter, but offered mixed guidance for the current quarter. AMAT stock slid in extended trading.\n\nThe Santa Clara, Calif.-based company earned an adjusted $2.38 a share on sales of $7.17 billion in the quarter ended Jan. 26. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of $2.28 a share on revenue of $7.15 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Applied Materials earnings rose 12% while sales increased 7%.\n\nFor the current quarter, Applied Materials forecast adjusted earnings of $2.30 a share on revenue of $7.1 billion. That's based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street was modeling earnings of $2.29 a share on sales of $7.21 billion for the fiscal second quarter. In the same quarter last year, Applied Materials earned an adjusted $2.09 a share on sales of $6.65 billion.\n\nApplied Materials said its fiscal Q2 outlook includes the estimated impact of recently announced U.S. export regulations.\n\n\"For the second fiscal quarter, we are encouraged by the trends supporting continued customer investments to enable leading-edge technology inflections, while also taking into account export control-related headwinds,\" Chief Financial Officer Brice Hill said in a news release.\n\nApplied Materials is enabling major device architecture inflections such as the need for energy-efficient artificial intelligence computing, Chief Executive Gary Dickerson said in a statement.\n\nAMAT Stock Retreats After Report\n\nIn after-hours trading on the stock market today, AMAT stock fell more than 5% to 173.50.

I will now turn the call over to Gary.\n\nGary E. Dickerson -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director\n\nThanks, Liz. In our first fiscal quarter of 2025, Applied Materials delivered record revenue surpassing the prior high we set last quarter. The major technology trends reshaping the global economy are made possible by advanced semiconductors underpinning long-term secular growth for the industry and especially Applied Materials. We are providing our customers a unique and connected portfolio of solutions to accelerate the technology roadmap, positioning us for continued growth and outperformance in the years to come.\n\nIn my prepared remarks, I'll share our latest market insights, I'll describe how our innovations are enabling the major device architecture inflections that are critical to advancing energy efficient AI, and I'll talk about why high-velocity co-innovation is more important than ever as the industry races to bring next-generation technology to consumers faster and at lower costs. Starting with the market, AI remains central to our outlook. With almost infinite possible uses, AI is the most transformative technology change of our lifetimes and a major catalyst for innovation and growth across the technology sector. Early deployment of AI supported approximately 20% year-on-year growth of global semiconductor sales in 2024, and the market remains on track to exceed $1 trillion of annual revenues by 2030.\n\nWe are only at the beginning of what's possible. And as we look ahead, we expect disruptive to significantly improve the energy efficiency and cost of AI, opening up new applications and growing the overall market opportunity. To unlock this potential, innovation is required across the technology stack, from the models and software as we've seen in recent weeks with DeepSeek, to data center architecture, chip design, and how those chips are made. Advancements in foundational semiconductor technologies will have a dramatic impact on system level energy and cost reduction in the AI data center.\n\nI've previously described four critical areas the industry is currently focusing on: leading-edge logic, high-performance DRAM, DRAM stacking referred to as high-bandwidth memory or HBM, and advanced packaging to connect the logic and memory chips together in an integrated package. There's also a fifth theme emerging, as we are seeing major innovations in power electronics. These innovations can address data transfer energy consumption within the data center, as well as significantly reduce grid to data center power losses. Applied has strong leadership in all these areas, and we're best positioned at future device architecture inflections, including next-generation gate-all-around transistors, backside power delivery, 4F2 and 3D DRAM, advanced packaging, compound semiconductors for power electronics, and silicon photonics.\n\nThese device architecture inflections in logic, compute memory, packaging, and power devices grow the market for wafer fab equipment, increase the relative mix of materials engineering technologies, and provide opportunities for Applied to gain market share. Taking leading-edge foundry-logic as an example, the transition from the most advanced generation of FinFET to the first nodes with integrated gate-all-around and backside power delivery grows our total available market by more than 15% to around $14 billion for every 100,000 wafer starts per month of capacity. At the same time, we expect related Applied revenues to grow in the 30% range for the equivalent wafer fab capacity. While the bulk of spending for these inflections is ahead of us, we are already seeing a positive impact on our business.\n\nIn 2024, we believe we outperformed the market in aggregate across leading-edge foundry-logic, DRAM, advanced packaging, and the ICAPS markets outside of China. The ability of U.S. companies to serve the China market is constrained and has been further limited by updated trade rules announced in December and January. We estimate the incremental impact of these new rules will be around $400 million of revenue in fiscal 2025, approximately half of which is service revenue.\n\nWe also see China being a smaller portion of global wafer fab equipment spending in 2025. At Applied Materials, our strategy is to develop and commercialize the most enabling technologies for the industry across leading-edge logic, memory, advanced packaging, and ICAPS. We have focused our investments on these high-growth inflections that allow us to create and capture more value. One of the ways we are implementing our strategy is to provide our customers unique and connected solutions that take advantage of our broad portfolio of technologies, capabilities, and partnerships.\n\nOur co-optimized and integrated solutions address higher-value device challenges for customers and are difficult for competitors to replicate. A good example is our integrated hybrid bonding interconnect solution that combines six technologies, including one module from a partner into a single integrated system. In the past quarter, we successfully completed important qualification milestones and received volume orders from multiple leading-edge customers. Our integrated hybrid bonding system is one of our next-generation solutions that is allowing us to extend our leadership in advanced packaging.\n\nIn 2024, our packaging business captured more than half of the market we serve, and we remain on track to double our revenues over the next several years. Another key pillar of our strategy is high-velocity co-innovation. We believe this is key for Applied and our customers to bring next-generation technology to market faster and at lower cost. By speeding up cycles of learning through tighter ecosystem collaborations, we are accelerating new chip architectures, driving higher mutual success rates, and optimizing R&D efficiencies.\n\nAmong our accomplishments in the past quarter, we launched our EPIC Advanced Packaging strategy at a technical summit we hosted in Singapore that brought together R&D leaders representing more than 20 global companies. We were part of two teams that received CHIPS Act grants to develop advanced packaging substrates for 3D integration. We are leading the team for silicon substrates, and we have a long-term partnership and investment in the company that won the grant for glass core packaging. We made significant progress with the construction of the EPIC Center in Silicon Valley, which is on track to come online in 2026 and will become the centerpiece of our global EPIC collaboration platform.\n\nAnd we partnered with TPG to transition Applied's thin film battery business into an independent company. We're also evolving our collaborative model and services where we are helping customers manage increasing complexity in their business as they ramp next-generation technology into high-volume manufacturing. We are deploying our advanced service products, including our actionable insight accelerator data platform, or AIX, to help accelerate customers' R&D programs, reduce technology transfer times, and optimize device performance yield, output, and cost in their fab. Through these closer working relationships, a high percentage of our service revenues is generated from subscriptions in the form of multiyear agreements.\n\nWhile our near-term service growth is negatively impacted by trade restrictions, we remain confident that we will still grow AGS at a low double-digit annualized growth rate over the longer term. Before I hand over to Brice, I'll quickly summarize. As major technology trends reshape the global economy in the semiconductor industry, Applied continues to deliver strong financial performance in the near term. We are best positioned at major device architecture inflections in fast-growing areas of the market that are critical to energy-efficient AI, and we're focused on high velocity co-innovation with our customers and partners to bring breakthrough technology to market faster than ever before.\n\nBrice?\n\nBrice Hill -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Global Information Services\n\nThanks, Gary, and thank you to everyone joining us for today's call. We had a strong start to the fiscal year with healthy revenue growth and meaningful margin expansion which helped drive a 12% year-over-year increase in non-GAAP earnings per share. In addition, we distributed $1.6 billion to shareholders with $1.3 billion of share repurchases and $326 million of dividends. For fiscal Q1, our results were largely in line with our expectations with total net sales of approximately 7.2 billion, up 7% year over year, with growth in both semiconductor systems and Applied Global Services.\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin was 48.9%, up 100 basis points year over year and our highest quarterly gross margins since fiscal year 2000. The strong margin performance in Q1 was the result of a very favorable mix and increasing adoption of our leading-edge technologies and advanced integrated systems. In addition, we progressed on our value-based pricing initiatives and cost reductions. Non-GAP operating expenses were 1.31 billion with increased R&D investments to support our technology growth areas.\n\nNon-GAAP EPS was a record $2.38, up 12% year over year, given the revenue growth, better profitability, and share repurchases. Moving to the segments. Semiconductor system sales were 5.36 billion for Q1, up 9% year over year, driven by 20% growth in foundry-logic, partially offset by an expected decline in DRAM sales as prior-year sales to customers in China did not repeat. Non-GAAP operating margin of 37.3% was up 160 basis points year over year.\n\nSales for the ICAPS nodes, which serve customers across the IOT, communications, automotive, power, and sensor markets, were down slightly year over year and flat quarter over quarter. Moving to Applied Global Services. AGS delivered revenue of $1.59 billion in Q1, up 8% year over year, with healthy growth in services partially offset by a decline in sales of 200-millimeter equipment. The non-GAAP operating margin of 28% was down 30 basis points year over year.\n\nLastly, our display business delivered revenue of $183 million. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $6.3 billion and debt of $6.3 billion. Cash from operations in the quarter was 925 million, capital expenditures were 381 million, and free cash flow was 544 million.\n\nWe distributed 1.6 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including 1.3 billion in share repurchases and 326 million in dividends. As of the end of the quarter, approximately 7.6 billion remains available under our share repurchase authorization. Turning to our outlook, we are seeing strong momentum for leading-edge foundry-logic, where we are particularly well-positioned as our customers ramp the most advanced technology nodes with gate-all-around transistors into high-volume manufacturing. Offsetting leading-edge is a more measured level of investment in the ICAPS nodes, following strong spending in '23 and '24.\n\nIn DRAM, we are seeing healthy demand but face tough year-over-year compares, given the purchases from Chinese customers in 2024 that do not repeat this year. We are also seeing growth in NAND, albeit from historically low levels. As Gary mentioned, as a result of the expanded export controls announced in December and January, we expect to face a headwind of revenue of approximately $400 million in fiscal 2025. Nearly half of that impact will be in Q2.\n\nThe impacts in the second half of the fiscal year will be more weighted to AGS as we are no longer able to service certain customers. And following the step-down in revenue in Q2, we would anticipate a return to growth in Q3 for AGS. Based on these trade restrictions and our view of our business, for Q2, we expect that China as a percentage of total revenue will be about 5 percentage points lower than in Q1. This is below the normalized level of approximately 30%.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account for fiscal Q2, we expect total revenue of $7.1 billion, plus or minus 400 million, which represents a 7% increase year over year and non-GAAP EPS of $2.30, plus or minus $0.18, which represents a 10% increase year over year. We expect semiconductor systems revenue approximately $5.3 billion, up 8% year over year; AGS revenue of approximately $1.55 billion, up 1% year over year; and display revenue approximately $250 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 48.4% and non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.3 billion. We are modeling a tax rate of approximately 13%.\n\nIn closing, our business is strong, and we remain confident in our growth opportunities across all of our business segments. We are making significant investments in R&D to grow our share at the leading-edge, and we are increasing our capital investments to be the leader in high-velocity co-innovation with our customers. This is an important indicator of the confidence we have in the growth trajectory of our business. And with our differentiated technology, unique insights, and deep industry relationships, we are poised to benefit from the technology transitions and semiconductor growth that is expected over the coming years.\n\nLiz, we're now ready to begin the Q&A.\n\nLiz Morali -- Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Brice. To help us reach as many people as we can on today's call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have an additional question, please requeue, and we'll do our best to come back to you later in the session.\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.\n\nToshiya Hari -- Analyst\n\nHi. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. I know you guys aren't or haven't been giving specific WFE numbers.\n\nBut at a high level, Gary and/or Brice, I was hoping you could provide a little bit of context on how you're thinking about the year. I know you gave a couple comments. But by application, by geography, you know, how is 2025 likely to shape up in your view? And more importantly, your outperformance vis-a-vis the market, you know, what are some of the key drivers we should be focused on? And if you can speak to the magnitude of outperformance relative to what you achieved in '24, that would be really helpful. Thank you.\n\nBrice Hill -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Global Information Services\n\nOK, thanks Toshiya, nice to hear from you. So, first, we'd say that, you know, our Q2 guide gives a really good indication of how we think the market is evolving. So, leading-edge with all the strength that you see in AI and, you know, pulling DRAM, advanced logic, and HBM, that factors into what we see in the market today. So, leading-edge is growing.\n\nWe've been thinking it will be accelerating through the course of the year, and we do see that growing strongly in Q2. And we highlighted that we've also been watching the ICAPS market after the significant build out the last couple of years in China, and that is lower in Q2. So, those things offset, but you see on total that we still have, you know, consistent year-over-year growth in the overall market. So, that's the big change from a market perspective.\n\nIf you look at the memory side, our memory is roughly flat quarter over quarter. We do see some additions on the NAND side, and that's offset by a slight reduction in DRAM. NAND's growing, but, of course, that's from a smaller level. And the last thing I would share is when you think about advanced packaging, we had a significant amount of capacity adds last year in the HBM side for the initial burst of capacity.\n\nAnd we're still, you know, selling into HBM, still adding equipment into that market, but it's at a slower rate. So, that's part of the outlook also. So, the key thing there is we've all been waiting to see if advanced logic would ramp strongly enough to offset any slower rate of investment in ICAPS, and that is what we're seeing in Q2. And that's, you know, our best.\n\nWhat we try to do is share what we're seeing today. And we think that's our best indication on how you can think about the year at this point.\n\nGary E. Dickerson -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director\n\nYeah, Toshiya, relative to the outperformance questions, over the last four years, including last year, we outperformed an aggregate across leading-edge foundry-logic, DRAM, high-bandwidth memory, advanced packaging, and ICAPS markets outside of China. And we've been talking about this a lot. We're focused on major device architecture inflections critical to AI energy efficient computing. When we're meeting with all of our customers, that's where they're all focused.\n\nFor us, we're on track to capture greater than 50% share of our serve market and gate-all-around and backside power and foundry-logic. We gained 10 points of DRAM share, and we're positioned to gain share as 4F2 and 3D DRAM architectures are adopted. Packaging was around 1.7 billion in 2024, up 3X in four years. And as we've said many times, we're positioned to double this business in the coming years.\n\nIn ICAPS, we gained several points of share since we formed the group six years ago. We brought several new products to market. We have a strong pipeline of new products that will grow our available market and position us well in this segment. And materials engineering intensity where Applied has clear leadership is increasing in next-generation chip architectures.\n\nSo, you know, going forward, I like how we're positioned to win these major inflections. Again, we've been outperforming in all of the segment of last four years, and we're well-positioned to continue to outperform going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Your question, please.\n\nAtif Malik -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my question. Brice, I appreciate the color on the April quarter. The silicon system is down a little bit explained by the China impact.\n\nAnd you're talking about the return to growth in AGS. Can you also comment on the silicon systems? Do they return to sequential growth in the July quarter, or we'll have to wait and see?\n\nBrice Hill -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Global Information Services\n\nYeah, thanks, Atif. I think we'll have to wait and see on the semiconductor systems. But what we're sharing is we've been expecting the leading-edge to accelerate. When you think about the gate-all-around and backside power nodes in the market and the advantages of those nodes for leading-edge architectures, we expect a significant amount of capacity to be put in place in those nodes.\n\nAnd that is what you see in Q2. And we expect that, you know, that is a good indication of where the market will be going. And then, on the offset for that, we highlighted the ICAPS, and we've been watching that. But I'll just say that market continues to evolve.\n\nOur forecast for ICAPS and for ICAPS China seems to change every single quarter. And so, we'll see how that evolves through the rest of the year. And then, on the services business, yes, this will be similar to 2022 when there were new trade rules. We'll have a step-back as you can see in our guide in Q2, but we expect to grow from there at the low double-digit rate as we continue to add customers, add new types of services.\n\nAnd the new customers and new locations will make it more likely the services business is utilized by the customers.\n\nAtif Malik -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please. Hi, guys.\n\nStacy Rasgon -- Analyst\n\nThanks for taking my question. You said that the China impact in the second half will be weighted to AGS, but you also said AGS returns to growth in Q3. So, how do I square that circle? What's offsetting the China impact in the second half? And just like broadly, if I were to add the 200 million-ish or so that that AGS is getting hit by the China sanctions, if we added that 200 million back in, would it still grow double digits this year?\n\nBrice Hill -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Global Information Services\n\nYes, that's a good question. Thank you, Stacy, for the question. So, on the AGS side, the way to think about it is approximately half of the impact will be taken in Q2, and then it'll be a continued impact in the following quarters, but we don't expect it to be a sequential reconciling line item. In other words, whatever business we can't support in Q2, that's the same business or less in Q3 and Q4.\n\nSo, there is an impact in Q3 and Q4, but we think you shouldn't worry about it from a modeling perspective. We'll just begin to add from there, and we'll grow at the rate that we've described, you know, low double digits as we continue to add installed base and tools to support. And then, didn't do the calculation. I guess what I would say is from a core AGS perspective, if you take the 200 millimeter out, we're absolutely growing at low double digits or higher.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.\n\nC.J. Muse -- Analyst\n\nYeah, thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you could speak a bit to gross margins. You talked about value-based pricing starting to come in, in the January quarter. I would love to hear more about, you know, how you see that flowing through the model throughout all of calendar '25.\n\nAnd I guess as part of that, how should we be thinking about kind of evolving mix in terms of modeling gross margin? Either first half, second half, or exit rate for calendar '25 would be very helpful. Thank you.\n\nBrice Hill -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Global Information Services\n\nOK. Thank you, C.J. Good to hear from you. So, on the gross margin, 48.9 and 48.4 in our guide in Q2, very strong mix in both quarters.\n\nObviously, with the China impacts for Q2, it's a little bit lesser mix strength. We're still going to reiterate our 48% underlying rate. So, we think with -- you know, when we don't have those quarters with ultra strong mix, that's still about the ballpark for our normalized rate. So, think in the second half that unless we maintain the exact same mix, which we likely don't expect, we will be closer to that 48% gross margin for the year -- or not for the year, sorry.\n\nWe're not giving a guide for the year. But that is our underlying baseline rate to think of as you think about where the business is normally. And then, if you think about the pricing, you know, I think of two dynamics with pricing. One, the solutions that we're developing, that Gary has pointed the company toward the inflections, those are increasingly valuable solutions for the customers.\n\nAnd so, there's increasing value proposition for the equipment itself. And then, our pricing mechanism is to make sure that we're including that in our thinking with respect to the pricing, and we also have a disciplined infrastructure to have those discussions with customers. So, as we allocate our R&D, we're, of course, allocating to the areas that we think are most valuable in the market. And we think, you know, it's a matter of execution to achieve that value in the marketplace, which is what we're trying to do.\n\nSo, I said third inning last quarter on those -- on the process for pricing, and I think that's still accurate.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, and our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your question, please.\n\nVivek Arya -- Analyst\n\nThanks for taking my question. I actually had a longer-term conceptual question for Gary related to little versus edge and depth intensity. You know, let's say overall WFE intensity stays around midteens. It means WFE will grow in line with semiconductor industry sales over the next several years.\n\nAnd if that happens, do you think Gary, little takes more share? Or do you think edge or depth take more share and, hence, grow faster or slower than overall semiconductor industry sales? I've heard arguments on both sides but would appreciate your views.\n\nGary E. Dickerson -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director\n\nOh. Hi, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So, if I look at the major inflections that we're focused on going forward, if you look at leading-edge foundry-logic, gate-all-around, and backside power, you know, our customers have talked about being able to achieve in backside power 30% area scaling benefit but beyond power and performance benefits with really no change in feature size.\n\nSo, you know, that's basically what we're seeing in foundry-logic, and we think that continues going forward. In DRAM, if you look at what our customers have talked about in 4F2, they also talk about significant area savings as they implement that new architecture. And, of course, again, for all of these things, we're incredibly well-positioned. And then, we get to 3D DRAM.\n\n3D DRAM is more similar, not the same materials, but a similar impact where the relative spending for materials engineering goes up significantly versus lithography. And, of course, another area that we're focused on and the entire industry is focused on is advanced packaging. And, you know, when we look at what the AI servers look like three or four years from now, the architectures are going to be very different. And the way the data is connected in those architectures, there's just going to be tremendous innovation, again, around materials innovation.\n\nSo, when I look at across any of these different markets and, of course, ICAPS is really all driven through materials innovations, we've talked about this before in our master classes, we see the percentage of materials engineering relative spending to be increasing going forward around all of these different architecture inflections.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS Securities. Your question, please.\n\nTimothy Arcuri -- Analyst\n\nThanks a lot. Brice, do you think as you look at -- you know, I know that you're not going to give us a WFE number for last year, but do you think you've gained WFE share? That's the first question. And then, how do you kind of assess, Gary, the headwind from these, you know, from these, you know, equipment companies in China? Because I know that they have delayed rev rec, so it makes it hard to sort of measure year to year. But they're about 5% now of WFE.\n\nIt's up like 400 basis points over the past four to five years, and that's all depth and etch. You know, you've done a, you know, great job holding share and gaining share. But how do you sort of think about that headwind from China? Because so much of the incremental spending is from there. Thanks.\n\nBrice Hill -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Global Information Services\n\nOK, Tim. Nice to hear from you. Thank you. On the share in '24, of course, we don't know yet in terms of the final measures there, but you heard in Gary's script, he talked about, we think we've gained share in all the markets except for likely China.\n\nSo, we'll just have to see what the, you know, what that reading is once all the share numbers are in. So, we feel well-positioned from that perspective. And even in China we feel good about the way we compete. It's just yes, the local Chinese vendors have some advantages with the trade rules that have been put in place.\n\nAnd then, on the headwinds for China, I think, you know, we do have lower visibility, but we continue to add customers and we think that's a, you know, huge market. It's our largest ICAPS market. And ICAPS is the largest market for Applied. And we expect that to grow over time, you know, at the device level mid to high single digits.\n\nAs you know, the equipment investments in the last couple of years have been ahead of the market. So, we've expected it to moderate for some period of time. So, we'll see how that plays out. But for us, that continues to be one of the most important markets for the company.\n\nGary E. Dickerson -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director\n\nYes, Tim, just I would add again, I talked about this a little bit earlier. Leading-edge foundry-logic, we're incredibly well positioned for those inflections. DRAM, we've gained 10 points of share and again, really well positioned for 4F2 and 3D DRAM. High-bandwidth memory, you know, that's another one where we have a very strong leading position.\n\nAnd advanced packaging is another area where it's up 3x in four years, and we anticipate that we'll double that business, and then that will keep going into the future. And again, we're just really well positioned for all those inflections. In ICAPS we have room to grow in PDC and etch, and we have momentum in those segments. And I talked earlier about the pipeline of ICAPS innovations.\n\nAgain, we formed this group six years ago. We brought 20 new products to market. And we have new products in the pipeline that will expand our total available market. We have new products for cost-competitive applications.\n\nAnd we have innovations to enable new ICAPS device architectures that we're co-innovating with leading customers. So, as Brice said, in the areas where we can compete, I feel really good about our positions and our pipeline going forward.\n\nTimothy Arcuri -- Analyst\n\nThanks a lot, Gary.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question please.\n\nHarlan Sur -- Analyst\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. We track many of your end customers in the semiconductor industry, both fabless and IDMs. And we're tracking their design starts, especially at 2 nanometer.\n\nDesign starts appear to be accelerating since the second half of last year, especially in areas like AI, accelerated, compute mobile. Is the team -- in talking with your customers, is the team getting a sense on how big the upcoming 2-nanometer node transition and more importantly volume production potential could be relative to 3-nanometer?\n\nBrice Hill -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Global Information Services\n\nHi, Harlan. Gary might also add on to this. I've seen various estimates for 2 nanometer based on the performance benefits of 2 nanometer. I think we're expecting that to be a large node.\n\nIf you look at some of the third-party estimates, you know, that should be a good landing spot for designs, just like 7 nanometer in the past was a good landing spot for designs. So, we're expecting it to be, you know, on the large side from a node perspective.\n\nGary E. Dickerson -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director\n\nYes, Harlan, I would just add that, everybody's focused on energy efficient computing for AI. And if you look at what our customers are saying, they're very bullish about the size of that 2-nanometer node.\n\nHarlan Sur -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question, please.\n\nKrish Sankar -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Gary, I had a question on gate-all-around. You have spoken about getting over 50% share of the incremental TAM there, but it seems like the epi stack is one of the more critical ones, and your epitaxy competitor seems to be making some strides.\n\nSo I'm just kind of curious, can you talk a little bit about your epi market share and if you still feel confident in the 50% plus share gain of the overall gate-all-around opportunity? Thank you.\n\nGary E. Dickerson -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director\n\nYeah, we're in -- as I mentioned earlier, we're in deep partnerships with all of our customers focused around this concept of high velocity co-innovation. And we're working with every one of our customers out a decade into the future on multiple technology nodes. For gate-all-around, we still are on track to do what we had talked about earlier with gaining more than 50% of the incremental spending for gate-all-around, and epi is part of that. We're in very strong position.\n\nI think 85% of those epi steps are selective epi where we have tremendous strength, we have new innovations we're bringing to market in epi, and so we still feel very confident in our outperformance going forward.\n\nKrish Sankar -- Analyst\n\nThanks, Gary.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question please.\n\nSrini Pajjuri -- Analyst\n\nThank you. My question is on China. I think Brice, you said for Q2 outlook, you used the word China will be below normal in terms of percent of exposure. I would think that the export restrictions, those are permanent.\n\nSo I'm just curious as to, when you say below normal, are you expecting China to recover to like the 30% level that you previously communicated? And then, when do you think we might get to that level? And then, maybe for Gary, Gary, you know, over the last 90 days excluding the export restrictions, can you talk to, how the demand conditions are within China? Thank you.\n\nBrice Hill -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Global Information Services\n\nOK. Thanks, Srini. So, first of all, 30% we still think will be a good long-term rate for us or a good long-term estimate of the share to China. You know, when you think about the market, of course for us now that's an ICAPS market, we can't serve the leading edge.\n\nBut that will be a growing market over time. The devices will grow mid to high single digits, if not more, heading to -- helping to get to the 1.3 -- or, yeah, $1 trillion to $1.3 trillion semiconductor market by 2030. So, that market will continue to grow. We may pause a little bit less.\n\nWe may have a little bit lower rate of investment as we go through the next short period of time will that adjust. But that's a very strong market for us. So, 26% in Q2, and 30% is a good estimate for the company. And, of course, that includes all of our businesses, AGS and display also.\n\nAnd then, Gary, on what we're seeing with respect to demand.\n\nGary E. Dickerson -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director\n\nYeah, I think I'll just make a comment on that. It's still our largest market, so you see leading-edge accelerating, but ICAPS is still our largest market. And China is the largest country inside that market. And so, when you're thinking about it, and you're thinking about what we're describing as a step-back in the rate of investment, you should still think about it as just, you know, a very large opportunity and growth opportunity going forward.\n\nAnd so, we think the rate slows down a little bit after two huge years of investment. But we expect that market to grow over time. We've continued to add customers. We're tracking a large number of projects that are underway.\n\nWe expect capacity to be added every single year. And, you know, that forms the backbone of our expectations.\n\nBrice Hill -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Global Information Services\n\nYes, the one thing I would add is that we believe that the ICAPS market over the longer term will grow kind of mid to high single digits. And as I mentioned earlier, we have new products in the pipeline that expand our total available market, new products for cost-competitive segments, and opportunities to grow in large segments where we have momentum. So, I think, you know, longer term, we're positive on the market and positive on our position in the market.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel. Your question please.\n\nBrian Chin -- Analyst\n\nHi there. Good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a few questions -- or maybe one question, maybe for Brice. I think you previously disclosed a $549 million reduction in backup for the fiscal year in a filing.\n\nAnd you're quantifying a $400 million impact for the year. Did you revise what that actual impact would be? Or is there some maybe the residual amount of 149 that sits outside of the 12-month horizon?\n\nBrice Hill -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Global Information Services\n\nYou've got it exactly right, Brian. So, it's not much of a change. That $549 was our backlog, and it covered, you know, more than just a year. And so we shared, I think, what was in the 12 months.\n\nAnd if you did that math, I think it was about $380. So, we're still very close in terms of what we're thinking the impact is for the year.\n\nBrian Chin -- Analyst\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\n\nJoe Quatrochi -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\n\nThanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your expectations for DRAM growth. If we were to exclude just the benefit of China DRAM spending in the comparison a year ago, how should we think about the growth in your business this year?\n\nBrice Hill -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Global Information Services\n\nYeah. Thanks, Joe. I'll start on this one. I think we've seen, you know, two record years of DRAM.\n\nAnd, of course, '24 was buoyed by the extra China demand that we saw. And I can't call the year here, but we see the rate of investment in DRAM continuing in the rest of the world. So, there's a lot of pull, you know, for the HBM solution, and there's a lot of pull in for DRAM in the advanced compute performance systems. So, I would expect continued momentum in DRAM, and that's included in our outlook in Q2.\n\nGary E. Dickerson -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director\n\nYes, Joe, I would just say that, as I mentioned earlier, we're more bullish on compute memory than we are in storage memory. And then, what our customers have said is it takes 3x the number of wafers to produce the same number of bits for HBM. So, that's going to certainly help the growth rate over the longer term.\n\nJoe Quatrochi -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Charles Shi from Needham and Company. Your question please.\n\nCharles Shi -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\n\nHi. Yes, good afternoon all. I have a question about the revenue, expected revenue from gate-all-around nodes. You previously said, more than 2.5 billion in fiscal -- I mean, in probably calendar 2024 and you expect it to double.\n\nHas the '25 number move up or down, or any changes to that number? And maybe the other part of the question, I think that you previously said last year's $8 on revenue plus this year kind of implies 100K global capacity built on 2-nanometer by the end of this year. Do you see potentially that gate-all-around spending can accelerate further into '26? Because we were trying to think about with the end capacity, it could be in '26, but do you want to get your early thoughts on 2026, if possible? Thank you.\n\nBrice Hill -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Global Information Services\n\nOK, Charles. Thanks for the question. So, first thing, yes, we have not changed our expectations for growth looking into 2025 with the gate-all-around related equipment, so 2.5 in '24 and then the opportunity to double that in '25. And if you put those together, you know, that's just over $7 billion.\n\nAnd when we describe the SAM for us with gate-all-around the backside power, yeah, you can back in and say that implies that there's approximately 100,000 wafer, you know, starts of pilot and HBM -- HVM, excuse me, high-volume manufacturing capacity, being put in place in the beginning. And then, of course, you'll have to do your own research to see what size you think the node would be. I would just suggest that nodes are generally larger than that, so we would expect that to continue and the ramp to continue beyond '25 for sure.\n\nGary E. Dickerson -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director\n\nYeah, I would say the one thing, incrementally, is that as you go forward, you're going to add in backside power, that also is growing our available market, and we have a very strong share there. So, once you have gate-all-around and backside power together, our opportunity grows significantly.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Your question please.\n\nChris Caso -- Analyst\n\nYes. Thank you. Good evening. I guess the question is regarding sort of where your level of confidence is in your customer forecast right now? And I know you haven't given us guidance for the full year, obviously, but I know the customers generally give you pretty good visibility on the forecast.\n\nMaybe you could talk about the different segments and you sound pretty constructive with regard to foundry-logic spending for the year. Your comments suggested that ICAPS, the forecast has been changing a lot. So, I'd imagine that there's some uncertainty there. Perhaps, you could speak in those terms for the different segments.\n\nBrice Hill -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Global Information Services\n\nSure. Thanks for the question, Chris. So, I think I would put the level of confidence for larger customers as fairly high. So, especially since COVID and the inflation events that we saw, we've asked for longer perspectives from all of our customers.\n\nSo, we have more visibility with the larger customers. So, if you think about leading logic, more visibility, certainly for DRAM, certainly for NAND. And then, I would split up ICAPS. It would be the same sort of observation for the more mature, longer-standing companies in the ICAPS space.\n\nGood visibility, same practices. And then, you know, for the long tail in ICAPS, including a lot of the customers in China, there's just more less experience there on both sides. And so, the visibility gets lower, and that's where we've seen a lot of volatility in our forecast. So, I think, in the past couple of years, we've continually increased our China forecast as we've gone through the year.\n\nSo, you have less visibility and the plans change as that goes forward. And then, just a last comment, you know, thinking about foundry-logic because there's lots of questions about the various foundries, our perspective there is not only do we have the information from the customers, but we try to also triangulate with our end market expectations. And so, we think we're pretty comfortable with our forecast for leading logic, being driven by, you know, data center, PC, smartphone and understanding what the end demand is for those markets.\n\nChris Caso -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your question please.\n\nVijay Rakesh -- Analyst\n\nYeah, hi. I just have a question on the packaging side. I know packaging is becoming more and more important and -- on the memory side. I'm just wondering if there's a way to look at what the mix of just packaging was of total WFE if you had to look at, you know, 2025 and how you see that mix of WFE growing as packaging becomes a bigger and bigger chunk of both memory and logic? Thanks.\n\nBrice Hill -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Global Information Services\n\nI'll try, Vijay. We said last year that in '24 that our packaging related revenues in advanced packaging were $1.7 billion. And so, that we have an advantaged share in that space, so you probably have to do some backward math to imply what packaging is. And it's growing at a strong rate.\n\nI think just thinking about what's behind that, we all know that there's, Gary calls it a race for performance on these leading-edge systems, getting the highest utilization out of GPUs, CPUs, accelerators, etc. And that's really what's driving the increased demand for these packaging technologies. So, we expect that to grow significantly over the coming years.\n\nGary E. Dickerson -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director\n\nYeah, Vijay. We also talked about doubling again our packaging revenue over the next few years. And there's just tremendous innovation happening in this space. We talked about chips grants on new substrate technologies for silicon and glass, how you connect the AI server and that architecture.\n\nIn three or four years, it's going to be very different than what it looks like today. So, you know, I believe this is a great opportunity for Applied. We're the leader in wiring on the front of the wafer, back of the wafer, and in advanced packaging. And this segment is going to see a significant compound annual growth rate because it's so important for energy-efficient computing.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna. Your question please.\n\nMehdi Hosseini -- Analyst\n\nYes. Thanks for taking my question. One question, two parts. Based on the last 10-K, the SSG backlog of 8.3 billion, down 23% year-over-year, and then AGS and backlog of 6.8 billion, up 32%, when do you expect backlog for SSG to show the inflection point and show growth? And on the AGS, the 200 million that is going to come out because of the restriction in China, that is a very small part of the AGS backlog.\n\nIs that a reflection of the AGS backlog in multiyear? Or any color you can have here would be great.\n\nBrice Hill -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Global Information Services\n\nYes, Mehdi, thanks for the question. You've got it right on the AGS. We've got multiyear contracts in AGS that tends to make that backlog look, you know, larger and your book-to-bill look much larger when we signed those contracts. So, the average contract life, I think, is in the 2.9-year region, and we're signing some that are longer than that.\n\nSo, that really is what distorts the backlog or makes it larger for AGS. And then, on the equipment side, you know, since the supply chain and issues related to COVID, we've been normalizing on the equipment side. So, we stopped reporting that on a quarterly basis because it's not a very good indication of the underlying business changes. We're working to get longer visibility with our customers, and we're working to get longer commits on the builds.\n\nAnd so, there's a lot of movement in that. So, I wouldn't have anything to share other than what you've seen in our 10-K.\n\nMehdi Hosseini -- Analyst\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timm Schulze-Melander from Redburn Atlantic. Your question please.\n\nTimm Schulze-Melander -- Redburn Atlantic -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Hi, there. Thanks very much for taking my question. Maybe one for Gary and one for Brice, please.\n\nGary, you mentioned advanced packaging and you referenced volume orders from multiple leading-edge customers. Maybe could you share a little bit of color in terms of what kind of device applications they are? And when you'd expect volume manufacturing to begin? And then, Brice, just a modeling question on that tax asset revaluation. Could you maybe just provide a little more color on that? And is there any real course or implication for the remaining 2.4 billion of deferred tax assets on the balance sheet? Thank you.\n\nGary E. Dickerson -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director\n\nYou know,, Tim, relative to packaging revenue, it's really coming from all of the different packaging architectures. We have a very strong position, a broad, unique connected portfolio. So, I wouldn't say that, again, for us, including an HBM where we were at 700 million in revenue this last year, we have strength across all of those different architecture types. I don't really want to comment -- I'll let customers comment on which architectures they're ramping.\n\nI would say, as I mentioned earlier, there's going to be tremendous innovation in this space with very different architectures than what are in the market today. This is going to be very important for energy-efficient computing. Applied has been investing to be positioned to win those architecture inflections.\n\nBrice Hill -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Global Information Services\n\nOK. And then, Tim, thanks for the tax question. So, yeah, good to point out that on our GAAP net income, you'll see a significant difference in the growth in our non-GAAP income. And what is happening there is one of those situations where good news is bad news.\n\nSo, we've just renewed our incentive rates in Singapore. And so the tax asset that we have in Singapore that was created years and years ago when we moved assets to Singapore, that is essentially a less valuable because it will protect from lower taxes, if that makes sense. So, our tax rate goes down, which is good news. And then, the asset that you have to protect from taxes is a little bit less valuable than what it was with higher tax rates.\n\nAnd so that 674, I think that number is a revaluation of that tax asset. And I wouldn't -- look, we're amortizing the benefit of that tax move of years to go. That's always in our reconciliation, but this particular event that we're talking about, I think there's any look forward on that.\n\nTimm Schulze-Melander -- Redburn Atlantic -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nBrice Hill -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Global Information Services\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator instructions] And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Brice for any further remarks.\n\nBrice Hill -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Global Information Services\n\nThank you. To recap, we believe we're well-positioned in both the near term and the longer term as the investments we're making in R&D for leading-edge technology inflections, together with our efforts to accelerate industry collaboration, set us up to benefit from the semiconductor growth as expected over the coming years.

            "content": "Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) Reports Q4 In Line With Expectations But Quarterly Revenue Guidance Slightly Misses Expectations\n\nSemiconductor machinery manufacturer Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) met Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q4 CY2024, with sales up 6.8% year on year to $7.17 billion. On the other hand, next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance of $7.1 billion was less impressive, coming in 0.8% below analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $2.38 per share was 3.7% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\n\nIs now the time to buy Applied Materials? Find out in our full research report.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Q4 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $7.17 billion vs analyst estimates of $7.14 billion (6.8% year-on-year growth, in line)\n\nAdjusted EPS: $2.38 vs analyst estimates of $2.30 (3.7% beat)\n\nAdjusted Operating Income: $2.19 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.13 billion (30.6% margin, 2.9% beat)\n\nRevenue Guidance for Q1 CY2025 is $7.1 billion at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $7.16 billion\n\nAdjusted EPS guidance for Q1 CY2025 is $2.30 at the midpoint, roughly in line with what analysts were expecting\n\nOperating Margin: 30.4%, up from 29.3% in the same quarter last year\n\nFree Cash Flow Margin: 7.6%, down from 31.3% in the same quarter last year\n\nInventory Days Outstanding: 136, up from 133 in the previous quarter\n\nMarket Capitalization: $147 billion\n\n\u201cThe industry drive to accelerate the development of advanced compute and more sophisticated AI is gaining momentum,\u201d said Gary Dickerson, President and CEO.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nFounded in 1967 as the first company to develop tools for other businesses in the semiconductor industry, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is the largest provider of semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment.\n\nSemiconductor Manufacturing\n\nThe semiconductor industry is driven by demand for advanced electronic products like smartphones, PCs, servers, and data storage. The need for technologies like artificial intelligence, 5G networks, and smart cars is also creating the next wave of growth for the industry. Keeping up with this dynamism requires new tools that can design, fabricate, and test chips at ever smaller sizes and more complex architectures, creating a dire need for semiconductor capital manufacturing equipment.\n\nSales Growth\n\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last five years, Applied Materials grew its sales at an impressive 13% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth surpassed the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions (which can sometimes offer opportune times to buy).",

This compares to earnings of $2.13 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.39%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of chipmaking equipment would post earnings of $2.18 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.32, delivering a surprise of 6.42%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApplied Materials , which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, posted revenues of $7.17 billion for the quarter ended January 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.18%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $6.71 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApplied Materials shares have added about 11.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.9%.\n\nWhat's Next for Applied Materials?\n\nWhile Applied Materials has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Applied Materials: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.32 on $7.3 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $9.38 on $29.3 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

            "content": "Applied Materials, Inc. is a global leader in providing innovative materials engineering solutions to the semiconductor, display, and related industries. Founded in 1967, the company's mission is to create customer value by developing technologies that enable them to build transformative products and drive their growth. With a commitment to sustainability and social responsibility, Applied Materials is dedicated to positively impacting the environment, communities, and society.\n\nApplied Materials offers a wide range of products and services that enable customers to manufacture advanced semiconductors, flat panel displays, and solar photovoltaic cells. The company's product portfolio includes chemical and physical vapor deposition equipment, etch, cleaning, and metrology. Applied Materials also provides advanced software, automation, and services to optimize the performance and efficiency of its equipment and enable customers to reduce their time-to-market and manufacturing costs.\n\nApplied Materials serves diverse semiconductor, display, and solar customers, including leading semiconductor manufacturers, foundries, memory and logic device makers, and display panel manufacturers. Some of the company's key customers include Samsung, Intel, TSMC, and Micron.\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, Applied Materials has a global presence with operations in over 20 countries. The company has a strong track record of innovation and has been recognized for its achievements and contributions to the industry. In 2020, Applied Materials was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 16th consecutive year, reflecting its commitment to sustainability and social responsibility.\n\nA seasoned management team leads Applied Materials with decades of experience in semiconductors and related industries. The company's Chief Executive Officer is Gary Dickerson, who has been with Applied Materials since 2013 and has led the company through sustained growth and innovation. Other key management team members include Brice Hill, Chief Financial Officer and Omkaram Nalamasu, Chief Technology Officer.\n\nApplied Materials has delivered strong financial performance over the past few years, driven by the growing demand for advanced semiconductor and display technologies. The company has been reporting modest increases in revenue, net income, and profit margin over the past several years.\n\nApplied Materials' valuation metrics align with its industry peers with price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios that parallel the industry. Its strong financial performance, growth prospects, and favorable industry trends support its valuation. Applied Materials' stock price has been on an upward trend over the past few years, driven by the company's strong financial performance and growth prospects. However, the company's stock price has been somewhat volatile in recent months due to global supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions.\n\nThe semiconductor industry has been experiencing strong growth in recent years, driven by the increasing demand for advanced electronics and digitalization. However, the industry faces significant challenges, including rising geopolitical tensions, global supply chain disruptions, and regulatory pressures. Given its strong technology portfolio and established customer relationships, Applied Materials is well-positioned to capitalize on the industry's growth prospects. The company also faces intense competition from industry peers such as Lam Research and ASML.\n\nGiven the industry's strong growth prospects, many governments worldwide are investing heavily in developing their semiconductor industries to reduce reliance on imports and enhance national security. This has led to increased competition and regulatory pressures in the industry, which could impact Applied Materials' growth prospects and profitability.\n\nIn addition, the industry is subject to significant cyclical fluctuations, which can lead to sharp declines in demand and revenue. This can be particularly challenging for Applied Materials, which relies heavily on the semiconductor industry for its revenue and profits.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, Applied Materials is focused on expanding its product portfolio, diversifying its customer base, and investing in research and development to maintain its competitive edge. The company also works closely with governments and industry partners to promote open trade and reduce regulatory barriers.\n\nAnother growth opportunity for Applied Materials is its leadership in developing equipment for manufacturing OLED displays, which are used in high-end smartphones and televisions. The company's innovations in this area have helped to reduce the cost of manufacturing OLED displays and increase their performance, making them more accessible to a broader range of consumers.\n\nWhile Applied Materials is well-positioned for growth, the company faces several risks and challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry, which can lead to fluctuations in demand and revenue.

Now, a study published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces demonstrates how to convert exhaust heat into electricity. The researchers present a prototype thermoelectric generator system that could reduce fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 an opportunity for improving sustainable energy initiatives in a rapidly changing world.\n\n\n\n\n\nFuel inefficiency contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and underscores the need for innovative waste-heat recovery systems. Heat-recovery systems, called thermoelectric systems, use semiconductor materials to convert heat into electricity based on a temperature difference. However, many existing thermoelectric device designs are heavy and complex, requiring additional cooling water that\u2019s used to maintain the necessary temperature difference. Now, a team of researchers led by Wenjie Li and Bed Poudel have developed a compact thermoelectric generator system to efficiently convert exhaust waste heat from high-speed vehicles like cars, helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles into energy.\n\nWant more breaking news?

Subscribe for FREE\n\nThe researchers\u2019 new thermoelectric generator contains a semiconductor made of bismuth-telluride and uses heat exchangers (similar to those used in air conditioners) to capture heat from vehicle exhaust pipelines. The team also incorporated a piece of hardware that regulates temperature, called a heatsink. The heatsink significantly increases the temperature difference, which directly influences the system\u2019s electrical output. Their prototype achieved an output power of 40 Watts, about enough to power a lightbulb. Importantly, the results indicate that high airflow conditions, like those found in exhaust pipes, enhance efficiency, thereby increasing the system\u2019s electrical output.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn simulations mimicking high-speed environments, the waste-heat system demonstrated great versatility; their system produced up to 56 W for car-like exhaust speeds and 146 W for helicopter-like exhaust speeds, or the equivalent of five and 12 lithium-ion 18650 batteries, respectively. The researchers say their practical system can be integrated directly into existing exhaust outlets without the need for additional cooling systems. As the demand for clean energy solutions escalates, they add that this work could pave the way toward practical integration of thermoelectric devices into high-speed vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: Smriti RB, Li W, Nozariasbmarz A, et al.

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Manufacturing Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against other best manufacturing stocks to buy now.\n\nThe manufacturing sector stands as a cornerstone of the U.S. economy, significantly contributing to the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), employment, and technological innovation. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in 2023, the U.S. manufacturing sector contributed approximately $2.3 trillion to the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), accounting for about 10.2% of the total U.S. GDP. Additionally, data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) indicated that as of January 2025, the manufacturing sector employs approximately 12.76 million individuals.\n\nReshoring and Strategic Shifts:\n\nIn recent years, the sector has experienced notable trends that are reshaping its landscape. One prominent development is the movement towards reshoring\u2014the practice of bringing manufacturing operations back to the United States. Geopolitical tensions, such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, ongoing trade frictions with China, and the aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic, have exposed vulnerabilities in global supply chains, prompting companies to reconsider the risks of offshoring. The decline in China\u2019s factory activity and the country\u2019s economic slowdown have also contributed to this shift, as firms seek to reduce their dependency on a single manufacturing hub. In fact, according to a report by CNBC, mentions of \u201creshoring\u201d in the broader market\u2019s earnings transcripts surged by 128% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the previous year, outpacing even the rise in discussions about artificial intelligence.\n\nMarket Performance and Investment Trends:\n\nManufacturing stocks have shown resilience over the past year. Despite challenges like inflation and shifting interest rates, the sector has benefited from strong domestic demand and strategic investments in technology. In 2024, greater asset price dispersion across securities, sectors, and countries created strong alpha opportunities for hedge funds. This market dynamic coincided with a significant increase in corporate profits within the U.S. manufacturing sector, which experienced a five-year compound annual growth rate of 11.1%, as reported by NIST.\n\nOutlook and Future Growth Prospects:\n\nThe outlook for the U.S. manufacturing sector is cautiously optimistic. Despite ongoing challenges, a focus on innovation and supportive policies position the sector for steady growth. According to a report by Reuters, in January 2025, manufacturing expanded for the first time since 2022, with the ISM manufacturing PMI rising to 50.9\u2014the highest reading since September 2022. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best manufacturing stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we first scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of the third quarter of 2024. Our focus was on selecting manufacturing companies across various sub-sectors within the industry, including industrial equipment, automotive, aerospace, and consumer goods. From this pool of companies, we identified the 10 best manufacturing stocks and ranked them in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them at the end of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nApplied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\n\nApplied Materials Inc.

Credit: ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2025). DOI: 10.1021/acsami.4c18023\n\nCombustion engines, the engines in gas-powered cars, only use a quarter of the fuel's potential energy while the rest is lost as heat through exhaust.\n\nNow, a study published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces demonstrates how to convert exhaust heat into electricity. The researchers present a prototype thermoelectric generator system that could reduce fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions\u2014an opportunity for improving sustainable energy initiatives in a rapidly changing world.\n\nFuel inefficiency contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and underscores the need for innovative waste-heat recovery systems. Heat-recovery systems, called thermoelectric systems, use semiconductor materials to convert heat into electricity based on a temperature difference.\n\nHowever, many existing thermoelectric device designs are heavy and complex, requiring additional cooling water that's used to maintain the necessary temperature difference. Now, a team of researchers led by Wenjie Li and Bed Poudel has developed a compact thermoelectric generator system to efficiently convert exhaust waste heat from high-speed vehicles like cars, helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles into energy.\n\nThe researchers' new thermoelectric generator contains a semiconductor made of bismuth-telluride and uses heat exchangers (similar to those used in air conditioners) to capture heat from vehicle exhaust pipelines. The team also incorporated a piece of hardware that regulates temperature, called a heatsink.\n\nThe heatsink significantly increases the temperature difference, which directly influences the system's electrical output. The prototype achieved an output power of 40 watts, about enough to power a lightbulb. Importantly, the results indicate that high airflow conditions, like those found in exhaust pipes, enhance efficiency, thereby increasing the system's electrical output.\n\nIn simulations mimicking high-speed environments, the waste-heat system demonstrated great versatility; their system produced up to 56 W for car-like exhaust speeds and 146 W for helicopter-like exhaust speeds, or the equivalent of five and 12 lithium-ion 18650 batteries, respectively. The researchers say their practical system can be integrated directly into existing exhaust outlets without the need for additional cooling systems.\n\nAs the demand for clean energy solutions escalates, they add that this work could pave the way toward practical integration of thermoelectric devices into high-speed vehicles.\n\nMore information: Rabeya Bosry Smriti et al, Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting for Exhaust Waste Heat Recovery: A System Design, ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2025).

            "content": "In the last year, many Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Applied Materials\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Applied Materials\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President, Gary Dickerson, sold US$99m worth of shares at a price of US$247 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$180. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.\n\nInsiders in Applied Materials didn't buy any shares in the last year.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Applied Materials insiders own about US$359m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Applied Materials Insiders?\n\nThere haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Applied Materials, we can't say the same about the selling of shares.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2025). DOI: 10.1021/acsami.4c17606\n\nSixth-generation, or 6G, cellular networks are the next step in wireless communication, and electromagnetic terahertz waves are seen as crucial to its development. However, terahertz waves, with their higher frequency and shorter wavelength, are subject to greater interference from electromagnetic noise, making clear and secure transmission a challenge.\n\nResearchers from the University of Tokyo, as part of a multi-institution team, have now created an electromagnetic wave absorber for waves between 0.1\u20131 terahertz (THz). This greatly expands the range of the terahertz frequency which could be commercially used in the future. The ultrathin film is inexpensive, environmentally friendly and can be used outdoors, as it is resistant to heat, water, light and organic solvents.\n\nThe findings are published in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.\n\nIf you have access to a 5G network, you'll probably have noticed a dramatic difference compared to the more widely available 4G. Its low latency (the time it takes for a signal to bounce from its source to a receiver and back) means lower lag times, which is great for gamers, while download speeds of up to 20 gigabits per second (compared to 0.1 gigabits per second) and potentially 1,000 times greater data capacity opens up opportunities for smart homes and smart cities.\n\nBut this isn't the end of the road for wireless cellular technology, and developers have already been looking toward the next step\u20146G.\n\nTerahertz waves are predicted to serve as carriers for the upcoming sixth-generation networks. Recent reports on tests with terahertz waves showed data transmission speeds of up to 240 gigabits per second. However, the challenge is not only to further improve speed, latency and data capacity, but to also prevent interference and reduce noise to ensure a secure and clear signal.\n\nThat's where electromagnetic wave absorbers come in. They can inhibit the transmission or reflection of electromagnetic waves and when placed on the covers of transmitters and antennas, help to enhance communication precision.\n\nMass production of lambda-trititanium-pentoxide (\u03bb-Ti 3 O 5 ). Mass production is possible since \u03bb-Ti 3 O 5 can be synthesized on a large scale relatively easily and cost-effectively, and its surface coating can be obtained simply by mixing it with titanium dioxide nanoparticles. Credit: S. Ohkoshi, Y. Tsuzuo, M. Yoshikiyo et al, CC-BY-ND\n\nThe team including researchers at the University of Tokyo and Japanese chemical and iron-based alloy manufacturer Nippon Denko Co., Ltd., has developed the world's thinnest electromagnetic wave absorber, capable of absorbing waves in the 0.1\u20131 THz range. To date, only absorbers for waves below 0.3 THz have been made commercially available, but a frequency range beyond this is anticipated to be used for large-capacity 5G and 6G.\n\n\"This frequency range is expected to be used for various applications including wireless communications, noncontact vital monitoring systems, quality-inspection scanning systems via tomographic imaging, and security sensing for detecting hazardous materials,\" said Professor Shin-ichi Ohkoshi from the Graduate School of Science.\n\nComposed of an electrically conductive metal oxide called lambda-trititanium-pentoxide (\u03bb-Ti 3 O 5 ), insulated within a titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) coating, the absorber is made entirely of titanium and oxygen. The absorber is made in powder form, which can be turned into an ultrathin film through compression molding and then applied to surfaces as needed.\n\n\"Our strategy was to combine an electrically conductive material with an insulating material. When a terahertz wave passes through, its alternating electric field induces scattering of the electric current generated inside of the conductive material, which causes energy loss and results in the dissipation of electromagnetic energy,\" explained Ohkoshi. \"This dissipation of interfering waves enables the suppression of noise, i.e., unwanted waves, resulting in a clear signal.\"\n\nAs the film is only 48 micrometers, or microns, thick (an average human hair is around 100 micrometers) and titanium is a highly abundant element, the absorber is economical for mass production and can be used even inside compact devices. It is also resistant to heat, water, light and organic solvents, and so can be used in outdoor environments and can even withstand harsh conditions.\n\n\"The higher frequency range above 0.3 THz remains an unexplored area in materials science and I have been eager to contribute to its development,\" said Ohkoshi. \"Our next step is to further develop the terahertz absorber and work toward its practical application, so that we can contribute to a more sustainable, eco-friendly, superfast wireless future.\"\n\nMore information: Shin-ichi Ohkoshi et al, Ultrathin Terahertz-Wave Absorber Based on Inorganic Materials for 6G Wireless Communications, ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2025).

            "content": "The current occupant of the White House is dragging the US back into the dark ages, but progress marches on elsewhere in the world, and it\u2019s a big world out there. Exhibit A is a new lithium-manganese-iron-phosphate EV battery formula from the UK firm Integrals Power, aimed at contributing to the next generation of high performing, lower-costing electric vehicles.\n\nHave A Little LMFP In Your EV Battery\n\nIntegrals Power emailed the news to CleanTechnica earlier this week, after recieving validation of its new LMFP EV battery cathode active material from the firm QinetiQ. The tests were conducted on pouch cells deploying graphite anodes and a liquid electrolyte.\n\n\u201cValidated at C-rates [high energy discharge rates] up to an extreme 10C, the tests found that at 5C, the LMFP material retained 92% of its original capacity, and at 2C, 99%,\u201d Integrals explained.\n\n\u201cEven at 10C, which is far beyond the limits of any use case, capacity retention was an impressive 60%,\u201d the company added, noting that QinetiQ was not the only third-party firm to put its LMFP through its paces.\n\nIntegrals has been focused on pumping up the proportion of manganese in its formula without losing energy density. Before handing the material over to QinetiQ, Integrals took it to other third-party testing firms and received the thumbs-up for a manganese content of 80%, while leaping the energy density hurdle with the delivery of almost 150 mAh/gr specific capacity.\n\n\u201cAs a result, Integrals Power has demonstrated that its LMFP material can be used to make cells that will enable battery packs to deliver an optimal balance of high performance, long range, and long life that exceeds the capability of Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) but at less cost and less reliance on critical minerals than Nickel Cobalt Manganese (NCM),\u201d Integrals concluded.\n\nLFP is the cathode material favored by automakers in China due to its relatively low cost, so matching that goalpost with a higher-performing battery is a significant achievement.\n\nIntegrals founder and CEO, Behnam Hormozi chipped in his two cents, noting that \u201cwe are able to demonstrate to our customers around the world that we can enable significant cost and weight reductions, and more compact, more sustainable, and longer-lasting battery pack designs.\u201d\n\nNew EV Battery Is Out For Testing\n\nIntegrals is not new to the EV battery field. The company has spent years building up a collaborative network with academic partners and industry stakeholders. Last fall, Reuters reporter Nick Carey reported that Integrals began shipping test samples of both LFP and LMFP cathode materials to EV battery makers and automakers, with three customers in its pocket and 10 more in the pipeline in the US as well as Europe.\n\n\u201cIntegrals Power has a small UK pilot production line and aims to have its first industrial scale line operational by 2027,\u201d Carey also noted.\n\nIt\u2019s not all on Integrals. The company can potentially license other firms to produce the material as well.\n\nMeanwhile, Back In The USA\n\nAs for the future of EV battery manufacturing in the USA, that\u2019s an open question. President Trump\u2019s dopey \u201cEnergy Emergency Declaration\u201d includes a carveout for \u201ccritical materials.\u201d That covers a wide ground including EV battery materials, which is a hopeful sign.\n\nOr not, as the case may be. In yet another demonstration of idiotic and destructive decision-making at the highest levels of federal energy policy making, on February 7 President Trump ordered a freeze on disbursements from NEVI, the $5 billion federal program that supports state-based EV charging stations programs with funding from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (also called the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act).\n\nOn the bright side, EV battery stakeholders in the US are not dead yet. After all, many companies long outlast the term of a presidency, so why not lay plans for the future now.\n\nOn February 4, for example, the new California firm Elevated Materials celebrated the occasion of its spinoff from Applied Materials. As an independent firm, Elevated will deploy the thin lithium films developed at Applied.\n\nThe launch was supported with investments from Applied Materials and the leading financial firm TPG, which lent its Rise Climate fund to the effort.\n\nElevated\u2019s lithium films are fabricated with roll-to-roll vapor deposition equipment, helping to keep costs down. \u201cElevated Materials\u2019 advanced lithium films maximize energy density and provide a cost-effective solution for gigawatt-hour scale production,\u201d explains Elevated CEO Jim Cushing.\n\nThe film can be used on graphite, silicon, and lithium metal anodes. Elevated foresees applications that will push costs down for electric aircraft, stationary energy storage, and consumer electronics as well as electric vehicles.\n\nIf the political environment for EV battery makers in the US becomes even more ridiculous and potentially harmful than it is now, Elevated can always decamp and move to Germany, where it also has offices. BMW, for one, is a fan. In a press statement, Dr. Peter Lamp, a battery expert for BMW Group, noted that Elevated\u2019s lithium thin films are key to overcoming challenges in energy density and anode-specific capacities, such as silicon oxide materials or lithium-metal.\u201d\n\nThe EV Battery Market Is Global, Remember?\n\nFor that matter, EV battery innovators don\u2019t need the US market, at least not over the short term. The Elevated spin-out is just one example of the global financial forces working to support the energy transition. As tracked by BNEF, clean tech investments are far outstripping fossil energy investments now, and the gap is expected to keep growing.\n\nTake the Rise Climate fund, for example. The $25 billion investing platform notes that it maintains \u201cdedicated pools of capital across private equity, transition infrastructure, and the Global South.\u201d\n\n\u201cTPG Rise Climate pursues climate-related investments that benefit from the diverse skills of TPG\u2019s investing professionals around the world, the strategic relationships and insights developed across TPG\u2019s broad portfolio of climate companies, and a global network of executives, advisors, and corporate partners,\u201d the firm adds.\n\nRise Climate managing partner Jonathan Garfinkle notes that his firm\u2019s knowledge of the mobility supply chain enables it to \u201cuncover, carve-out, and scale breakthrough technologies like Elevated Materials.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look forward to complementing Applied Materials\u2019 world-class technology expertise with TPG\u2019s business-building capabilities to accelerate and scale this new business to serve the world\u2019s largest battery, auto, and aviation OEMs around the world,\u201d he adds for good measure.\n\nThe global energy transition is spending money, creating jobs, and making life on Earth a little healthier, with or without support from the US.\n\nIf you\u2019d rather see your tax dollars and other public resources go to support clean tech instead of propping up destructive \u201cenergy dominance\u201d bloviating, contact your representatives in Congress and let them know.\n\nFollow me via LinkTree, or @tinamcasey on LinkedIn and Bluesky.\n\nPhoto (cropped): Trump or no Trump, the global EV battery supply chain is shifting into high gear as global innovators introduce new materials that cut costs while improving performance (courtesy of Integrals Power, via email to CleanTechnica).",

They've created a material that kills multiple types of harmful bacteria, and it does so using tiny flowers.\n\nIf you've never heard of nanoflowers, they're microscopic structures made up of nanosheets of material which self-assemble into three-dimensional clusters.\n\nThe \"petals\" of each flower pack a huge amount of surface area into a small space, allowing the structures to be heavily loaded with therapeutic substances. For this reason, the technology has previously been utilized for targeted drug delivery within the body.\n\nThis time around, Fatemeh Ahmadpoor, Pier Francesco Ferrari and colleagues at the University of Genoa set out to develop antibacterial nanoflowers. The structures were grown in a saline solution, and were composed of tannic acid and copper phosphate.\n\nTannic acid is a member of a group of plant-derived chemicals known as polyphenols. Among other things, polyphenols reduce oxidative stress, kill bacteria, and reduce inflammation in body tissue. Copper phosphate boosts polyphenols' ability to do these things.\n\nThe scientists proceeded to attach their nanoflowers to strips of electrospun nanofiber fabric. If you really want to know, that fabric was specifically composed of \"poly(caprolactone)-coated gum arabic\u2013poly(vinyl alcohol) nanofibers.\"\n\nIn lab tests, the strips eradicated cultured harmful bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa on contact. Importantly, however, the fabric didn\u2019t damage lab-grown human cells, and was otherwise shown to be fully biocompatible.\n\nAs an added benefit, the dressing should also be relatively easy and inexpensive to produce on a commercial scale.\n\nA paper on the research was recently published in the journal ACS Applied Bio Materials.\n\nSource: American Chemical Society\n\n",

(NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against other best big tech stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nBig Tech comprises some of the largest and most influential companies in the world, recognized for their sheer size, extensive customer base, and financial strength. Leading this group are five major companies that have been at the forefront of the tech sector economy, driving innovation and shaping consumer behavior. Over the years, Big Tech firms have benefited from the widespread adoption of smartphones and high-speed internet, increased demand for digital services, the rise of social media, strong demand for cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital advertising.\n\nHow Did the Big Tech Companies Become The Giants They are Today?\n\nBeyond technological advancements, these companies have also benefited from several phenomena. The first is network effects\u2014the more users a platform has, the more valuable it becomes. Other contributing factors include economies of scale as they expanded through acquisitions and the ease of scaling digital businesses globally; access to vast amounts of user data used to enhance products, target ads, and create highly personalized services; and their deep pockets (strong balance sheets) that enabled them to invest heavily in R&D, hire top talent, and operate during challenging times. This financial strength also allowed them to aggressively invest in AI and maintain a first-mover advantage. While challenges persist, we believe these companies will continue to innovate, expand their influence, and shape the future of technology.\n\nIn a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, Wedbush Securities\u2019 Global Head of Technology Research, Dan Ives, expressed optimism about the future of Big Tech, stating:\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s $80 billion investment announcement and then Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement that his company plans to spend up to $65 billion on artificial intelligence is \u201cthe start of a massive build-out of AI Capex\u201d that I think the Street is massively underestimating. And it\u2019s the multiplier \u2013 every dollar spent on a NVIDIA chip, means $8 to $10 multiplier goes to the rest of tech \u2013 that\u2019s bullish for tech. Of course, with Trump and Stargate, it just shows that fourth industrial revolution is just starting.\u201d\n\nWhile Big Tech typically refers to the top five mega-cap companies, we have prepared an extended list of 15 stocks that have made a significant impact on the tech landscape and are equally innovative and transformative as the top five.",

            "content": "The research findings have been published in the Applied Materials Today (Q1, IF: 7.2).\n\nTwo-dimensional materials are defined as ultrathin layers with a range of properties, from conductors like graphene (graphite monolayer) to semiconductors and even dielectrics. The physical, chemical, and electronic properties of these two-dimensional materials are unique and promising for applications in electronics, sensors, and catalysis. Two-dimensional materials, including talc and molybdenum disulfide, can be obtained by exfoliation, a process that involves the peeling of ultrathin layers from their bulk forms. These two-dimensional materials occur naturally as layered minerals.\n\n\n\n\n\nNevertheless, many layered minerals have yet to be studied in the form of ultrathin layers. The search for materials with unique properties from natural minerals mined in Russia poses a captivating challenge, with the potential to yield novel and promising devices. In this research, TPU scientists obtained thin nanometer-scale As2S3 flakes from the orpiment mineral.\n\nOrpiment mineral\n\n\u201cOur research has shown that even under the low-intensity light, this material quite significantly changes its electronic properties. However, it does not exhibit the capacity to conduct electric current, as it normally occurs in semiconductors used in photodetectors. This process mechanism is different. The exposure of the two-dimensional material to light results in a redistribution of charges. Consequently, the surface electric potential increases to a maximum of 80 mV,\u201d says Garcia Balsa Aura Samid, co-author of the study and researcher at the at the Research School of Chemistry and Applied Biomedical Sciences.\n\nThe ability to modulate the surface potential renders the material promising for the development of next-generation phototransistors and optical switches.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn comparison, molybdenum disulfide, the most common two-dimensional semiconductor, shows no change in surface potential under the same conditions.\n\nConversely, the use of metallic nanoparticles holds considerable promise in the domains of photocatalysis, sensing, and optoelectronics. They can intensify the interaction of light with matter, stimulate optoelectronic response and improve the photocatalytic performance of 2D materials. In light of these observations, the researchers designed a hybrid material by combining arsenic trisulfide with silver nanowires to enhance the photoresponse. This combination has been shown to enhance the efficiency of photocatalytic processes by 71% in comparison with the use of nanowires alone.\n\nLight exposure of the material\n\n\u201cThe discovered properties of ultrathin mineral layers may instigate the development of new domestic technologies in optoelectronic or photocatalytic systems. In further research, we plan to study the properties of other ultrathin layers of minerals mined in Russia and investigate the properties of various two-dimensional material combinations,\u201d shares Raul Rodriguez, co-author of the study and professor at the Research School of Chemistry and Applied Biomedical Sciences.\n\nThe research was a joint effort between the TPU Research School of Chemistry and Applied Biomedical Sciences, TPU School of Earth Sciences and Engineering, Shihezi University, Ningbo Institute of Materials Science and Engineering, and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.",

(Image: Adapted from ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 2024, DOI: 10.1021/acsami.4c16439)\n\nMost batteries are rigid and incompatible with water. But people work and play in oceans and estuaries, and they could benefit from flexible and saltwater-safe power sources. Now, researchers report in ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces a yarn-like battery prototype that works when immersed in seawater. They knotted the rechargeable strands into a fishing net that lit up LEDs and wove a fabric that powered a timer.\n\nFlexible, yarn-like batteries can be knit or woven into various shapes. These stringy energy sources are lightweight and are often designed to be waterproof. But rather than avoid battery exposure to water entirely, scientists have proposed using salty water as a critical battery component \u2014 the electrolyte \u2014 a liquid that conducts electricity through ions. Yan Qiao, Zhisong Lu, and colleagues previously developed a water-friendly battery made with carbon fiber and cotton yarn. This prior work used sweat from the body as the electrolyte for exercise monitors. Like sweat, seawater, which contains sodium, chloride and sulfate ions, can serve as an electrolyte. So, Qiao, Lu and a new team wanted to develop a marine version of a rechargeable battery that could be used to power lights on fishing nets, life jackets, or mooring lines for buoys.\n\nTo create electrodes for the seawater batteries, the group treated carbon fiber bundles with electrically conductive coatings: nickel hexacyanoferrate for the positive electrode (cathode) and polyamide for the negative electrode (anode). Then researchers twisted two bundles together to form yarn-like cathode and anode strings. To prepare a battery, the researchers wrapped the cathode string in a layer of fiberglass, laid it along the anode, and encased both strands in a nonwoven, permeable fabric. The fabric protects the electrodes while also allowing in seawater to contact the electrodes. In tests using saltwater, the battery continued to store an electrical charge after being bent 4000 times. Then, when evaluated in seawater, it retained most of the initial charging efficiency and storage capacity over 200 charge and discharge cycles.\n\nFinally, as a proof-of-concept, the group knotted battery strands together into a fishing net and wove a rectangular piece of fabric. The net was then soaked in seawater to absorb the electrolyte and was charged. The net battery lit up a 10-LED panel. Similarly, the fabric submerged in a sodium sulfate solution powered a timer for more than an hour. The researchers say their yarn-like battery has potential as an energy source in marine applications.\n\nHere is an exclusive Tech Briefs interview, edited for length and clarity, with Lu.\n\nTech Briefs: What was the biggest technical challenge you faced while developing this seawater battery?\n\nLu: The most significant technical challenge we encountered would be how to efficiently immobilize active materials within yarn-like electrodes. The goal was to maximize the use of the internal spaces between the carbon fibers to boost performance. Traditionally, active materials are immobilized on yarns using a \"twist-before-coating\" method, where fibers are twisted first and then coated with active materials. But in this study, we developed a new approach called the \"twist-after-coating\" technique. We first coat the well-aligned carbon fibers with active materials and then twist them to form the yarn-like electrodes. This method ensures that the active materials are evenly distributed both inside the yarn and on its surface, thereby making full use of each carbon fiber. As a result, we reduced the charge transfer resistance and achieved a higher specific capacity.\n\nTech Briefs: Can you please explain in simple terms how it works?\n\nLu: Seawater acts as a natural electrolyte because it contains positively charged ions like sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and magnesium (Mg2+). When the battery charges, these ions are embedded into the yarn-based negative electrode, storing energy. During discharge, the ions are released from the negative electrode, move through the seawater, and embed themselves into the positive electrode. The back-and-forth movement of the ions between the electrodes enables the battery to work.\n\nTech Briefs: How does this battery differ from the water-friendly battery made with carbon fiber and cotton yarn that your team previously developed?\n\nLu: In our earlier work, we created a water-friendly battery called a \"yarn-based sweat-activated battery.\" That design used zinc wire as the positive electrode, carbon fiber as the negative electrode, and human sweat as the electrolyte instead of seawater. Another key difference is that the sweat-activated battery was a single-use, non-rechargeable device, whereas this newly developed seawater battery is fully rechargeable.\n\nTech Briefs: Do you have plans for further research/work/etc.?\n\nLu: Future research will focus on two main areas: (1) optimizing the active materials and device structure to improve the performance of these yarn-like seawater batteries, and (2) developing simpler, scalable methods for mass production to meet the demands of marine and deep-sea applications.\n\nTech Briefs: Do you have any updates you can share?\n\nLu: In our latest work, we\u2019ve improved the design by adjusting the intertwined structure of the positive and negative electrodes, which resulted in a better negative-to-positive capacity ratio. Compared to earlier versions, the new yarn-like seawater batteries show a 10.2 percent increase in specific capacity.\n\nTech Briefs: Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add that I didn\u2019t touch upon?\n\nLu: One important point is that traditional seawater batteries often use non-aqueous electrolytes and sodium anodes, which can be harmful to the environment and limit their widespread use. Our yarn-like seawater battery avoids these issues entirely \u2014 it doesn\u2019t rely on hazardous electrolytes or active metal anodes, making it a safe and sustainable power source that works seamlessly in seawater. Plus, its open structure eliminates the need for sealing layers and solid ion-conducting membranes, which significantly cuts down on costs.",

Credit: Motohiro Tagaya / Nagaoka University of Technology, Japan\n\nMedical implants have transformed health care, offering innovative solutions with advanced materials and technologies. However, many biomedical devices face challenges like insufficient cell adhesion, leading to inflammatory responses after their implantation in the body.\n\nApatite coatings, particularly hydroxyapatite (HA)\u2014a naturally occurring form of apatite found in bones, have been shown to promote better integration with surrounding tissues. However, the biocompatibility of artificially synthesized apatite nanoparticles often falls short of expectations, primarily due to the nanoparticles' limited ability to bind effectively with biological tissues.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, researchers at Nagaoka University of Technology, Japan have developed a method for synthesizing surface-modified apatite nanoparticles that results in improved cell adhesion, offering new possibilities for the next generation of biocompatible medical implants.\n\nLed by Dr. Motohiro Tagaya, Associate Professor at the Department of Materials Science and Bioengineering at Nagaoka University of Technology, Japan, this research aims to enhance the performance of apatite coatings and advance the field of biocompatible materials for medical devices.\n\nThe findings of this study were published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces. Along with Dr. Tagaya, Mr. Kazuto Sugimoto from Nagaoka University of Technology, Dr. Tania Guadalupe Pe\u00f1aflor Galindo from Sophia University, and Mr. Ryota Akutsu from Nagaoka University of Technology were also a part of this research team.\n\nApatites are a class of calcium-phosphorus-based inorganic compounds, with hydroxyapatite\u2014a naturally occurring form found in bones. These compounds are known for their high biocompatibility.\n\nRecent studies have found that coating artificial joints and implants with apatite nanoparticles is a plausible solution for improving the biocompatibility of these biodevices. However, the artificially synthesized nanoparticles often show reduced binding affinity to biological tissues in vitro.\n\nAccording to Dr. Tagaya and his team, this difference could be linked to the nanoscale surface layer of the apatite nanoparticles.\n\nDr. Tagaya's research was driven by a desire to unravel the complexities of biocompatible materials, leading his team to develop an interdisciplinary framework that controls the intricate interactions between apatite and biological systems.\n\n\"The properties of the nanoscale surface layer of apatite nanoparticles are crucial when considered for medical coatings,\" adds Dr. Tagaya. Adding further, he says, \"In this study, we successfully controlled the nanoscale surface layers of apatite nanoparticles, paving the way for advanced surface coating technologies for biodevices.\"\n\nThe team synthesized hydroxyapatite nanoparticles by mixing aqueous solutions of calcium and phosphate ions. The pH of the solution was controlled using three different bases, which included tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

Higher pH favored the formation of CHA, leading to better crystallinity, and a higher calcium to phosphorus (Ca/P) molar ratio.\n\nThe surface of the apatite nanoparticles shows three different layers. The inner apatite layer/core is characterized by the presence of the crystalline structure of the apatite. Above the apatite layer is the non-apatitic layer, which is rich in ions like phosphate ions and carbonate ions.\n\nThis layer reacts with water molecules and forms the hydration layer. Analyzing the surface characteristics of these layers revealed that pH adjustments facilitated the formation of the non-apatitic layer rich in reactive ions, enhancing hydration properties, which was confirmed.\n\nImportantly, the study revealed that while higher pH facilitates the formation of the non-apatitic layer, the presence of Na+ ions reduces the concentration of phosphate ions, leading to decreased reactivity of the layer.\n\nThe introduction of substantial ions by NaOH also affected the uniformity of electrophoretic deposition, as observed in scanning probe microscope studies. This effect was not observed with KOH, indicating that KOH was more suitable than NaOH for forming the non-apatitic layer and ensuring a uniform coating.\n\nEmphasizing the significance of the study, Dr. Tagaya says, \"This study focuses on the critical interfaces between bioceramics and biological systems and could inspire designs of biocompatible surfaces with preferential cell adhesion.\"\n\nThese findings can be potentially useful for surface coating of a wide range of biodevices that are implanted in the human body, including artificial joints and implants.\n\nGoing ahead, the team intends to push the boundaries of nanobiomaterials, paving the way for groundbreaking innovations in medical materials and devices that could revolutionize health care and improve patient outcomes.\n\nMore information: Kazuto Sugimoto et al, Surface State Control of Apatite Nanoparticles by pH Adjusters for Highly Biocompatible Coatings, ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2025).

The study was published in ACS Applied Nano Materials.\n\nAir quality affects ecosystems, human health, and overall environmental conditions. Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), a byproduct of fuel combustion, industrial emissions, and gas cooking, is a significant air pollutant with known health risks. Short-term exposure can lead to respiratory irritation, while prolonged exposure is associated with chronic respiratory conditions. Regulatory agencies such as the European Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have established exposure limits to mitigate health risks.\n\nDespite advancements in gas sensor technology over the past two decades, challenges remain in improving sensitivity, selectivity, real-time monitoring, and room-temperature operation. Most existing NO 2 sensors are not suitable for integration into wearable devices.\n\nCurrent NO 2 detection methods often rely on expensive instrumentation, underscoring the need for cost-effective sensor technologies that enable large-scale monitoring of this pollutant.\n\nAt AMBER, we are actively developing 2D material networks on flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates. Through multidisciplinary collaboration, we aim to leverage their flexibility, affordability, and transparency to enhance wearable technologies for real-time air quality monitoring and advanced sensing in smartwatches, clothing, and beyond.

Early detection of hazardous gas emissions from such events remains challenging. As atmospheric pollutants disperse beyond localized areas, there is an increasing demand for cost-effective, scalable technologies such as personal air monitors.\n\nThe research team from Trinity College Dublin was led by Jonathan Coleman, the Erasmus Smith Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy (1724), with contributions from Leonidas Tsetseris of the National Technical University of Athens and Zden\u011bk Sofer of the University of Chemistry and Technology Prague.\n\nJournal Reference:\n\nUrs, K., et al.

Researchers report in ACS Applied Bio Materials that laboratory tests of their nanoflower-coated dressings demonstrate antibiotic, anti-inflammatory and biocompatible properties. They say these results show these tannic acid and copper(II) phosphate sprouted nanoflower bandages are promising candidates for treating infections and inflammatory conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nNanoflowers are tiny, self-assembling structures. But their large surface area provides plenty of space to attach drug molecules, making the flowers particularly suitable for delivering medications. For their bandage blooms, Fatemeh Ahmadpoor, Pier Francesco Ferrari and colleagues chose copper(II) phosphate and tannic acid because of the antibiotic and anti-inflammatory properties of both reagents. After growing their flowers in a saline solution, the researchers attached the bioinspired structures onto strips of electrospun nanofiber fabric. In tests, the nanoflower-coated bandages inactivated a broad spectrum of cultured bacteria (including E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus) and their antibiotic-resistant biofilms, scavenged reactive oxygen species, and didn\u2019t damage lab-grown human cells.\n\nWant more breaking news?

All eyes were on the impending interest rate decision from the U.S. Federal Reserve, set for release later in the day.\n\nIt is broadly anticipated that the Federal Reserve will maintain the current interest rates in its announcement, scheduled for 2 p.m. ET.\n\nGoldman Sachs economists mentioned in a report, \u201cGiven the lack of clear effects from various governmental actions, especially tariffs, as well as tax policies and the immigration policy\u2019s influence on the job market, we anticipate the Fed will likely offer limited guidance today.\u201d\n\nAs of 9:46 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had risen by 23.73 points, or 0.05%, reaching 44,874.08, while the S&P 500 dropped by 16.71 points, or 0.26%, to 6,052.02, and the Nasdaq Composite fell by 112.68 points, or 0.53%, to 19,628.68.\n\nTechnology stocks led the downturn with a 1.1% decline, impacting six of the eleven sectors in the S&P 500.\n\nNvidia\u2019s stock fell by 3.3% after a previous gain of nearly 9% on Tuesday. The drop followed the launch of new AI models by Chinese startup DeepSeek, which claimed to be more cost-effective and to operate on less sophisticated chips than those required by OpenAI.\n\nApple\u2019s shares also saw a decrease of 1.1% after Oppenheimer downgraded its rating from \u201coutperform\u201d to \u201cperform.\u201d The tech giant is expected to release its quarterly earnings later this week.\n\nAccording to data from LSEG, of the 112 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings so far, 75.9% have exceeded analyst expectations.\n\nMeanwhile, shares in semiconductor firms and related equipment manufacturers saw gains after Dutch company ASML reported fourth-quarter bookings of 7.09 billion euros ($7.39 billion), significantly surpassing expectations. KLA Corp rose 1.5%, Applied Materials was up 1.3%, Lam Research increased by 0.5%, and Micron Technology added 1.1% in morning trading.\n\nThe previous session saw the Nasdaq jump 2% and the S&P 500 nearly 1%, as Nvidia and other AI-related tech stocks partially recovered from earlier losses in the week.\n\nMarket tensions have been fueled by concerns over proposed tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump, which could heighten inflationary pressures and hinder rate reductions.\n\nThe December reading of the personal consumption expenditures price index, a key indicator for tracking inflation, is expected to be released on Friday.\n\nIn earnings news, T-Mobile surged 7.4% following its forecast of stronger-than-expected annual subscriber growth, spurred by rising demand for its affordable premium 5G plans.\n\nConversely, Danaher\u2019s stock dropped 7.7% after the life sciences firm reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter profits, attributed to weak demand for its biotech and pharmaceutical client services.\n\nUpcoming earnings reports from major companies like Microsoft, Meta (formerly Facebook), and Tesla are highly anticipated after the market closes.\n\nF5, a cybersecurity and cloud services firm, saw its stock jump 5.1% after projecting second-quarter revenues that topped estimates and reporting strong first-quarter results.\n\nOn the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.09-to-1 ratio, while on the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1.29-to-1 ratio.\n\nThe S&P 500 registered 18 new 52-week highs and two new lows, whereas the Nasdaq Composite noted 36 new highs and 52 new lows.\n\n($1 = 0.9628 euros)This story was updated to include new information.",

While PUD promises high throughput at low energy and area cost, we uncover three limitations of existing PUD approaches that lead to significant inefficiencies: (i) static data representation, i.e., 2\u2019s complement with fixed bit-precision, leading to unnecessary computation over useless (i.e., inconsequential) data; (ii) support for only throughput-oriented execution, where the high latency of individual PUD operations can only be hidden in the presence of bulk data-level parallelism; and (iii) high latency for high-precision (e.g., 32-bit) operations. To address these issues, we propose Proteus, which builds on two key ideas. First, Proteus parallelizes the execution of independent primitives in a PUD operation by leveraging DRAM\u2019s internal parallelism. Second, Proteus reduces the bit-precision for PUD operations by leveraging narrow values (i.e., values with many leading zeros). We compare Proteus to different state-of-the-art computing platforms (CPU, GPU, and the SIMDRAM PUD architecture) for twelve real-world applications. Using a single DRAM bank, Proteus provides (i) 17x, 7.3x, and 10.2x the performance per mm2; and (ii) 90.3x, 21x, and 8.1x lower energy consumption than that of the CPU, GPU, and SIMDRAM, respectively, on average across twelve real-world applications. Proteus incurs low area cost on top of a DRAM chip (1.6%) and CPU die (0.03%).\u201d\n\nFind the technical paper here. January 2o25.\n\nOliveira, Geraldo F., Mayank Kabra, Yuxin Guo, Kangqi Chen, A.

            "content": "We recently published a list of Coatue\u2019s 35 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management.

The footpads of geckos have hydrophilic (water-loving) mechanisms that allow the little animals to easily move over moist, slick surfaces. Researchers in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces report using silicone rubber enhanced with zirconia nanoparticles to create a gecko-inspired slip-resistant polymer. They say the material, which sticks to ice, could be incorporated into shoe soles to reduce injuries in humans.\n\n\n\n\n\nSlips and falls account for more than 38 million injuries and 684,000 deaths every year, according to the World Health Organization. And nearly half of these incidents happen on ice. Current anti-slip shoe soles rely on materials such as natural rubber that repel the layer of liquid water that sits atop pavement on a rainy day. On frozen walkways, however, shoe soles with these materials can cause ice to melt because of pressure from the wearer, creating the slippery surface the shoes are supposed to protect against.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious studies of gecko feet have led to new ideas for developing more effective anti-slip polymers. Those works found that their footpad\u2019s stickiness comes from hydrophilic capillary-enhanced adhesion: The force of water being drawn into narrow grooves in the footpad creates suction that helps the lizard navigate slippery surfaces. Vipin Richhariya, Ashis Tripathy, Md Julker Nine and colleagues aimed to develop a polymer with capillary-enhanced adhesion that works on rainy sidewalks and frozen surfaces.\n\nWant more breaking news?

After they rolled the composite material into a thin film, they hardened it with heat and laser-etched a grooved pattern onto the film\u2019s surface that exposed the hydrophilic zirconia nanoparticles. When the film encountered water molecules atop ice, it stuck to the slippery surface because the polymer mimicked the capillary action of slip-resistant gecko footpads. They tested five versions of the patterned nanocomposite material with different proportions of zirconia nanoparticles by weight: 1%, 3%, 5%, 7%, and 9%.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing infrared spectroscopy and simulated friction tests, the researchers found that the most slip-resistant nanocomposites contained 3% and 5% zirconia nanoparticles by weight. In addition to a nature-inspired anti-slip shoe sole, the team says this technology could be used in medical innovations, such as electronic skin and artificial skin, where polymers interact with a layer of fluid between two different surfaces.\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: Richhariya V, Tripathy A, Carvalho O, Gomes J, Nine MJ, Silva FS.

Organized by the Consumer Technology Association, the CES is one of the largest and most influential tech trade shows in the world. It serves as a platform for global innovators and companies to feature breakthrough technologies aiming to become the latest solutions to the world\u2019s biggest challenges.\n\nBuilding New Connections at CES\n\nAmong the companies that PEZA met include Quintel Solutions, a subsidiary of long-standing PEZA locator Cirtek. Quintel is considered the global market leader for multiport antennas, serving leading Telecom carriers in North America.\n\nThe PEZA team also met with the top officials of ON Semiconductor Corporation (stylized and doing business as Onsemi), a leading semiconductor manufacturer with over 80,000 different parts, including advanced MOSFETs, Image Sensors, Silicon Carbide technology (EliteSiC) and a global supply chain. The company serves tens of thousands of customers across several markets. Onsemi has been registered with PEZA since 2007, operating facilities in PEZA zones in Tarlac, Cavite, and Mactan. The meeting allowed PEZA to provide an overview of the competitive fiscal incentives package that the Philippines offers following the passage of the CREATE MORE law, as well as understand how the agency can better support the company towards the goal of another expansion in the Philippines.\n\nPEZA also worked on the leads of the Philippine Trade and Investment Center (PTIC) in Los Angeles through its Trade Commissioner Mr. Eric Elnar. Among those endorsed by PTIC-LA included Valmiz, a software development company; VANET Inc, a California-headquartered company that specializes in providing network solutions, and IPC International, the global association that helps OEMs, EMS, PCB manufacturers, cable and wire harness manufacturers and electronics industry suppliers build more reliable, high-quality products through proven standards, certification, education and training, thought leadership, advocacy, innovative solutions and industry intelligence.\n\nPEZA also briefed the following companies on the fiscal incentives available under the CREATE More regime and other value proposition of the Philippines as an investment destination: Winstron NeWeb Corp., (wireless communication products), Logoline (BPO), and LJ1D Consulting (Specializes in MNCs relocating from China to ASEAN).\n\nAlongside Science and Technology Secretary Dr. Renato Solidum Jr., Assistant Secretary Dr. Napoleon Juanillo Jr., and SEIPI President Dr. Danilo Lachica, Director General Tereso Panga participated at the World Electronics Forum breakfast at CES. With key leaders of the global electronics industry in attendance, the PEZA Chief provided an overview of the competitive advantages of locating manufacturing capabilities in PEZA zones, highlighting the strong EMS-SMS ecosystem hosted by PEZA.\n\nMeanwhile, PEZA Enterprise Regulations Group Manager Atty. Ross Vincent Sy served as one of the speakers at the Philippine Business Forum at CES where he highlighted the unique pull factors for the Philippines and its strong regional performance, as well as an overview of the new incentives regime package that the Philippines offers through the recently enacted CREATE MORE Law.\n\nPEZA\u2019s participation at CES was capped by a dialogue hosted by world-renowned Filipino rap artist and staunch advocate of workforce development Apl.de.ap, with the end-goal of bringing new job opportunities for Filipinos through government and private sector collaboration.\n\nExpanding Opportunities in San Francisco\n\nThe PEZA delegation proceeded to San Francisco to work on promising leads. Among those that the delegation met include Applied Materials, the global leader in materials engineering solutions. Applied Materials supplies equipment, services and software for the manufacture of semiconductor (integrated circuit) chips for electronics, flat panel displays for computers, smartphones, televisions, and solar products. The meeting allowed PEZA to gain valuable insights from Applied Materials on how to allow the Philippines to secure parts of the supply chain of equipment manufacturing.\n\nAlso included in the companies whom PEZA met is Enphase Energy, a market leader for intelligent microinverters with manufacturing capabilities in the USA. Enphase\u2019s microinverter allows the conversion of DC to AC electricity, which provides users the safest, most reliable, and cost-efficient way of harnessing solar power. PEZA and Enphase agreed to continue discussions in the Philippines to form part of PEZA\u2019s sustainability initiatives.\n\nThe PEZA delegation also participated in company visits organized by the DTI through PTIC-Silicon Valley headed by its Trade Commissioner Anne Marie Kristine Umali, which included visits to Nvidia and Tesla. NVIDIA is a software and fabless company which designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing, and system on a chip units (SoCs) for mobile computing and the automotive market. Nvidia is also a dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software. On the other hand, Tesla designs, manufactures and sells battery electric vehicles (BEVs), stationary battery energy storage devices from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar shingles, and related products and services.\n\n\u201cI am upbeat with the reception from the US Companies and the possibility that they may invest in the Philippines in the near future. Some talks have already started, jumping-off from the initial engagement, to realize these potential investments in the coming months. Given the positive economic performance of the Philippines due to the reforms initiated by President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., I have no doubt that we will be able to convince these companies in making PEZA their investment partner and the Philippines as their hub of business operations in ASEAN,\u201d said Tereso Panga, PEZA\u2019s Director General.",

            "content": "Earlier this week, many technology stocks sold off sharply on news of DeepSeek R1, the groundbreaking, low-cost AI model from China that materially lowered the cost of deploying AI.\n\nBut has that sell-off opened up a buying opportunity? Here are three tech stocks that should not only weather the current AI disruption, but also thrive on the other side.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon (AMZN 1.17%) founder Jeff Bezos once said, \"Your margin is my opportunity.\" So if artificial intelligence becomes more commoditized and the largest-scale, lowest-cost player wins, there's perhaps no company better positioned than Amazon.\n\nIf the cost of artificial intelligence comes far down, that will level the playing field for a lot of digital businesses. However, it's still hard to challenge large-scale players in the physical world. In other words, it may be easy to use AI to spin up a digital website and offer services, but it's another thing to deliver millions of items to people's doorstep within a day. So Amazon's e-commerce moat stands to endure the AI revolution. And Amazon should also be able to implement AI robotics to further optimize its delivery ecosystem and lower costs even further.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon Web Services may also have an advantage. AWS is the oldest and largest cloud platform and has committed to giving customers as much choice as possible at the lowest possible costs.\n\nSince Amazon's rival Microsoft (MSFT 0.74%) leapt out and invested early in OpenAI, it had been thought by some that AWS was behind in the AI races. However, if large models become more commoditized, that Microsoft-OpenAI first-mover advantage won't mean much.\n\nBut rather than tying itself to one AI leader, Amazon has committed to hosting a variety of large language models on its Amazon Bedrock platform. Meanwhile, Amazon has also invested in OpenAI rival Anthropic, based on the results and usage it was seeing for Anthropic's Claude models on AWS.\n\nAmazon is also committed to drive down the cost of training and inference with its homemade Trainium and Inferentia chips. By designing its own hardware in-house, Amazon offers dramatically lower costs than renting Nvidia GPUs. In fact, even Antrhopic, as a leading frontier model builder, has committed to training future models on Trainium. That could give it a cost advantage over other model-builders.\n\nOn a big-picture level, Amazon's history shows it has continually invested in new ideas and innovations, perhaps at the expense of near-term profits. It also usually vertically integrates, solidifying a cost advantage and increasing its moats versus its rivals in large industries.\n\nThis all makes Amazon a stock with staying power, which means long-term investors can still feel comfortable buying, even at recent all-time highs.\n\nTencent\n\nThere are a few issues that DeepSeek brought to the market's attention. One is that if the cost of training AI models comes down materially, AI will be embedded into more and more existing services. The second is that China's tech community can also pioneer groundbreaking innovations.\n\nBoth issues should be a benefit to Tencent (TCEHY -1.00%), which is not only developing its own AI services, but also has several massive existing businesses that should benefit from AI.\n\nAfter all, Tencent owns WeChat, the largest social network in China, with 1.38 billion monthly active users. That is probably the largest trove of proprietary data available in China, or probably anywhere in the world. Given the democratization of large language models, companies with large distribution systems and proprietary data like Tencent will be able to leverage AI to the greatest advantage.\n\nNot to be outdone, Tencent's other main businesses in video game publishing and fintech should also see benefits from AI. Video game studios can use AI to more efficiently create better games with more monetization opportunities, and Tencent's fintech arm, Tenpay, can leverage AI to better underwrite loans and detect fraud in digital payments.\n\nFinally, Tencent also writes huge amounts of software across its businesses, and one of AI's early main use cases is for software coding. If Tencent is able to lower the number of software engineers it needs, there is a huge opportunity to lower its costs.\n\nMeanwhile, China's stock valuations, despite a rally last year, are still well off their highs and below those of their U.S. counterparts. Thus, this could still be a good time to buy best of breed Chinese stocks like Tencent, for those willing to take the geopolitical risk.\n\nApplied Materials\n\nThe first reaction for the semiconductor industry to the DeepSeek news was a violent sell-off. This included most hardware names, from chipmakers to server-makers to semiconductor equipment stocks such as industry leader Applied Materials (AMAT 1.41%).\n\nHowever, that could be short-sighted. If the cost of AI training comes down, that should spark an explosion of use cases for AI, which is likely to increase computing at the edge. That means edge servers, phones, and PCs. So even if the most advanced AI training chips see a deceleration from expectations, inference chips in these other devices should then take off. Overall, the pie is likely to grow.\n\nApplied Materials is a great choice for those looking for broad-based exposure to the chip industry, as the most diversified equipment-maker across both market segments and types of chip equipment. The company makes etch and deposition, metrology, ion implantation, and advanced packaging machines, among others, serving the leading-edge logic, lagging-edge logic, DRAM and NAND memory markets.\n\nThis diversified exposure makes Applied a safe choice to benefit from the overall growth of computing. Add in a services business at around 23% of revenue and largely tied to Applied's growing installed base of equipment, and Applied is a lower-risk and profitable way to play the growth of computing over the long term.\n\nThe large semiconductor equipment companies also form an oligopoly, with only one or two choices at each process step. That enables all players to generate high margins and return on capital. That in turn allows Applied to repurchase its stock consistently, even through downcycles, and pay a rising dividend.\n\nSo even if investment in the most leading-edge training GPUs moderates, investment in edge computing segments, which have recently lagged, should pick up in a big way. Either way, Applied should grow along with the overall computing intensity of the economy, all while returning lots of cash to shareholders over the long term.",

(NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against other best beginner stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nStock Market Outlook for 2025\n\nOn December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared on CNBC to talk about his 2025 playbook. After two years of significant market gains, Lee\u2019s playbook painted an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market in 2025. He anticipated that the S&P 500 would rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025 before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This highlights an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, consistent with historical averages for stock market returns.\n\nFurthermore, Lee estimated the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the S&P 500 to be around $260 in 2025, going up to $300 in 2026. These numbers are slightly below the Wall Street consensus estimates, which show an average of around $268 for 2025. Talking about his investment thesis, Lee believed several themes could bring a positive trajectory in the market in 2025. In his own Dickensian version, he predicted a \u201ctale of two halves,\u201d where the first half of 2025 is expected to see strong market performance, with a potential pullback in the second half. The positive first-half performance is attributed to factors such as market-friendly initiatives under President Trump\u2019s administration and Federal Reserve policies. The pullback in the second half of 2025 reflects historical trends after strong consecutive years.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 and 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In.\n\nMega Cap Companies: Is There Potential?\n\nLee was of the opinion that the small-cap sector may have potential even though it has historically underperformed relative to large-cap stocks. He also talked about mega-cap companies and how they\u2019re leading, mentioning that investors typically reach for these companies when there is even a possibility of risk in the market. In addition, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. Since the tech market is bullish after the December rate cut is in effect, the investment case for megacaps is further strengthening.\n\nHowever, despite an overall positive outlook, Lee acknowledged that several risks may impact market performance. For instance, he was of the view that the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Furthermore, the implementation of tariffs poses another concern, as tariffs can adversely affect corporate profits and financial conditions. Lee\u2019s pointing out of historical patterns showed that after two years of considerable gains, markets are prone to decline in the latter half of the third year.",

            "content": "However, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. (AMAT): Positioned for Growth Amid Taiwan Semi's Capital Spending Surge\n\nA technician in a clean room assembling a semiconductor chip using a microscope.\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) provides equipment, services, and software for the semiconductor industry. There are many aspects that contribute to this company being an excellent investment opportunity. Among them is the company\u2019s strong financial growth, as illustrated in the fiscal year report of 2024. For instance, Applied generated record revenue of $27.18 billion, and on a GAAP basis, the company recorded a gross margin of 47.5%, a record operating income of $7.87 billion or 28.9% of net sales, and a record EPS of $8.61. Additionally, on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, the company reported a gross margin of 47.6%, a record operating income of $7.92 billion or 29.2% of net sales, and a record EPS of $8.65. Moreover, the company\u2019s AIx platform enables engineers to gain real-time insights into semiconductor processes, optimizing thousands of variables to improve performance, power efficiency, area, cost, and time to market. The AIx platform works across all Applied Materials process equipment, eBeam metrology systems and inspection systems and is extendable from lab to fab.\n\nOverall AMAT ranks 16th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AMAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AMAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 30 Best and Worst Data Center Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against the other data center stocks.\n\nWe believe data centers are currently experiencing a remarkable growth phase as the demand for digital services, cloud computing, and broader GenAI applications increases significantly. In the hyperscale and colocation segments, an estimated 10 GW is projected to commence globally in 2025 (according to JLL Global Outlook). Market intelligence firm Statista forecasts the global data center market to reach $624 billion in 2029, up from $452 billion in 2025, with a CAGR of 8.4%. Meanwhile, a report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) estimates that to meet the global demand for computing power, leading data center players will need to invest a staggering $1.8 trillion from 2024 to 2030. In essence, it's a juggernaut poised to reshape how the world consumes and processes information.\n\nThere has already been substantial capital investment over the last 3-4 years, transforming the data center industry landscape. Additionally, merger and acquisition activity has surged, with many well-known players now privatized. For instance, three major deals occurred in 2021: KKR and Global Infrastructure Partners acquired CyrusOne for $15 billion, American Tower acquired Coresite for $10 billion, and Blackstone acquired QTS for $10 billion. Later, Switch Inc. was acquired for $11 billion by DigitalBridge and IFM in 2022. These deals and their valuations only underscore the future value of data center assets.\n\nIn exploring investment opportunities for this article, we also examined some smaller private operators with intriguing business models, capitalizing on the growing demand for digital infrastructure. One such company is LightEdge, which operates 14 data center locations across the U.S. with a capacity of 30 MW. They offer customized solutions and services, including colocation, hybrid and edge cloud, and managed services. Another notable player is Vantage Data Centers, a private operator owned by DigitalBridge and other investors. Vantage operates in 21 markets worldwide, boasting 23 million square feet of space and 2.6 GW of power.\n\nFlexential is another prominent name, providing tailored hybrid IT solutions through its FlexAnywhere platform. This platform integrates colocation, cloud, connectivity, data protection, and managed and professional services, across three million square feet of data center space in 19 highly connected markets. A recent addition to the emerging data center companies is Fleet Data Centers, launched by Tract Capital at the beginning of 2025. This company aims to develop mega-scale data center campuses with capacities of 500 MW or more, specifically designed for single-user customers. Tract Capital, the founder, is a data center land acquisition and development company led by an experienced team of data center experts.",

(NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nInvestors have become increasingly concerned about the rising capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, with many wondering whether the expectations embedded in financial markets today project a realistic path ahead. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega-cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025.\n\nThe Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now makes up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and has driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on a 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nAnalysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. Hardware firms were defined as the companies that drive the design and manufacture of the semiconductors that are key to generating computing power.

The approach could benefit a wide range of industries, from automotive to aerospace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNano-architected materials combine high performance shapes, like making a bridge out of triangles, at nanoscale sizes, which takes advantage of the \u2018smaller is stronger\u2019 effect, to achieve some of the highest strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios, of any material,\u201d says Peter Serles (MIE MASc 1T9, MIE PhD 2T4), the first author of the new paper.\n\nWant more breaking news?

Subscribe for FREE\n\n\u201cHowever, the standard lattice shapes and geometries used tend to have sharp intersections and corners, which leads to the problem of stress concentrations. This results in early local failure and breakage of the materials, limiting their overall potential.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs I thought about this challenge, I realized that it is a perfect problem for machine learning to tackle.\u201d\n\n\n\nNano-architected materials are made of tiny building blocks or repeating units measuring a few hundred nanometres in size \u2014 it would take more than 100 of them patterned in a row to reach the thickness of a human hair. These building blocks, which in this case are composed of carbon, are arranged in complex 3D structures called nanolattices.\n\n\n\nTo design their improved materials, Serles and Filleter worked with Professor Seunghwa Ryu and PhD student Jinwook Yeo at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon, South Korea. This partnership was initiated through U of T\u2019s International Doctoral Clusters program, which supports doctoral training through research engagement with international collaborators.\n\n\n\nThe KAIST team employed the multi-objective Bayesian optimization machine learning algorithm. This algorithm learned from simulated geometries to predict the best possible geometries for enhancing stress distribution and improving the strength-to-weight ratio of nano-architected designs.\n\n\n\n\n\nSerles then used a two-photon polymerization 3D printer housed in the Centre for Research and Application in Fluidic Technologies (CRAFT) to create prototypes for experimental validation. This additive manufacturing technology enables 3D printing at the micro and nano scale, creating optimized carbon nanolattices.\n\nThese optimized nanolattices more than doubled the strength of existing designs, withstanding a stress of 2.03 megapascals for every cubic metre per kilogram of its density, which is about five times higher than titanium.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the first time machine learning has been applied to optimize nano-architected materials, and we were shocked by the improvements,\u201d says Serles. \u201cIt didn\u2019t just replicate successful geometries from the training data; it learned from what changes to the shapes worked and what didn\u2019t, enabling it to predict entirely new lattice geometries.\n\n\n\n\u201cMachine learning is normally very data intensive, and it\u2019s difficult to generate a lot of data when you\u2019re using high-quality data from finite element analysis. But the multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm only needed 400 data points, whereas other algorithms might need 20,000 or more. So, we were able to work with a much smaller but an extremely high-quality data set.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe hope that these new material designs will eventually lead to ultra-light weight components in aerospace applications, such as planes, helicopters and spacecraft that can reduce fuel demands during flight while maintaining safety and performance,\u201d says Filleter. \u201cThis can ultimately help reduce the high carbon footprint of flying.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFor example, if you were to replace components made of titanium on a plane with this material, you would be looking at fuel savings of 80 litres per year for every kilogram of material you replace,\u201d adds Serles.\n\n\n\nOther contributors to the project include Professors Yu Zou (MSE), Chandra Veer Singh (MSE), Jane Howe (MSE, ChemE) and Charles Jia (ChemE), as well as international collaborators from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Rice University in the United States.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis was a multi-faceted project that brought together various elements from material science, machine learning, chemistry and mechanics to help us understand how to improve and implement this technology,\u201d says Serles, who is now a Schmidt Science Fellow at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).\n\n\n\n\u201cOur next steps will focus on further improving the scale up of these material designs to enable cost effective macroscale components,\u201d adds Filleter.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn addition, we will continue to explore new designs that push the material architectures to even lower density while maintaining high strength and stiffness.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: Serles P, Yeo J, Hach\u00e9 M, et al.

            "content": "If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Applied Materials' (NASDAQ:AMAT) returns on capital, so let's have a look.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Applied Materials:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.30 = US$7.9b \u00f7 (US$34b - US$8.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2024).\n\nThus, Applied Materials has an ROCE of 30%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.6% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nView our latest analysis for Applied Materials\n\nNasdaqGS:AMAT Return on Capital Employed January 27th 2025\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Applied Materials' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Applied Materials .\n\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\n\nWe like the trends that we're seeing from Applied Materials. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 30%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 78% more capital is being employed now too. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Applied Materials thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.\n\nOur Take On Applied Materials' ROCE\n\nIn summary, it's great to see that Applied Materials can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. Since the stock has returned a staggering 228% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.\n\nBefore jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

Underpinning the declines: the concern that the performance of DeepSeek's model rivals its U.S. counterparts while requiring less computing power, raising questions about the market for and necessity of expensive AI technology.\n\nSome Wall Street watchers saw an opportunity to buy the dip. Wedbush analysts called it a \u201cgolden buying opportunity\u201d to own Nvidia, along with Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Palantir (PLTR), and other heavyweights of the American AI ecosystem.\n\nThe analysts called DeepSeek\u2019s accomplishments \u201cimpressive,\u201d but suggested major U.S. companies are unlikely to use a Chinese startup like DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure, adding that \u201claunching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing\u2026 launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.\u201d\n\nBernstein analysts called the market reaction \u201coverblown,\u201d and said they continue to view AI stocks in their coverage favorably, particularly Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO). Bernstein maintained \u201coutperform\u201d ratings for both stocks, as well as Qualcomm (QCOM) and Applied Materials (AMAT).\n\nCiti analysts, who maintained a \u201cbuy\u201d rating for Nvidia, said recent AI spending measures, including President Trump\u2019s announcement of a $500 billion AI infrastructure project called Stargate point to the continued need for advanced U.S. chips.\n\nRaymond James analysts added that DeepSeek\u2019s advances could also push U.S. hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon (AMZN) to act with greater urgency, to the benefit of more established firms. They reiterated a \u201cstrong buy\u201d for Nvidia and ASML (ASML), and \"outperform\u201d ratings for Marvell Technology (MRVL), Arm (ARM), AMD (AMD), Micron Technology (MU), Lam Research (LRCX), Applied Materials, and KLA (KLAC).",

(NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s radar.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently broke down the market\u2019s performance on Tuesday, discussing how President Donald Trump\u2019s early days in office might be influencing investor sentiment. He speculated that the stock rally could be tied to a belief among investors that Trump\u2019s promises on tariffs may be harsher than his actual actions, leading to optimism.\n\nCramer pointed out that during Trump\u2019s first presidency, investors learned to buy stocks during moments of market volatility caused by his aggressive rhetoric. He noted that Trump\u2019s frequent saber-rattling would often prompt sell-offs, but those moments, when stocks of companies he criticized dropped, turned out to be prime opportunities to invest.\n\nCramer explained that this pattern of buying the dips was exactly what played out on Tuesday. After months of discussing high tariffs, Trump\u2019s inaugural speech struck a more tempered tone, and he avoided threatening severe trade barriers. According to Cramer, this shift in rhetoric surprised many, especially given how aggressive his stance had been in the past.\n\n\u201cMaybe four years is a long time ago, but people seem to forget the Trump drill. The president loves the stock market. He always loves to send signals that all hell is going to break loose and when it doesn\u2019t, well guess what? The market flies.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Discussed 9 Stocks for This Week\u2019s Game Plan and 9 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar\n\nCramer also suggested that this latest market rally is driven by the prospect of tariffs, especially on tariffs that are smaller than initially forecasted. He mentioned that these could increase if foreign countries don\u2019t comply with U.S. demands. Furthermore, Cramer highlighted the role of new projects such as Stargate, an AI infrastructure initiative backed by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. He noted that this project, which will involve new data centers likely outfitted with Nvidia technology, was another contributing factor to the market\u2019s upbeat performance. Cramer noted that the presence of major tech leaders at the inauguration further reinforced optimism.",

Some of the company's key customers include Samsung, Intel, TSMC, and Micron.\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, Applied Materials has a global presence with operations in over 20 countries. The company has a strong track record of innovation and has been recognized for its achievements and contributions to the industry. In 2020, Applied Materials was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 16th consecutive year, reflecting its commitment to sustainability and social responsibility.\n\nA seasoned management team leads Applied Materials with decades of experience in semiconductors and related industries. The company's Chief Executive Officer is Gary Dickerson, who has been with Applied Materials since 2013 and has led the company through sustained growth and innovation. Other key management team members include Brice Hill, Chief Financial Officer and Omkaram Nalamasu, Chief Technology Officer.\n\nApplied Materials has delivered strong financial performance over the past few years, driven by the growing demand for advanced semiconductor and display technologies. The company has been reporting modest increases in revenue, net income, and profit margin over the past several years.\n\nApplied Materials' valuation metrics align with its industry peers with price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios that parallel the industry. Its strong financial performance, growth prospects, and favorable industry trends support its valuation. Applied Materials' stock price has been on an upward trend over the past few years, driven by the company's strong financial performance and growth prospects. However, the company's stock price has been somewhat volatile in recent months due to global supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions.\n\nThe semiconductor industry has been experiencing strong growth in recent years, driven by the increasing demand for advanced electronics and digitalization. However, the industry faces significant challenges, including rising geopolitical tensions, global supply chain disruptions, and regulatory pressures. Given its strong technology portfolio and established customer relationships, Applied Materials is well-positioned to capitalize on the industry's growth prospects. The company also faces intense competition from industry peers such as Lam Research and ASML.\n\nGiven the industry's strong growth prospects, many governments worldwide are investing heavily in developing their semiconductor industries to reduce reliance on imports and enhance national security. This has led to increased competition and regulatory pressures in the industry, which could impact Applied Materials' growth prospects and profitability.\n\nIn addition, the industry is subject to significant cyclical fluctuations, which can lead to sharp declines in demand and revenue. This can be particularly challenging for Applied Materials, which relies heavily on the semiconductor industry for its revenue and profits.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, Applied Materials is focused on expanding its product portfolio, diversifying its customer base, and investing in research and development to maintain its competitive edge. The company also works closely with governments and industry partners to promote open trade and reduce regulatory barriers.\n\nAnother growth opportunity for Applied Materials is its leadership in developing equipment for manufacturing OLED displays, which are used in high-end smartphones and televisions. The company's innovations in this area have helped to reduce the cost of manufacturing OLED displays and increase their performance, making them more accessible to a broader range of consumers.\n\nWhile Applied Materials is well-positioned for growth, the company faces several risks and challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry, which can lead to fluctuations in demand and revenue. The industry is also subject to significant geopolitical risks, such as trade tensions between the US and China, which can impact demand for semiconductors and disrupt supply chains.\n\nIn addition, there is intense competition in the semiconductor equipment market, with some well-established players and new entrants vying for market share. Applied Materials faces stiff competition from companies like ASML, Lam Research, and KLA, which also provide equipment and services for semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, Applied Materials has implemented a number of risk management strategies, including diversifying its customer base and product offerings, investing in R&D to maintain its competitive edge, and maintaining a strong balance sheet to weather industry downturns.",

(NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against other undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nGlobal market intelligence firm IDC, in its most recent report, projected a 15% growth for the global semiconductor market in 2025, driven by the relentless rise in demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC). According to their analysts, this surge will be fueled by forthcoming upgrades in key application markets, notably cloud data centers. Further emphasizing the industry\u2019s promising growth outlook, Nicolas Gaudois, head of Asia-Pacific technology research at UBS, stated in a recent CNBC interview that AI-compute will continue to underpin growth in 2025. He observed:\n\n\u201cThe 21% growth in the semiconductor market was mostly driven by AI-compute demand while non-AI growth actually declined. In 2025, AI would remain the growth driver with 40% growth but we expect non-AI portion to also grow by 17% due to several factors such as autos and industrial markets growth improving, restocking (customers buying for their inventories) in those markets and also increase in semiconductor content in devices to support edge (on-device) AI.\u201d\n\nNicolas also suggested that GPU chipmakers and foundries will remain the main beneficiaries of AI demand and will make the most money from it. With the semiconductor space ripe for further growth, we have picked 10 semiconductor stocks that are undervalued and are best placed to benefit from this growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo identify the 10 undervalued semiconductor stocks, we carried out thorough research and used stock screeners to compile a list of U.S.-listed companies. Our criteria included a market capitalization of over $2 billion, an expected share price upside of at least 10%, and a Forward PE ratio below 30x. Ultimately, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their upside potential. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Applied Materials, Inc.

            "content": "Researchers at the University of Toronto\u2019s Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering have used machine learning to design nano-architected materials that have the strength of carbon steel but the lightness of Styrofoam.\n\nIn a new paper published in Advanced Materials, a team led by Professor Tobin Filleter (MIE) describes how they made nanomaterials with properties that offer a conflicting combination of exceptional strength, light weight and customizability. The approach could benefit a wide range of industries, from automotive to aerospace.\n\n\u201cNano-architected materials combine high performance shapes, like making a bridge out of triangles, at nanoscale sizes, which takes advantage of the \u2018smaller is stronger\u2019 effect, to achieve some of the highest strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios, of any material,\u201d says Peter Serles (MIE MASc 1T9, MIE PhD 2T4), the first author of the new paper.\n\n\u201cHowever, the standard lattice shapes and geometries used tend to have sharp intersections and corners, which leads to the problem of stress concentrations. This results in early local failure and breakage of the materials, limiting their overall potential.\n\n\u201cAs I thought about this challenge, I realized that it is a perfect problem for machine learning to tackle.\u201d\n\nNano-architected materials are made of tiny building blocks or repeating units measuring a few hundred nanometres in size \u2014 it would take more than 100 of them patterned in a row to reach the thickness of a human hair. These building blocks, which in this case are composed of carbon, are arranged in complex 3D structures called nanolattices.\n\nTo design their improved materials, Serles and Filleter worked with Professor Seunghwa Ryu and PhD student Jinwook Yeo at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon, South Korea. This partnership was initiated through U of T\u2019s International Doctoral Clusters program, which supports doctoral training through research engagement with international collaborators.\n\nThe KAIST team employed the multi-objective Bayesian optimization machine learning algorithm. This algorithm learned from simulated geometries to predict the best possible geometries for enhancing stress distribution and improving the strength-to-weight ratio of nano-architected designs.\n\nSerles then used a two-photon polymerization 3D printer housed in the Centre for Research and Application in Fluidic Technologies (CRAFT) to create prototypes for experimental validation. This additive manufacturing technology enables 3D printing at the micro and nano scale, creating optimized carbon nanolattices.\n\nThese optimized nanolattices more than doubled the strength of existing designs, withstanding a stress of 2.03 megapascals for every cubic metre per kilogram of its density, which is about five times higher than titanium.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time machine learning has been applied to optimize nano-architected materials, and we were shocked by the improvements,\u201d says Serles. \u201cIt didn\u2019t just replicate successful geometries from the training data; it learned from what changes to the shapes worked and what didn\u2019t, enabling it to predict entirely new lattice geometries.\n\n\u201cMachine learning is normally very data intensive, and it\u2019s difficult to generate a lot of data when you\u2019re using high-quality data from finite element analysis. But the multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm only needed 400 data points, whereas other algorithms might need 20,000 or more. So, we were able to work with a much smaller but an extremely high-quality data set.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hope that these new material designs will eventually lead to ultra-light weight components in aerospace applications, such as planes, helicopters and spacecraft that can reduce fuel demands during flight while maintaining safety and performance,\u201d says Filleter. \u201cThis can ultimately help reduce the high carbon footprint of flying.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, if you were to replace components made of titanium on a plane with this material, you would be looking at fuel savings of 80 litres per year for every kilogram of material you replace,\u201d adds Serles.\n\nOther contributors to the project include Professors Yu Zou (MSE), Chandra Veer Singh (MSE), Jane Howe (MSE, ChemE) and Charles Jia (ChemE), as well as international collaborators from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Rice University in the United States.\n\n\u201cThis was a multi-faceted project that brought together various elements from material science, machine learning, chemistry and mechanics to help us understand how to improve and implement this technology,\u201d says Serles, who is now a Schmidt Science Fellow at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).\n\n\u201cOur next steps will focus on further improving the scale up of these material designs to enable cost effective macroscale components,\u201d adds Filleter.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we will continue to explore new designs that push the material architectures to even lower density while maintaining high strength and stiffness.\u201d",

But people work and play in oceans and estuaries, and they could benefit from flexible and saltwater-safe power sources. Now, researchers report in ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces a yarn-like battery prototype that works when immersed in seawater. They knotted the rechargeable strands into a fishing net that lit up LEDs and wove a fabric that powered a timer.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlexible, yarn-like batteries can be knit or woven into various shapes. These stringy energy sources are lightweight and are often designed to be waterproof. But rather than avoid battery exposure to water entirely, scientists have proposed using salty water as a critical battery component: the electrolyte (a liquid that conducts electricity through ions). Yan Qiao, Zhisong Lu and colleagues previously developed a water-friendly battery made with carbon fiber and cotton yarn. This prior work used sweat from the body as the electrolyte for exercise monitors. Like sweat, seawater, which contains sodium, chloride and sulfate ions, can serve as an electrolyte. So, Qiao, Lu and a new team wanted to develop a marine version of a rechargeable, yarn-like battery that could be used to power lights on fishing nets, life jackets or mooring lines for buoys.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create electrodes for the seawater batteries, the group treated carbon fiber bundles with electrically conductive coatings: nickel hexacyanoferrate for the positive electrode (cathode) and polyamide for the negative electrode (anode). Then researchers twisted two bundles together to form yarn-like cathode and anode strings. To prepare a battery, the researchers wrapped the cathode string in a layer of fiberglass, laid it along the anode, and encased both strands in a nonwoven, permeable fabric. The fabric protects the electrodes while also allowing in seawater to contact the electrodes. In tests using saltwater, the battery continued to store an electrical charge after being bent 4000 times. Then, when evaluated in seawater, it retained most of the initial charging efficiency and storage capacity over 200 charge and discharge cycles.\n\nWant more breaking news?

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 High Growth Semiconductor Stocks That Are Profitable Heading into 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against other high growth semiconductor stocks that are profitable.\n\nSemiconductors have led industrial advancements and aided key applications such as personal computing, data centers, and cloud computing. As per PwC, Memory ICs were the fastest-growing semiconductor category over the previous 2 decades, with DRAM and HBM standing out. The broader DRAM market is supported by cost and scale, while HBM, because of its advanced technological requirements, reflects a high-barrier, closed-loop ecosystem.\n\nGlobal Semiconductor Sales Rose 20.7% YoY in November 2024\n\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) announced that global semiconductor sales touched $57.8 billion during November 2024 month, demonstrating 20.7% growth as compared to November 2023 total of $47.9 billion and 1.6% growth as compared to the October 2024 total of $56.9 billion. As per the report published by SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International), the semiconductor industry is expected to begin 18 new fab construction projects in 2025. These new projects will include three 200mm and fifteen 300mm facilities. Notably, the majority will begin operations from 2026 \u2013 2027.\n\nIn 2025, the Americas and Japan will be the leading regions with 4 projects each. Next, China and Europe & Middle East regions have 3 planned construction projects. Finally, Taiwan has 2 planned projects, with Korea and Southeast Asia having 1 project each for this year. As per SEMI\u2019s President and CEO, investments have been fueling leading-edge and mainstream technologies to cater to dynamic global demands. Gen-AI and high-performance computing continue to fuel advancements in the leading-edge logic and memory segments. However, mainstream nodes have supported crucial automotive, IoT, and power electronics applications.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nSemiconductor Capacity to Ramp Up\n\nSEMI projects semiconductor capacity to accelerate further, with a 6.6% yearly growth rate to a total of 33.6 million wafers per month (wpm) for 2025. This expansion is expected to primarily stem from leading-edge logic technologies in high-performance computing (HPC) applications and higher penetration of generative AI in edge devices. Overall, the broader semiconductor industry continues to focus on building advanced computing capabilities, and responding to the increased computational demands of LLMs.\n\nMoving forward, foundry suppliers are expected to be the leaders in purchases of semiconductor equipment. The Foundry segment can increase capacity by 10.9% YoY, increasing from 11.3 million wpm in 2024 to 12.6 million wpm in 2025.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 10 High Growth Semiconductor Stocks That Are Profitable Heading into 2025, we conducted extensive research and scanned through several online rankings to shortlist companies having ~10% revenue growth over the previous 5 years and TTM net income of at least $400 million. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q3 2024. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)\n\n5-year Sales Growth: ~13.22%\n\nTTM net income: $7,177.0 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is engaged in the provision of manufacturing equipment, services, and software to the semiconductor, display, and related industries. Morningstar believes that the company tends to benefit from good AI investment and broader demand across semiconductor markets. The firm expects 8% compound annual sales growth for Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) through fiscal 2029. Furthermore, it projects strong growth for the company in fiscal 2025 and 2026, aided partly by strong capacity expansions at chipmakers to supply AI demand. The company\u2019s system sales are the most cyclical, while its services business is stable, which supports offsetting some cyclicality on the top line.\n\nMorningstar gave a wide moat rating to the company, given its intangible assets and switching costs. As per the firm, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has the most comprehensive portfolio of equipment for semiconductor manufacturing. The company is expected to benefit from drivers of chip complexity, such as gate-all-around transistors and advanced packaging. Furthermore, Morningstar expects the company to focus on generating strong cash flow while prioritizing R&D investment.\n\nKeyCorp upgraded the shares of Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) from a \u201cSector weight\u201d rating to an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating, providing a price target of $225.00 on 17th January. Vltava Fund, an investment management company, recently released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cIn the quarter just ended, we added to the portfolio two new companies from the technology sector: Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Lam Research. Both are in the same industry as is another of our investments that we have held for some time, KLA Corporation. This industry is termed semiconductor devices and materials. One chapter in Hidden Investment Treasures is devoted to investing in technology companies and, among other things, the controversy over what really constitutes a technology company. As investors, we try to view technology companies not according to the industry into which they are formally classified but by whether the technologies and technological processes used in the production of their products and services are an essential element in value creation or if they are a source of long-term, sustainable competitive advantage. Among the companies that are formally categorized as technology-based and fall into either the Information Technology or the Communications Services sector, we find some that can be said to be just that but also others for which this classification is at least debatable. Similarly, among companies that do not formally belong to these two sectors, we find many that clearly are built to a large extent on technology and base their market positions and competitiveness on it. In the cases of Applied Materials and Lam Research, there can be no doubt that these are technology companies not only as a formality but also in fact. Applied Materials provides manufacturing equipment, services, and software for the semiconductor, display, and related industries. Its principal business activities are semiconductor systems and Applied Global Services. Its largest customers are Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors, but its overall clientele is more diversified than is that of Lam Research. At first glance, it would appear that Applied Materials has a somewhat less tangible and definable competitive advantage compared to KLA Corporation and Lam Research, but the numbers do not support such a view. Net margins likewise in the neighborhood of 27% and ROCE around 30% are outstanding. Basically, it can be said that all three companies we own have very similar underlying profitability metrics. Even their valuations, growth, and potential are similar. All have strong free cash flow and strong balance sheets, and they are regularly buying back their own shares over the long term and in large volumes\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, AMAT ranks 5th on our list of high growth semiconductor stocks that are profitable heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AMAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than AMAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Valued at a market cap of $156.3 billion , Applied Materials, Inc. ( AMAT ) provides innovative manufacturing equipment, services, and software to the semiconductor, display, and related industries, enabling improvements in device performance, yield, and cost. With a global presence and expertise in advanced technologies, it supports manufacturers in producing cutting-edge semiconductor chips, displays, and electronic components. The Santa Clara, California-based company is slated to announce its fiscal Q1 2025 earnings results on Thursday, Feb. 20.\n\nAhead of this event, analysts expect the semiconductor equipment maker to report a profit of $2.28 per share, a 7% growth from $2.13 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company has exceeded Wall Street's earnings expectations in the past four quarters. In the most recent quarter, AMAT surpassed the consensus EPS estimate by a 6.4% margin.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, analysts expect AMAT to report EPS of $9.37, marking a growth of 8.3% from $8.65 in fiscal 2024 . In addition, EPS is expected to grow 8.4% year-over-year to $10.16 in fiscal 2026.\n\nShares of Applied Materials have risen 25.2% over the past 52 weeks, slightly lagging behind the broader S&P 500 Index's ( $SPX ) 26.5% gain . But, the stock has outpaced the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's ( XLK ) 22.1% return over the same period.\n\nDespite reporting stronger-than-expected Q4 2024 adjusted EPS of $2.32 and revenue of $7.1 billion on Nov. 14, Applied Materials' stock dropped 9.2% the next day due to disappointing Q1 2025 guidance . The company cited headwinds from the tech cold war with China, as it scales back operations in compliance with regulations restricting advanced semiconductor technology, impacting its revenue outlook. Guidance for Q1 revenue of $7.1 billion to $7.2 billion fell short of consensus estimates, with a 28% projected drop in display revenue. Although adjusted EPS guidance of $2.11 - $2.47 slightly exceeded expectations, concerns about revenue growth drove the sell-off.\n\nAnalysts' consensus view on AMAT stock remains cautiously optimistic, with a \"Moderate Buy\" rating overall. Out of 33 analysts covering the stock, 20 recommend a \"Strong Buy,\" two \"Moderate Buys,\" 10 give a \"Hold\" rating, and one suggests a \"Strong Sell.\" The average analyst price target for AMAT is $211.50, suggesting a potential upside of 10.1% from the current levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nAfter soaking in salty water, these rechargeable strands lit up LEDs (top image) and powered a timer (bottom image). Credit: ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2024). DOI: 10.1021/acsami.4c16439\n\nMost batteries are rigid and incompatible with water. But people work and play in oceans and estuaries, and they could benefit from flexible and saltwater-safe power sources.\n\nNow, researchers report in ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces on a yarn-like battery prototype that works when immersed in seawater. They knotted the rechargeable strands into a fishing net that lit up LEDs and wove a fabric that powered a timer.\n\nFlexible, yarn-like batteries can be knit or woven into various shapes. These stringy energy sources are lightweight and are often designed to be waterproof. But rather than avoid battery exposure to water entirely, scientists have proposed using salty water as a critical battery component: the electrolyte (a liquid that conducts electricity through ions).\n\nYan Qiao, Zhisong Lu and colleagues had previously developed a water-friendly battery made with carbon fiber and cotton yarn. This prior work used sweat from the body as the electrolyte for exercise monitors. Like sweat, seawater\u2014which contains sodium, chloride and sulfate ions\u2014can serve as an electrolyte. So, Qiao, Lu and a new team wanted to develop a marine version of a rechargeable, yarn-like battery that could be used to power lights on fishing nets, life jackets or mooring lines for buoys.\n\nTo create electrodes for the seawater batteries, the group treated carbon fiber bundles with electrically conductive coatings: nickel hexacyanoferrate for the positive electrode (cathode) and polyamide for the negative electrode (anode). Then the researchers twisted two bundles together to form yarn-like cathode and anode strings.\n\nTo prepare a battery, the team wrapped the cathode string in a layer of fiberglass, laid it along the anode, and encased both strands in a nonwoven, permeable fabric. The fabric protects the electrodes while also allowing in seawater to contact the electrodes. In tests using saltwater, the battery continued to store an electrical charge after being bent 4,000 times. Then, when evaluated in seawater, it retained most of the initial charging efficiency and storage capacity over 200 charge and discharge cycles.\n\nFinally, as a proof-of-concept, the group knotted battery strands together into a fishing net and wove a rectangular piece of fabric. The net was then soaked in seawater to absorb the electrolyte and was charged. The net battery lit up a 10-LED panel. Similarly, the fabric submerged in a sodium sulfate solution powered a timer for more than an hour.\n\nThe researchers say their yarn-like battery has potential as an energy source in marine applications.\n\nMore information: Yihao Jian et al, Constructing High-Performance Yarn-Shaped Electrodes via Twisting-after-Coating Technique for Weavable Seawater Battery, ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2024).

            "content": "UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 In the COVID-19 pandemic era, at-home, portable tests were crucial for knowing when to wear a mask or isolate at home. Now, Penn State engineering researchers have developed a portable and wireless device to simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and vitamin C, a critical nutrient that helps bolster infection resistance, by integrating commercial transistors with printed laser-induced graphene.\n\nTheir results were published as the cover article of the November 2024 issue of ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces. By simultaneously detecting the virus and vitamin C levels, the test could help individuals and their health care providers decide on more effective treatment options, the researchers said. For example, someone with low vitamin C levels may benefit from a supplemental boost, while someone with normal or high vitamin C levels may need to consider other options.\n\n\u201cThere are several studies that show that vitamin C can help with managing the symptoms of viral respiratory infections like SARS-CoV-2,\u201d said corresponding author Aida Ebrahimi, the Thomas and Sheila Roell Early Career Associate Professor of electrical engineering, of biomedical engineering and of materials science and engineering. \u201cThere are testing platforms for vitamin C, but they are bulky, expensive and not suitable for point-of-care, at home testing. Our device is portable, easy to operate and can detect vitamin C and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, with the option to add new target molecules to the same testing platform in the future.\u201d\n\nResearchers chose to test vitamin C and SARS-CoV-2 not only for their clinical importance for patients, but also to demonstrate the versatility of their testing approach.\n\n\u201cWe used vitamin C and SARS-CoV-2 as model targets to demonstrate the applicability of our approach for detecting biomarkers with the two common types of sensors used in the biosensors community: those with a capture element to \u2018capture\u2019 the target molecules, and those without one,\u201d Ebrahimi said. \u201cWe used the molecules to show our improvement in the test\u2019s functionality compared to existing methods.\u201d",

(NASDAQ:AMAT) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 82% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nAnd things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$17b in market cap last week. One-year return to shareholders is currently 15% and last week\u2019s gain was the icing on the cake.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Applied Materials.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Applied Materials\n\nNasdaqGS:AMAT Ownership Breakdown January 20th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Applied Materials?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Applied Materials. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Applied Materials' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nNasdaqGS:AMAT Earnings and Revenue Growth January 20th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Applied Materials. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 9.6% of shares outstanding. With 9.4% and 4.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.",

            "content": "Transforming U.S. Semiconductor Manufacturing with a $1.4B Boost\n\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) has announced a $1.4 billion program under the CHIPS for America initiative to expand semiconductor manufacturing and packaging capabilities. This investment comes at a pivotal time as global demand for advanced semiconductors continues to surge. Let\u2019s break down what this means, how hydrogen plays an unexpected yet vital role, and why this could be a game-changer for everything from supply chains to national security.\n\nMajor Investments in Advanced Packaging\n\nThe newly unveiled CHIPS National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program allocates $300 million to industry leaders like Absolics Inc., Applied Materials Inc., and Arizona State University to develop next-generation substrates and materials. Advanced packaging, a crucial step in semiconductor production, shields fragile chips, enhances connectivity, and boosts performance.\n\nThe largest portion of funding\u2014$1.1 billion\u2014will create Natcast\u2019s Advanced Packaging Facility in Tempe, Arizona. This facility serves as a collaborative space where researchers can test and scale innovations in chip packaging. Imagine it as a playground for cutting-edge ideas, allowing discoveries to transition from the lab to real-world applications.\n\nThe DOC is also leaning on partnerships with leading companies like Analog Devices and Coherent Corp. to advance production capabilities. These efforts collectively aim to establish the United States as a hub for state-of-the-art semiconductor production, reducing reliance on foreign supply chains.\n\nThe Hydrogen Connection\n\nWhile semiconductors might not immediately make you think of hydrogen, this link is more critical than you\u2019d expect. Hydrogen plays a crucial role in chip manufacturing, particularly during processes like wafer annealing, etching, and deposition. These steps require an ultra-pure environment, often achieved using specialized gases like hydrogen.\n\nRecent data shows that the semiconductor sector will significantly contribute to rising demand for industrial gases, including hydrogen. According to a market report, demand for semiconductor-related gases could almost double by 2032, aligning with the industry\u2019s rapid expansion. And this isn\u2019t just a trend in the U.S.; it\u2019s a global shift towards advanced, clean-energy-aligned technology.\n\nWhy This Initiative Matters\n\nThe CHIPS for America program is more than an economic effort. It\u2019s about shoring up national security and reclaiming America\u2019s position in technology innovation. During the 2020 global chip shortage, industries from automotive to healthcare faced production delays, exposing vulnerabilities in supply chains.\n\nBy investing in domestic infrastructure, the U.S. is working to ensure a steady flow of high-quality semiconductors. But there\u2019s also a deeper ripple effect at play. These investments spur job creation\u2014tens of thousands of positions, according to the DOC\u2014impacting not only factory floors but also the surrounding communities.\n\nAbsolics Inc., for instance, is reportedly developing advanced packaging materials that could improve energy efficiency in end-use devices. Meanwhile, companies like Corning and GlobalFoundries are expanding their facilities, incorporating hydrogen-dependent manufacturing to meet demand. These advancements accelerate timelines, with some facilities expected to be operational within a few years.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nWhile the program lays the foundation for a brighter semiconductor future, the road ahead isn\u2019t without challenges. Standards-setting, workforce training, and supply chain alignment will require continued coordination among public and private entities.\n\nYet, the timeline is ambitious. Facilities like Natcast\u2019s in Arizona could be up and running by 2025, ushering in a new era of U.S.-based semiconductor production. If you\u2019re in a tech-dependent industry\u2014or even just someone waiting for the next smartphone release\u2014this means shorter lead times and potentially lower costs in the long run.\n\nHow Does This Impact Us Now?\n\nWhen you hear about massive investments in technology, it\u2019s easy to wonder how it actually affects your day-to-day life. Chances are, the semiconductors produced thanks to these initiatives will end up in things you use regularly\u2014your car, your phone, even the appliances in your home.\n\nThis program also ties into broader sustainability goals. Advanced technologies coming from domestic manufacturing facilities could produce chips that are more energy-efficient, lowering the environmental impact of electronics over their lifecycle. The hydrogen connection further highlights the push for cleaner, smarter manufacturing processes.\n\nBut there\u2019s something else to consider. Beyond gadgets and green tech, this investment reinforces the importance of resilience. The last few years showed us just how vital it is to have control over critical supply chains. A renewed focus on U.S.-based production gives us all a bit more certainty in an uncertain world.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what makes this so exciting. It\u2019s not just high-tech; it\u2019s high-tech with a purpose, a step forward that touches everything from energy to economy to education. Imagine the possibilities as these projects take shape\u2014and you don\u2019t have to wait decades to see the benefits. They\u2019re coming faster than you think.",

            "content": "The BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock ). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA technician in a clean room assembling a semiconductor chip using a microscope.\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) provides equipment, services, and software for the semiconductor industry. This company stands out as a worthwhile investment due to a combination of favorable factors. Firstly, as per the reports of the fiscal year of 2024, Applied generated a record revenue of $27.18 billion. On a GAAP basis, the company recorded a gross margin of 47.5%, a record operating income of $7.87 billion or 28.9% of net sales, and a record EPS of $8.61. Additionally, Applied Materials is betting on one of its most talked about chip designs, the gate-all-around transistor, to drive overall revenue, which was relatively flat year over year at $6.65 billion and down from $6.71 million last quarter. Secondly, the company plans to expand its global EPIC innovation platform with a new collaboration model specifically designed to accelerate the commercialization of advanced chip packaging technologies. The company has convened more than two dozen top R&D leaders from the semiconductor industry to encourage alliances between equipment makers, material providers, device companies and research institutes.\n\nOverall AMAT ranks 15th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against the other semiconductor stocks.\n\nIn an updated forecast, The World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) revised its 2024 projections upward, expecting a strong 19.0% YoY growth in the broader semiconductor market. The global market value for 2024 is now pegged at $627 billion, demonstrating improvement in performance in Q2 2024 and Q3 2024, mainly in the computing sector. Growth in 2024 is expected to be aided by 2 Integrated Circuit segments- Memory, which can increase by 81.0%, and Logic, which is expected to grow by 16.9%.\n\nRegion-wise, the Americas and Asia Pacific are well-placed to lead the recovery, with expected growth rates of 38.9% and 17.5%, respectively.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead for The Semiconductor Market?\n\nWSTS expects broad-based improvement for the semiconductor market in 2025, with an 11.2% growth, resulting in an estimated $697 billion in global market valuation. This growth is expected off the back of the Logic and Memory sectors, which together are expected to surpass $400 billion in value. This consists of a YoY growth of more than 17% for Logic and 13% for Memory. Notably, other semiconductor categories are projected to grow at more modest, single-digit rates, demonstrating a steady expansion for the broader industry.\n\nWSTS believes that, in 2025, all the regions will be well-placed for continued expansion. The Americas and Asia Pacific regions will maintain their double-digit growth year over year.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nKey Trends Likely to Aid Semiconductor Market in 2025\n\nIDC predicted some critical trends in the semiconductor market. While AI-driven rapid growth continues to be on top of the list, the Asia-Pacific IC (Integrated Circuits) design market will continue to heat up. The memory segment is expected to be aided by the increased penetration of high-end products including HBM3 and HBM3e, which are needed for AI Accelerator, and the new generation of HBM4, which is expected to be rolled out in H2 2025. The non-memory segment is expected to be supported by healthy demand for advanced node ICs for AI servers, high-end mobile phone ICs, and WiFi7.\n\nAs per IDC, Asia-Pacific IC design product lines remain rich and diversified. Since inventory levels have been stabilizing, demand for personal devices is picking up, and AI computing continues to extend to a wide range of applications, the overall demand for IC design is expected to increase. Mature nodes (22nm-500nm) continue to have a wide range of applications spanning consumer electronics, industrial control, automotive, and other industry segments. Looking ahead, the demand is anticipated to improve after the correction and oversupply. This is expected to be aided by consumer electronics and periodical inventory replenishment across automotive and industrial control sectors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 7 Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now, we used a screener and sifted through several online rankings. After getting an initial list of 12-15 stocks, we chose the ones that were popular among hedge funds. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is engaged in the provision of manufacturing equipment, services, and software to the semiconductor, display, and related industries. The company has a strong position in the semiconductor equipment market, mainly in deposition technologies. Its product portfolio remains well-aligned with areas of incremental spending in the broader semiconductor industry. This strategic positioning can contribute to market share gains and revenue growth in 2025.\n\nThe semiconductor industry continues to see increased adoption of gate-all-around (GAA) transistors. In fiscal 2024, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) generated more than $2.5 billion in revenue from GAA-related products, and the company anticipates this figure to double by 2025. With the continuous growth in GAA adoption, the company\u2019s addressable market expands, leading to growth opportunities. Therefore, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)\u2019s strong position in GAA technology and Advanced Packaging demonstrates significant growth opportunities.\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) believes that the semiconductor industry is expected to reach a $1 trillion market by 2030 and the company sees healthy demand in leading-edge logic and ICAPS nodes. Vltava Fund, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cIn the quarter just ended, we added to the portfolio two new companies from the technology sector: Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Lam Research. Both are in the same industry as is another of our investments that we have held for some time, KLA Corporation. This industry is termed semiconductor devices and materials. One chapter in Hidden Investment Treasures is devoted to investing in technology companies and, among other things, the controversy over what really constitutes a technology company. As investors, we try to view technology companies not according to the industry into which they are formally classified but by whether the technologies and technological processes used in the production of their products and services are an essential element in value creation or if they are a source of long-term, sustainable competitive advantage. Among the companies that are formally categorized as technology-based and fall into either the Information Technology or the Communications Services sector, we find some that can be said to be just that but also others for which this classification is at least debatable. Similarly, among companies that do not formally belong to these two sectors, we find many that clearly are built to a large extent on technology and base their market positions and competitiveness on it. In the cases of Applied Materials and Lam Research, there can be no doubt that these are technology companies not only as a formality but also in fact. Applied Materials provides manufacturing equipment, services, and software for the semiconductor, display, and related industries. Its principal business activities are semiconductor systems and Applied Global Services. Its largest customers are Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors, but its overall clientele is more diversified than is that of Lam Research. At first glance, it would appear that Applied Materials has a somewhat less tangible and definable competitive advantage compared to KLA Corporation and Lam Research, but the numbers do not support such a view. Net margins likewise in the neighborhood of 27% and ROCE around 30% are outstanding. Basically, it can be said that all three companies we own have very similar underlying profitability metrics. Even their valuations, growth, and potential are similar. All have strong free cash flow and strong balance sheets, and they are regularly buying back their own shares over the long term and in large volumes\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall AMAT ranks 7th on our list of the best semiconductor stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

However, the outlook for companies such as Applied Materials that make the equipment needed to produce microchips and processors is improving amid the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, says Barger.\n\nThe KeyBanc analyst stresses that a recovery in Applied Materials and other chipmaking equipment makers should be anticipated in the year ahead, and he encourages long-term investors to grab shares before the stocks takeoff. AMAT stock has been flat over the past three months, rising only 0.30%.\n\nIs AMAT Stock a Buy?\n\nThe stock of Applied Materials has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 21 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 14 Buy, six Hold, and one Sell recommendations assigned in the last three months. The average AMAT price target of $210.26 implies 12.75% upside from current levels.\n\nRead more analyst ratings on AMAT stock\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Source The Motley Fool\n\nShares of semiconductor equipment giants rallied big on Thursday, with Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT), Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX), and KLA Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC) jumping 4.5%, 4%, and 4.3%.\n\nThese three stocks collectively account for much of the large oligopoly in semiconductor equipment, and each stock has had excellent long-term returns as a result. However, the near-term picture hasn't been as good, with each down between 20% and 32% from their summer highs.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nBut could that pullback be ending as of today? On Thursday, these stocks got a big boost following Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (NYSE: TSM) fourth-quarter earnings release in which TSMC forecast higher-than-expected capital expenditures for the coming year, supporting what it sees as a massive five-year growth cycle ahead.\n\nTSMC's spending-palooza\n\nTSMC is the most important manufacturer in the semiconductor manufacturing industry by far. While other chip manufacturers are trying to catch up with this market leader, TSMC currently has a near-monopoly on today's leading-edge semiconductor production, supporting the world's biggest chip designers, from Nvidia to Apple.\n\nThus, while these companies also have large memory businesses, a lot of their logic revenue comes from TSMC. And again, these stocks were down since summer as investors have come to wonder about the sustainability of the AI buildout. Additionally, non-AI semiconductor markets in PCs and smartphones have been somewhat lackluster.\n\nHowever, TSMC's commentary on the future likely put many concerns to rest. TSMC management now predicts a near-20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for revenue over the next five years, from 2025-2029. Unsurprisingly, that overall outlook is bolstered by a predicted mid-40% annual CAGR for AI accelerators. TSMC noted that AI chips accounted for almost a mid-teens percentage of overall revenue in 2024, with that percentage set to increase significantly.\n\nThat growth of course will need to be supported by new semiconductor equipment, and TSMC forecasts reaccelerating its capital expenditures in the coming year to between $38 billion and $42 billion. That's up a significant 33% at the midpoint over the amount spent in 2024, and also well above the prior annual peak of $36.3 billion spent in 2022.\n\nNeedless to say, a 33% increase in capital expenditures bodes well for Applied, Lam, and KLA. Applied and Lam both make critical etch and deposition equipment for laying down and stripping away transistor materials. Because of the switch to gate-all-around transistors coming this year, as well as the advent of backside power delivery likely in 2026, both Lam and Applied are set to see an expansion of their addressable market, since these innovations require more intense etch and deposition steps.\n\nAdditionally, all of these meticulous manufacturing steps have to be measured for defects at every stage of the process. As the dominant market share leader in metrology and process control equipment, KLA should also see a benefit from TSMC's spending plans.\n\nSemiconductor capital equipment stocks are great long-term holds despite volatility\n\nEach of these semiconductor equipment vendors are excellent buy-and-hold stocks for the long-term investor. Not only is each correlated to the dynamic semiconductor industry, which should grow above GDP for some time, but these companies are also highly profitable and return lots of cash to shareholders.\n\nThe downside is that these stocks can also be highly volatile. After all, these names are down 20%-30% from their highs, and the semiconductor market hasn't even been in a traditional bear market.\n\nBut while these names are cyclical, the chip industry should continue to innovate and make new highs over time. So for investors who can handle 40% or larger drawdowns every so often, these stocks should be on their buy list whenever they dip. Today's strong move off their recent six-month lull is illustration of that.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Applied Materials right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Applied Materials, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Applied Materials wasn\u2019t one of them.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Home Depot, Inc. (HD), RTX Corp. (RTX) and Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT), as well as two micro-cap stocks Kewaunee Scientific Corp. (KEQU) and AXIL Brands, Inc. (AXIL). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nHome Depot\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry over the past six months (+17.8% vs. +12.5%). The company\u2019s recovery in top-line trends is supported by sales from the SRS acquisition. The company delivered better-than-expected sales and EPS in Q3 of fiscal 2024, with year-over-year sales growth fueled by gains in certain seasonal categories due to favorable weather and hurricane-related demand.\n\n\n\nHome Depot gains from its \u201cOne Home Depot\u201d investment plan focused on expanding supply chain facilities, enhancing technology and improving the digital experience. HD is also advancing efforts to build a robust Pro ecosystem. HD raised its sales and EPS view for fiscal 2024, citing strong third-quarter results and projected hurricane-related demand in Q4.\n\n\n\nHowever, comparable sales and EPS remain impacted by higher interest rates and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Home Depot here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of RTX have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+45.4% vs. -1.3%). The company continues to receive ample orders for its wide range of combat-proven defense products from the Pentagon and its foreign allies. It won several notable defense awards during the third quarter.\n\n\n\nA steadily improving commercial air traffic has been bolstering commercial OEM as well as commercial aftermarket sales for the company. RTX holds a solid financial position, which enables it to make successful share repurchases.\n\n\n\nHowever, rising crude price tends to put cost pressures on airlines and may affect the operating results of commercial OEM producers like RTX. The company may also be affected if China enforces its announced sanctions against its missile and defense unit. Supply-chain challenges also pose a threat to RTX\u2019s growth.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on RTX here >>>)\n\n\n\nApplied Materials\u2019 shares have gained +25.9% over the past year against the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry\u2019s gain of +62.3%.

            "content": "Shares of semiconductor equipment giants rallied big on Thursday, with Applied Materials (AMAT 1.41%), Lam Research (LRCX 4.40%), and KLA Corporation (KLAC 2.43%) jumping 4.5%, 4%, and 4.3%.\n\nThese three stocks collectively account for much of the large oligopoly in semiconductor equipment, and each stock has had excellent long-term returns as a result. However, the near-term picture hasn't been as good, with each down between 20% and 32% from their summer highs.\n\nBut could that pullback be ending as of today? On Thursday, these stocks got a big boost following Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (TSM 3.63%) fourth-quarter earnings release in which TSMC forecast higher-than-expected capital expenditures for the coming year, supporting what it sees as a massive five-year growth cycle ahead.\n\nTSMC's spending-palooza\n\nTSMC is the most important manufacturer in the semiconductor manufacturing industry by far. While other chip manufacturers are trying to catch up with this market leader, TSMC currently has a near-monopoly on today's leading-edge semiconductor production, supporting the world's biggest chip designers, from Nvidia to Apple.\n\nThus, while these companies also have large memory businesses, a lot of their logic revenue comes from TSMC. And again, these stocks were down since summer as investors have come to wonder about the sustainability of the AI buildout. Additionally, non-AI semiconductor markets in PCs and smartphones have been somewhat lackluster.\n\nHowever, TSMC's commentary on the future likely put many concerns to rest. TSMC management now predicts a near-20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for revenue over the next five years, from 2025-2029. Unsurprisingly, that overall outlook is bolstered by a predicted mid-40% annual CAGR for AI accelerators. TSMC noted that AI chips accounted for almost a mid-teens percentage of overall revenue in 2024, with that percentage set to increase significantly.\n\nThat growth of course will need to be supported by new semiconductor equipment, and TSMC forecasts reaccelerating its capital expenditures in the coming year to between $38 billion and $42 billion. That's up a significant 33% at the midpoint over the amount spent in 2024, and also well above the prior annual peak of $36.3 billion spent in 2022.\n\nNeedless to say, a 33% increase in capital expenditures bodes well for Applied, Lam, and KLA. Applied and Lam both make critical etch and deposition equipment for laying down and stripping away transistor materials. Because of the switch to gate-all-around transistors coming this year, as well as the advent of backside power delivery likely in 2026, both Lam and Applied are set to see an expansion of their addressable market, since these innovations require more intense etch and deposition steps.\n\nAdditionally, all of these meticulous manufacturing steps have to be measured for defects at every stage of the process. As the dominant market share leader in metrology and process control equipment, KLA should also see a benefit from TSMC's spending plans.\n\nSemiconductor capital equipment stocks are great long-term holds despite volatility\n\nEach of these semiconductor equipment vendors are excellent buy-and-hold stocks for the long-term investor. Not only is each correlated to the dynamic semiconductor industry, which should grow above GDP for some time, but these companies are also highly profitable and return lots of cash to shareholders.\n\nThe downside is that these stocks can also be highly volatile. After all, these names are down 20%-30% from their highs, and the semiconductor market hasn't even been in a traditional bear market.\n\nBut while these names are cyclical, the chip industry should continue to innovate and make new highs over time. So for investors who can handle 40% or larger drawdowns every so often, these stocks should be on their buy list whenever they dip. Today's strong move off their recent six-month lull is illustration of that.",

            "content": "Tech companies are not only driving innovation but are also swiftly adjusting their dividend strategies. In 2024, many prominent tech firms began issuing dividends, significantly boosting the overall dividend pool. Although dividends are traditionally linked with value stocks rather than the high-growth companies fueling the AI surge, analysts suggest this shift broadens the appeal of these stocks to new investor groups while putting surplus cash to use. Typically, growth-focused companies prioritize reinvestment over returning earnings to shareholders. However, experts like Ted Mortonson from Baird argue that these dividend payments won\u2019t undermine the companies\u2019 future dominance. Here are some other comments from the analyst:\n\nNASDAQ\u2019s consistent outperformance can be observed over several years. According to a report by Invesco, since January 1, 2008, the Nasdaq-100 Index has delivered a cumulative total return of 750%, significantly outpacing the broader market\u2019s 315% return. This success is largely attributed to the innovation driven by tech companies, which continues to attract investors. For instance, the technology sector in the broader market has achieved an annualized total return of 20.65% over the past decade, compared to 12.80% for the market. This leadership is understandable given the rapid adoption of technology in recent years. The Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) noted that the Nasdaq-100 has approximately 55% exposure to the tech sector, in contrast to about 32% for the broader market.\n\nThe NASDAQ, heavily comprised of technology stocks, has been on a consistent upward trajectory for some years. In 2023, it experienced remarkable growth, marking its best performance since 2020 with an increase of over 43%. In 2024, the index continued to surpass market expectations with a 28.64% gain. This impressive performance is largely driven by the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, which has significantly boosted major tech stocks and the broader market throughout 2023 and into this year. Analysts suggest that the NASDAQ could be the index of the future, as its companies have shown a strong ability to adapt to evolving market trends.\n\nWe recently published a list of 15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against other best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOverall dividends are becoming increasingly popular among investors, with many US companies either raising or maintaining their payouts. Howard Silverblatt, a Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, suggested that with an anticipated reduction in interest rates by the FOMC in 2025, coupled with record earnings forecasted for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the entire year of 2025, companies might allocate more funds towards substantial dividend hikes in the upcoming year. He further mentioned that February, traditionally the peak month for dividend increases, is expected to see even more significant growth as some firms may look to compensate for previous conservative strategies. In 2024, the large-cap companies in the broader market outperformed many others, achieving record levels in earnings, sales, and dividends. For 2025, a projected 8% rise in dividend payments is expected, up from a 6.4% increase in 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of the third quarter of 2024 and selected companies that are trading on the NASDAQ exchange and also pay dividends to shareholders. From that list, we picked 15 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked in ascending order of hedge funds\u2019 sentiment toward them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nIs Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA technician in a clean room assembling a semiconductor chip using a microscope.\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is a global leader in semiconductor equipment manufacturing, supplying critical tools for creating advanced chips used in AI, data centers, automotive technology, and other sectors. The global semiconductor manufacturing equipment market is projected to more than double by 2032, with Applied Materials likely to be a major beneficiary of this growth. Beyond just selling its equipment, the company has seen a significant boost in revenue from its equipment servicing segment. As manufacturing equipment becomes more complex and specialized, the demand for expert maintenance continues to rise, contributing to this fast-growing part of the business. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by over 16%.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) reported revenue of $7.05 billion, which showed a 5% growth from the same period last year. The company\u2019s net income for the quarter came in at $1.73 billion. Its diverse range of products and services strategically positions the company to support its customers in advancing AI and energy-efficient computing. As these critical areas of semiconductor innovation gain prominence, the industry\u2019s progress increasingly relies on materials engineering, a field where Applied Materials holds a leading position.\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) also showed a strong cash position in FY24. The company reported an operating cash flow of $8.68 billion during the year. Its free cash flow amounted to $7.5 billion. Moreover, the company returned approximately $5.01 billion to shareholders, including $1.19 billion in dividends. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has been growing its payouts for seven consecutive years. Currently, it offers a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.89%, as of January 15.\n\nVltava Fund highlighted Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in its recently published Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n\u201cIn the quarter just ended, we added to the portfolio two new companies from the technology sector: Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Lam Research. Both are in the same industry as is another of our investments that we have held for some time, KLA Corporation. This industry is termed semiconductor devices and materials. One chapter in Hidden Investment Treasures is devoted to investing in technology companies and, among other things, the controversy over what really constitutes a technology company. As investors, we try to view technology companies not according to the industry into which they are formally classified but by whether the technologies and technological processes used in the production of their products and services are an essential element in value creation or if they are a source of long-term, sustainable competitive advantage. Among the companies that are formally categorized as technology-based and fall into either the Information Technology or the Communications Services sector, we find some that can be said to be just that but also others for which this classification is at least debatable. Similarly, among companies that do not formally belong to these two sectors, we find many that clearly are built to a large extent on technology and base their market positions and competitiveness on it. In the cases of Applied Materials and Lam Research, there can be no doubt that these are technology companies not only as a formality but also in fact.\n\nOf the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 74 funds held stakes in Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), compared with 77 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $4.6 billion.\n\nOverall, AMAT ranks 6th on our list of best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for AMAT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

The glass substrates will be used as an important advanced packaging technology to increase the performance of leading-edge chips for artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance compute and data centres by reducing power consumption and system complexity.\n\nApplied Materials in Santa Clara, California also sees $100m to develop and scale a silicon-core substrate technology for next-generation advanced packaging and 3D heterogeneous integration.\n\nTHe third project, also with $100m, will see Arizona State University develop the next generation of microelectronics packaging through fan-out-wafer-level-processing (FOWLP). Based at the ASU Advanced Electronics and Photonics Core Facility, the project will explore the commercial viability of 300 mm wafer-level and 600 mm panel-level manufacturing, a technology that does not exist as a commercial capability in the US today.\n\nNatcast\u2019s Advanced Packaging Facility, also in Tempe, Arizona, will see $1.1bn to set up a baseline advanced packaging piloting line to enable the development and commercialization of advanced packaging processes. This aims to enable researchers and industry leaders to develop and test new materials, devices, and advanced packaging.\n\nwww.chips.cov\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, you will like the following ones: don't miss them by subscribing to : If you enjoyed this article, you will like the following ones: don't miss them by subscribing to : eeNews on Google News\n\nShare:",

Listen to this article using the player above. \u2716\n\nRead time: 1 minute\n\nResearchers have demonstrated new wearable technologies that both generate electricity from human movement and improve the comfort of the technology for the people wearing them. The work stems from an advanced understanding of materials that increase comfort in textiles and produce electricity when they rub against another surface.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt issue are molecules called amphiphiles, which are often used in consumer products to reduce friction against human skin. For example, amphiphiles are often incorporated into diapers to prevent chafing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe set out to develop a model that would give us a detailed fundamental understanding of how different amphiphiles affect the surface friction of different materials,\u201d says Lilian Hsiao, corresponding author of a paper on the work and an associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at North Carolina State University. \u201cThe model helps us understand the molecular basis for friction reduction and can be used by engineers to tailor a material\u2019s properties for different applications.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe then began a series of experiments to explore whether we could use amphiphiles to modify materials and incorporate them into haptic energy harvesters,\u201d says Saad Khan, co-corresponding author and INVISTA Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at NC State. \u201cSpecifically, we wanted to know if we could create energy from friction in amphiphile-modified materials. It turns out we could not only generate electricity, but we could do so while also reducing the friction that people wearing these materials experience.\u201d\n\nWant more breaking news?

Subscribe for FREE\n\nIn other words, the researchers found they could use amphiphiles to create wearable fabrics with slippery surfaces that feel good against human skin.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers also found that some amphiphiles have electronic properties that allow them to \u201cdonate\u201d electrons. And when the researchers incorporated those electron-donating amphiphiles into the wearable materials, the end result was a material that was both comfortable and capable of generating electricity through friction produced by rubbing against human skin or other materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe technology for harvesting static energy is well established but devices that can be worn for long periods of time are still missing.\u201d Hsiao says. \u201cIn our proof-of-concept testing, we found these amphiphile materials not only feel good on the skin but could generate up to 300 volts, which is remarkable for a small piece of material.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAn optimal balance between friction needed to generate power and maintaining the comfort of the wearer is paramount in designing haptic technologies and amphiphile chemistry offers a facile way to do so,\u201d Khan says. \u201cWe\u2019re interested in doing more to make use of these materials, such as exploring how they can be incorporated into existing haptic devices. And we\u2019re open to working with industry partners on identifying new applications.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: Jani PK, Yadav K, Derkaloustian M, et al.

Courtesy of TSMC\n\nArizona State University-affiliated research programs and laboratories will receive $1.2 billion in new funding for semiconductor packaging, winning two of four new national awards announced by the U.S. Commerce Department on Wednesday.\n\nThe biggest prize, worth $1.1 billion, will go to the Natcast Advanced Packaging Facility to be built in the ASU Research Park in southeast Tempe. This laboratory will be part of an effort to bridge the gap between research and commercial production and will involve testing new materials and devices used in specific packaging segments.\n\nNatcast is a nonprofit entity tied to the Commerce Department and will operate the new facility, which was announced on Jan. 6 but without a definitive funding amount. The laboratory is expected to draw researchers from around the nation, from startups to large manufacturers.\n\nPackaging is the process of protecting semiconductors and connecting them to the myriad of electronic devices they power, in intricate ways that ensure performance and enhance speed while minimizing power use \u2014 all on an increasingly diminutive scale.\n\n\u201cBolstering our advanced packaging capabilities is key to America remaining a global leader in leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing,\u201d said Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, in a prepared statement. These and other investments under the CHIPS and Science Act \u201cwill strengthen our end-to-end semiconductor ecosystem and help close the gap between invention and commercialization to ensure the U.S. is a global leader in semiconductor innovation and manufacturing.\u201d\n\nThe Commerce Department also finalized awards of $100 million each to projects in two other states.\n\nOne will go to Absolics Inc. in Covington, Georgia, to support the company\u2019s research in glass-core packaging, which focuses on reducing power consumption and the complexity of semiconductor systems used in artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and data centers.\n\nThat\u2019s in addition to $100 million for Applied Materials in Santa Clara, California, for packaging used in energy-efficient AI and high-performance computing. Applied Materials also will conduct research at the Natcast facility at ASU.\n\nArizona already had received a disproportionately high amount of awards under the CHIPS Act, including $6.6 billion for the new Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing complex in north Phoenix, about $3.9 billion for Intel\u2019s campus in Chandler and around $400 million going to Amkor Technology, a leading packaging provider, for a new plant in Peoria.\n\nReach the writer at russ.wiles@arizonarepublic.com.",

Analyst Caso highlighted that the upcoming MI350 chip series, set to launch in the second half of the year, could act as a \u201ccatalyst\u201d for the company.\n\nUnlike the MI325, which focuses primarily on increasing memory capacity, the MI350 is expected to feature a more substantial redesign and significant upgrades.\n\nAdditionally, Dell Technologies recently announced plans to integrate AMD processors into its corporate-targeted computers for the first time.\n\nThis move, previously limited to Dell\u2019s consumer PC lineup, signals potential market share gains for AMD in the client computing segment, Caso noted.",

Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices and is considered by the Federal Reserve to be a more reliable measure of price pressures, slowed last month to its lowest level since July.\n\nMarket participants have become increasingly antsy in recent weeks that strong economic data will prevent the Fed from cutting interest rates this year nearly as aggressively as they once expected. Some have even become nervous that officials may need to reverse course and raise rates again to return inflation to the Fed's 2% target.\n\nNew Inflation Data Favors Another Rate Cut\n\nWednesday's inflation report helped reassure investors that the Fed will lower its benchmark federal funds rate at some point this year. The odds of at least one 25-basis-point rate cut by the middle of the year increased to 64% from 57% Tuesday, according to fed funds futures trading data. The odds of no cut this year declined to less than 17% from nearly 26%.\n\nA slew of strong economic reports and the imminent inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump\u2014whose tax, immigration, and tariff policies some economists warn could reinvigorate inflation\u2014has caused yields to climb relatively steadily in recent months. Since mid-September, the 10-year Treasury yield, which influences an array of commercial and consumer lending rates, has increased by more than 1 percentage point, while the Fed has cut interest rates by the same amount.\n\nRising yields have weighed on stocks. The S&P 500 as of Wednesday had pulled back about 3% from the record high it hit in early December. Higher rates hurt equities by raising borrowing costs for businesses, eating into their profits, and diverting capital from the stock market to bonds. Stocks popped on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 on track to have its best day since November.\n\nTreasury yields also have lifted interest rates for consumers, including prospective homebuyers. Mortgage rates have crept higher since September, making a historically expensive housing market even less affordable.",

Sure, I own a few stocks that should benefit from long-term AI tailwinds, but as far as direct artificial intelligence plays, there aren't many.\n\nOne of my 2025 investing New Years resolutions is to increase my exposure to the massive opportunity in AI, and in January, I plan to buy two stocks in particular, one of which I already own, and another that could be an excellent long-term investment regardless of who the winners in the AI chip race are.\n\nA big winner that could keep winning\n\nSea Limited (SE 1.50%) was the best-performing stock in my portfolio in 2024, and it wasn't even close. Shares were up by more than 160% for the year, a stunning turnaround after profitability concerns sent them plunging more than 90% from its 2021 peak.\n\nThe strong performance was well deserved. All three sides of Sea's business looked fantastic. The Shopee e-commerce business grew gross merchandise volume by 25% year over year in the third quarter, expanded its take rate, and achieved adjusted EBITDA profitability for the first time ever. The Sea Money digital finance platform grew its loan portfolio by 70% while simultaneously lowering its percentage of non-performing loans. And finally, the Garena digital entertainment business grew both daily active users and bookings by 25%.\n\nOverall, Sea's revenue grew by 30% over the third quarter of 2023 and the company went from negative-$144 million in net income to a profit of more than $150 million. However, there is still plenty of room to grow margin and scale all three parts of the business. Sea also has tons of AI potential, especially when it comes to optimizing its e-commerce business. With about $10 billion in cash on the balance sheet, Sea Limited has plenty of firepower to pursue opportunities as they arise.\n\nAn under-the-radar AI play at a good value\n\nMuch of the attention surrounding the AI revolution is focused on chipmakers such as Nvidia, and for good reason. But there are some excellent behind-the-scenes companies that could also be excellent investments, and Applied Materials (AMAT 1.41%) is one in particular that I have my eye on.\n\nIf you aren't familiar, Applied Materials produces the equipment that allows Nvidia, Intel, and other chipmakers to manufacture their products. As AI chips get more complex, the equipment needed to make them becomes more specialized, and Applied Materials is the leader in this industry. The global semiconductor manufacturing equipment market is expected to more than double in size by 2032 and Applied Materials could be the biggest winner from this trend.\n\nIn addition to selling its equipment, Applied Materials also generates a nice revenue stream from servicing its equipment, and this has been a fast-growing component of the business in recent years. After all, the more complex and specialized manufacturing equipment is, the more specialized maintenance it requires.\n\nApplied Materials is a highly profitable business and has been for years, and management has a solid history of prioritizing capital return to shareholders, both as buybacks and dividends. With shares about 35% below their 52-week high and close to their lowest price-to-sales ratio in a year, I'm planning on adding this AI winner to my portfolio in January.\n\nJust a starting point\n\nTo be clear, I plan to add to my portfolio's AI exposure throughout 2025, and these are probably not the last two AI stocks I'll be purchasing this year. And that's especially true if the recent market turbulence persists and top AI stocks start trading at more attractive valuations.",

            "content": "Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) saw a premarket increase of $2.91, or 1.70%, settling at $173.78, following a WSJ report highlighting a major investment by Macquarie Group (MQG) into Applied Digital. This investment, potentially reaching up to $5 billion, underscores the growing interest in AI infrastructure. According to the report, the Sydney, Australia-based Macquarie, through its asset-management arm, has committed to an initial $900 million investment in a North Dakota data-center campus, securing a right of first refusal for an additional $4.1 billion over the next 30 months. This deal will be structured as preferred equity, giving Macquarie a 15% stake in Applied Digital\u2019s high-performance computing business while maintaining Applied Digital\u2019s majority control at 85%.\n\nApplied Digital, formerly known as Applied Blockchain prior to its 2022 rebranding, has transitioned from cryptocurrency mining to leveraging the booming AI computing sector. This strategic shift aligns with a broader industry trend, as companies increasingly adapt to meet the soaring demand for AI computing power. Despite this pivot, the company\u2019s stock has seen a modest year-over-year appreciation of over 11%, reflecting a measured level of investor confidence in its new AI-focused direction.\n\nThe financial boost from Macquarie will assist Applied Digital in managing its debt related to the construction of these facilities in North Dakota, allowing it to recoup over $300 million of its equity investment. Wes Cummins, CEO of Applied Digital, emphasized that this deal not only helps in debt management but also provides crucial equity for scaling up data centers which require substantial power capacities, upwards of two gigawatts.\n\nThe AI sector has seen significant investment, with companies like Nvidia (NVDA) leading the charge in market valuation \u2013 $3.26 trillion as of last check \u2013 due to their role in AI chip manufacturing. However, the infrastructure supporting these technologies, like data centers and specialized computing services, also attracts substantial capital. Blackstone\u2019s (BX) investments in AI-supporting companies and Macquarie\u2019s $500 million financing for Lambda, a GPU cloud company, illustrate how financial institutions are finding diverse ways to engage with the AI ecosystem, not just through direct tech investments but also through infrastructure and services.\n\nMacquarie\u2019s involvement in this sector is not new; it has previously led financing for AI computing infrastructure and has a global footprint in data center investments. This latest move with Applied Digital further cements Macquarie\u2019s commitment to the AI industry, recognizing the critical role of infrastructure in the AI boom.\n\nThe challenges in this field include the high cost and energy consumption of AI chips and related infrastructure, which pose significant financing hurdles. Yet, the strategic partnerships like that between Applied Digital and Macquarie show an adaptive approach by companies to leverage available capital, manage financial risks, and meet the escalating demands of AI technology development. This scenario not only boosts the prospects of companies like Applied Digital but also signals a robust investment climate for AI infrastructure, driven by both technological need and investor interest.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

            "content": "To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Applied Materials ( ) we really liked what we saw.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Applied Materials:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.30 = US$7.9b \u00f7 (US$34b - US$8.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2024).\n\nThus, Applied Materials has an ROCE of 30%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 8.6%.\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Applied Materials compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can for free.\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For Applied Materials Tell Us?\n\nWe like the trends that we're seeing from Applied Materials. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 30%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 78%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.\n\nIn Conclusion...\n\nAll in all, it's terrific to see that Applied Materials is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.\n\nWhile Applied Materials looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price.

            "content": "High-temp electrochemical memory\n\nResearchers from the University of Michigan and Sandia National Laboratory propose a nonvolatile electrochemical memory that can store and rewrite information at temperatures over 1100\u00b0F (600\u00b0C), enabling it to continue working in environments as extreme as the surface of Venus.\n\nInstead of transporting electrons, the memory moves oxygen ions between layered materials in a process similar to how a battery charges and discharges. The memory is made up of two layers, the semiconductor tantalum oxide and the metal tantalum, separated by a solid electrolyte. The oxygen ions are guided by a series of three platinum electrodes that control whether the oxygen is drawn into the tantalum oxide or pushed out of it.\n\n\u201cOnce the oxygen atoms leave the tantalum oxide layer, a small region of metallic tantalum is left behind. At the same time, a tantalum oxide layer similarly caps the tantalum metal layer on the opposite side of the barrier. The tantalum and tantalum oxide layers do not mix, similar to oil and water, so these new layers will not revert back to the original state until the voltage is switched,\u201d explained Derek Smith of the College of Engineering at U-M, in a press release. \u201cDepending on the oxygen content of the tantalum oxide, it can act as either an insulator or a conductor\u2014enabling the material to switch between two different voltage states that represent the digital 0s and 1s. Finer control of the oxygen gradient could enable computing inside the memory, with more than 100 resistance states rather than a simple binary. This approach could help reduce power demand.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo far, we\u2019ve built a device that holds one bit, on par with other high-temperature computer memory demonstrations. With more development and investment, it could in theory hold megabytes or gigabytes of data,\u201d said Yiyang Li, assistant professor of materials science and engineering at U-M, in a press release. The information states can be stored above 1100 \u00b0F for more than 24 hours. [1]\n\nPolymer data storage\n\nResearchers at Flinders University used a low-cost polymer made up of sulfur and dicyclopentadiene to store data at densities exceeding typical hard disk drives. An atomic force microscope and a scanning probe instrument were used to make and read small indentations in the material, which can be erased with short bursts of heat and reused several times.\n\n\u201cThis research unlocks the potential for using simple, renewable polysulfides in probe-based mechanical data storage, offering a potential lower-energy, higher density and more sustainable alternative to current technologies,\u201d said Abigail Mann, a PhD candidate from the College of Science and Engineering at Flinders University, in a statement. [2]\n\nMagnetic states in antiferromagnets\n\nResearchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Max Planck Institute, and Seoul National University created an longer-lasting magnetic state in an antiferromagnetic material using a terahertz laser. The laser\u2019s oscillations are tuned to the natural vibrations among the material\u2019s atoms, in a way that shifts the balance of atomic spins toward a new magnetic state.\n\n\u201cAntiferromagnetic materials are robust and not influenced by unwanted stray magnetic fields,\u201d said Nuh Gedik, professor of physics at MIT, in a release. \u201cHowever, this robustness is a double-edged sword; their insensitivity to weak magnetic fields makes these materials difficult to control.\u201d\n\nThe researchers focused on FePS 3 , which transitions to an antiferromagnetic phase at 118K (-247\u00b0 F). Using the terahertz pulse, the team was able to switch the cooled material to a magnetic state lasting several milliseconds even after the laser was turned off. Compared to previous light-induced phase transitions that lasted on the order of a picosecond, the new approach provides an extended window of time in which researchers can probe the properties of the temporary new state before it returns to antiferromagnetism. The team hopes this will aid in further studies trying to optimize antiferromagnets for use in next-generation memory storage technologies. [3]\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Li, J., Jalbert, A.

But that scarcely detracts from the really solid long term returns generated by the company over five years. Indeed, the share price is up an impressive 173% in that time. We think it's more important to dwell on the long term returns than the short term returns. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nView our latest analysis for Applied Materials\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Applied Materials achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 25% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 22% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNasdaqGS:AMAT Earnings Per Share Growth January 12th 2025\n\nThis free interactive report on Applied Materials' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Applied Materials the TSR over the last 5 years was 186%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nApplied Materials shareholders are up 14% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 23% a year, over half a decade) look better. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. Most investors take the time to check the data on insider transactions.

The stock's fantastic run is driven by powerful demand for the company's graphics processing unit (GPU) chips and related technology to enable artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\nThe AI revolution had been gaining steam for several years but hit a big inflection point in late 2022 with OpenAI's launch of its ChatGPT chatbot.

This equates to an almost 30% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Moreover, AI is poised for robust growth over the longer term.\n\nNvidia stock is still a great way to invest in AI. However, some investors might prefer to gain exposure to the AI space by buying an exchange-traded fund (ETF).

Here he offers his insight on transitioning to industry, what businesses consider in commercial deployment, and suggestions to make research more applicable to the real world.\n\nCredit: Image courtesy of William Morris\n\n1) You have broad experiences in research, commercializing products, and business strategy. Tell us about your career path. I completed a Masters in Chemistry at the University of Manchester (2003 \u2212 2007), followed by a PhD at theUniversity of California Los Angeles (2007 \u2212 2012) in the laboratory of Omar Yaghi. My research in the Yaghi laboratory focused on identifying and characterizing chemically stable metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Following the identification of MOFs, I looked to perform chemical transformations on MOFs through postmodification and evaluated the application of these materials in gas adsorption and separation applications. I then attended a postdoc at Northwestern University in Chad Mirkin\u2019s laboratory. In the Mirkin lab, I continued working on MOFs, evaluating how these materials behaved at the nanoscale and, in collaboration with others, how they interact with biological systems. During this time, I also had the opportunity to learn about lithography and DNA-mediated assembly. While at Northwestern, I first heard about Numat, a company focused on commercializing MOFs. I joined Numat in 2015, looking to leverage my scientific training to support Numat\u2019s mission to commercialize MOFs. While at Numat, I have served in several roles, including senior chemist, director of R&D, and today, director of business development.\n\nOver nearly twenty years, my scientific interests have focused on MOFs. During this period, the questions I have asked about these materials have changed significantly. As a graduate student and postdoc, I focused on fundamental research questions. Over the past ten years, my focus alongside the Numat team has shifted to understanding how this class of novel materials can be deployed in commercial applications. This work has focused on applied research, answering real-world testing, scaling, product integration, compliance, and safety questions. Alongside this technical work, I have developed business cases, worked on federally sponsored research programs, and developed robust intellectual property portfolios to support commercialization. My work as an industrial chemist at a growth-stage company draws on many of the skills I established as a graduate chemist as I look to communicate the importance of the work Numat is performing.\n\n2) Can you share why you decided to leave academia and pursue a career in industry? I was looking to take the next step in my scientific career after my postdoc, and I evaluated opportunities both in academia and industry. Like today, the academic job market was competitive, and I wasn\u2019t offered a position in academia. However, I also looked at opportunities in the chemical industry through recruiting events held at Northwestern University. It was there that I learned Numat was recruiting chemists with experience in MOF chemistry, where I was consequently hired into my first industrial role.\n\nAs a postdoc, if I had been offered an academic position before I became aware of the role of Numat, I would probably be working as an academic today. In hindsight, I am glad I transitioned from academia to industry for multiple reasons. First, the chemistry questions one has to answer in an industrial setting around applied research are different, and I have learned a lot about applied chemistry. Second, working at a fast-paced growth-stage company with a multidisciplinary group to commercialize a chemical technology has been fun. Finally, contributing to some of the first commercializations of a technology I worked on through my PhD has been very rewarding.\n\n3) What do you think MOFs are most promising for and why aren\u2019t they widely used yet? The academic literature today is filled with fundamental research on many MOF applications, including adsorption, separation, sensing, catalysis, and biology. In these reports, MOFs often show great promise with improved performance over current materials, enabling new functions or reducing energy costs associated with chemical processes. Although promising, only a handful of MOF applications have transitioned from fundamental research to commercialization. Drawing parallels with other novel chemistries, including lithium-ion batteries and graphene, these materials technologies can take many decades to transition from discovery to commercial deployment. Applications enabled by new materials, including MOFs, face challenges that must be overcome to transition from fundamental research to commercialization. These challenges can be broadly bucketed into applied research and include but are not limited to material scaling, post-processing, integration into a device, prototype testing, safety, and compliance. Each topic must be addressed for a new material class to be commercialized. Therefore, these commercial transitions take a lot of time and resources.\n\nAlongside applied research, the business case for each application where a new material is to be deployed must be developed. This critical component can\u2019t be overlooked if MOFs are to realize broader implementation. A business case should be matured alongside applied research. As development costs and timelines are longer for deploying any new material than applying incumbent material, the business case must justify the development costs of applied research in this area.\n\n4) What major challenges are Numat trying to solve? Numat has investigated multiple business cases for MOFs, identifying two initial markets where MOFs can address major challenges: electronics and extreme environments. Numat has developed two products for these markets: ION-X\u00ae MOFs for subatmospheric gas delivery systems in electronics markets and SNTL\u2122 MOFs for gas filtration in extreme environments. In both cases, customer adoption of these products is driven by safety considerations. ION-X stores toxic gases subatmospherically that are used at global semiconductor manufacturing sites. SNTL is deployed in protective filters and fabrics to capture and degrade toxic gases and chemical warfare agents. Across these products, Numat has spent ten years completing the applied research required to bring these materials to commercialization. This time involves establishing business cases, customers, and distribution partners for these products. To achieve this commercial success, Numat has built a multidisciplinary team, a domestic MOF manufacturing site, and dedicated many people hours to addressing applied research questions.\n\nToday, we are producing MOFs at a multi-ton scale and deploying them in products, enabling a profit-generating business. Numat is looking to accelerate further MOF commercialization efforts, focusing on addressing major energy challenges, including carbon capture, water management, and low-energy separations. Across these applications, we are looking to use our prior experience in MOF commercialization to accelerate MOFs into first-of-a-kind demonstrations. For example, Numat now has a capacity for nearly three hundred tons of MOF production in the United States. Leveraging this production capacity and experience scaling MOFs, we will enable first-of-a-kind demonstrations that use MOFs on rapid timelines.\n\n5) Does Numat collaborate with academia and what is the dynamic of this like? In a fast-moving field like MOFs, it is critical to maintain collaborations and an awareness of the work being performed in academia and other research organizations like National Laboratories. As a growth-stage company spun out of Northwestern University, Numat shares close ties with the laboratory of Professor Farha, one of the founders of Numat. In collaboration with Professor Farha, we have accessed grant funding to support graduate students and postdocs, enabling collaborations between Numat and Northwestern. We have also collaborated with others, providing opinions on MOF commercialization, publishing papers, and looking to access grant funding. Beyond Numat, spinout companies from universities and large companies are looking to bring new MOF research to commercialization. In addition to collaborating with academia, Numat attends conferences, reviews MOF literature, and hires employees from leading academic MOF labs to join the Numat team.\n\n6) The MOF field has grown so large in the last few decades. Which areas do you think need to be further developed? Seeing how the MOF field has grown since the initial discoveries and reports on these materials has been amazing. I was recently in Singapore for the international MOF conference, and the diversity of research on MOFs continues to expand. As a result, many of the early challenges associated with these materials have been overcome. These challenges include improvements in the chemical stability of MOFs and improvements in the synthesis techniques used to produce MOFs. Today, material discovery is happening at a faster cadence, and studies of the applications of MOFs in a broader range of applications continue.\n\nBased on my experience, especially over the last ten years, there needs to be a continued focus on applied research on MOFs if more commercial applications of MOFs are to be realized. In this area, there is not one challenge but multiple challenges that must be overcome to debottleneck MOF commercialization. I recently wrote about this topic along with authors from other leading industrial companies1. This manuscript highlights multiple challenges that must be overcome to transition MOFs through applied research to commercialization, including MOF scaling, forming, washing, activation, and testing under real-world conditions. For example, synthesis at an early technology readiness level (TRL) might only require grams of MOF to perform characterization and performance studies. However, tons, if not kilotons, of MOF, might be required to commercialize a product that deploys a MOF. Synthesizing MOFs at these scales requires new equipment, people from different disciplines, and will incur significant development costs. This is true across all aspects of applied research where multidisciplinary teams, new equipment, and significant capital are required. As well as optimizing these processes and commercializing MOFs, it is important to establish operations that are compliant, safe, and that generate a profit.\n\nToday, drawing parallels with fundamental research, this applied research is happening quicker than ever before, with many researchers now looking at the scaling, integration, and real-world testing of MOFs. Applied research on MOFs is becoming a topic at conferences and in publications, enabling researchers to learn from others. Further, focus on applied research can take the potential of MOFs from research articles to the real world. This work is especially important in a world where we\u2019re looking to identify technologies for decarbonization, address water scarcity, and reduce energy usage. If MOFs can realize a small fraction of applications discussed in the academic literature, they will be one of the most important material discoveries of the past twenty-five years.\n\n7) Do you have any suggestions for researchers to make their work more applicable to the real world? For any researcher interested in making their research more applicable to the real world, many things can be done today. First, think about the next set of experiments that could be performed to advance the TRL of the research being performed. Depending on the targeted application, this work can take many forms, but it will likely look to establish performance under real-world conditions. Second, evaluate the business case for your technology. Answering questions like what you are looking to enable, what technology are you competing against, who the customer is, and what scale you will have to produce it at. Third, establish how you could bring your technology to commercialization. This work might involve partnering with a company or establishing a company to mature the technology to commercialization.\n\nToday, more resources, funding, and support are available than ever to transition new materials through applied research to real-world applications. Capital is available from both private and government sources to enable applied research, with certain funding sources focused on applied research and available exclusively to build small businesses. For example, in the United States, the Department of Energy, through the Inflation Reduction Act, has made tax credits and funding available that enable first-of-a-kind demonstrations of MOFs. Furthermore, incubators looking to support the commercialization of fundamental research are becoming more common. In Chicago alone, we have mHub, Chain Reaction Innovations, The Garage, and Resurgence, all looking to accelerate chemical technologies.\n\n8) Finally, what developments are you most excited about? I am not sure if it is excitement or nerves, but today, there is a great driving force for accelerating new materials technologies to commercialization. This driving force is global warming and the need to reach \u201cnet zero,\u201d ideally by 2050. Net zero is a bold goal; going from 36.8 gigatons of emissions today to zero will require completely reimagining how we generate and use energy. New materials technologies will play a critical role across a broad range of applications if we\u2019re to achieve net zero, forcing us to rethink how we harvest, store, separate, and the energy sources of the future. To apply new materials to net zero challenges, business cases, and funding must be developed to facilitate the transition of these technologies to commercialization. The initial signs are promising, with governments establishing tax policies, companies pledging to net zero goals, and a larger focus on demonstrating technologies at relevant scales to make an impact.\n\nIn a net-zero world, I am excited about the role MOFs can play and how the Numat team can accelerate this work.",

However, it is extremely flammable.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nResearchers from Texas A&M University have developed a groundbreaking technology that can dramatically reduce the flammability of cotton in a single step. This novel technique involves applying a polyelectrolyte complex coating, which can be customized for a variety of textiles, such as clothing and upholstery.\n\nThe method, scalable through a common pad-dry coating process, holds significant promise for widespread industrial applications and offers a potentially life-saving solution for fire protection.\n\nMaya D. Montemayor, a graduate student in the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M and the study\u2019s lead author emphasized the importance of this advancement. \u201cMany of the materials in our day-to-day lives are flammable, and offering a solution to protect from fire benignly is difficult,\u201d Montemayor said. \u201cThis technology can be optimized to quickly, easily, and safely flame retard many flammable materials, offering vast protection in everyday life, saving money and lives of the general population.\u201d\n\nDeveloping a new kind of flame-retardant coating\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nTraditional flame-retardant coatings require multiple steps, making the process time-consuming and expensive. In contrast, the researchers\u2019 new method streamlines the process using a volatile base, such as ammonia, which evaporates under ambient conditions.\n\nThis evaporation lowers the pH and induces complexation, forming a stable flame-retardant layer on the cotton\u2019s surface. This technique has been proposed but never effectively applied in flame-retardant treatments.\n\nThe study introduces a more efficient, cost-effective, and scalable approach to applying polyelectrolyte-based flame-retardant coatings. The technology also stands out for its use of water-based, non-toxic solutions, setting it apart from many other flame-retardant treatments that often involve hazardous chemicals.\n\nThe Texas A&M team is now working closely with industry partners to expand the potential applications of this technology. They aim to protect a wide range of materials, including wood, fabric, foam, and other textiles, from the dangers of fire.\n\n\u201cThis cutting-edge research offers Texas A&M recognition as one of the leaders of this technology and the opportunity for further development with external companies,\u201d said Dr. Jaime Grunlan, Leland T.

            "content": "In a darkened corner of Nanosys's suite here at CES 2025 in Las Vegas was a tiny watch-sized prototype display. At first glance, it didn't seem particularly special. It was bright, for sure, and definitely colorful. The watch band was fake, and it was all embedded in a box that was undoubtedly helping it function in some way. Even using a jeweler's loupe, there weren't any outward signs that this was one of the most exciting next-gen display technologies. And yet, it was.\n\nThis new MicroLED goes further into the skinny end of the electromagnetic spectrum than competing types by incorporating four ultraviolet LEDs per pixel. By contrast, most LED-based displays on the market today use some version of blue LED, plus red and green quantum dots, to create the red, green and blue you need to create an image. Many other displays use phosphors instead of quantum dots, while a few use red, green and blue LEDs.\n\nWatch this: Best TVs of CES 2025: Among So Many New Screens, I Pick 4 05:35\n\nIf this seems weird it's because it is. It's also, as you'll see, exceedingly clever. It might even drive down the currently exorbitant cost of MicroLED displays. Here's what I learned.\n\nUV LED\n\nDifferent ways to create a MicroLED display, with the associated theoretical pros and cons: Left is just red, green and blue LEDs. In the middle, blue LEDs create blue light and excite red and green quantum dots. On the right, UV LEDs excite red, green and blue quantum dots. The fourth subpixel is a spare to help improve yields. Wiley/ID Magazine/Applied Materials\n\nFirst, and this was one of my questions as well, yes, this is safe. You might have read or heard some stories from the last few years where industrial-grade UV lighting was used incorrectly, which led to skin and eye damage. One of the incredible things about quantum dots is that they convert light to different wavelengths almost perfectly. What little UV is left after most of it is converted by the QDs to some other color is blocked by the glass of the display and a filter.\n\nUsing UV LEDs in a MicroLED display has multiple benefits, though they're perhaps not as world-changing as adding quantum dots to OLED or a whole new tech like nanoLED. It's mostly on the manufacturing side. MicroLED is one of the newest display techs, and while it has a lot of promise, it's currently quite difficult to manufacture. That's one of the reasons MicroLED displays are so expensive.\n\nIf you strip out all the bits and bobs, at its core a typical MicroLED display is made up of millions of red, green and blue LEDs. Three of these are placed together to form each pixel. Without diving too far into the deep end, let's just state the obvious that this is difficult to do. Using different red, green and blue LED materials presents certain manufacturing challenges. Challenges that using all blue LEDs and adding red and green quantum dots helps partially alleviate.\n\nUsing UV LEDs goes one step farther. Instead of blue LEDs creating blue light and exciting red and green QDs, UV light excites red, green and blue QDs. So every subpixel is the same, just with a different flavor of QD on top. This reduces complexity and, theoretically, increases yields and thereby reduces manufacturing costs. Blue quantum dots aren't nearly as commonly used as red and green. The beauty of quantum dots is that making them different sizes, which is what determines what wavelength (color) they emit, is relatively easy. Easier, in theory at least, than using different LED materials for different subpixel colors. Using UV LEDs introduces its own challenges, but according to pro-UV LED companies like Applied Materials, these are potentially easier to overcome.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of this method, at least as currently implemented, is using four subpixels instead of three. Because of the relatively high likelihood of dead pixels for any MicroLED display, having a \"spare\" subpixel to use in case one of the red, green or blue subpixels isn't working, has the potential to increase yields. A dead subpixel would be found in the manufacturing process, and whatever subpixel color isn't working would get a spray of that color. While this fourth subpixel would increase the overall cost of this aspect of production by 33% or so, researchers are estimating it would improve yields enough that it would be more than worthwhile.\n\nThis diagram shows the various stages used to build MicroLED displays using UV LEDs. The UV LEDs are mounted to the backplane, four for each pixel, and each has its own \"bucket\" that will hold quantum dot material. An ink-jet printer deposits said material into the bucket. As precise as this is, some \"ink\" spills out of the correct bucket (a). By turning on that subpixel, the UV light created cures the ink into place (also a). The surface is washed, removing the spilled ink (b). The process is repeated for green and blue (c-f). If, during this process, a computer detects one of the subpixels isn't activating, the 4th spare subpixel gets called into action, receiving the dead subpixel's ink color (g). The final stage (h) sees the entire unit covered and secured for further manufacturing and assembly. Wiley/ID Magazine/Applied Materials\n\nAnother potential boon for the manufacturing process is being able to self-cure. Some manufactures would like to use ink-jet printing for small MicroLED displays, as there are potential cost benefits. This method works on larger displays, but MicroLEDs are, well, micro.\n\nUsing a different formulation in the QD \"ink,\" a color can be deposited on the substrate, cured by its own LED because it emits UV, and then any spillover of that color QD ink onto an adjacent subpixel can be washed away before the next subpixel gets its color sprayed on (see diagram above).\n\nSo each subpixel only has the QDs for its color even if the ink-jet itself isn't perfectly precise, improving color accuracy and performance. Something about the efficiency of a pixel curing itself makes my brain happy.\n\nThe display\n\nThe UV MicroLED prototype, built by CTC, mocked up to look like a smartwatch. It has 300dpi. Geoffrey Morrison/CNET\n\nWhich brings us back to Las Vegas and this bright, tiny display. As you can probably tell from the images, it's mocked up to be a smartwatch display. With a brightness of up to 1,000 nits, it was plenty bright in a dark room. CTC, the manufacturer and part of the Foxconn group, estimates that in full production it might be able to get 3,000 nits.\n\nWhy, you might ask, would you need a 3,000-nit smartwatch if you're not trying to signal passing spacecraft? To shine it in your eyeballs. One of the big potential uses for MicroLED is for AR and VR headsets, where tiny, efficient, extremely high-resolution displays are vital. It's also like your TV -- it's not always putting out its maximum brightness. Having that brightness potential opens up a wider range of possibilities.\n\nFuture displays\n\nStill in the prototype stage, a production display would be brighter and potentially used in other devices like AR/VR headsets and more. Geoffrey Morrison/CNET\n\nThe question is always, \"When does it come out?\" That's a bit hard to answer beyond, \"not right now.\" MicroLED in general and UV MicroLED specifically are both in the early stages of their development. There are MicroLED displays on the market, but it's clear a lot of companies want a lot more MicroLED displays on the market. The trend is towards ditching LCD and OLED all together, but then again I've been writing about the death of LCD for over a decade, so who knows. We'll likely see more of these later in the year and at next year's CES for sure.\n\nAs well as covering audio and display tech, Geoff does photo tours of cool museums and locations around the world, including nuclear submarines, aircraft carriers, medieval castles, epic 10,000-mile road trips and more.\n\nAlso, check out Budget Travel for Dummies, his travel book, and his bestselling sci-fi novel about city-size submarines.

The domain walls inside these crystals separate regions with different bound charge orientations.\n\nMore importantly, these tiny boundaries despite being embedded in insulating crystals, can acts as channels for regulating electron flow, and thus are capable of storing and processing information like in a human brain, says Flinders University senior lecturer in physics Dr Pankaj Sharma, lead and corresponding author in a new American Chemical Society (ACS) article.\n\nWhy does this matter? Devices mimicking the human brain allow for faster processing of vast amounts of information while using far less energy compared to existing digital computers, in particular, for tasks such as image and voice recognition, the researchers say.\n\n\u201cWith this new design, these ferroelectric domain walls in crystalline ferroelectric materials are poised to power a new generation of adaptable memory devices, bringing us closer to faster, greener and smarter electronics,\u201d says Dr Sharma. \u201cOur results reaffirm the promise of ferroelectric domain walls for brain-inspired neuromorphic and in-memory computing applications based on integrated ferroelectric devices.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn our research, a single ferroelectric domain wall has been controllably injected and engineered to mimic memristor behaviour. By applying electric fields, we carefully manipulate the shape and position of this single wall, causing it to bend and warp.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis controlled movement leads to changes in the wall\u2019s electronic properties, unlocking its ability to store and process data at different levels.\u201d\n\nThe new study reveals how ferroelectric domain walls straddling two terminal devices (see image below) can function as \u201cmemristors\u201d \u2013 devices that can store information at varying levels and remember the history of its electrical activity \u2013 similar to synapses in a human brain.\n\nCoauthor UNSW Professor Jan Seidel, says \u201cthe key lies in the interplay between the wall\u2019s surface pinning (where it\u2019s fixed) and its freedom to twist or warp deeper within the material.\n\n\u201cThese controlled twists create a spectrum of electronic states, enabling multi-level data storage, and eliminates the need for repetitive wall injection or erasure, making the devices more stable and reliable,\u201d he says.\n\nUsing advanced microscopy and theoretical phase field modelling, this research uncovers the physics behind these warping-induced electronic transitions at the domain walls.\n\nCoauthor UNSW Professor Valanoor Nagarajan adds: \u201cThese new highly reproducible and energy-efficient domain wall devices could revolutionise neuromorphic computing, the brain-inspired systems that promise to reshape artificial intelligence and data processing.\u201d\n\nThe article, Ferroelectric Domain Wall Warp Memristor (2024) by Pankaj Sharma, Chi-Hou Lei, Yunya Liu, Daniel Sando, Qi Zhang, Nagarajan Valanoor and Jan Seidel, has been published in journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces DOI: 10.1021/acsami.4c16347.\n\nAcknowledgements: The study was supported by funding from Australian Research Council Discovery Projects (DP240102137, DP240100238) and Flinders University grants.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Rachel Barton/Texas A&M Engineering\n\nAlthough extremely flammable, cotton is one of the most commonly used textiles due to its comfort and breathable nature. However, in a single step, researchers from Texas A&M University can reduce the flammability of cotton using a polyelectrolyte complex coating. The coating can be tailored for various textiles, such as clothing or upholstery, and scaled using the common pad-dry coating process, which is suitable for industrial applications. This technology can help to save property and lives on a large scale.\n\n\"Many of the materials in our day-to-day lives are flammable, and offering a solution to protect from fire benignly is difficult,\" said Maya D. Montemayor, a graduate student in the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M and the publication's lead author. \"This technology can be optimized to quickly, easily, and safely flame retard many flammable materials, offering vast protection in everyday life, saving money and lives of the general population.\"\n\nCurrent studies developing flame retardant coatings deposited via polyelectrolyte complexation require two or more steps, increasing the time and cost to coat a material effectively.\n\nIn contrast, this study recently published in ACS Applied Polymer Materials hopes to achieve the same results using only one step. The researchers address this issue by incorporating a volatile base, a molecule that evaporates under ambient conditions.\n\nUsing ammonia as the volatile base, the base evaporates to reduce the pH and induce complexation (a chemical reaction that forms a stable complex) on the cotton's surface. Until now, this technique has been proposed but never used to prepare a flame-retardant treatment.\n\nThe cotton is set aflame, showing the difference between cotton with and without the polyelectrolyte complex coating. Credit: Dr. Jaime Grunlan\n\nThis research can be utilized to deposit polyelectrolyte-based flame-retardant coatings in a scalable and efficient manner. Other positive attributes of the technology include that it is aqueous (water-based) and non-toxic, unlike many other flame-retardant treatments.\n\nThe researchers will continue evaluating this technology in partnership with companies in hopes of using their findings to protect wood, fabric, foam and other textiles.\n\nOther contributors to the findings include Texas A&M graduate students Danixa Rodriguez-Melendez, Dallin L. Smith, Natalie A. Vest and Bethany Palen, and Texas A&M undergraduate students Edward Chang and Alexandra V. Moran.\n\nMore information: Maya D.

            "content": "Kate Strangfeld, M.Ed. '22 and teacher Shawn Boggs lead a middle school teacher workshop discussing differences among baking powder brands at the Harvard Science and Cooking Laboratory\n\nMary Velasquez and Shawn Boggs wanted to make their science instruction more impactful. Velasquez, a fourth- to sixth-grade Montessori teacher in Cambridge, and Boggs, an 8th-grade science teacher in Shepherdsville, Kentucky, had similar goals \u2013 to make science relatable and interesting to their students.\n\nThat desire led them to the Science and Cooking for Secondary Science Educators Program, an initiative at the Harvard Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) designed and led by Kate Strangfeld, M.Ed. '22 along with Pia M. S\u00f6rensen, Senior Preceptor in Chemical Engineering and Applied Materials, and Kathryn Hollar, Director of Community Engagement and Diversity Outreach at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). The program, spun out of Harvard\u2019s popular Science and Cooking course and public lecture series, \u201cis tailored to empower middle and high-school teachers to use food and cooking as a medium to teach science and engineering that is also aligned to national secondary teaching standards,\u201d said S\u00f6rensen. This program now provides complete instructional resources, professional learning opportunities, and hands-on activities to engage their students.\n\n\u201cI saw my students getting excited about science in a way I had never seen before,\u201d Velasquez said. \u201cTheir confidence just soared.\u201d\n\nStudents in Shawn Boggs\u2019 class explore precision and unit conversions through chocolate chip cookies\n\nVelasquez and Boggs participated in the program\u2019s first pilot workshop in the summer of 2023 and have been critical in building this initiative through their continued participation. They spent several months in their classrooms teaching food-based science lessons from 2023-2024, emphasizing that by connecting science to something as familiar as food, the program makes abstract concepts more accessible and engaging for students.\n\n\u201cThis has completely transformed the way that I teach my class,\u201d Boggs said. \u201cI was able to take these otherwise really hard-to-understand chemistry concepts and translate them in a way that made sense to my students.\u201d\n\nOne of the goals of the program is to build a community of teachers deeply engaged in this work who can support and inspire each other. Velasquez and Boggs joined Strangfeld and Meredith Moore, a high school chemistry teacher from Washington, D.C. who participated in the 2023 workshop, to share their experiences by presenting at the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) annual national conference in Denver in March 2023. Together, they led four sessions, reaching more than 225 teachers. Three of these sessions were hands-on workshops in which participants made fresh cheese, created dough, and experimented with different brands of baking soda to explore the underlying properties of these soft materials and their ingredients.\n\nStrangfeld said the visibility of the conference \u201chelped us expand our reach to new areas in the U.S. 75% of our participants this year were from out-of-state and traveled to Harvard to be a part of this program. I think it speaks to the value both teachers and their districts see in this type of learning.\u201d\n\nThe 2024 MRSEC Science and Cooking high school teacher workshop cohort with SEAS Director of Community Engagement and Diversity Outreach Kathryn Hollar (back left), Mary Velasquez (back second from left), Kate Strangfeld (front right), and Annie Lee-Hassett (back right).\n\nVelasquez and Boggs also helped Strangfeld facilitate and lead workshops for new participants this past summer. Twenty-six new teachers from 24 states came to campus for an intensive four days of professional learning, followed by four days of virtual learning. When discussing Velasquez and Bogg\u2019s help, Strangfeld shared, \u201cTheir involvement was invaluable. It is important that this program is rooted in what is truly going on in the classroom. Mary and Shawn could share tips about how to do this in back-to-back classes with many students, how to support and empower students to design their own investigations, and how to build students\u2019 understanding over time.\u201d\n\nTo continue to build this active community network, educators stay connected throughout the school year. \u201cThe support from my colleagues and the community we built through this program was crucial to my growth as an educator,\u201d Velasquez said.\n\nTeachers who\u2019ve gone through the program are now working with over 1,600 students this year.

            "content": "About six months ago China launched the third instalment of its Big Fund. An investment to make the country's semiconductor industry self-sufficient. The so-called Big Fund III is primarily meant to support developers and makers of chip production equipment as Chinese chipmakers have lost access to advanced wafer fabrication tools from market leaders like ASML and Applied Materials. Now, it is time to spend the massive capital of \u00a5344 billion ($47 billion), reports Nikkei.\n\nThe third phase of the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (or the Big Fund III) began operations on December 31, 2024. Just like the first two phases, it will be managed by Huaxin Investment Management, a firm founded in 2014 to oversee investments for all phases of the fund. Initially the fund will invest \u00a593 billion ($12.685 billion) in various companies that produce materials like ultra-pure chemistry (e.g., resists) or silicon wafers as well as in companies that develop and build wafer fabrication equipment. For now, it is unclear whether the fund will focus on boosting established players like AMEC or Naura, or will attempt to help new start-ups to emerge.\n\n$12.685 billion is a lot of money, but it is not enough to leapfrog market leading makers of fab tools. To put the number into context, ASML's annual research and development budget totaled $4.308 billion in 2023, whereas Applied Materials R&D budget in 2024 reached $3.233 billion.\n\nSince its launch in 2014, the Big Fund and its successor, Big Fund II, have collectively raised hundreds of billions of dollars, with investments of approximately $100 billion during the first phase (2014\u20132018) and $41 billion in the second (2019\u20132023). According to Bloomberg's estimates in mid-2024, the assets then managed by the fund were valued at around $45 billion as they were affected by U.S. sanctions targeting China's semiconductor sector. To date, the sanctions disrupted the most successful Chinese semiconductor companies, such as Huawei's chip design arm HiSilicon, contract chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), and 3D NAND leader Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. (YMTC).",

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this maker of chipmaking equipment have returned +3.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.7% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Applied Materials belongs, has gained 20.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Applied Materials is expected to post earnings of $2.28 per share, indicating a change of +7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.37 points to a change of +8.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.2%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.16 indicates a change of +8.5% from what Applied Materials is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.9%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Applied Materials.",

DOI: 10.1021/acsami.4c16347\n\nImagine a future where your phone, computer or even a tiny wearable device can think and learn like the human brain\u2014processing information faster, smarter and using less energy.\n\nA new approach developed at Flinders University and UNSW Sydney brings this vision closer to reality by electrically \"twisting\" a single nanoscale ferroelectric domain wall.\n\nThe domain walls are almost invisible, extremely tiny (1\u201310 nm) boundaries that naturally arise or can even be injected or erased inside special insulating crystals called ferroelectrics. The domain walls inside these crystals separate regions with different bound charge orientations.\n\nMore importantly, these tiny boundaries, despite being embedded in insulating crystals, can act as channels for regulating electron flow, and thus are capable of storing and processing information like in a human brain, says Flinders University senior lecturer in physics Dr. Pankaj Sharma, lead and corresponding author of the new article published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.\n\nWhy does this matter? Devices mimicking the human brain allow for faster processing of vast amounts of information while using far less energy compared to existing digital computers, in particular, for tasks such as image and voice recognition, the researchers say.\n\n\"With this new design, these ferroelectric domain walls in crystalline ferroelectric materials are poised to power a new generation of adaptable memory devices, bringing us closer to faster, greener and smarter electronics,\" says Dr. Sharma. \"Our results reaffirm the promise of ferroelectric domain walls for brain-inspired neuromorphic and in-memory computing applications based on integrated ferroelectric devices.\n\n\"In our research, a single ferroelectric domain wall has been controllably injected and engineered to mimic memristor behavior. By applying electric fields, we carefully manipulate the shape and position of this single wall, causing it to bend and warp.\n\n\"This controlled movement leads to changes in the wall's electronic properties, unlocking its ability to store and process data at different levels.\"\n\nThe new study reveals how ferroelectric domain walls straddling two terminal devices can function as \"memristors\"\u2014devices that can store information at varying levels and remember the history of its electrical activity\u2014similar to synapses in a human brain.\n\nCo-author UNSW Professor Jan Seidel, says \"the key lies in the interplay between the wall's surface pinning (where it's fixed) and its freedom to twist or warp deeper within the material.\n\n\"These controlled twists create a spectrum of electronic states, enabling multi-level data storage, and eliminate the need for repetitive wall injection or erasure, making the devices more stable and reliable,\" he says.\n\nUsing advanced microscopy and theoretical phase field modeling, this research uncovers the physics behind these warping-induced electronic transitions at the domain walls.\n\nCo-author UNSW Professor Valanoor Nagarajan adds, \"These new highly reproducible and energy-efficient domain wall devices could revolutionize neuromorphic computing, the brain-inspired systems that promise to reshape artificial intelligence and data processing.\"",

            "content": "QUBO representation for lattice optimization problem\n\nAll the problems that can be solved by the state-of-the-art QA algorithm need to be formulated as an Ising model or, equivalently, a QUBO model (the details of QA and QUBO problems are in the Methods section). Therefore, mapping the target optimization problem to the QUBO problem as accurately as possible is the prerequisite for the effective use of QA. For the lattice optimization problems, the general process of obtaining a reliable QUBO mapping is to (1) establish a binary representation for lattice configuration and (2) establish a QUBO-like \u201cfeature-label\u201d relationship that can accurately represent the properties of interest as the functions of configurations.\n\nFor a HEA system, M types of atoms are randomly distributed at N sites in the 3D lattice for a certain composition. The number and coordinates of sites are pre-defined by the space group of the HEA, and therefore, the configuration of an HEA lattice can be modeled by a discrete approximation. In this approximation, the sites in the 3D lattice are assigned with N indices, and a binary variable x with M \u00d7 N dimensions can represent the occupation status for all the sites in the lattice. For example, x ij = 1 represents an atom of type i occupying site j (as Fig. 1b shows). The solution to this discretization of configuration representation might not provide the true global optimum as it does not consider lattice distortion, but its solution can serve as the initial structure for further lattice relaxation49. For selected systems, we performed additional relaxations before calculating their mechanical properties (see the Method section for details).\n\nThe thermodynamic stability of an alloy at a given temperature and pressure results from the Gibbs free energy of mixing14,50,51. Therefore, the target of the HEA lattice optimization is to optimize the Gibbs free energy of the lattice, which includes the enthalpy and the entropy components, \u0394G mix = \u0394H mix \u2013 T\u2219\u0394S conf . Within the binary regular solution model52, the mixing enthalpy \u0394H mix of a HEA lattice can be defined as a linear combination of the pair interactions among the constituent elements:\n\n$$\\Delta {H}_{{mix}}=\\sum _{i}\\sum _{j > i}{\\Omega }_{{ij}}{c}_{i}{c}_{j}$$ (1)\n\nin which c i and c j represents the fraction of elements i and j, and \u03a9 ij is the pair interaction between i and j. The binary interaction is obtained from the enthalpy of mixing of the binary system as\n\n$${\\Omega }_{{ij}}=4\\Delta {H}_{{ij}}=4\\left[{E}_{{ij}}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left({E}_{i}+{E}_{j}\\right)\\right]$$ (2)\n\nWhere \u0394H ij is the mixing enthalpy of the binary system made of element i and j, E ij is the ensemble average of the lattice energy of the binary system represented by the special quasirandom structure (SQS)51 composed of element i and j, and E i is the lattice energy of the reference unary system containing element i in the same lattice structure. As we do not consider lattice distortion of the lattice, the energies of the reference unary systems are constants in Eq. (2), and thus the mixing enthalpy of the alloy expressed by Eq. (1) depends only on c i , c j and E ij . Therefore, the minimization of \u0394H mix can be achieved by minimizing the lattice energy. Then, we establish a lattice energy model that can be mapped into a QUBO problem for QA optimization by employing the widely used cluster expansion (CE) method53,54,55. For versatility and simplicity when applying CE to HEA systems, the effective pair interaction (EPI) model is used56. We can convert the EPI model into the Ising model, so it is compatible with QA. The effective energy at lattice site j can be expressed as57:\n\n$$E\\left(j\\right)={J}_{0}+\\sum _{l\n\ne j}{J}^{X\\left(j\\right)Y\\left(l\\right)}{c}_{l}$$ (3)\n\nwhere JX(j)Y(l) is the pair-wise interatomic potential between element X and Y at sites j and l, respectively, c l is the occupation parameter of site l, and J 0 is the concentration-dependent part. Summing up the energy over all the N atomic sites yields the total energy of the lattice:\n\n$$E\\left(\\sigma \\right)=N{J}_{0}+N\\sum _{X,\\,Y}{J}^{{XY}}{\\sigma }^{{XY}}$$ (4)\n\nwhere \u03c3XY is the percentage of XY pairs in the system. Combining the previously defined binary representation of lattice configurations with an explicit expression for the pair interaction energy U ijkl , the energy of the lattice can be written as:\n\n$$E=\\sum _{i,\\,j,\\,k,\\,l}{U}_{{ijkl}}{x}_{{ij}}{x}_{{kl}}$$ (5)\n\nwhere the quadratic term U ijkl x ij x kl represents the contribution to the total energy when the atom of type i and atom of type k occupy sites j and l, respectively.\n\nThe configurational entropy \u0394S conf is described by the Boltzmann\u2019s entropy formula58,59,60:\n\n$${\\Delta S}_{{conf}}=-R\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{X}_{i}\\,{\\mathrm{ln}}\\,{X}_{i}$$ (6)\n\nwhere X i represents the mole fraction of the atom and R is the ideal gas constant. For HEA systems, configurational entropy is a compositional property that assumes that atoms are randomly distributed on the lattice points and is maximum when the alloy composition is equiatomic61 (i.e., the proportion of each element is equal). Therefore, configurational entropy can be considered as an additional constraint on the alloy composition to control the optimized structure to always be in the high entropy region in the middle of the phase diagram (as shown in Fig. 1a). Applying the proposed binary representation for a N-site lattice of M elements, Eq. (6) can be rewritten as\n\n$${\\Delta S}_{{conf}}=-R\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{M}\\frac{1}{N}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{j=1}^{N}{x}_{{ij}}\\,{\\mathrm{ln}}\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{j=1}^{N}{x}_{{ij}}\\right)$$ (7)\n\nFor the HEA system with M elements, the maximum entropy is obtained at equiatomic distribution (X i = M-1), and the polynomial approximation of Eq. (7) around M-1 is\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{\\Delta S}_{{conf}}\\approx -R\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{M}\\left(\\frac{1}{M}{\\mathrm{ln}}\\frac{1}{M}+\\left(1+{\\mathrm{ln}}\\frac{1}{M}\\right)\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{j=1}^{N}{x}_{{ij}}-\\frac{1}{M}\\right)\\right.\\\\\\qquad\\qquad\\left.+\\frac{M}{2}\\cdot {\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{j=1}^{N}{x}_{{ij}}-\\frac{1}{M}\\right)}^{2}\\right)\\end{array}$$ (8)\n\nwhich also has a second-order form that can be used to construct a QUBO-like formula together with the energy in Eq. (5). Therefore, the objective function for the HEA optimization can be constructed by the energy term in Eq. (5) and entropy term in Eq. (8).\n\nIn addition, there are physical constraints that need to be applied to the objective function. The constraint in Eq. (9) is the assignment constraint to ensure that each type of atom can only occupy a certain number of sites, which is determined by the composition. The constraint in Eq. (10) ensures that at most one atom occupies each lattice site. The constraint in Eq. (11) applies extra physical constraints, such as periodic boundary conditions, where f(i,j) is the constraint function for x ij on the boundary.\n\n$$\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{j=1}^{N}{x}_{{ij}}={c}_{i}$$ (9)\n\n$$\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{M}{x}_{{ij}}=1$$ (10)\n\n$${x}_{{ij}}^{b}=f\\left(i,\\,j\\right)$$ (11)\n\nWith the energy and entropy in Eqs. (5) and (8), and incorporating all physical constraints from Eq. (9) ~ (11), the QUBO formulation of the Hamiltonian (hQUBO) to be minimized for lattice optimization problem can be written as:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{\\mathscr{H}}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i}^{M}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{j}^{N}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{k}^{M}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{l}^{N}{U}_{{ijkl}}{x}_{{ij}}{x}_{{kl}}-{TR}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i}^{N}\\left(\\frac{1}{M}\\mathrm{ln}\\frac{1}{M}+\\left(1+{\\mathrm{ln}}\\frac{1}{M}\\right)\\,\\cdot\\, \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{j=1}^{N}{x}_{{ij}}-\\frac{1}{M}\\right)\\right.\\\\\\qquad\\qquad\\left.+\\frac{M}{2}\\,\\cdot\\, {\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{j=1}^{N}{x}_{{ij}}-\\frac{1}{M}\\right)}^{2}\\right)+{\\lambda }_{1}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i}^{M}{(\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{j}^{N}{x}_{{ij}}-{c}_{i})}^{2}\\\\\\qquad\\qquad+{\\lambda }_{2}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{j}^{N}(\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i}^{M}{x}_{{ij}}(\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{k}^{M}{x}_{{kj}}-1))+{\\lambda }_{3}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{j}^{N}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i}^{M}{\\left({x}_{{ij}}-f\\left(i,j\\right)\\right)}^{2}\\end{array}$$ (12)\n\nwhere \u03bb i are the weighing factors for the i-th constraint, which are usually much larger than U ijkl to enforce the constraints.\n\nThe construction of the hQUBO shown in Eq. (12) requires the knowledge of interaction coefficients U ijkl in the EPI model. Factorization machine (FM), introduced by Rendle et al.62, is a regression model designed for learning sparse feature interactions. Due to the consistency in mathematical form, the 2nd-order FM is often employed as the surrogate model for mapping the original problems to the QUBO formulation63. By training a 2nd-order FM regression model using DFT-calculated energy data and retrieving linear coefficients and interacting coefficients, we can obtain the coefficient U ijkl and construct the EPI energy model shown in Eq. (5), and then use entropy in Eq. (8) and constraints to construct the QUBO model in Eq. (12). In the meantime, based on physical intuition, atomic pairs in the lattice at different sites will show unique interaction behaviors, so FFM is selected as the advanced version of FM to accurately capture different pair interactions by assigning each of the N sites in the lattice to an individual field (See the Methods section for detailed discussion on the FM and FFM).\n\nQALO algorithm\n\nThe QALO algorithm is developed based on the active learning framework integrating FFM, QA and MLP in an iterative loop for the proper QUBO mapping of the target optimization problem, solving the QUBO and new data production, respectively (Fig. 2). The initial data pool for the active learning is constructed with randomly generated alloy configurations and their energies calculated using DFT (see Methods section for the details of DFT calculations). An ensemble random sampling strategy57 is used to generate initial random configurations, which means several different supercell sizes are considered simultaneously to provide diverse degrees of atomic disorder in the dataset. Large supercells can better capture long-range order, while small supercells help capture short-range order and preserve low computational cost. Both are important in HEAs, which are important factors affecting the mechanical properties of alloys. Therefore, including different supercell sizes in the dataset helps to establish a more comprehensive Hamiltonian by the surrogate model14,64. With the iterations going on, new data points from each QALO loop will be added to the dataset. To maintain the representativeness of the data pool for different degrees of disorders by preventing the algorithm from keeping adding new data of the same supercell size, randomly generated configurations of other sizes that different from the designing target and their energies calculated by MLP are also added to the data pool.\n\nFig. 2: The schematic of the active machine learning scheme of the QALO algorithm. The details of FFM, QA and ML potential are in the Methods section. The QA module is executed on the D-Wave quantum annealer, and other modules are on the classical computer. Full size image\n\nThe FFM model, which serves as a surrogate mode for mapping the original optimization problem to the QUBO form, is trained on a sub-dataset randomly sampled from the whole data pool. The FFM models in this work are implemented in the open-source package \u201cxLearn\u201d65. For each training, 70% of the data points are randomly sampled from the data pool and split into the training set, validation set, and test set with a ratio of 8:1:1. After the FFM model is trained, the QUBO model is constructed according to the discussion in the last section. QA is then used to solve the hQUBO to find the ground state. Comparing with classical algorithms, the usage of QA can greatly accelerate the optimization for the high dimensional problems. In this work, we use the hybrid QA (HQA, powered by the hybrid partitioning algorithm66) to address the challenge of high dimensional optimization (see Methods section for the details). The MLP is then used to calculate the energy for this QA-predicted configuration without computationally expensive DFT calculations. The MLP used in this work is the spectral neighbor analysis potential (SNAP)67 and is trained with the entire data pool (see Methods section for the details of SNAP model and the training of MLP). Since the MLP usually has high accuracy and strong interpolation ability, the re-training of the MLP is not necessary in each iteration but is only needed when the root mean squared error (RMSE) of energy on the small test set (randomly sampled from the data pool) is larger than a pre-set threshold (RMSE > 1.0 eV in this work).\n\nThe optimization for the HEA lattice should not be limited to obtaining the most stable atomic arrangement but also includes obtaining the optimal composition in the alloy system. The assignment constraint in Eq. (9) ensures that atoms of each type strictly occupy a certain number of sites that are determined by the corresponding composition c i . Therefore, the solution of the hQUBO constructed with the assignment constraint will just be the optimal atomic arrangement under a given elemental composition. However, if the assignment constraint is relaxed during the construction of the hQUBO, the solutions obtained from QA module will have the possibility to break the constraint and move to a different elemental composition. This can lead to the optimization toward better composition. Figure 3 shows how the QA module in the QALO algorithm is designed. As mentioned above, the optimization for composition is realized by a relatively loose constraint, while the optimization for atomic arrangement is realized by a tight constraint. In the QA module, the hybrid quantum annealer will be called multiple times in a serial way and return the solution sets of a series of hQUBOs (as depicted by Si in Fig. 3, each solution set contains all the solutions from multiple QA shots for the same hQUBO) whose assignment constraints are adjusted from loose to tight by the exponential increase of the weighting factor \u03bb 1 (as Eq. (13) shows, where r is the increasing rate of constraint weighting factors, \u03bbmax is the maximum weighting factor in the loose-to-tight QA deployment, \u03bbi is the weighting factor in the i-th HQA run, and n is the total number of HQA calls in one QA module). The optimal composition obtained from the previous solution will be applied to the assignment constraint of the following hQUBO, so that both atomic arrangement and composition can be optimized simultaneously within a single QALO iteration.\n\n$${\\lambda }_{1}^{i}={\\lambda }_{1}^{max }\\times {r}^{1-\\frac{i}{n}}$$ (13)\n\nFig. 3: The deployment strategy of QA in QALO. For each calling of QA, the EPI energy model obtained from FFM coefficients, and the initial composition of the current iteration are passed to the QA module. Then, a series of hQUBO \u210bi is constructed based on the EPI energy model with different assignment constraints from loose to tight. D-Wave quantum annealer will return optimal configurations Si for the current hQUBO and pass the composition information of the optimal solution to the next hQUBO construction. Finally, the QA module returns both optimal elemental composition and atomic configurations. Full size image\n\nOptimization of NbMoTaW HEA lattice\n\nThe established QALO algorithm is then used to optimize the bulk lattice configuration of the refractory NbMoTaW alloy system. The refractory bcc NbMoTaW exhibits outstanding high-temperature mechanical strength6,10, and one of the major limitation is the brittleness, exhibiting limited room-temperature compressive strain32,68,69. Therefore, studying the relationship between the configuration of NbMoTaW and its mechanical property can help improve alloys with better performance, especially the microscopic atomic arrangement is directly related to short-range orders (SROs), which also determines the stability of lattice structure19.\n\nAs mentioned in the last section, an ensemble random sampling strategy is used to randomly generate configurations with different supercell sizes using DFT calculations for the initial data pool. Table 1 shows the sampling method used in this work. Four different supercell sizes (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2, 4 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2, 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2 and 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4) are used, and 200 different configurations for each size are randomly drawn. Our target lattice for optimization is 8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8 supercells to minimize artifacts due to the finite size effect70. During the active learning iterations, as new data for the 8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8 supercell will be continuously added to the data pool, random configurations of the other sizes will be randomly generated and added to the data pool after each iteration to maintain their representativeness in the entire data pool.\n\nTable 1 Ensemble random sampling for NbMoTaW configurations Full size table\n\nBefore starting the active learning iterations, we trained the FFM and SNAP-MLP with a sub-dataset (400 data points randomly sampled from the initial data pool) for benchmark testing of the two surrogate models. Figure 4 shows the parity plots for FFM and SNAP-MLP models on the training set and a test set (40 data points from the initial data pool not seen in the training). For comparison, the energy values are normalized according to the supercell sizes. It can be seen that FFM can work well on both training set and test set, showing its good performance on describing the energy landscape and interpolation. MLP shows the accuracy comparable to DFT ground truth and higher accuracy than FFM on both the training set and the test set. Therefore, using the active learning strategy to continuously increase the capacity and representativeness of the database to improve the accuracy of FFM is necessary for the high-quality mapping of the original problem to the QUBO form, while the re-training of MLP does not need to be performed frequently due to its high accuracy, by which we can reduce the computational cost for the algorithm.\n\nFig. 4: Parity plots of FFM and SNAP-MLP models against DFT calculated energy on the training set and test set. (a) Parity plot of FFM model. (b) Parity plot of SNAP-MLP model. Full size image\n\nQALO is then used to optimize the configuration of the NbMoTaW lattice. The initial composition for the optimization is set to be equiatomic quantities, i.e., 25% for each of the Nb, Mo, W, and Ta species. The hyperparameters and setups for each module are listed in Table 2. Figure 5a shows the evolution of the Hamiltonian in 700 QALO iterations, within which the energy of the system converges. At the beginning of the optimization, the active learning continuously produces configurations with better atomic arrangements under the equiatomic composition, resulting in a slight but gradual decrease in the lattice total energy. However, after a few cycles, the QALO algorithm starts to explore the phase space under the guidance of the HQA and the loose constraint in hQUBO, leading to the update on the composition ratios of the four elements. Concurrently, the energy of the solution exhibits a precipitous drop after the update of the composition. Such dual modes of energy evolution alternately appear in the subsequent optimization process. Finally, the composition of the four elements tends to converge, and the optimizations further focus on the atomic arrangements. Figure 5b shows the composition evolution during the iterations. Clear depletion of Nb and enrichment of W can be observed during the optimization, and the composition converges to Nb 18.0%, Mo 23.6%, Ta 26.5% and W 31.9%, which are similar to the observations of Li et al.32 on the bulk grain phase (Nb, 15.5%, Mo 24.6%, Ta 28.0% and W 31.9%), where the Nb depletion and W enrichment driven by thermodynamics were simulated by MC/MD simulations. In the real alloy synthesis, the heat treatments that stabilize the alloy\u2019s microstructure, such as annealing or homogenization, are also driven by the thermodynamics, but they are not considered in the present work71.\n\nTable 2 Hyperparameters and setup for different modules in the QALO optimization simulation Full size table\n\nFig. 5: The evolution of results in 700 QALO iterations. a Hamiltonian (\u210b = E \u2013 TS) evolution and (b) composition evolution. Full size image\n\nThe configuration of HEA systems can be characterized by the partial radial pair correlation functions (RDF)32,72. Figure 6 shows the partial RDF for the optimized structure. The RDF curves reveal that the pair correlations between elements from different groups, such as Mo-Ta, Ta-W, and Nb-Mo, are significantly stronger than those between elements within the same group, such as Nb-Ta and Mo-W73. In addition, the SRO parameters are calculated in the lattice to further qualify the local atomic arrangement. The Warren-Cowley SRO parameter is defined as74\n\n$${\\alpha }_{k}^{i,j}=1-\\frac{{P}_{k}^{i,j}}{{c}_{j}}$$ (14)\n\nin which \\({P}_{k}^{i,j}\\) is the probability of finding element j at the k-th neighbor shell of element i, and c j is the concentration of element j. A negative \\({\\alpha }_{k}^{i,j}\\) suggests the tendency of element j clustering around the element I, while the positive \\({\\alpha }_{k}^{i,j}\\) indicates the opposite. If \\({\\alpha }_{k}^{i,j}=0\\) for each of the k-th shell, then the distribution can be regarded as completely random. In Fig. 6, we also show the SRO parameters \\({\\alpha }_{1}^{i,j}\\) of each pair of elements, which are consistent with the partial RDF analysis.\n\nFig. 6 Partial radial distribution function (RDF) and the SRO for optimized NbMoTaW lattice structure. Full size image\n\nOne of the major advantages of HEA is its superior mechanical properties, which are related to the composition and atomic configuration. We perform MD simulations at 300 K with the MLP to study the uniaxial stress-strain responses of a randomly generated equiatomic NbMoTaW configuration, a suboptimal NbMoTaW configuration with the converged composition but random atomic arrangement, and the optimized NbMoTaW configurations from the QALO algorithm, as shown in Fig. 7. The optimized HEA configuration is obtained by selecting the solution from the last QALO iteration. The compressive and tensile deformations are applied on the structure along the x-axis (see Methods section for the details of strain-stress simulations). It can be seen that the optimized configuration exhibits much higher moduli under both compression and tension than the randomly generated alloy structure and the suboptimal structure. From QALO, we see that the optimization of the lattice of bulk grain will lead to special SRO and create regions with varying compositions and local environments formed by elements with strong chemical affinities, which can contribute to the solid solution effect known to enhance the mechanical property of HEAs18. This result suggests that the algorithm we proposed can simultaneously optimize the HEA structure in terms of composition and atomic arrangement, thereby obtaining the structure with excellent mechanical properties and thermodynamical stabilities. The comparison of the mechanical properties of the three alloy systems also illustrates the importance of both composition optimization and configuration optimization for HEA property, highlighting the advantages of our proposed algorithm when facing a large search space.\n\nFig. 7: Uniaxial stress-strain behavior of NbMoTaW systems. In comparison are a randomly generated equiatomic NbMoTaW configuration (NbMoTaW_Rand), a suboptimal NbMoTaW configuration with the converged composition but random atomic arrangement (NbMoTaW_subOpt), and the optimized NbMoTaW configurations from the QALO algorithm (NbMoTaW_Opt). Full size image\n\nComputational efficiency analysis\n\nFor comparison with QA, the same lattice optimization problem is also solved by the mixed-integer linear program (MILP) solver Gurobi75 and simulated annealer76, which are classical optimizers that are generally more efficient at escaping local minima compared to traditional MC methods. These two classical optimizers are carried out on the classical computer with Dual 12 core Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae 2.50 GHz CPU and 256 GB RAM. The loose-to-tight deployment strategy (as Fig. 2 depicted) is also used for constructing the hQUBOs for these two optimizers to optimize the compositions and configurations. Table 3 shows the computational time and the minimum configurational energy of the three solvers. The running time is calculated by averaging the wall time of all the loose-to-tight optimization modules during the entire QALO optimization, and the minimum configurational energy is the MLP-calculated energy of the optimized configuration after the iteration converges. For small optimization problems (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 supercell), Gurobi shows a faster convergence speed than simulated annealing and QA. In this scenario, the non-negligible charge time (including communication and problem embedding time on quantum devices) on the quantum annealer hardware will become an obstacle to computing efficiency. As the target problem becomes larger (4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 supercell), the computational efficiency of Gurobi becomes much lower, and the optimization results are also less satisfactory compared to the other two annealing algorithms. At the same time, the advantages of QA in both computational efficiency and global searching accuracy are gradually emerging. As the scale of the problem further increases (8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8 supercell), Gurobi and simulated annealer cannot converge to the optimal solution within 6 hours due to the physical memory limitations of the classical computer. It is foreseeable that as the optimization problem becomes larger and larger, the advantage of the QA algorithm will become more significant. The limitations of quantum hardware (e.g., number of interconnect qubits) still largely limit the size of the problems. However, for the HEA problem in this study, 4x4x4 a cell size is found yielding converged state when considering the per atom energy of the optimized lattice.",

One of the photos shows four feet wearing hiking boots on a mountain peak in the White Mountains National Park in New Hampshire, symbolizing the long journey he and his son took together. Another photo offers a breathtaking view from the Milford Track in New Zealand, taken during a post-army trip with his daughter. This theme\u2014the journey\u2014is both a life philosophy and a management approach for Benami. His personal journey to leading an organization of 2,000 employees in Israel, which has doubled its size in the past three years under his leadership, began 12 years ago.\n\nApplied Materials is a public company employing tens of thousands globally, specializing in chip manufacturing processes. The Israeli branch focuses on machinery and quality control products for chip production and is the company\u2019s largest R&D and manufacturing center outside the U.S. Benami assumed the General Manager role in early 2022, during the twilight of the high-tech boom, only to be thrust into a global crisis, alongside Israel\u2019s judicial reform turmoil and a prolonged war that has lasted over a year.\n\n1 View gallery Rafi Benami ( Photo: Orel Cohen )\n\nYou took office during the peak of growth in Israeli high-tech, and now everything is different. How have you experienced these three turbulent years?\n\n\"There is the storm in Israel that we are dealing with as managers in a challenging environment. However, our business is shaped by the semiconductor industry's global state, which is at the heart of global technology. The demand for chips\u2014for AI, cars, data processing, and memory\u2014is only increasing. As a company, we expect demand in the semiconductor industry to grow by 50% by 2030, so we\u2019re operating in an environment with a very optimistic forecast.\n\n\"Additionally, Applied Global has significantly increased its investment in us. Since 2021, we have nearly doubled our workforce and financial investments in the Israeli branch. We now have a campus with three buildings, and we\u2019re constructing a fourth as part of this expansion. This growth reflects our confidence in the industry\u2019s direction and the company\u2019s future. From a business perspective, I am very optimistic about where we\u2019re heading. On the national level, however, the challenges are immense.\"\n\nOn October 7, Benami drove his son, who serves in an elite unit, to the army and then convened the company\u2019s business continuity forum to implement contingency plans for uninterrupted operations. The war has deeply impacted the company. Applied Israel lost four employees, including Yehuda Cohen, a veteran employee whose son, Nimrod Cohen, was kidnapped and taken to Gaza. Since the war began, 15% of the company\u2019s workforce has been drafted into reserve duty, with up to 300 employees serving simultaneously. To address the labor shortage, Applied Materials Israel reached out to retired employees, asking them to return temporarily, and expanded its facilities.\n\nThe company rented an entire hotel in Rehovot\u2019s industrial zone to house families of employees from areas affected by the war, including the Gaza border region. It provided financial aid to families whose homes were damaged and offered psychological support to employees grappling with the traumatic events.\n\nDo you think global management at Applied Materials might eventually lose patience with the situation in Israel?\n\n\"The bottom line is no. Applied Materials has been heavily invested in Israel for many years, and I\u2019ve managed to convince the CEO to increase that investment further. Since October 7, we\u2019ve proven to both management and customers that we can operate effectively in these challenging circumstances. Despite initial concerns, we\u2019ve continued delivering machines and support to customers without interruption.\n\n\"Our global management, based in Santa Clara, California, moved from a place of concern to confidence as they saw us maintaining operations seamlessly. One key reason is that even before October 7, we built our operations as a global company. We have a strong core in Israel, complemented by robust teams in India, Germany, and near our customers. This global balance enables us to maintain business continuity even in difficult times.\"\n\nSo, has some of the activity shifted abroad?\n\n\"We haven\u2019t moved operations abroad\u2014we\u2019ve diversified them. This global diversification allows us to mitigate risks. That said, we continue to recruit locally, with over 80 open positions in Israel spanning technology fields like physics, software, and algorithms. Globally, we\u2019re hiring for a similar number of roles. This balance, paired with building a strong core here in Israel, is why we\u2019ve been able to navigate this challenging environment successfully.\"\n\nBenami lives in Ramat Gan with his wife, Professor Orly Sade, Dean of the Faculty of Business Administration at the Hebrew University, and their two children. His journey at Applied Materials began over a decade ago, following roles at global tech firms like Comverse and NICE. Reflecting on his early days at the company, Benami admits it wasn\u2019t \"love at first sight.\"\n\nYou said it\u2019s a difficult company to integrate into. Why is that?\n\n\"This stems from the complexity of our work. We deal with a wide range of technologies, each requiring deep expertise. These technologies must be integrated while meeting specific customer needs. To succeed here, you need a passion for learning and a commitment to staying up-to-date. Transitioning from NICE, a software company, I had to dive deeply into entirely new technologies\u2014it was a challenge.\"\n\nThroughout your career, you\u2019ve climbed the corporate ladder. Do you have tips for succeeding in large organizations?\n\n\"First, you need to excel in your work, but that\u2019s not enough. Collaboration is key\u2014you can\u2019t achieve anything alone. You\u2019re only as good as your partners, so you must foster win-win collaborations. Also, balancing a broad systems perspective with the ability to dive into details when needed is critical. This combination drives large organizations forward.\"\n\nAre you working in a hybrid model? Does it make collaboration harder?\n\n\"Since the pandemic, we\u2019ve adopted a hybrid model of two to three days in the office. While hybrid work has its benefits, interpersonal interaction is irreplaceable. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building a new office, opening in October, to encourage employees to return. Long-standing relationships built here over the years have helped us maintain collaboration, even in a hybrid setup. But eventually, some of the intangible benefits of working together in-person will be lost.\"\n\nApplied Materials Israel\u2019s offices feel more like an industrial plant than a typical Israeli high-tech workspace. The company produces physical products, unlike many software-focused firms, even as it operates at the forefront of chip technology.\n\nHow does the current high-tech job market affect your company?\n\n\"Fortunately, we\u2019ve remained an attractive workplace, even during the high-demand years of 2021\u20132022. Today, it\u2019s easier to recruit, but we\u2019ve always maintained diversity in hiring, bringing in both juniors and experienced professionals. This approach creates a healthier, more innovative organization.\"\n\nWhat are your predictions for Israeli high-tech in 2025?\n\n\"The current situation in Israel is harming Israeli high-tech. For it to thrive, we need stability\u2014people and capital must flow freely in and out of the country. Unfortunately, Israel\u2019s \u2018brand\u2019 is being damaged. Social cohesion and shared values are critical for high-tech success, and right now, those are under threat.",

The researchers\u2019 new quantum chip is flexible, scalable and as modular as the chips in cellphones and laptops.\n\nSize and noise\n\nQuantum computers are highly advanced yet delicate devices with the potential to transform fields such as telecommunications, healthcare, clean energy, and cryptography. But two things must happen before quantum computers can tackle these global problems to their fullest potential.\n\nFirst, they must be scaled to large enough size with flexible operability. \u201cThis scaling can offer solutions to computational problems that a classical computer simply cannot hope to solve, like factoring huge numbers and thereby cracking encryption codes,\u201d Prof. Andrew Cleland said.\n\nSecond, they must be able to perform massive calculations with few errors, ideally surpassing the processing power of current state-of-the-art classical computers.\n\nThe superconducting qubit platform is one promising approach to building a quantum computer. But the designs used so far need rethinking.\n\n\u201cA typical superconducting processor chip is a square shape with all the quantum bits fabricated on that. It\u2019s a solid-state system on a planar structure,\u201d said study co-author Haoxiong Yan, who graduated from PME in the spring and now works as a quantum engineer for Applied Materials.\n\nThis typical design causes several limitations.\n\nFirst, putting qubits on a grid means each qubit can only interact with, at most, four other qubits \u2013 its immediate neighbors to the north, south, east and west. Connecting more qubits would make a more powerful processor, but until the PME team, researchers hadn\u2019t found a practical path around the \u201cnearest neighbor\u201d limit.\n\nAlso, if all qubits are fabricated on the same planar substrate, this poses a significant challenge to the fabrication process, as even a small number of failed devices means the processor won\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cTo undertake practical quantum computing, we need millions or even billions of qubits and we need to make everything perfectly,\u201d Yan said.\n\nRethinking the chip\n\nTo work around these issues, the team retouched the design of the quantum processor.\n\nTaking inspiration from classical computers, the design clusters qubits around a central router, similar to how PCs talk to each other through a central network hub.\n\nQuantum \u201cswitches\u201d can connect and disconnect any qubit within a few nanoseconds, enabling high-fidelity quantum gates and the generation of quantum entanglement, a fundamental resource for quantum computing and communication.\n\nThe processor is designed to be modular, so that different components can be pre-selected before being mounted onto the processor motherboard.\n\n\u201cIn principle there's no limit to the number of qubits that can connect via the routers,\u201d said Wu. \u201cYou can connect more qubits if you want more processing power, as long as they fit in a certain footprint.\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s next steps are working on ways to scale up the quantum processor to more qubits, find novel protocols for expanding the processor\u2019s capabilities, and, potentially, find ways to link router-connected qubit clusters the way supercomputers link their component processors.\n\nThey\u2019re also looking to expand the distance over which they can entangle qubits.\n\n\u201cRight now, the coupling range is sort of medium-range, on the order of millimeters,\u201d Wu said. \u201cSo if we're trying to think of ways to connect remote qubits, then we must explore new ways to integrate other kind of technologies with our current setup.\u201d\n\nCitation: \u201cModular Quantum Processor with an All-to-All Reconfigurable Router,\u201d Wu et al, Physical Review X, November 4, 2024.\n\nFunding: Army Research Office and Laboratory for Physical Sciences, Air Force Office of Scientific Research\n\n\u2014Adapted from an article first published by the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering.",

            "content": "It hasn't been the best quarter for Applied Materials, Inc. ( ) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 19% in that time. But that doesn't change the fact that shareholders have received really good returns over the last five years. In fact, the share price is 162% higher today. To some, the recent pullback wouldn't be surprising after such a fast rise. Ultimately business performance will determine whether the stock price continues the positive long term trend.\n\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nOver half a decade, Applied Materials managed to grow its earnings per share at 25% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 21% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\n\nBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of .\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Applied Materials' TSR for the last 5 years was 175%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nApplied Materials shareholders are up 9.8% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 22% a year, over half a decade) look better. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing.

This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.22%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.36%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.16%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the maker of chipmaking equipment had lost 10.23% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 1.86%, while the S&P 500 lost 2.36%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Applied Materials in its forthcoming earnings report. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.28, reflecting a 7.04% increase from the same quarter last year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.16 billion, up 6.74% from the year-ago period.\n\nAMAT's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $9.38 per share and revenue of $29.34 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +8.44% and +7.97%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Applied Materials. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.66% lower within the past month. As of now, Applied Materials holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Applied Materials has a Forward P/E ratio of 17.34 right now. This denotes a discount relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 25.27.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AMAT currently has a PEG ratio of 1.7. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Electronics - Semiconductors stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.09 based on yesterday's closing prices.",

            "content": "The LCO particles were coated with 1 wt.% LZF via a simple wet-chemistry method followed by annealing. For comparison, the conventionally employed 1 wt.% LNO-coated LCO (LNO-LCO) was also prepared following the procedures reported in existing literature34. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to examine the crystal structure of the materials. The XRD patterns (Supplementary Fig. 1) demonstrate that both LNO-LCO and LZF-coated LCO (LZF-LCO) samples correspond well to the hexagonal R\\(\\bar{3}\\)m structure, indicating no structural damage occurred during the coating process. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Supplementary Fig. 2) depict that the LCO consists of particles ranging from 2\u201310 \u03bcm in size. After being modified with LNO or LZF, the surface of particles appears hazy due to the covering of a protective layer. The homogeneous distribution of Nb on the surface of LNO-LCO was also detected by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping (Supplementary Fig. 3).\n\nTo investigate the composition and structure of the protective layer on LZF-LCO unequivocally, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was employed (Fig. 1a). A thin layer with a thickness of 6\u201313 nm is observed to uniformly cover the LCO particle. Enlarged images of the region of interest clearly exhibit nanocrystalline with lattice fringes, which match well with (002), \\((\\bar{1}\\bar{1}1)\\), and (201) planes of LZF with trigonal P\\(\\bar{3}\\) 1m structure. The corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) further confirms the presence of LZF. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) also verifies the structure of the protective layer consisting of LZF nanocrystalline embedded in an amorphous matrix (Supplementary Fig. 4). While other regions are mainly composed of amorphous phases. In order to identify the composition of the large amounts of amorphous matter in the coating, we carefully examined the coating layer with STEM and EDS mapping. We found that Zr and F element cover the entire surface of LCO uniformly, rather than being sporadically distributed (Fig. 1b). This indicates that our target product (i.e., LZF) includes not only nanocrystalline structures but also a significant amount of amorphous matter in the coating layer. Density of states (DOS) result indicated the nanocrystalline embedded in amorphous matrix can help reduce electronic conductivity of coating layer (Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Data 1). Meanwhile, an about 3 nm reconstruction from layered to disordered layered to rock salt structure had occurred on the surface after the coating process (Fig. 1b). In addition, the EDS mapping results from different scales (Supplementary Figs. 6\u20138) reveal a uniform distribution of Zr and F elements on the surface of LCO particles after coating process as well. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of LZF-LCO powders also show signals of Zr4+ and F\u2212, further corroborating the presence of LZF (Supplementary Fig. 9). Furthermore, the morphology of LNO coating layer was also characterized. The STEM and EDS results clearly show that the LNO coating layer with a thickness of 10\u201318 nm homogeneously covers the LCO particles (Supplementary Fig. 10). We noticed that the thickness of our LNO coating layer falls within the optimal range for LNO (9\u201318 nm) in terms of electrochemical performance35.\n\nFig. 1: Structural and chemical characterization of LZF-LCO. a HRTEM images and corresponding FFT images of LZF protective layer. b Typical HAADF-STEM image of LZF-LCO particle surface and corresponding EDS mappings of Co, O, Zr and F elements. Full size image\n\nThe electrochemical performance of In-Li|LPSCl|LZF-LCO and In-Li|LPSCl|LNO-LCO all-solid-state cells with an LCO loading of 11.07\u201311.58 mg cm\u22122 was investigated to validate the efficacy of the LZF protective layer. It is worth noting that the mass fraction of LCO in composite positive electrode is as high as 80 wt.%. As shown in Fig. 2a\u2013d, the In-Li|LPSCl|LZF-LCO exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 154.1 mAh g\u22121 between 2.6 and 4.5 V at 70 mA g\u22121. Surprisingly, a capacity of 96.2 mAh g\u22121 can still be delivered even at a high rate of 700 mA g\u22121. In stark contrast, the In-Li|LPSCl|LNO-LCO displays a significantly larger overpotential than In-Li|LPSCl|LZF-LCO (Fig. 2c). Consequently, it exhibits a much lower initial discharge capacity of 127.1 mAh g\u22121 at 70 mA g\u22121, and only a capacity of 35.2 mAh g\u22121 can be maintained at 700 mA g\u22121. It is noted that the electrochemical performance displayed by In-Li|LPSCl|LNO-LCO is comparable to that reported in previous studies28,29,30,31,32,33, proving the successful coating of LNO. The high-voltage cycling stability was also evaluated at 70 mA g\u22121 (Fig. 2e). The In-Li|LPSCl|LNO-LCO displays substantial capacity decay and only retains 69% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles. While this severe performance deterioration can be considerably alleviated by replacing LNO with the LZF protective layer, achieving 90% capacity retention after 100 cycles.\n\nFig. 2: Electrochemical performance of In-Li | LPSCl | LZF-LCO and In-Li | LPSCl | LNO-LCO at 25 \u00b0C. a Galvanostatic charge-discharge voltage profiles of In-Li|LPSCl|LZF-LCO at different rates. b Rate capability of In-Li|LPSCl|LZF-LCO. c Galvanostatic charge-discharge voltage profiles of In-Li|LPSCl|LNO-LCO at different rates. d Rate capability of In-Li|LPSCl|LNO-LCO. e Cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency of In-Li|LPSCl|LZF-LCO and In-Li|LPSCl|LNO-LCO. Full size image\n\nIn order to elucidate the basis for the significant performance gap between LZF-LCO and LNO-LCO, we have synthesized pure LNO and LZF powders and compared their ionic and electronic conductivity more comprehensive insights (Supplementary Figs. 11\u201313, Supplementary Tables 2\u22123). The ionic conductivity of LNO, as determined from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests, is 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22128 S cm\u22121, while LZF exhibits a lower ionic conductivity of 7.6 \u00d7 10\u22129 S cm\u22121. Both coating materials exhibit similar electronic conductivity, with LNO having a value of 2.8 \u00d7 10\u221210 S cm\u22121 and LZF having 1.8 \u00d7 10\u221210 S cm\u22121. According to the ionic and electronic conductivity test results, the LNO-LCO should have delivered similar or even better electrochemical performance compared to the LZF-LCO. However, this was not observed in our experiments.\n\nIn addition to ionic and electronic transport properties, Young\u2019s modulus (E) is also considered a critical parameter, as it affects the ability of coating materials to inhibit volume strain and intragranular cracking in positive electrode materials. It can be calculated from Eq. (1).\n\n$$E=2G\\left(1+\n\nu \\right)$$ (1)\n\nwhere the G is shear modulus and the \u03bd is Poisson\u2019s ratio. Using corresponding data from the Materials Project database, we determine the Young\u2019s modulus of LNO to be 126 GPa and that of LZF to be 88 GPa. This result implies that the LNO coating can better resist the volume strain of LCO. The particle integrity of LNO-LCO after 100 cycles has also been verified by STEM images, with no intragranular cracks observed (Supplementary Fig. 14). These results further validate that the mechanical stability of the coatings is not responsible for the distinct electrochemical performance between LNO-LCO and LZF-LCO. Additionally, the LZF-LCO particles also maintain their intact structure after 100 cycles, suggesting the LZF coating is sufficient to inhibit the volume strain of LCO (Supplementary Fig. 15).\n\nTherefore, in order to reveal underlying factors, we conducted potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) after each cycle within the initial 50 cycles at 70 mA g\u22121 (Fig. 3a\u2013b, Supplementary Fig. 16). The In-Li|LPSCl|LNO-LCO cell initially exhibits an acceptable cell impedance of 125.7 \u03a9 cm2 after the first cycle. However, this value continues to increase in each of the subsequent cycles, eventually reaching 346.4 \u03a9 cm2 after 50 cycles. In contrast, the In-Li|LPSCl|LZF-LCO cell exhibits a lower cell impedance of 89.2 \u03a9 cm2 after the first cycle. This value shows a modest increase to 132.8 \u03a9 cm2 after 10 cycles and remains stable for the subsequent cycles. Given that the same negative electrode was utilized in both cells, the substantial difference between them arises entirely from the positive electrode side.\n\nFig. 3: PEIS and DRT analysis showing the different impedance evolution process and underlying thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms. a, b Nyquist plots of In-Li|LPSCl|LNO-LCO (a) and In-Li|LPSCl|LZF-LCO (b) at each discharged state in the first 50 cycles at 70 mA g\u22121 and 25 \u00b0C. c, d Corresponding DRT results of In-Li|LPSCl|LNO-LCO (c) and In-Li|LPSCl|LZF-LCO (d). e Calculated mutual reaction energies of different interface. f The volume fraction of electron conductive species (0 eV band gap) in the decomposition products of LZF/LPSCl, LNO/LPSCl and LCO/LPSCl. Full size image\n\nFor a more profound understanding, distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analysis was employed to comprehend the evolution of the PEIS spectrum and decouple the contributions of different electrochemical processes (Fig. 3c-d). Five kinetic processes can be distinguished depending on their specific relaxation time. The peaks at 10\u22125 and 10\u22124 s are respectively attributed to ionic transport through the grain boundary of the SSE and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the negative electrode side. The multiple peaks at 10\u22124 to 1 s are assigned to the CEI with complex composition. Charge transfer impedance (R ct ) between LCO and SSEs is also identified as a peak located at 1 to 10 s. While the charge transfer process between negative electrode and SSEs is too small to be individually recognized. In addition, the peak at 10 to 100 s is attributed to the diffusional impedance (R d ) of Li+ in LCO36. For In-Li|LPSCl|LNO-LCO cell, it is evident that the impedance related to the electrochemical processes of the positive electrode increases with each successive cycle and does not saturate, including R CEI , R ct , and R d . The results indicate that the continuous growth of CEI between LCO and SSEs albeit with LNO protective layer, combined with the persistent structural degradation of LCO to impede Li+ diffusion, collectively increase the challenges associated with interfacial charge transfer (Fig. 3c). Conversely, the In-Li|LPSCl|LZF-LCO cell exhibits an increase in R CEI only during the first 10 cycles, with the other impedance contributions remaining stable throughout the entire 50 cycles (Fig. 3d). This highlights the remarkable protective role played by LZF to control CEI growth and preserve layer structure of LCO.\n\nTo gain deeper insights into the factors that dictate the divergent electrochemical behaviors, possible interfacial decomposition before and after the incorporation of the LNO/LZF protective layer were investigated (Supplementary Tables 4\u20138), and corresponding thermodynamic mutual reaction energies were calculated (Fig. 3e). The results disclose that the Li 0.33 CoO 2 /LPSCl interface is not thermodynamically stable but undergoes spontaneous decomposition reactions with a maximum decomposition energy of \u22120.5346 eV\u00b7atom\u22121 (Supplementary Table 4), aligning well with previous literature37. The introduction of an LNO protective layer significantly enhances the interfacial stability of Li 0.33 CoO 2 /LNO, as evidenced by a notable decrease in the maximum decomposition energy to \u22120.0095 eV\u00b7atom\u22121 (Supplementary Table 5). However, it is noteworthy that, despite this improvement, the LNO/LPSCl interface still exhibits a non-negligible maximum decomposition energy of \u22120.109 eV\u00b7atom\u22121 (Supplementary Table 6). Moreover, from the interfacial decomposition products between LNO and LPSCl, it can be found that NbS 3 and Li 5 (NbS 2 ) 7 , which possess a band gap of 0 eV (Supplementary Table 7), constitute a significant portion of the resultant products (35.63 vol%). This value is comparable with that of reaction products between Li 0.33 CoO 2 and LPSCl (34.99 vol%). More importantly, we noticed that the S and Nb elements are largely overlapped in the surface particles on LNO-LCO after 100 cycles, which is an evidence to support above calculations (Supplementary Fig. 14). This characteristic expedites the exhaustion of LNO, converting it into a mixed conductive interlayer. This transformation enhances electron mobility and eradicates the kinetic barrier for the chemical interaction between LCO and SSEs, instigated by differences in the chemical potential of various elements. As Co diffuses into LPSCl, it generates electronic conductors such as CoS 2 , Co 3 S 4 , and Co 9 S 8 with a band gap of 0 eV, ensuring a continuous supply of electrons for the persistent reaction (Supplementary Table 8).\n\nConsequently, this process results in forming a thick CEI and disintegrating the layered LCO structure. When the LZF protective layer was employed, not only the Li 0.33 CoO 2 /LZF interface is thermodynamically stable (maximum decomposition energy is 0 eV\u00b7atom\u22121), but better interfacial stability can also be achieved between LZF and LPSCl, with a negligible maximum decomposition energy of \u22120.046 eV\u00b7atom\u22121 (Supplementary Table 7. Of greater significance, none of the reaction products are electronic conductors, amongst which the ZrS 2 possesses the smallest band gap of 1.04 eV (Supplementary Table 8), thus effectively preventing electron leakage even if the LZF protective layer was decomposed. This property avoids the interfacial reaction between LCO and LPSCl and assures the structural integrity of LCO over an extended period. The interfacial stability was also validated through long-term high-temperature testing (Supplementary Fig. 17 and Supplementary Note 1). In addition, the distinct electrochemical stability windows of LNO and LZF also contribute to the different stability during cycling (Supplementary Fig. 18).\n\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was first employed to study the detailed chemical insights into the composite positive electrode of In-Li|LPSCl|LZF-LCO and In-Li|LPSCl|LNO-LCO after cycles (Fig. 4a, b). The samples\u2019 surfaces were cleaned by Ar+ sputtering before the test to remove the possible surface contamination. For comparison, XPS was also conducted on LPSCl powder (Supplementary Fig. 19). The S 2p spectrum and the P 2p spectrum of LPSCl both display doublets, with the S 2p 3/2 peak at 161.4 eV and the P 2p 3/2 peak at 131.8 eV. These features align well with the PS 4 3\u2212 tetrahedra of the argyrodite structure. After 20 cycles, the S 2p spectrum of LNO-LCO composite positive electrode exhibits three new doublets with the 2p 3/2 peaks at 162.9 eV, 163.8 eV, and 169 eV, suggesting the formation of bridging sulfur in P 2 S x , elemental sulfur (S) and sulfate (SO 4 2\u2212), respectively. Extending the cycling process to 100 cycles leads to the appearance of a new doublet with the 2p 3/2 peak at 167.1 eV, which corresponds to sulfite (SO 3 2\u2212), while also intensifying the signal associated with SO 4 2\u2212. These high oxidation state species severely hinder Li+ transport within the composite positive electrode. After substituting LNO with LZF, the chemical/electrochemical formation of these products can be effectively mitigated, with no SO 4 2\u2212 detected after 20 cycles. Moreover, even after 100 cycles, the decomposition products still show intensities comparable to those of LNO-LCO composite positive electrode after 20 cycles. It should be noted that the signal of Co 9 S 8 may not be discernible, probably due to its merging with the S signal owing to their close binding energies (~163.9 eV)38. The P 2p core-level XPS data of LNO-LCO composite positive electrode after 20 cycles displays two new doublets at higher binding energy, corresponding to P 2 S x and P-O, which show an increase after 100 cycles. Similar to evolution in S 2p spectra, the LZF protective layer efficiently alleviates the generation of these resistive decomposition species. These results demonstrate the capability of LZF to stabilize the interface, thereby achieving better electrochemical performance.\n\nFig. 4: Characterizations on chemical interaction between LCO and LPSCl with LNO or LZF protective layer. a, b S 2p (a) and P 2p (b) XPS spectra of LNO-LCO and LZF-LCO at discharged state after 20 or 100 cycles.

Full size image\n\nX-ray absorption spectra (XAS) were characterized on the composite positive electrode after cycles to further investigate the interfacial stability (Fig. 4c\u2013d). The S K-edge and P K-edge XAS of pristine LZF-LCO composite positive electrode displayed identical characteristics as those of LPSCl, indicating the preserved integrity of the argyrodite structure15,32. However, for LNO-LCO composite positive electrode after 100 cycles, there are notable alterations in the peak shape of S K-edge XAS. These changes include a pronounced increase in the intensity of the peaks at ~2472 eV (typically Li 2 S) and ~2477 eV (typically SO 3 2\u2212), indicative of severe oxidation reactions and a rearrangement of the local structure of LPSCl. Similarly, the features in P K-edge XAS also display substantial changes, encompassing a decreased intensity of the main peak and the emergence of a new peak at ~2152 eV, ascribed to P 4 O 10 39. Additionally, the broad peak around 2170 eV can be attributed to the multiple scattering of P-O40. These results underscore that the LNO protective layer loses its protective function against chemical interactions between LCO and LPSCl prematurely. In the case of the LZF-LCO composite positive electrode after 100 cycles, despite a slight decrease in peak intensity and minor alterations in peak shape, its S K-edge and P K-edge XAS exhibit a significantly improved retention compared to the LNO-LCO composite positive electrode.\n\nAdditionally, interphase growth between LCO and LPSCl after 100 cycles was probed by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) measurements with LNO or LZF protective layer (Fig. 4e\u2013f). Ar+ sputtering was also applied before the test to avoid misunderstanding. Chemical ion images of Co+ and S\u2212 are utilized to locate LCO and LPSCl, respectively. Various other species are also observable, including CoS\u2212, SO 3 \u2212, and PO 3 \u2212. CoS\u2212 can be recognized as a distinctive component of Co 9 S 8 or Co 3 S 4 , SO 3 \u2212 can be attributed to SO 3 2\u2212 or SO 4 2\u2212, and PO 3 \u2212 can be associated with P 4 O 10 or PO 4 3\u2212. It is clear that all ions related to decomposition products exhibit higher intensities in the LNO-LCO composite positive electrode when compared to the LZF-LCO composite positive electrode. Normalized intensity of these ionic fragments was also provided (Supplementary Fig. 20). These results provide strong evidence that LNO is not stable enough to inhibit chemical interaction between LCO and LPSCl, leading to thick CEI formation, especially at high voltage. On the other hand, LZF can remarkably reduce chemical degradation and ensure fast Li+ transport within the composite positive electrode.\n\nThe gas generation from the composite positive electrode during charge was also detected by differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) experiments (Fig. 4g\u2013i). As depicted in Fig. 4g, SO 2 release from the LNO-LCO composite positive electrode was detectable even when LCO was slightly oxidized to Li 0.95 CoO 2 (Fig. 4g). The presence of an LZF protective layer significantly delayed the onset of SO 2 generation occurring when LCO underwent oxidation to Li 0.7 CoO 2 (Fig. 4h). Furthermore, the accumulation of SO 2 from the LZF-LCO composite positive electrode was notably lower, accounting for only 23.6% of that from the LNO-LCO composite positive electrode (Fig. 4i). It is important to note that the detection of SO 2 below 4 V serves as evidence that SO 2 originates from a chemical reaction between LCO and LPSCl, rather than being formed by O 2 released from LCO interacting with LPSCl. DFT calculations were employed to elucidate the mechanism by which LCO reacts with the electrolytes LPSCl during charging to produce SO 2 . When a potential of 4 V (versus Li+/Li) is applied, the reaction energy for the formation of SO 2 from LCO and LPSCl is -0.592 eV/atom (Supplementary Fig. 21). This suggests that the oxygen from LCO is thermodynamically favored to combine with sulfur to produce SO 2 at this potential. Given the spontaneous reaction between LNO and LPSCl, sulfur from the electrolytes can diffuse into LNO coating layer, leading to the formation of electron-conductive niobium sulfide compounds and the fast decomposition of LNO. This process can facilitate the combination of oxygen and sulfur, resulting in the formation of SO 2 . In stark contrast, the enhanced thermodynamic and kinetical stability between LZF and LPSCl effectively impedes the combination of oxygen and sulfur, preventing the production of SO 2 . DEMS data for Ar and N 2 were also displayed to verify the airtightness of the setup during cell cycling (Supplementary Fig. 22).\n\nBesides the characterization on chemical decomposition and CEI growth, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was utilized to distinguish the structural transformation of LNO-LCO and LZF-LCO particles after 100 cycles (Fig. 5a\u2013f). These samples were prepared by focused ion beam (FIB). As depicted in Fig. 5a, the layered structure of LCO was reconstructed in the near-surface region despite the presence of the LNO coating. The amplified lattice fringes and the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) further elucidate that this reconstruction phase is dominated by Fd\\(\\bar{3}\\)m spinel Co 3 O 4 (Fig. 5b\u2013c). Additionally, the HRTEM results validate the presence of not only the spinel phase but also a more undesired Fm\\(\\bar{3}\\)m rock-salt phase (Supplementary Figs. 23\u221224). The formation of these reconstruction phases is associated with O oxidation (O2\u2212 to O\u03b1\u2212, 0 <\u03b1 < 2) at voltages exceeding 4.3 V and subsequent O\u03b1\u2212 diffuse and release from the surface due to LNO layer has decomposed and failed in its role41,42. In this case, the chemical reaction between LCO and SSEs also contributes to the formation of the reconstruction layer due to their disparity in O chemical potential. This reconstruction layer not only impedes Li+ diffusion in LCO particles but also leads to the loss of active materials. Moreover, these O species diffuse to SSEs to form resistive products, increasing Li+ transport impedance within the composite positive electrode as discussed above. Excitingly, these layered-to-spinel/rock-salt transformation behaviors were significantly mitigated in LZF-LCO (Fig. 5d\u2013f). The enlarged lattice fringes and corresponding FFT results confirm the well-preserved layered structure of LCO, owing to the LZF protective layer, which effectively prevents the release of O\u03b1\u2212 and possesses long-term stability at the interface between LCO and LPSCl.\n\nFig. 5: Characterizations on chemical interaction between LCO and LPSCl with LNO or LZF protective layer. a\u2013c Cross-sectional STEM images of LNO-LCO showing the reconstructed spinel Co 3 O 4 phase and the corresponding FFT image. d\u2013f Cross-sectional STEM images of LZF-LCO showing the well preserved layered LCO phase and the corresponding FFT image. g, h EELS line scan of O K-edge at the near-surface region of LNO-LCO particle (g) and LZF-LCO particle (h). i, j EELS line scan of Co L 2 , 3 -edge at the near-surface region of LNO-LCO particle (i) and LZF-LCO particle (j). All the cells cycled at 70 mA g\u22121 and 25 \u00b0C before disassembly and sampling for the ex situ measurements. And all the samples were characterized at discharged state after 100 cycles. Full size image\n\nThe electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurement was further performed to distinguish the states of Co and the loss of O in different depths (Figs. 5g\u2013j, Supplementary Fig. 25). O K-pre-edge features in LCO have been identified as the result of a transition of electrons from the 1 s state to the hybridized O 2p-Co 3 d orbitals43,44. Concerning LNO-LCO particle after 100 cycles, the decreased O pre-edge peak and slight peak shift to higher energy loss within 15 nm from the surface indicate a decrease in the number of unoccupied states in the hybridized O 2p-Co 3 d orbitals, which is assigned to the reduction of transition metal and the sharing of d-orbitals holes with the oxygen ligands, including the associated decrease in covalency15. Moreover, the shift of Co L-edge to the lower energy loss and higher Co L 3 /L 2 area ratio in the near-surface region also manifests the occurrence of undesired spinel/rock-salt phase (Figs. 5i\u2013j, Supplementary Fig. 26). Impressively, only about 7 nm reconstruction layer exists in the surface of LZF-LCO after 100 cycles. Furthermore, the EDS mapping of the interface between LNO-LCO particle and LPSCl reveals the diffusion of Co into LPSCl (Supplementary Fig. 27a). This indicates that the LNO coating layer has already lost its functionality, and Co can readily diffuse into LPSCl, triggering its decomposition due to their differences in Co chemical potential. In contrast, the signals of Co in LZF-LCO remain confined to the LCO region (Supplementary Fig. 27b), once again highlighting the remarkably different protective effects of the two coatings. These results presented here demonstrate that LZF not only more effectively helps mitigate the SSEs decomposition but also plays a more substantial role in alleviating the structural transformation of LCO, jointly facilitating the interfacial charge transfer between LCO and SSEs, in accordance with the finding from the PEIS and DRT results.\n\nSince the veiled factors that made a significant difference between LNO and LZF protective layers have been clarified, further testing was conducted on the In-Li|LPSCl|LZF-LCO to fully exploit its potential. Its cycling durability at a high rate was demonstrated after evaluation of its rate capability (Fig. 6a, c). The voltage profile displays a high degree of overlap, particularly in the initial 1000 cycles. Impressively, highly stable cycling performance can be maintained for 2492 cycles at 420 mA g\u22121 with a capacity retention of 88.5%. To further verify the capability of LZF at an areal capacity of commercial interest (typically > 3 mAh cm\u22122), high-loading In-Li|LPSCl|LZF-LCO with an LCO areal loading of 30.19 mg cm\u22122 was evaluated (Fig. 6b, d). An areal capacity of 5.2 mAh cm\u22122 can be delivered at 7 mA g\u22121 in the first five cycles. When the current density is increased to 70 mA g\u22121, an areal capacity of up to 3.8 mAh cm\u22122 can be achieved. Excitingly, a capacity retention of 80.5% can be obtained after 1500 cycles. Another high-loading In-Li|LPSCl|LZF-LCO with an LCO areal loading of 30.82 mg cm\u22122 can display a high areal capacity of 2.95 mAh cm\u22122 at a high rate of 140 mA g\u22121, and achieve good capacity retention of 80% after 320 cycles (Supplementary Fig. 28). Such encouraging results again highlight the interfacial design principle for high-voltage all-solid-state batteries.\n\nFig. 6: Electrochemical performance of In-Li | LPSCl | LZF-LCO at high rate or high LCO loading. a, b Galvanostatic charge-discharge voltage profiles of In-Li|LPSCl|LZF-LCO at 420 mA g\u22121 and LCO loading of 11.32 mg cm\u22122 (a) and at 70 mA g\u22121 and LCO loading of 30.19 mg cm\u22122 (b). c, d Electrochemical cycling stability of In-Li|LPSCl|LZF-LCO at 420 mA g\u22121 and LCO loading of 11.32 mg cm\u22122 (c) and at 70 mA g\u22121 and LCO loading of 30.19 mg cm\u22122 (d). The LCO mass fraction in composite positive electrode is 80 wt.%. The experiments were performed between 2.0-3.9 V versus Li+/LiIn, corresponding to ~2.6\u22124.5 V versus Li+/Li.

Listen to this article using the player above. \u2716\n\nRead time: 2 minutes\n\nWhile lithium-ion batteries have been the go-to technology for everything from smartphones and laptops to electric cars, there are growing concerns about the future because lithium is relatively scarce, expensive and difficult to source, and may soon be at risk due to geopolitical considerations. Scientists around the world are working to create viable alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn international team of interdisciplinary researchers, including the Canepa Research Laboratory at the University of Houston, has developed a new type of material for sodium-ion batteries that could make them more efficient and boost their energy performance \u2014 paving the way for a more sustainable and affordable energy future.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new material, sodium vanadium phosphate with the chemical formula NaxV2(PO4)3, improves sodium-ion battery performance by increasing the energy density\u2014the amount of energy stored per kilogram\u2014by more than 15%. With a higher energy density of 458 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg) compared to the 396 Wh/kg in older sodium-ion batteries, this material brings sodium technology closer to competing with lithium-ion batteries.\n\nWant more breaking news?

This allowed theoretical modelling to go through experimental validation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers created a battery prototype using the new material, NaxV2(PO4)3, demonstrating significant energy storage improvements. NaxV2(PO4)3, part of a group called \u201cNa superionic conductors\u201d or NaSICONs, is designed to let sodium ions move smoothly in and out of the battery during charging and discharging.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike existing materials, it has a unique way of handling sodium, allowing it to work as a single-phase system. This means it remains stable as it releases or takes in sodium ions. This allows the NaSICON to remain stable during charging and discharging while delivering a continuous voltage of 3.7 volts versus sodium metal, higher than the 3.37 volts in existing materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this difference may seem small, it significantly increases the battery\u2019s energy density or how much energy it can store for its weight. The key to its efficiency is vanadium, which can exist in multiple stable states, allowing it to hold and release more energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe continuous voltage change is a key feature,\u201d said Canepa. \u201cIt means the battery can perform more efficiently without compromising the electrode stability. That\u2019s a game-changer for sodium-ion technology.\u201d\n\nPossibilities for a Sustainable Future\n\nThe implications of this work extend beyond sodium-ion batteries. The synthesis method used to create NaxV2(PO4)3 could be applied to other materials with similar chemistries, opening new possibilities for advanced energy storage technologies. That could in turn, impact everything from more affordable, sustainable batteries to power our devices to help us transition to a cleaner energy economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur goal is to find clean, sustainable solutions for energy storage,\u201d Canepa said. \"This material shows that sodium-ion batteries can meet the high-energy demands of modern technology while being cost-effective and environmentally friendly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: Park S, Wang Z, Choudhary K, et al.

(Courtesy of NASA)\n\nFor missions that could last years, EP thrusters must operate smoothly and consistently over long periods of time.\n\nElectric propulsion works by ionizing a neutral gas, usually xenon, and then using electric fields to accelerate the resulting ions. The ions, now forming a high-speed plasma beam, push the spacecraft forward.\n\nCompared to chemical rockets, EP systems are much more fuel-efficient, enabling spacecraft to travel farther while carrying less fuel. These systems are often powered by solar panels or small nuclear reactors, making them ideal for long missions in space, such as NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon, and eventually send astronauts to Mars and beyond.\n\nHowever, the plume emitted by the thrusters isn\u2019t just exhaust \u2014 it\u2019s the lifeline of the entire propulsion system. If not well understood, the plume can cause unexpected problems. Some particles may flow backward toward the spacecraft, potentially damaging important components on the craft, such as solar panels or communication antennas.\n\n\u201cFor missions that could last years, EP thrusters must operate smoothly and consistently over long periods of time,\u201d Cui said. This means scientists and engineers must have a deep understanding of how the plasma plume behaves in order to prevent any potential damage.\n\nWhat the Research Found\n\nCui specializes in building advanced computer simulations to study how plasma behaves in EP thruster plasma flows. These aren\u2019t just any simulations. They\u2019re powered by modern supercomputers and use a method called Vlasov simulation, an advanced \u201cnoise-free\u201d computational method.\n\nThe electrons in an EP beam don\u2019t behave exactly as predicted by simple models. They perform differently at different temperatures and speeds, creating distinct patterns.\n\nBeing able to precisely see the complexity of electron interactions, while factoring out data that confuse the bigger picture, is key.\n\nThe electrons are a lot like marbles packed into a tube. \u2026 However, if the \u2018marbles\u2019 roll out from the middle of the tube, they start to cool down.\n\n\u201cThe electrons are a lot like marbles packed into a tube,\u201d Cui said. \u201cInside the beam, the electrons are hot and move fast.

            "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a growing industry worth your investment dollars. One way to invest in this sector is to buy shares in businesses playing an essential role in the AI market. Two such companies are Applied Materials (AMAT 1.41%) and ASML (ASML 1.91%). Both supply machines to manufacture the microchips that make AI possible and are two of the world's biggest providers of this semiconductor equipment.\n\nASML specializes in lithography machines, which apply the blueprint of a microchip onto a silicon wafer. Applied Materials is known for the tools used in other steps of the microchip manufacturing process, such as metrology and inspection systems to ensure chips are defect-free.\n\nBoth play crucial roles in the AI ecosystem, but if you had to choose between them, which one is the superior AI stock?\n\nThe pros and cons of Applied Materials\n\nApplied Materials management sees tremendous long-term business opportunities thanks to the secular trends involving semiconductor components. Many markets now rely on semiconductors, including electric vehicles (EVs), robotics, solar and other renewable energy, and AI.\n\nThe company's products are poised to remain in demand for years as the equipment evolves to meet increasingly complex needs. For example, semiconductor manufacturers are starting to adopt Gate-All-Around (GAA) manufacturing technology to construct microchip transistors.\n\nThe Fin Field-Effect transistor architecture is widely used today, but GAA is the evolution of this approach. It's aimed at improving the performance, power efficiency, and density of transistors.\n\nApplied Materials generated $2.5 billion in revenue from GAA in its 2024 fiscal year, ended Oct. 27, and expects to double that in fiscal 2025. Overall, the company's sales grew 2% year over year in fiscal 2024 to $27.2 billion, the fifth consecutive year of revenue growth.\n\nHowever, a Morgan Stanley analyst downgraded the company's stock in December, expecting weak demand to weigh on the company's 2025 revenue. One factor involves U.S. government restrictions on semiconductor-related sales to China.\n\nChina is one of the company's most important markets. But for now, Applied Materials expects fiscal Q1 sales to reach around $7.2 billion, an increase from the prior-year's $6.7 billion.\n\nA look at ASML\n\nASML is not only a major supplier of lithography equipment to the semiconductor industry, but it's also the only company in the world today to sell the most advanced lithography technology, called extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. EUV machines are the sole means of manufacturing the most advanced microchips, ones that can produce powerful yet energy-efficient AI.\n\nThis gives ASML a competitive advantage. Even so, its stock price declined after announcing third-quarter results on Oct. 15. The company's Q3 revenue was $7.5 billion, up 20% from 2023's $6.2 billion, which is excellent growth. However, ASML management delivered a disappointing outlook.\n\nThe company expects to finish fiscal 2024 with 28 billion euros in revenue, a small increase over 2023's 27.6 billion euros. The macroeconomic factors weighing on Applied Materials is also impacting ASML.\n\nMoreover, management estimates the current weak demand in the semiconductor industry, outside of AI, will extend into 2025. CEO \u200b\u200bChristophe Fouquet stated, \"[O]ther market segments are taking longer to recover.\" This dour outlook contributed to ASML's shares being down about 6% in 2024.\n\nHowever, the company's near monopoly in lithography machines positions it to succeed over the long run once the semiconductor market rebounds from its current softness. After all, the semiconductor sector is a cyclical industry, so a downturn eventually is followed by an upswing.\n\nASML's sales to the China market are expected to be around 20% of total revenue in 2025, which is the company's historical trend. Over the long term, ASML predicts it will hit between 44 billion euros to 60 billion euros by 2030.\n\nChoosing between ASML and Applied Materials\n\nWhile current macroeconomic factors are a short-term headwind for Applied Materials and ASML, over the long run both are poised to benefit from years of growth in demand from the AI, EV, and other industries reliant on semiconductors. Therefore, it's ideal to invest in both companies.\n\nBut if I had to choose one, Applied Materials is the better AI investment. The tie-breaker comes down to stock valuation. To assess this, here's a look at each company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, a widely used metric that tells you how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar's worth of earnings.\n\nThe chart shows that Applied Materials and ASML have seen a drop in their P/E ratios from earlier in the year. However, the former's P/E multiple is considerably lower than ASML's at the time of this writing. This suggests that Applied Materials shares are the better value.\n\nIts stock valuation, combined with the long-term secular trends that can offset a potential decline in sales to China, make now a good time to pick up Applied Materials stock.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against the other best nanotechnology stocks to buy.\n\nNanotechnology, a groundbreaking concept introduced by Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman in 1959 during a speech at Caltech, focuses on working with materials at an incredibly small scale\u2014between one and 100 nanometers. At the nanoscale, things get interesting\u2014surface area and quantum effects start playing a big role in how materials behave. Nanotechnology thus focuses on understanding and harnessing these unique properties, covering all kinds of research and technologies that take advantage of them.\n\nSmall Science VS Big Impact\n\nOne of the most exciting applications of nanotechnology is in the semiconductor industry. Today\u2019s cutting-edge chips, like those powering iPhones and AI processors, rely on transistors that are just a few nanometers wide. Nanotechnology also plays a crucial role in improving semiconductor manufacturing, with specialized coatings and treatments that enhance equipment durability and efficiency, cutting downtime and boosting output.\n\nHealthcare is another sector transformed by nanotechnology, becoming a cornerstone of modern biomedicine. From improving cancer diagnosis to enabling targeted drug delivery and advancing pharmaceutical manufacturing, it\u2019s transforming the quality of treatments and boosting patient outcomes. This progress has led to the rise of nanomedicine, a field focused on innovative diagnostics, disease prevention, and streamlined drug development. In drug delivery, nanoscale technologies enhance how medications work by improving their stability and effectiveness. Perhaps the most exciting breakthrough is nanorobots\u2014tiny machines that can travel through the bloodstream to deliver drugs precisely where they\u2019re needed. This approach not only boosts precision but also reduces side effects, paving the way for more personalized and efficient treatments.\n\nIn the U.S., the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) drives much of the research and development in this field. With participation from 30 federal agencies, the program underscores nanotechnology\u2019s growing importance. The NNI\u2019s 2024 budget request of $2.16 billion\u2014the largest yet\u2014focuses on both fundamental research and real-world applications. Given the trade tensions with China, which leads the world in nanotech startups, this investment is likely to grow, highlighting the strategic value of staying at the forefront of nanotechnology innovation.",

An AI-powered facial recognition system, X-face.ai is specifically designed for survivors of domestic violence. It\u2019s programmed to identify specific individuals via home cameras and sends warnings immediately via Telegram to the user when the individuals come near the home.\n\n3 View gallery X-face.ai founders and President Herzog. ( Credit: X-face.ai )\n\n\u201cWe spoke to women who had experienced domestic violence about what their needs were and they spoke a lot about \u2018the day after,\u2019\u201d says Fanger. \u201cNormally, when we discuss solutions for domestic violence, we\u2019re talking about the period of the abuse, but not how to deal with the reality afterwards. For these women, living securely in their own homes is a major concern and there is no existing solution on the market.\u201d\n\nNow the startup is part of the fifth cohort of the Michal Sela Startup Academy, a startup accelerator focused on developing innovative solutions aimed at enhancing personal safety and preventing violence against women. In partnership with Google for Startups, the academy showcases the latest entrepreneurial endeavors in Safetech.\n\nThe forum\u2019s vision is to establish 100 tech startups by 2030, all dedicated to saving the lives of women suffering from domestic violence, with the ultimate goal of achieving zero femicides per year. \u201cI founded the Michal Sela Forum with the goal of saving the next potential victim,\u201d says CEO Lili Ben-Ami, whose sister Michal Sela was murdered by her husband in the presence of their daughter in 2019. Ben-Ami established the Michal Sela Forum in Michal\u2019s memory to study the subject and focus on preventative solutions, including by spearheading hackathons and tech accelerators.\n\nThe Michal Sela Startup Academy runs for three and a half months and includes intensive weekly sessions designed to address the specific needs of each startup, held at the Google Campus in Tel Aviv. Participating startups are provided with professional mentoring, expert-led lectures, business planning resources, and promotional materials to help them refine and develop their projects.\n\n\u201cThis is the fifth year we\u2019ve supported the development of technological solutions for dealing with violence against women,\u201d said Yuval Passov, Head of Google for Startups. \u201cWe see the highest value in combining technology and innovation for life-saving purposes. The ability of startups like She Proves to use AI to identify violence and gather evidence demonstrates how technology can create real, meaningful change. For Google, partnerships like this allow us to support groundbreaking ventures and advance life-changing technological solutions.\u201d\n\nFor SheProves Co-founder and CEO Ivgeni Kucherov, his incentive is even more personal. \u201cI recently filed a complaint with the police following a physical and sexual assault I experienced. Initially, they wouldn\u2019t pursue the case due to insufficient evidence to indict,\u201d says Kucherov. Only after he provided additional evidence, including an audio recording, was an indictment filed. \u201cI learned how easily police shut cases because there isn\u2019t enough evidence,\" he says, adding that this also led to \"a lack of belief from friends and colleagues, including victim-blaming, adding emotional distress and isolation and shifting blame away from the perpetrator. I decided to develop a solution that could help lead to more indictments and a decrease in violence.\u201d\n\n3 View gallery SheProves foundres. ( Credit: SheProves )\n\nKucherov, an engineer at NVIDIA, founded SheProves alongside CTO Noa Yaakov, COO Shir Papo and Nir Shilo during a Michal Sela Forum hackathon. The AI-powered solution detects violent incidents or threats of violence through a voice recognition system. The system transcribes the audio and translates it if needed, evaluates threat levels, and documents events to provide detailed, actionable reports, and the data is saved in the cloud and on a blockchain.\n\nThe app is built for smartphones and smart home assistants to ensure real-time response and reliable evidence. Kucherov hopes that for those who are experiencing violence, this will provide a much needed solution. \u201cI just want every person - women and men - to feel more secure, in public and in their homes.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Sheproves and X-face.ai, other ventures in this year\u2019s cohort at the Michal Sela Startup Academy include Watch Out, an app that uses smartwatch data to monitor health parameters like heart rate, body movement, and language, enabling it to detect abnormal patterns and send real-time alerts to emergency contacts while ensuring the privacy of the user.\n\n3 View gallery The Michal Sela Forum's 5th Startup Accelerator. ( Credit: Michal Sela Forum )\n\nSelfy, a real-time emotional feedback app, assists users during violent or difficult situations by analyzing conversations and offering tips for emotional resilience and self-empowerment. IC-Help, a tech solution developed by ICL, aims to detect violent conversations within homes by combining smart listening devices and advanced data analysis, sending alerts based on detected toxic patterns. Protect Me, a compact smart pepper spray device, is designed for women\u2019s self-defense. Check-In is an app that helps people in therapy track their emotional well-being during stressful episodes by using their phone's camera, texts, or voice to document their emotional state in real-time.",

(NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against the other long-term stocks.\n\nTo select stocks with long-term growth potential, investors should focus on fundamental analysis, evaluating financial health through earnings history, revenue growth, and profit margins. Companies that consistently demonstrate earnings growth and possess a strong competitive advantage are more likely to thrive over time. Investing in dividend-paying stocks is also beneficial, as those that regularly increase dividends indicate financial stability. Identifying stocks in growing industries, such as technology, renewable energy, and healthcare, can further guide investment choices. Diversification across various sectors reduces risk, ensuring that underperformance in one area can be balanced by gains in another. By combining such strategies, investors can improve their chances of finding promising stocks that align with long-term financial goals.\n\nOn December 26, Drew Pettit, Director at Citi Research, discussed his long-term investment strategy on CNBC as he looks ahead to 2025, emphasizing a \"barbell\" approach that balances high-growth stocks with lower valuation names. This is relevant for investors considering a long-term stock portfolio over the next decade. Pettit advocates for pairing mega-cap growth stocks with cyclical and defensive sectors, where fundamentals are expected to improve. He believes that adopting this barbell strategy can enhance portfolio resilience and capitalize on diverse market opportunities.\n\nIn the realm of AI, Pettit noted a growing enthusiasm among investors. He highlighted a shift in perception, moving beyond backend applications to include companies that are more customer-facing within the AI value chain. When it comes to specific investments within AI, Pettit expressed a preference for semiconductors over software at this time. He pointed to Marvell Technology as a standout choice, projecting that its custom AI chip business could experience remarkable growth, projected at 200% next year, followed by an additional 60% growth in the subsequent year.\n\nPettit also discussed his strategy for 2025 and outlined plans to reduce exposure to consumer stocks while focusing on attractive areas within the sector that are less sensitive to interest rates. He highlighted the potential of fintech and payment companies and said that they are well-positioned for long-term growth amid deregulation. Pettit emphasized that his firm's focus is not on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but on traditional payment networks. He expressed concerns about consumer data trends and interest rate changes, advocating for a balanced approach by seeking high-quality stocks less affected by rate fluctuations and recommending key positions such Big Tech for long-term investment.",

When it comes to TV tech though, progress is king, and as such, there\u2019s always an even better, brighter, and more exciting TV on the horizon.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying TV technology progresses at a bank balance-obliterating rate. While that QD-OLED sitting pride of place in your lounge may be the best OLED TV right now, the simple fact is that it will likely be usurped by a better model in 2025. Granted, these improvements may be minor \u2013 say an improved UI to make navigating apps easier or a slight brightness boost \u2013 but hey, an upgrade is an upgrade.\n\nIf you\u2019ve not bought a new TV in a while, 2025 could well entice you back into the market for a fresh display, be it a super bright \u201cMAX\u201d OLED panel or potentially even the long-rumored debut television from Apple. Read on for the TV tech trends we think could emerge in the year ahead.\n\nApple will enter the TV market\n\n(Image credit: Apple)\n\nWe\u2019re pretty sure early humans were riding woolly mammoths back when the rumors of Apple entering the TV market first surfaced \u2013 don\u2019t worry, you can totally trust our Ice Age facts. Well in 2025, all of that long-gestating scuttlebutt could finally become a reality.\n\nOver the past few months, whispers have grown that Apple is \u2018evaluating\u2019 a launch of its long-lost TV set. Why now? With an increasing number of TV manufacturers demanding your data when you first set up your smart TV, Apple, which is bigging up the privacy features of its devices more than ever, might have seen a gap in the market.\n\nIf Apple markets its rumored debut TV to those users who aren\u2019t keen on regularly sharing their details every time they want to download an app, the Cupertino Crew may find some sales success.\n\nThis being Apple, longstanding software support would likely be stellar if the California company did decide to release a TV. That shouldn\u2019t be sniffed at when several traditional TV manufacturers haven\u2019t done a great job on this front.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThrow in the fact Apple fans have an almost cult-level appreciation for the firm\u2019s products, and we can genuinely see a future where Apple releases an \u2018I-TV\u2019, if not in 2025, but certainly in the near future.\n\nMAX OLED could set better, brighter standards\n\n(Image credit: Samsung)\n\nQuantum Dot technology and Micro Lens Array (MLA) panels have seen the best OLED TVs reach near unimaginable brightest levels over the last 24 months compared to what the technology used to be capable of. But if it\u2019s up to a company called Applied Materials, the future is going to cook your pupils even more as pictures get even brighter. Better grab some shades.\n\nWithout bombarding you with too many head-spinning specifics, \u2018MAX OLED\u2019 (via HDTVTest ) could be the next lotto-winning ticket in the Organic Light-Emitting Diode world.\n\nConjured up by a company called Applied Materials, this new tech scales OLED manufacturing in a way that triples brightness lined up next to W-OLED panels, while also more than doubling screen resolution. If Applied Materials info is on the money, these advanced screens will provide panels with a pixel density of 2,000 pixels per inch.\n\nThose rumored stats are certainly eye-catching, no question. A little less exciting, but more beneficial in practical everyday use? MAX OLED displays could be 30% more energy efficient than old-school OLEDs, with the scrumptious cherry on top that they could also last up to five times longer.\n\n\n\nSamsung is the first TV giant to hop on the MAX OLED train, and if the final results are as promised, we could be stepping into the brightest and most planet-friendly version of the premium TV tech currently available.\n\nLCD TV viewing angles will improve\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nWith OLED and mini-LED TVs continuing to evolve, LCD sets that use a regular LED backlight have felt more and more like the forgotten middle child over the past few years. While the technology will never offer the contrast quality or convincing black levels of its rivals, certain LCD TVs are due for significant upgrades in 2025.\n\n\n\nAccording to a report (via HDTVTest), a range of premium WHVA LCD televisions from Samsung and TCL will launch next year, offering improved contrast and color when viewing content at wide angles \u2013 something that has been a historic weakness with traditional VA (Vertical Alignment) LCD TVs.\n\n\n\nThese premium LCD panels are being manufactured by TCL CSOT, a subsidiary partner of TCL. The company recently revealed some of these new screens at an event where it showed off an 85-inch WHVA LCD TV that had an impressive 150Hz refresh rate.\n\nConsidering the majority of consumers still mostly buy LCD/LED TVs, it would be great to see WHVA shake up and evolve a technology that has long needed significant revisions to fix its glaring flaws.\n\nMore ads on your smart TV\n\n(Image credit: Telly)\n\nOn a slightly gloomy note, 2025 may not be all sunshine and lollipops for the future of TV tech. With several TV firms losing money on hardware to profit from ad revenue (something that is particularly prominent in the United States), it\u2019s difficult to envision a future where unskippable commercials aren\u2019t the norm.\n\nAs TV prices continue to drop, manufacturers need new ways of offsetting these costs. Seemingly the easiest way? Ramping up the number of ads that pop up every time you switch on your smart TV\u2019s home menu.\n\nIf TV companies are willing to reduce hardware prices to secure a bigger audience they can peddle mandatory ads upon, they\u2019re probably onto a winner. After all, do you really think about how many sales pitches you\u2019re going to have to skip on your set when you\u2019re buying a new TV on Black Friday?\n\nOLED TVs will also get cheaper thanks to inkjet tech\n\n(Image credit: TCL)\n\nPrices of OLED TVs have dropped significantly in recent years, yet they\u2019re not exactly ultra-affordable quite yet. That may change in 2025 and beyond though, with the advent of TCL inkjet-printed OLED panels.\n\nThe Chinese firm has been talking about inkjet in regards to OLED displays for a decade at this point, but it\u2019s only now that the tech is set to become a reality. The prototype technology is finally rolling out in the form of a 21.6-inch 4K OLED screen that\u2019s designed to be used by medical professionals. The exciting knock-on effect for potential future OLED IJP TVs? The inkjet-printed production process is 20% cheaper and 30% faster than manufacturing traditional OLED panels.\n\nThough it\u2019s currently unclear whether the IJP process can enter mass market production in its current form, if it does, the more affordable costs will hopefully result in savings for folks interested in inkjet OLEDs.\n\nNot only could IJP OLED TVs be cheaper than traditional W-OLED screens, but they should also last longer and save you money on your energy bill, as they\u2019re supposedly more energy efficient.",
