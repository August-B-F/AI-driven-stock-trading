            "content": "US president Donald Trump has rolled out import tariffs for all kinds of countries. Goods from the European Union face a tariff of 20 percent as soon as they appear in the US. This development and many others have prompted ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet to speak out about the increasing geopolitical tensions. The Dutch chip machine manufacturer emphasizes that international cooperation is crucial for progress in the sector.\n\n\u201c\u201cOur industry has been built basically on the ability of people to work together, to innovate together,\u201d Fouquet said during an industry event in the Netherlands on Thursday, which Bloomberg has a recording of. He emphasized that export controls and increasing geopolitical tensions undermine this cooperation, without specifically addressing the new US import tariffs.\n\nImpact on European tech sector\n\nTech companies in the European Union that are confronted with a 20 percent levy are still determining the impact on their business activities and supply chains. ASML is the only manufacturer of EUV lithography machines in the world and is therefore in a unique position. Without ASML\u2019s machines, it will be impossible for semiconductor companies to produce the chips needed for high-quality smartphones and computers.\n\nAlthough the tariffs announced by Trump exclude semiconductors, they do not specifically mention chip machines like those made by ASML. The latest models are said to cost 350 million dollars each. Import tariffs could mean that Intel and the American branch of TSMC could have to hand over more than 400 million dollars net. An ASML spokesperson declined to comment to Bloomberg on how the tariffs could affect the company.\n\nAccording to Thornburg Investment Management, which the news agency spoke to, the direct short-term effects could be limited. In 2024, approximately 16 percent of ASML\u2019s net sales came from customer facilities in the United States, according to the company\u2019s annual report. ASML\u2019s heavy reliance on revenue from China is yet another concern entirely, but it does ensure that the current tariffs could have a limited effect.\n\nExpansion in the US\n\nSeveral major ASML customers, including Intel, TSMC and Samsung, are expanding their activities in the US, with plans to build a series of new chip factories in the coming years. Together with the AI initiative Project Stargate, the outlines of a North America-centered ecosystem for the production and use of advanced chips are becoming visible, although international dependence is virtually impossible to eliminate. For example, some substances such as gallium nitride, a possible substitute for silicon in chips, mainly come from China.\n\nBloomberg also notes that the financial picture for US expansion for chip players is actually positive. An important stimulus for American expansion is a 25 percent tax break on investments, part of the Chips and Science Act of 2022, which can be used to compensate for the purchase of expensive chip machines. In the long term, this could have a positive effect on the sale of ASML equipment in the US, and therefore also on ASML itself, despite the import tariffs.\n\nBroader trade conflicts\n\nTrump\u2019s so-called \u2018reciprocal tariffs\u2019 affect both allies and opponents, with a reach that goes far beyond any trade measures from his first term. This also affects the Netherlands and several other major exporters of chip machines, such as Japan (now facing a 24 percent tariff) and South Korea (26 percent import tariffs).\n\nThe EU is preparing a package of retaliatory measures, said Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade Reinette Klever, whereby individual countries have the option of supplying input. \u201cI met with the US trade representative in Washington a few weeks ago and there I stressed the importance of reciprocal trade and that remains our commitment in the future,\u201d Klever stated. She refused to comment to Bloomberg on the question of whether the Netherlands would seek exemptions for ASML.\n\nIncreasing pressure on the chip industry\n\nAs mentioned above, the situation for ASML was already complex due to the previously imposed export restrictions to China. These have almost always been adopted by the Netherlands based on the wishes of the US, under both former president Biden and Trump. Fouquet, who last year succeeded ASML veteran Peter Wennink, faces the challenge of leading ASML through this turbulent period. In fact, the situation is becoming increasingly challenging for the chip machine manufacturer. In recent years, export restrictions have led to an expansion to DUV machines, where previously only high-tech EUV chip manufacturing machines were subject to restrictions.\n\nThe European semiconductor industry is now trying to strengthen its position. The European Semiconductor Industry Association (ESIA), of which ASML is a member, has called on the EU to hurry up with more support for the sector and to ensure fewer export restrictions to give the European chip industry a boost.\n\nGlobal competition\n\nWe have not even mentioned the growing diversity of competitors on the world stage. In addition to the established players such as Taiwan, South Korea, the US and Japan, new parties such as Saudi Arabia are also vying for a key role in the chip industry.\n\nWith ASML, the Netherlands has acquired a crucial position in global chip production, but here too, issues are arising that could change the situation. The Dutch government has set up Project Beethoven, a program to keep chip machine manufacturers such as ASML in the country, although it recently became apparent that this project is at risk of falling behind schedule. The situation must change now if all ambitions are to be realized before 2030, and for that to happen, ASML may have to relocate some of its activities abroad.\n\nDespite the challenges, ASML\u2019s position as an indispensable player in the chip industry remains undisputed, but the increasing geopolitical tensions pose a threat to the international cooperation that Fouquet believes is crucial for further innovation in the sector.",

His illegal income amounted to about \u20ac40,000 thousand, and he faces 18 to 32 months in prison. Although the engineer did not have the opportunity to steal the volume of required for production documents, the coordinated group could potentially facilitate semiconductor production in Russia. Investigators found that he received 105 internal ASML documents and 88 TSMC-related files.\n\nThe materials did not contain complete drawings for the creation of equipment for the manufacture of plates or otherwise, but they were marked as confidential and related to a line capable of producing 28 nm chips suitable for military use. Investigators believe that he shared this data via cloud storage, messengers, and handed over a USB drive in Moscow, for which he was allegedly paid the amount mentioned above.\n\nThe defendant is also linked to an attempt to purchase a chemical vapor deposition tool needed for the production of microchips. However, according to the report, the tool was first redirected to Israel and then never delivered.\n\nIn August 2024, German A. was taken into custody. A month later, ASML and NXP officially notified him of suspicion of espionage. His case is currently being considered in court, and the authorities suspect ties to Russian intelligence. Both companies are involved in the investigation and have filed complaints against the former employee.\n\nPrior to his arrest last year, the defendant had a long career in semiconductor design and manufacturing. In 2008 and 2009, he was an intern at the Imec research center in Belgium. After that, he joined the Greek research institute NCSR and later started working at Fab 1, the Dresden facility of GlobalFoundries. In 2015, he joined Mapper, a Dutch startup that developed maskless lithography technology. In 2012, Mapper received financial support from \u00abRosnano\u00bb and built a small factory in Russia.\n\nWhen Mapper went bankrupt at the end of 2018, ASML took over its assets and staff under pressure from the Dutch and US governments to protect the technology. Herman A. was among more than 100 engineers who moved to ASML, where he operated machines for the production of electro-optical components. The spy\u2019s name appears in four patent applications related to ASML, the last of which was published only a month ago.\n\nIn January 2022, the Russian joined NXP on a temporary contract as a process engineer. In May of that year, he contacted the company to get a price from ASM International for a used chemical vapor deposition tool. Initially, the equipment was supposed to be shipped to Germany, but then the destination was changed to Israel, but the goods were never delivered. Now it is perceived as an attempt to assemble parts for a new production facility.\n\nStatements by his ex-wife show that at the end of 2023, Herman was in contact with Russian researchers about building a factory in Russia capable of producing chips using 28-nm technology. That same year, he held a position at Delft University of Technology, but remained isolated from important research, and investigators found no signs of theft there.\n\nIn the past, ASML and NXP have also experienced breaches related to unauthorized access. At the end of 2023, a Chinese-linked cyber group was discovered to have been covertly operating at NXP for a long period of time. ASML often faces cyberattacks and insider threats: previously a former employee from China stole confidential data. Although he also did not have access to the full set of documentation, a wider network of agents could have obtained it. Both companies have now strengthened their security: internal systems limit data sharing between departments, and employee activity is monitored.\n\nSource: Tom`s Hardware",

            "content": "Semiconductors are more than just a crucial component of modern technology\u2014they are the backbone of global economies, from consumer electronics to military systems. In a bold and strategic move, China has unveiled a \u20ac37 billion investment plan aimed at bolstering its domestic chip production and reducing its reliance on foreign technology. This investment signals Beijing\u2019s determination to reduce its dependence on Western companies and build a self-sufficient semiconductor industry, a goal that could fundamentally reshape the competitive dynamics of global technology.\n\nSMIC vs. ASML: A Clash of Giants\n\nAt the heart of the semiconductor battle between China and the West stand two titans: SMIC (Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation), China\u2019s leading chip manufacturer, and ASML, the Dutch firm that holds an effective monopoly on photolithography\u2014a technology essential for producing cutting-edge microchips.\n\nPhotolithography involves using light to etch intricate circuit patterns onto silicon wafers, a process that\u2019s critical for the production of advanced microchips. ASML\u2019s dominance in this technology has made it a key player in the race for semiconductor supremacy, and its importance is only growing as the demand for increasingly complex chips rises. The ongoing technological rivalry between SMIC and ASML highlights the larger global struggle between Eastern and Western forces in the tech sector.\n\nWhen I think about the pressure China is under to catch up in this arena, I can\u2019t help but recall my own experiences working in industries dependent on the latest technology. In a way, it\u2019s like trying to catch up to a competitor that has been years ahead in the race. That\u2019s the situation China finds itself in today with ASML leading the way in semiconductor technology.\n\nChina\u2019s Bold Move in Photolithography\n\nWith U.S. trade restrictions limiting China\u2019s access to some of the most advanced chip-making technologies, including photolithography, China is making an aggressive push to develop its own capabilities in this field. The \u20ac37 billion investment plan is a direct response to these restrictions, aiming to create competitive lithography machines that could reduce China\u2019s dependence on Western companies like ASML.\n\nIf successful, China\u2019s efforts could drastically alter the global semiconductor landscape. It\u2019s a massive gamble for Beijing, but one that underscores just how important control over semiconductor production has become in today\u2019s geopolitical climate. This isn\u2019t just about economic power; it\u2019s about national security and technological sovereignty. If China can develop its own lithography technology, it would be a game-changer for its chip-making industry and for its broader tech ambitions.\n\nI remember reading about China\u2019s drive to independently develop technology in various sectors. It\u2019s not just a matter of competition; it\u2019s about ensuring the country can thrive without depending on external powers. This investment shows just how serious China is about achieving that self-sufficiency.\n\nThe Huawei Catalyst : A Game-Changing Moment\n\nA key milestone in this ongoing struggle was the release of the Huawei Mate 60 Pro in 2023. Despite facing severe U.S. sanctions, this device was equipped with an advanced 7nm processor, a clear indication that China\u2019s semiconductor industry was able to innovate even under extreme pressure. The success of the Mate 60 Pro marked a turning point in the semiconductor race and solidified China\u2019s commitment to developing its own high-end chip-making capabilities.\n\nThis event was significant not just because of the product itself, but because it demonstrated that China could overcome some of the hurdles posed by Western sanctions and continue to make strides in semiconductor development. The Huawei example became a rallying point for China, proving that the country could stand up to technological restrictions and still find ways to innovate.\n\nI can recall how much of a game-changer it was when China proved it could still thrive, despite the odds. It\u2019s like when a startup, underfunded and faced with overwhelming competition, comes out with a groundbreaking product\u2014it sends a message that things are changing.\n\nASML\u2019s Technological Advancements\n\nWhile China is ramping up its efforts to compete in photolithography, ASML is far from slowing down. The Dutch company is currently developing EUV High-NA (Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography with High Numerical Aperture) technology, which promises unprecedented precision for chips that are smaller than 2 nanometers. This new technology is expected to push the boundaries of semiconductor manufacturing, enabling the production of chips with even more powerful capabilities and smaller form factors.\n\nASML\u2019s relentless pursuit of cutting-edge technology ensures that it remains the leader in photolithography. The company\u2019s continuous innovation not only keeps it ahead of China but also underscores the immense challenge that China faces in its quest to develop competitive lithography systems. While SMIC and other Chinese firms have made impressive progress, ASML\u2019s technological edge still holds the key to the next phase of semiconductor production.\n\nFrom my perspective, this race reminds me of the importance of innovation in staying ahead. It\u2019s not just about competing\u2014it\u2019s about constantly reinventing and pushing boundaries, something ASML has mastered and that China will have to catch up to in order to compete on an equal footing.\n\nThe Geopolitical Stakes of Semiconductor Control\n\nControl over semiconductor production is no longer just a business matter. It has become a central issue in global geopolitics, with profound implications for both civilian and military technologies. The global semiconductor market is a strategic asset, and the country that dominates this sector holds significant influence over global supply chains and technological development.\n\nAs nations recognize the importance of semiconductor dominance, these technologies have become a central pillar of national security strategies. China\u2019s \u20ac37 billion investment signals that the country is ready to stake its claim in this critical field, which could have far-reaching implications for the global tech landscape.\n\nThinking about the stakes here, it\u2019s almost like when a country has access to critical infrastructure\u2014that control becomes indispensable for its global position. And that\u2019s exactly what China is vying for in this case: control over an essential sector that influences much more than just smartphones and computers.\n\nWhat China\u2019s \u20ac37 Billion Investment Means for the Industry ?\n\nChina\u2019s \u20ac37 billion bet on developing its own lithography technology is a game-changing move in the semiconductor wars. While ASML remains the global leader, China\u2019s push to reduce its reliance on the West could alter the landscape in ways that we\u2019re only beginning to understand. If successful, this strategy could significantly impact the global semiconductor market, reshaping competition and perhaps even the future of technological development.\n\nFor now, the battle for semiconductor supremacy is intensifying, and with high stakes, the global market is watching closely. The outcome of this rivalry could shape the future of technology itself. It\u2019s clear that China\u2019s investment is a move that will not only change the industry but could also have lasting geopolitical consequences.",

German A. was among over 100 engineers who moved to ASML, where he operated machines for producing electro-optical components. For now, ASML's employees describe German A. as a 'not high flyer,' whereas others claim he was a committed but introverted technician who had difficulty communicating.\n\nHowever, according to NRC, German A.'s name appears on four patent filings associated with ASML, the latest of which was published just a month ago. These documents list several inventors, and it is unclear whether German A. played a significant role in those innovations.\n\nA review of his digital activity shows that he accessed restricted files on two days in December 2020, even though he had no need for them. At the time, the company's internal security systems did not raise any alerts. Experts asked by NRC believe the leaked data includes presentations and manuals but not the core plans needed to construct chip machines or an entire plant. His contract ended in 2021 when ASML outsourced his work.\n\nAfter ASML, German A. used recruitment agencies to look for work in research roles but was unsuccessful. In January 2022, during the pandemic, he joined NXP in Nijmegen on a temporary contract as a process technician. In May of that year, he contacted a company in Nijmegen to request a quote for a used chemical vapor deposition tool from ASM International. Initially, the equipment was supposed to be shipped to Germany, but he later changed the destination to Israel. The item was never delivered. This is now seen as an attempt to gather parts for a new facility.\n\nStatements from his former spouse reveal that by late 2023, he was in touch with Russian researchers about building a fab in Russia capable of producing chips using a 28nm technology. Back then, Russian entities were blacklisted and could not get advanced chips from prominent suppliers, whether distributors or foundries.\n\nThat same year, he held a one-year position at TU Delft but remained isolated, and investigators found no signs of theft there.\n\nNot first time\n\nBoth ASML and NXP experienced breaches involving unauthorized access in the past. In late 2023, it was revealed that a cyber group linked to China had been covertly operating within NXP's systems for an extended period. ASML also battles frequent cyberattacks and insider threats: in early 2022, a former Chinese employee stole confidential data. Although that employee, just like German A., lacked access to complete designs needed to construct a fab tool or equip a fab, a broader network of similar operatives could realistically piece together enough to boost the semiconductor industries of China and Russia.\n\nIn response, both companies have strengthened their digital defenses: internal systems now limit access between departments and employee activity is tracked for unusual behavior.",

            "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly shifting from hype to reality. It feels like yesterday that ChatGPT first went viral. That was in early 2023. Just over two years later, research by Statista estimates the AI market will reach $244 billion this year and exceed $1 trillion by 2031.\n\nIt's an exciting time for technology investors, though the artificial intelligence opportunity will evolve as it matures, and AI stocks won't go up in a straight line.\n\nLook no further than recent weeks. Volatility has shaken the market, and while the major market indexes remain within shouting distance of all-time highs, several high-profile AI stocks, like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), and ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML), have fallen 26% to 38% from their highs.\n\nHere is why each stock should thrive over the next five years (and beyond) and are no-brainer buys right now.\n\nDemand for Nvidia's AI GPU chips is not slowing\n\nNvidia has been the biggest winner in AI's early innings. The company's GPU chips became the industry standard for training large language models, which can require many thousands of chips housed in data centers. Whether companies are developing smarter AI models or simply trying to keep them running as the world floods them with queries, it seems all roads have led to increased chip demand.\n\nThere is an ongoing development curve with AI chips, with a push for more computing power while using less energy. The initial AI investment cycle centered on Nvidia's Hopper chip microarchitecture, and now its successor, Blackwell, could be even more successful. Nvidia has a product roadmap that could last years as the world races to build AI technology.\n\nDespite Nvidia stock's 26% decline, analysts continue to raise their revenue estimates for 2025 and 2026 as AI investments remain strong. Today, the stock trades at a PEG ratio of roughly 1.0 using its current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and estimated 35% long-term earnings growth rate. That's a compelling value for an AI leader, and it gives investors a margin of safety if growth slows somewhat from its current trajectory.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's foundry leadership makes it a long-term winner by default\n\nSome investors may not realize that Nvidia doesn't manufacture its chips. Instead, it depends on chip foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor, the world leader in this field. Counterpoint Research estimates Taiwan Semiconductor's global foundry market share at approximately 67%, meaning it's the biggest and best chip builder by a country mile.",

            "content": "Without innovations in microchips, none of the technology we take for granted today would be possible. Smartphones, AI models, and vehicles depend heavily on this industry, making it a vital investment area.\n\nI see three promising chip stocks that look like buys right now. They are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and ASML (NASDAQ: ASML). Each has a different thesis for why it will be a successful investment in 2025.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia can be considered a chip company because it manufactures GPUs that use a considerable amount of proprietary chip technology to make them best in class. Nvidia's top-performing GPUs have allowed it to capture nearly all of the artificial intelligence (AI) computing market, which has provided the company with massive growth over the past two years.\n\nIn 2025, Nvidia is working to ramp up production of its next-generation Blackwell architecture, which provides incredible improvements over the previous Hopper architecture. With many of Nvidia's largest clients warning investors they will continue ramping up data center spending in 2025 to meet the growing AI demand, Nvidia is primed to benefit once again.\n\nAlthough 2025 won't bring the same explosive growth for Nvidia as the previous two years, Wall Street analysts still expect 51% growth for fiscal 2026 (ending January 2026). Considering Nvidia's $3.4 trillion market capitalization, that's incredible growth. Furthermore, Nvidia's stock isn't as expensive as it appears.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nNVDA PE Ratio data by YCharts\n\nWith the company growing revenue at a 50% clip, 54 times trailing earnings really isn't a bad price to pay. As a result, I think investors can confidently take a position in Nvidia right now.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n\nNvidia's GPUs contain chips manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor. Because TSMC is a chip foundry, companies like Nvidia send TSMC chip designs to fabricate. However, Taiwan Semi is a neutral party, as it also manufactures chips for competitor GPUs. This makes Taiwan Semiconductor an intriguing AI investment, as it is a true picks-and-shovel play on the AI boom.\n\nManagement hasn't been shy about letting investors know how much AI is benefiting the company. For 2024, management expects AI-related revenue to triple year over year and make up a mid-teens percentage of overall revenue. That's massive growth, and considering that Nvidia is still expected to grow in 2025, it bodes well for Taiwan Semiconductor.\n\nTSMC will also launch its latest product, 2-nanometer (nm) chips, at the end of the year. These chips are expected to be far more power efficient than previous generations and will greatly reduce operating costs for expensive AI computing equipment.\n\nWith Taiwan Semiconductor trading at just 23 times forward earnings, it looks like a great stock to scoop up right now.\n\nASML\n\nASML isn't doing as well as the previous two stocks. ASML provides extreme ultraviolet lithography machines that are vital in the chip manufacturing process. No other company in the world has this technology, giving ASML a monopoly.\n\nHowever, Western governments have used this monopoly as a tool in their quest to prevent China from overtaking them in technological prowess. As a result, the Netherlands (where ASML is headquartered) and the U.S. have placed export bans on some of its machines, only allowing the low-tech ones to be sold and serviced in China.\n\nThese bans have started to hurt ASML, as management had to cut 2025 revenue guidance from the original 30 billion to 40 billion euro range to between 30 billion and 35 billion euros. Still, the long-term growth picture is intact, as management's revenue guidance for 2030 of 44 billion to 60 billion euros hasn't changed from the original 2022 investor day guidance.\n\nASML's technology is nearly impossible to replicate, as it is the culmination of decades of innovation. With its machines vital in the chip manufacturing process, ASML is well positioned to be a long-term winner in the chip investing world. With the stock down around 36% from its highs after the China news, now seems like a great time to scoop up shares and capitalize while the rest of the market is fearful.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about ASML (ASML).\n\nASML currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.42, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 24 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.42 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 24 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 19 are Strong Buy, representing 79.2% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ASML\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ASML here>>>\n\n\n\nThe ABR suggests buying ASML, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nShould You Invest in ASML?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for ASML, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.8% over the past month to $25.37.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ASML. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for ASML may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\n7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days\n\nJust released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys.

Although autism can bring challenges, it sometimes also offers unique advantages in the tech world. For example, people with autism can excel in pattern recognition, attention to detail, and analytical thinking. Leading companies such as ASML embrace these qualities. They recognize the value of neurodiversity within their organization.\n\nAlbert Einstein and Elon Musk\n\nRelying on routines, difficulty with social interactions, sensitivity to sounds: autism can be a major challenge in daily life. But it can also bring unique advantages that are particularly useful, for example, in the tech industry and science. Icons such as Albert Einstein and Elon Musk are often mentioned as examples. Both are (possibly) autistic, and they have managed to turn their peculiarities into groundbreaking ideas.\n\nScientific research into autism\n\nA study conducted by the recruitment agency Auticon estimated that the prevalence of autism in the technology sector is around 2-3%. This is considerably higher than the estimated 1% prevalence in the general population.\n\nStudies show that people with autism spectrum disorders often excel in creative processes, particularly when it comes to original linguistic and figurative tasks. This can result in unconventional solutions.\n\nPeople with autism also sometimes have a strong focus on specific interests. This selective interest can lead them to delve intensively into a particular subject. This not only ensures a high degree of expertise but also exceptional concentration during their work\u2014which can result in groundbreaking insights and innovations.\n\nASML embraces neurodiversity\n\nA few years ago, ASML published a message expressing its appreciation for neurodiversity within the organization. With the message \u201cNot everyone at ASML thinks the same way, and we're proud of it\u201d, the company emphasized that it embraces difference.\n\nA good example is Arnout Nederpelt, a business analyst at ASML who has autism. After years of struggling to find work, he found his place within the company. He has now been working there for more than a decade.\n\nUnique perspectives\n\nNeurodiversity encompasses various neurological variations, such as autism, ADHD, and dyslexia. Each brain has unique characteristics, challenges, and talents. People with neurodiversity sometimes think differently. In the tech world, that can be very valuable. Unique perspectives ultimately contribute to technological progress in the world.",

            "content": "ASML Holding's ASML short percent of float has risen 9.52% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 1.64 million shares sold short, which is 0.46% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 1.0 days to cover their short positions on average.\n\nWhy Short Interest Matters\n\nShort interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.\n\nShort interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.\n\nSee Also: List of the most shorted stocks\n\nASML Holding Short Interest Graph (3 Months)\n\nAs you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for ASML Holding has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.\n\nComparing ASML Holding's Short Interest Against Its Peers\n\nPeer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro, ASML Holding's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 9.17%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.\n\nDid you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock?

            "content": "More doubt is being cast over the US CHIPS Act program with the Trump administration threatening to halt payments unless companies in line to receive funding commit to substantially expand their own investments.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued an Executive Order to establish a new office within the Department of Commerce titled the United States Investment Accelerator.\n\nThe office's aim is \"to encourage companies to make large investments in the United States,\" and among its powers will be oversight of the CHIPS Program to maximize the benefits for taxpayers, the White House states.\n\nThis move follows earlier calls by President Trump to scrap CHIPS Act funding entirely, and any remaining money to be allocated to cutting federal debt.\n\nAccording to reports, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick has indicated that he intends to withhold CHIPS Act grants already agreed in order to push the companies involved to substantially expand the projects they have planned.\n\nThe aim is to force semiconductor makers promised grants and subsidies for building new manufacturing facilities on American soil to invest even more, without increasing the size of federal grants. This follows the example of TSMC, which earlier this month pledged to spend $100 billion to expand its US fabrication plants.\n\nHowever, that $100 billion figure disclosed by TSMC chief CC Wei during his meeting with Trump was merely an estimated price tag for plans the company had in the pipeline anyway. Intel's former boss, Pat Gelsinger, also pointed out recently that while TSMC is building fabs in the US, it is keeping its research and development in Taiwan.\n\n\"If you don't have R&D in the US, you will not have semiconductor leadership in the US,\" Gelsinger said at the end of last week.\n\nHis old company finalized an agreement with the Department of Commerce in November to receive up to $7.86 billion from the CHIPS Act, which would make it the largest beneficiary of the federal government's cash, if it actually receives it all.\n\nThat was also conditional on Intel retaining control of its foundries, amid talk that the troubled Santa Clara-based biz was potentially looking to spin them off as part of a restructure. Intel has since announced it is delaying some of its fab buildout, such as pushing back the completion of its $28 billion Ohio plant until at least 2030.\n\nGelsinger had previously stated that without CHIPS Act funding, Intel would continue to build new fabs in Arizona and Ohio, however the expansion would take longer, and it wouldn't be as comprehensive.\n\nAlong with import tariffs on chips, the tough approach the Trump administration is taking with semiconductor makers is likely to lead to more uncertainty in the tech industry. This has already caused mayhem in the PC business, with costs increasing and customers rethinking purchases.\n\nRichard Gordon, Vice President and Practice Lead, Semiconductors, The Futurum Group, referred to AMD's Lisa Su's comments about the impact of tariffs, remarking that Su appeared to be \"waiting to see how things pan out in the coming weeks / months before coming to any major conclusions ... and I think that's the only sensible way to deal with Trump.\"\n\nGordon added: \"The threats about withholding CHIPS Act Funding are largely rhetorical and designed to keep up the pressure on the US semis companies IMO. I think the threats are unnecessary and won't make much difference because US companies are already rapidly re-shoring, as Lisa mentions...\n\n\"In terms of investment generally, it's always been my view that semis companies will invest regardless of government handouts because if they don't they won't be around for long. It's nice to have handouts and companies will gladly accept them (depending on the strings attached) but often they only serve to prop up weaker companies.\"\n\nIn addition to overseeing the CHIPS Act, the Investment Accelerator office will try to cut through bureaucracy to ensure that businesses can quickly deploy capital and create jobs, according to the White House.\n\n\"By streamlining processes, the Accelerator will attract both foreign and domestic investment, reinforcing America's position as the premier destination for large-scale investment,\" it claimed.\n\nAs well as scrapping some subsidies previously agreed, the Commerce Secretary may consider initiating a separate 25 percent tax credit from the CHIPS Act. \u00ae",

Please see additional application instruction information.\n\nPlease note: Harvard University recently provided a statement on financial stewardship that applies to the Berkman Klein Center\u2019s fellowship roles. Current uncertainties in funding and appointments may affect the size of the cohort, or the ability to host one at all, for the 2025-26 academic year. The call described below solicits concrete candidate interest, and we\u2019ll provide an update on next year\u2019s program as soon as we have more certainty.\n\nAbout the BKC Fellowships Program \u2022 2025-2026 Fellowship Workstreams \u2022 Our Collaborative Approach \u2022 Who Should Apply? \u2022 Support \u2022 Community Principles, Policies, and Resources \u2022 Notice of Nondiscrimination \u2022 Application\n\nAbout the BKC Fellowships Program\n\nOver the course of its 25+ year history, BKC has taken a unique approach to developing and delivering innovation in modes beyond the confines of a traditional university. This is due in large part to the unusual model the center has adopted and honed for fellowships. While traditional university programs emphasize and rely on academic credentials as a gate to fellowships, the BKC Fellowship program instead considers the whole person \u2013 their path, values, and contributions \u2013 in the spirit of the Internet itself.\n\nThis has led to an active alumni network of 500+ BKC fellows, with participants going on to advance their careers in academia or work in government, tech, social impact, and the arts. Early projects like Creative Commons and the Digital Public Libraries of America \u2013 as well as newly incubated initiatives such as the Integrity Institute and Data Nutrition Project \u2013 have demonstrated the crucible of bringing together new and non-esoteric ideas to make progress in the digital space.\n\n2025-2026 Fellowship Workstreams\n\nFor the new academic year, the Center is taking a new approach to its work and its fellowships. We are focusing our efforts on a number of discrete workstreams: bodies of work led by a faculty member that are tied to the critical issues and topics of the day. Workstreams take up problems within those areas that are of clear importance and even urgency, and that lack easy answers. These problems will be at a high enough level of generally not to be picayune, and a high enough level of specificity not to devolve into platitudes or balancing tests. (\u201cWe just need to balance security and privacy.\u201d) Making progress on such problems will require expertise from multiple disciplines and approaches, and implementation of mitigations and solutions will typically need different people and organizations with hands on different levers to pull them more or less at once.\n\nCandidates will apply for consideration to be embedded with one of six workstreams at the Center. Those who are selected for a fellowship will collaborate with a team of Harvard faculty, staff, students, and others on projects, tools, events, and publications related to their workstream topic:\n\nAI Interpretability Ethics and Implications\n\nAI Ethics with Allen Lab for Democracy Renovation (more information on the joint fellowship here )\n\n) Agentic AI Protocols and Risk Mitigations\n\nArtificial General Intelligence Futurecasting and Policy Development\n\nTech, Tools, and Practices for Improving University Discourse\n\nSafety Solutions for Social Media\n\nWhile your fellowship application should showcase the types of projects you're interested in pursuing within your chosen workstream, the final project slate will be determined collectively by your workstream cohort during a fall planning process. All projects will be executed through collaboration among the fellows, faculty, and staff.\n\nOur Collaborative Approach\n\nWe endeavor to assemble a cohort of mission-aligned fellows who will develop plans, events, and projects collaboratively for each workstream. As part of their application materials, prospective fellows should describe their interest in and ability to contribute to a specific workstream; they also may propose a project to be executed in collaboration with BKC faculty, staff, students, and other fellows. Although individual outputs (articles, studies, manuscripts) may be included in the proposal, they ought not to be the centerpiece.\n\nWe are most interested in supporting fellows with an interest in convening experts and stakeholders on key issues in novel ways and combinations, and producing a multitude of publicly accessible artifacts (policy recommendations, product prototypes, white papers, etc.) in collaboration with Center faculty and fellows.\n\nRepresentative examples from past cohorts include:\n\nA multi-day conference bringing together trust and safety workers to discuss the field\u2019s past, present, and future.\n\nA closed-door workshop for regulators, platform representatives, and content creators to produce federal policy and industry standard recommendations to advance the creator economy.\n\nEngaging with BKC participants and programming\n\nBeyond their work with their workstream colleagues, fellows are expected to engage with faculty, staff, students, and other members of the BKC and Harvard University communities. Fellows will be required to take part in a weekly community meeting; they also will be expected to regularly participate in the Center\u2019s programming to learn with and from others and strengthen their own work. This programming could include speaking at and/or participating in workshops, research sessions, and working groups, as well as collaborating with other members of the broader BKC community.\n\nTime and location commitments\n\nThe Fellows program will run for the full academic year, from September 1, 2025 to August 31, 2026. Fellows are expected to be free of the majority of their regular commitments so that they may fully devote themselves to their fellowship and Center workstream. We recognize that fellows who bring their own funding might have specific commitments due to their funding arrangements.\n\nFellows are required to be in residence in Cambridge, MA from September 2025 through May 2026. During the time spent in residence, they will work from the Berkman Klein Center\u2019s offices on the Harvard Law School campus.\n\nWho Should Apply?\n\nThe Berkman Klein Center seeks to be a space for both established and rising scholars and non-academics. Qualifications for these tracks are below, and we ask that candidates specify which track for which they are applying for in their application form.\n\nOur Academic Fellowship track welcomes applications from faculty\u2026\n\nfor whom serving as a professor is their full-time commitment, including assistant, associate, and full professors or equivalent roles in countries outside of the U.S.;\n\nfrom any discipline whose scholarship deeply engages with ideas related to either AI or social media and networked communication;\n\nwho have a clear vision of a potential project and a clear sense of the problem(s) their work is addressing;\n\nwho are eager to engage in a cohort setting and work in collaboration with other workstream participants to develop a shared plan, projects, and events to advance the topic as a group;\n\nwho are eager to engage in a cohort setting and work in collaboration with other workstream participants to develop a shared plan, projects, and events to advance the topic as a group; who have prior published work in this space and a demonstrated record of contributing to public and scholarly conversations.\n\nOur Post-Doctoral Fellowship track welcomes applications from scholars\u2026\n\nfrom any discipline whose scholarship deeply engages with ideas related to either AI or social media and networked communication;\n\nwho have a clear vision of a potential project and a clear sense of the problem(s) their work is addressing;\n\nwho are eager to engage in a cohort setting and work in collaboration with other workstream participants to develop a shared plan, projects, and events to advance the topic as a group; who have prior or upcoming published work in this space and a demonstrated record of contributing to public and scholarly conversations.\n\nNote: Post-doctoral fellows must have recently received a doctoral degree or other terminal degree, or will by the start of the appointment in September 2025.

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Specifically, we decided to study ASML Holding's ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ASML Holding is:\n\n41% = \u20ac7.6b \u00f7 \u20ac18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every \u20ac1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of \u20ac0.41.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for ASML Holding\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nASML Holding's Earnings Growth And 41% ROE\n\nFirst thing first, we like that ASML Holding has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 11% which is quite remarkable. This likely paved the way for the modest 19% net income growth seen by ASML Holding over the past five years.\n\nAs a next step, we compared ASML Holding's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 25% in the same period.\n\nENXTAM:ASML Past Earnings Growth March 31st 2025\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price.

            "content": "We came across a bullish thesis on ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) on Substack by Kontra Investments. In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on ASML. ASML Holding N.V. (ASML)\u2019s share was trading at $674.58 as of March 28th. ASML\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 32.64 and 25.91 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nASML, founded in 1984 as a spin-off from Philips, has cemented itself as the most crucial company in the semiconductor industry. Headquartered in the Netherlands, ASML employs over 44,000 people worldwide and plays an indispensable role in advancing Moore\u2019s Law. As the sole provider of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, ASML holds a near-monopoly on the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing technology, creating high customer dependency and an unmatched competitive moat. Despite near-term headwinds such as geopolitical tensions and regulatory risks, ASML\u2019s technological dominance and robust financial performance underscore a compelling long-term investment thesis. The launch of its High-NA EUV systems in 2025 will further solidify its leadership, enabling semiconductor manufacturers to push the boundaries of chip miniaturization and performance.\n\nASML\u2019s financials remain strong, with 2024 revenue reaching \u20ac28.26 billion, up from \u20ac27.56 billion in 2023, and projected to grow 9% to \u20ac30.84 billion in 2025. EBIT margins are at a healthy 32.1% and are expected to expand to 43.6% by 2029 due to increasing EUV equipment sales and a growing installed base. Net earnings for 2024 stood at \u20ac7.39 billion, slightly lower than 2023 due to temporary industry challenges, but long-term projections remain robust. Earnings per share are expected to nearly triple from \u20ac18.79 in 2024 to \u20ac46.59 by 2029, supported by ASML\u2019s strong pricing power, high switching costs, and continuous innovation.\n\nASML\u2019s dominance is driven by its technological superiority, particularly its EUV lithography systems, which are essential for manufacturing the most advanced semiconductor chips. The company commands 90% market share in lithography systems, with competitors unable to match its scale and expertise. High-NA EUV, set for deployment in 2025, will further widen ASML\u2019s lead, ensuring continued reliance from top chipmakers like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. Despite reports of China developing an alternative EUV technology, ASML remains far ahead due to superior power efficiency, established manufacturing processes, and deep integration with global semiconductor supply chains. The complexity of EUV technology, which requires specialized optics, mirrors, and supporting infrastructure, makes it unlikely that China will challenge ASML\u2019s dominance in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company\u2019s strong financials are supported by a resilient and high-margin business model. ASML\u2019s lithography equipment has significant switching costs, locking in customers for decades due to their reliance on ASML\u2019s technology. Once a fab adopts ASML\u2019s EUV systems, shifting to an alternative supplier would require billions in retooling and risk major disruptions in yield. This ensures long-term revenue stability through services, upgrades, and recurring maintenance. Notably, DUV systems generate 130% of their initial sale price in service revenue over their lifecycle, while EUV systems could exceed 150%, making ASML\u2019s installed base a reliable and growing cash flow generator.\n\nGeopolitical risks remain a concern, particularly regarding ASML\u2019s exposure to China, which accounted for 36% of 2024 revenue. Recent U.S. and Dutch export restrictions on advanced DUV systems pose potential headwinds, though ASML has navigated these challenges effectively. While further regulatory tightening could impact sales, ASML\u2019s backlog and global customer base provide a strong buffer. Additionally, the company\u2019s continued investments in R&D\u2014\u20ac4.3 billion in 2024\u2014ensure that it stays at the forefront of semiconductor innovation.\n\nESG factors further enhance ASML\u2019s attractiveness. The company has significantly reduced the energy consumption of its EUV systems, lowering operational costs for customers while addressing environmental concerns. Sustainability remains a priority, with continued efficiency improvements reinforcing ASML\u2019s long-term value proposition.\n\nASML presents an exceptional long-term investment opportunity driven by its technological moat, financial strength, and growing dominance in semiconductor manufacturing. Valuation-wise, ASML trades at a P/E of 32x for 2024 earnings, which may seem high but is justified by its projected earnings growth of over 10% annually and an exceptional return on invested capital (ROIC) expected to exceed 100% by 2027. Compared to peers in the Magnificent 7, ASML\u2019s valuation aligns with high-growth technology leaders like Nvidia and Amazon. Using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model with an 8.5% discount rate and a 20x EV/EBITDA multiple, ASML\u2019s fair value is estimated at approximately \u20ac770 per share, presenting an attractive upside from current levels. Additionally, the stock\u2019s P/E is expected to decline to 14x by 2029 as earnings accelerate, while the EV/EBITDA ratio is set to fall from 31x to 11x, making ASML an increasingly compelling long-term opportunity. With multiple tailwinds, including the rollout of High-NA EUV, ASML is well-positioned to deliver significant shareholder value in the coming years.\n\nASML Holding N.V.

            "content": "The market started to recover at the end of March, but it still has a way to go before returning to its highs. In particular, many tech stocks are even further off their highs than the broader market. I'm willing to bet that these stocks will start to recover in April and could even return to their all-time highs.\n\nThree stocks that I think will rebound strongly in April are Nvidia (NVDA -4.91%), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -5.76%), and ASML (ASML -3.59%). All are huge players in the AI arms race and show no signs of slowing down.\n\nThese three could see their stocks rebound as quarterly results trickle in\n\nAlthough we won't have financial results from these three until late April or May, Taiwan Semiconductor (also known as TSMC) gives investors monthly updates on its revenue. In January, revenue was up 36% year over year, and in February, it was up 43%.\n\nThat doesn't look like a company that's slowing down, and with TSMC's unique position within the industry, it acts as a great bellwether stock for the tech sector.\n\nIt's a chip fabricator that supplies companies without production capabilities (like Nvidia and Apple) with manufacturing capacity. So, if TSMC's sales continue to climb, it's a sure sign that companies like Nvidia are doing just fine.\n\nNvidia had strong sales throughout 2023 and 2024, and 2025 is also expected to be quite strong. While we won't know the most recent results until May (which is when it reports is fiscal 2026 first quarter), management projects 65% revenue growth in the period, which is impressive considering the base it's starting from.\n\nIn addition, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is projecting that companies will spend $1 trillion to build out data centers by 2028. That is a huge tailwind for Nvidia stock.\n\nAs results start to trickle in from Nvidia's largest clients, the artificial intelligence (AI) hyperscalers, it will be evident that their massive capital expenditure plans for 2025 are still intact. This should ease fears of the business coming up against difficult headwinds and push the stock higher throughout the month.\n\nASML is in a unique position in the chip industry. It makes extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which lay tiny electrical traces on microscopic chips. It's the only company in the world with this technology, giving it a monopoly.\n\nWith TSMC announcing a $100 billion expansion into the U.S., it will need to purchase machines from ASML. As chip demand grows from the AI race, more ASML machines will be needed, which will become a strong tailwind.\n\nAll three of these companies are much cheaper now than they have been in some time, which is why I think each is a great buy now, even after they have started to rise a bit from their lows. From a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) perspective, each is cheaper than it has been in around a year, which indicates that investors shouldn't be worried about overpaying for them.\n\nThis suggests that all three are solid buys for April, and their long-term outlooks are even better.\n\nThe future looks bright for this trio\n\nAs long-term investors, we're looking for short-term deals that allow us to buy the best companies at a discount. All three of these stocks are clearly trading at a discount, but each company's management team has also given fantastic guidance.\n\nFor a revenue outlook, ASML's management believes it can attain between 44 billion euros ($47.4 billion) and 60 billion euros ($64.7 billion) in sales by 2030. Considering that it generated around 28 billion euros ($30.2 billion) over the past 12 months, that's huge growth over the next five years.\n\nAs impressive as that is, TSMC's and Nvidia's revenue is expected to rise even faster. Taiwan Semiconductor's management believes it can grow its revenue at a 20% compound annual rate over the next five years, putting its total revenue at $224 billion. Nvidia's forecast is even more bullish when you consider Huang's projection of data center revenue.\n\nThose are fantastic long-term predictions, and if each one of these companies hits those goals, they will not only beat the market, they will crush it. Investors should also keep these long-term projections in mind as fears of tariffs swirl around the market, since we're focused on the long run, not what will happen in April to affect these stocks.\n\nWith each stock still on sale from its recent highs, I think April is an excellent time to take a position, with the mindset of holding on to them for multiple years.",

            "content": "ASML expansion in the Brainport Eindhoven region under the Beethoven plan is facing critical challenges, reports De Telegraaf. Grid congestion and the nitrogen crisis put the chip machine maker's growth in the Netherlands at stake. Given the dependence on local suppliers\u2013which contributed to its success\u2014ASML's expansion abroad would be costly.\n\nUnveiled last year, the Beethoven plan is a \u20ac2.5 billion plan financed by the Dutch government and the regional ones to support the semiconductor industry. This money was allocated to invest in talent and housing projects to support ASML\u2019s growth. The company got the green light to expand and add 20,000 new jobs by 2030.\n\nGrid congestion and nitrogen crisis\n\nThe primary hurdle for ASML's expansion is the capacity of the local electricity grid. As part of the Beethoven plan, substantial infrastructure improvements are required, including constructing 116 new medium-voltage substations and upgrading numerous transformers. This demand outpaces the current capabilities, presenting a significant bottleneck. Local municipalities and grid operator Enexis are under pressure to resolve these issues swiftly to support the anticipated boost in semiconductor production.\n\nIn an effort to accommodate economic growth, the Beethoven plan targets the construction of over 60,000 homes by 2030. ASML is contributing by establishing the Beethoven Housing Fund to facilitate social housing developments. However, municipalities face significant challenges, including escalating construction costs, a shortage of skilled labor, and permit approval delays, all exacerbated by the nitrogen crisis.\n\nNitrogen crisis puts a third of Dutch housing projects at stake The nitrogen crisis in the Netherlands threatens over a third of planned housing projects, impacting \u20ac138 billion in investments Read More\n\nTalent supply strain\n\nAnother pillar of the Beethoven initiative focuses on education, particularly increasing the number of semiconductor students. Eindhoven University of Technology aims to double its semiconductor student body by 2030. Yet, the influx of international students is threatened by policy changes, which may dampen ASML's ability to attract necessary talent, jeopardizing its domestic growth plans.\n\nThe pressure to sustain ASML's growth has brought discussions on possible relocation if challenges remain unaddressed. ASML's CEO Christophe Fouquet has expressed concerns over talent availability, emphasizing that ASML might expand beyond the Netherlands if conditions do not improve. This strategic consideration poses a risk to the Dutch economy, reflecting the critical nature of resolving these issues. ASML is asking for clarity before taking its decisions by the end of the year.\n\nFouquet warns: 'EU needs to protect its champions better' Christophe Fouquet warns that Europe could lose its leading companies if better protection is not provided.

It manufactures extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, and it's the only company on the planet with the technology to do so. As a result, it holds a technological monopoly in this space.\n\nIt's important to note that monopolies aren't necessarily illegal, only if they squash competition with anti-competitive practices. ASML hasn't been accused of these practices yet and is so important to technological breakthroughs that it's unlikely it will ever be considered for a breakup.\n\nThese kinds of companies are quite rare in the stock market, and I want to own them whenever I can, which is one of the reasons why I'm bullish on ASML's stock.\n\nASML's machines are highly specialized\n\nASML's EUV machines lay the tiny electrical traces on the world's smallest chips. With the distance between traces as little as 3 nanometers today (a human hair is usually between 80,000 and 100,000 nanometers thick), it's clear you need specialized equipment to do this work. Furthermore, these chips continue to push the limits of what's possible, as 2-nanometer and 1.6-nanometer chips are slated to be released in 2025 and 2026.\n\nAs you can imagine, the equipment required to do this work is incredibly complex and expensive. ASML only sells a handful of machines every quarter, which can make its results quite lumpy.\n\nThis makes it critical for investors to focus on the long term with ASML, although many investors have failed to do that.\n\nASML got crushed last year when it decreased its revenue guidance for 2025 due to export restrictions harming China sales. However, ASML did not touch its 2030 revenue guidance, so the long-term outlook for the business hasn't changed.\n\nDespite this, ASML's stock is down around 35% from its all-time high established last July.\n\nSince then, several of ASML's key clients (such as Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing) have announced large expansions, which will boost ASML's sales.\n\nWith the market getting distracted by short-term events and losing sight of long-term guidance, now is an excellent time to scoop up shares, as ASML is expected to grow solidly over the next six years.\n\nASML's stock is primed to do well over the next few years\n\nA bet on ASML is a bet that more chips and more advanced chips will be used in the future, which seems like a very safe bet to me. By 2030, ASML expects to generate between 44 billion and 60 billion euros in revenue. In 2024, ASML generated 28.3 billion euros in revenue, so this guidance indicates a compound annual growth rate for revenue between 7.6% and 13.3%. If revenue comes in on the lower end of that range, it could be a disappointing investment, but that seems unlikely considering the path that the chip industry is heading down.\n\nFurthermore, ASML has about a 1% dividend yield, so investors will also benefit from that.\n\nASML also trades near its cheapest levels in three years from a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) perspective.\n\nWith the combination of this cheap stock price, a decent dividend, and growth that's projected to be in the double-digits (if it comes in the middle to high end of guidance), ASML seems like a no-brainer buy.\n\nAdditionally, there is nearly zero risk of its disruption, as its technology represents decades of research and billions of dollars invested to reach its current state.\n\nWithout ASML, the chips that power incredible AI models, smartphones, and self-driving cars wouldn't be possible. As a result, it's one of the world's most important companies, making it a great stock to buy now and stash away.",

These results would represent year-over-year changes of +21.85% and +12.41%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for ASML. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.79% upward. As of now, ASML holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at its valuation, ASML is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 26.59. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 23.4.\n\nMeanwhile, ASML's PEG ratio is currently 1.47. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.15 as of yesterday's close.",

            "content": "The ambitious plans to grow ASML and the Dutch chip industry are being hampered by slow decision-making, gridlock and European nitrogen regulations. The multi-billion package dubbed \u2018Project Beethoven\u2019 is running into fundamental obstacles, while the international competition is heating up.\n\nThe Eindhoven region, known as the nearest Dutch equivalent to Silicon Valley, is facing a crucial challenge. The 2.5 billion euro rescue plan drawn up in 2024 to anchor ASML and the entire chip sector in the Netherlands threatens to get bogged down in a morass of procedures and practical limitations. The alarm bell is being sounded by various stakeholders, including Mayor Jeroen Dijsselbloem to the Dutch publication De Telegraaf.\n\nNitrogen as a showstopper\n\n\u201cWe cannot wait until this cabinet falls or until a solution is found in a few years,\u201d says Dijsselbloem about the nitrogen problem, affecting European nations across the board and hitting Dutch building projects hard. He opposes the ongoing \u201cdenial or dismissal\u201d of the issues.\n\nGiovanni Wouters, secretary-director of the Eindhoven Metropolitan Region, confirms that nitrogen could become an \u201cabsolute showstopper\u201d. He concludes: \u201cUltimately, it is up to the government to fundamentally address this problem.\u201d If not, all plans will come to a standstill, he says.\n\nThe problem has symptoms that strongly resemble the ongoing struggles in other sectors. For example, the nitrogen issue has already halted Dutch building projects across the board. Now, it threatens to paralyze the entire ASML growth strategy, forcing the company to devise alternative solutions, which are located outside the Netherlands.\n\nPower grid cannot handle demand\n\nAnother familiar problem is grid congestion. ASML and other companies are running up against an overloaded power grid when it comes to expansion plans. In June 2024, the Eindhoven city council gave the green light for the development of the Brainport Industries Campus (BIC) near Eindhoven Airport, which should provide space for some 20,000 additional jobs. But the necessary electricity infrastructure is lacking.\n\nAs Wouters tells De Telegraaf, this results in an enormous task. In six years, 116 new medium-voltage stations would be needed, and they would have to be built without disturbing local residents.\n\nThe Eindhoven city council had already expressed concerns about ASML\u2019s expansion plans. Some council members found it problematic that they had to say \u2018yes\u2019 first, while the consequences for the municipality\u2019s quality of life were unclear.\n\nHousing shortage hinders growth\n\nThe housing shortage, another local issue, also plays a role here. Wouters mentions that 60,000 homes are needed before 2030, 17,000 of which are directly from Project Beethoven. The current trend shows that only half of the intended number of homes will be realized.\n\nASML is also trying to contribute. The company has previously invested in the construction of affordable housing in the region, on a non-profit basis and not intended for its own staff. This approach helps project developers to realize affordable housing, which should ease the pressure on the regional housing market.\n\nASML dependence\n\nASML is still nervous about the situation, although CEO Christophe Fouquet is less outspoken in the media than his predecessor Peter Wennink. There seems to be no question of a complete departure from the Netherlands, but growth opportunities could be exploited elsewhere.\n\nASML is also losing potential employees to parties such as the Taiwanese chip giant TSMC. This is partly due to a decline in the number of international students. The Netherlands, therefore, has to compete with countries such as the US, Germany and South Korea, says Robert-Jan Smits, chairman of the board of Eindhoven University of Technology.\n\nAs an international monopolist in a critical industry, it is difficult to express the value of ASML to the Netherlands in exact figures. Without the chip machine manufacturer, companies like TSMC, Samsung and Intel Foundry cannot compete for the most advanced processors in the world. With the introduction of High-NA EUV lithography, the technology behind the most precise chip manufacturing currently possible, a new arms race has emerged. If ASML were to lose its Dutch character, the Netherlands would lose its most valuable company, financial or otherwise.\n\nAlso read: ASML: from a leaky shed to the chip industry\u2019s key player",

            "content": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nCredit: ZNTC\n\nZelenograd Nanotechnology Center (ZNTC) and Planar have concluded developing Russia's first lithography system capable of supporting 350nm-class process technologies (0.35 micron). The development was assisted by Belarus-based Planar company. The machine has cleared official inspections and is undergoing integration trials in Zelenograd. Despite its symbolic significance, the system's design has been outdated by several decades, and whether ZNTC can produce these in volume is unclear.\n\nA new tool\n\nThe ZNTC lithography tool \u2014 which was officially introduced a year ago \u2014 is a 200-mm litho machine based on a solid-state laser with an exposure field size of 22mm \u00d7 22mm (484 mm^2). ZNTC and Planar do not disclose critical technical details about the tool, including the wavelength of the laser it uses or the power that the laser can emit. However, it says it uses an energy-efficient 'solid-state' laser with a 'tighter' emission range and longer operational life.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe use of a solid-state light source seems to be an important detail that not only differentiates the tool from those designed by leading fab tool makers but could also give a hint about the company's plans going forward.\n\nConsidering that ZNTC makes rather vague announcements (perhaps to keep its progress and the progress of its partners under wraps), it makes sense to examine the so-called best-known production tools from ASML to put ZNTC's achievements into context.\n\nASML's lithography tools designed for 200-mm wafers used for process technologies ranging from 350nm down to 130nm traditionally utilized one of two main types of ultraviolet (UV) illumination sources, depending on the exact lithography model and process node requirements: mercury arc lamps, KrF (krypton fluoride), or ArF (argon fluoride) laser.\n\nFor process technologies of 350nm and less advanced, ASML's i-line steppers used mercury arc lamps with a wavelength of 365nm(405nm and 436nm were less common). For nodes of 250nm and more advanced, ASML used a KrF (krypton fluoride) laser with a 248nm wavelength. Starting from 130nm nodes, ASML's deep ultraviolet lithography systems have used ArF (argon fluoride) lasers with a 193nm wavelength.\n\nA solid-state light source?\n\nAn avid reader would ask, \"What is a solid-state laser in semiconductor production?\" Solid-state lasers are widely used in semiconductor manufacturing, yet not for the primary lithographic exposure at advanced nodes. Instead, they are used in supporting roles, such as wafer inspection, defect analysis, marking, and micromachining processes, including wafer dicing or trimming components.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSolid-state lasers operating at around a 365nm wavelength (frequency-tripled Nd:YAG lasers) can also be employed for lithography at mature nodes (e.g., \u2265250nm), as they are stable, efficient, and reliable. However, as noted above, ASML has used gas-based excimer lasers (KrF at 248nm, ArF at 193nm) or mercury lamps (365nm i-line) since the late 1990s.\n\nThis gets interesting as ZNTC said it is working on a lithography system capable of a 130nm-class process technology, though its development is expected to be finalized sometime in 2026.\n\nToo late?\n\nWhile a 350nm-class process technology is used for some devices, it is obsolete by today's standards. In the mid-1990s, Intel used this node for its Pentium MMX, Pentium Pro, and early Pentium II CPUs, while AMD produced its K6 processor using the same technology around 1997. Nowadays, advanced chips are made at 5nm-class process technologies or better.\n\nEven Russian chipmakers like Angstrem and Mikron do not manufacture at 350 nm. Both companies operate at resolutions between 250 nm and 90 nm. As such, the new scanner does not match the existing production nodes of major Russian foundries, limiting its immediate commercial relevance to non-critical layers at domestic producers, which will continue to use ASML's PAS 5500-series lithography tools, which are smuggled into Russia.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nStill, ZNTC's tool may find limited use in specific sectors. Some automotive and power management ICs are produced using mature processes. Military applications could also benefit from this kind of tool, as cutting-edge performance is not always a requirement for them.\n\nStill, it appears that the new machine's primary aim is to serve as a base for developing more capable versions. ZNTC is currently working on a new model targeting 130nm-class process technologies. Completion is expected in 2026. This version is part of a longer-term roadmap set by the Russian government, which aims for domestic production at 90nm by the end of 2025, 28nm by 2027, and 14nm by 2030. ZNTC and its peers in Russia are well behind the plan.",

            "content": "In the ever-evolving world of global technology, semiconductors are the silent powerhouses driving both economic and military dominance. As countries compete for control over this critical sector, China is taking bold steps to challenge Europe\u2019s leadership, particularly in the field of lithography equipment. With a massive $41 billion investment, China is accelerating its pursuit of technological self-sufficiency and aiming to lessen its reliance on foreign expertise.\n\nThe Rivalry Between SMIC and ASML\n\nAt the heart of this technological rivalry are two industry giants: SMIC (Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation) from China, and ASML, a Dutch company that holds a virtual monopoly on the photolithography equipment crucial for producing advanced semiconductors. Photolithography is the process that etches intricate circuits onto silicon wafers, a pivotal step in chip manufacturing.\n\nPin\n\nASML\u2019s Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines are essential for creating the next generation of chips with features as small as 3 nanometers\u2014critical for advancements in computing and artificial intelligence. Dr. Li Wei, a semiconductor analyst at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), highlights the gap: \u201cASML\u2019s technology is currently unparalleled, giving them a significant edge in the global semiconductor supply chain. For China, achieving parity in lithography is not just an economic goal\u2014it\u2019s a strategic necessity.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s Strategic Investment in Lithography Technology\n\nIn response to the United States\u2019 efforts to curb China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductor technology, Beijing has unveiled an ambitious plan to enhance its own lithography capabilities. This $41 billion investment is focused on developing domestic lithography machines to reduce dependence on ASML and other foreign suppliers.\n\nPin\n\nChinese companies like Hua Hong Semiconductor, Honghu Suzhou Semiconductor Technology, and Naura Technology Group are leading the charge in research and development, working tirelessly to create competitive lithography systems. This financial commitment underscores China\u2018s broader ambition to become a dominant force in the global semiconductor industry. Professor Zhang Ming from the Chinese Academy of Sciences notes, \u201cThis investment is a clear indication of China\u2019s determination to close the technological gap and emerge as a self-reliant superpower in semiconductor manufacturing.\u201d\n\nThe Huawei Incident\n\nA pivotal moment in this ongoing semiconductor struggle came with the launch of the Huawei Mate 60 Pro. This smartphone, powered by a 5G processor designed and manufactured entirely in China, defied US sanctions and underscored China\u2019s progress in semiconductor development. The success of the Mate 60 Pro was a statement to the global tech community, proving that China can innovate independently and compete on the world stage.\n\nEmily Chen, a technology correspondent for TechCrunch, remarked, \u201cHuawei\u2019s achievement with the Mate 60 Pro sends a strong message to the global tech community. It demonstrates that with the right investment and focus, China can produce high-quality, competitive technology\u2014even under significant external pressures.\u201d\n\nASML\u2019s Technological Advances\n\nWhile China ramps up its efforts, ASML isn\u2019t standing still. The company has recently announced the development of High-NA EUV systems\u2014an advanced iteration of its existing EUV machines. These new systems promise even greater precision, allowing for the production of chips with feature sizes below 2 nanometers. Despite the hefty price tag of about $300 million per machine, ASML\u2019s High-NA EUV systems are expected to play a crucial role in the next generation of semiconductor manufacturing, ensuring that ASML remains a dominant player in the market.\n\nJames Thompson, a semiconductor expert at Gartner Inc., explains, \u201cASML\u2019s advancements in EUV technology solidify their position as a crucial player in the semiconductor industry. Their ability to innovate continuously keeps them ahead of competitors and reinforces the global market\u2019s dependence on their equipment.\u201d\n\nThe Geopolitical Stakes\n\nThe competition over semiconductor technology extends far beyond economics\u2014there are geopolitical ramifications at play. Mastery over semiconductor production means greater control over global supply chains, enhanced national security, and the power to drive innovation in both civilian and military technologies. By investing heavily in lithography equipment, China is positioning itself to secure a prominent role in this critical sector and reduce its vulnerability to foreign sanctions and technology blockades.\n\nDr. Maria Gonzalez, a geopolitical analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), observes, \u201cControl over semiconductor technology translates to significant geopolitical leverage. China\u2019s push to develop domestic lithography capabilities is a clear move to assert its independence and influence on the global stage.\u201d\n\nConclusion\n\nChina\u2019s $41 billion investment in domestic lithography equipment marks a crucial moment in the ongoing battle for semiconductor supremacy. While ASML remains the undisputed leader in photolithography technology, China\u2019s drive to develop its own competitive systems highlights the intensity of the competition and the high stakes involved in this sector. As global powers continue to invest heavily in innovation, the outcome of this race will have far-reaching consequences for the future of technology, economics, and international relations.",

            "content": "After many artificial intelligence (AI) companies recently led the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC -4.83%) into correction territory, it's time to start thinking about what will happen next. Many are worried that an economic slowdown triggered by unknowns around tariffs could slow AI investments and hurt many of these companies. However, there haven't been any signs of this occurring yet, and this correction looks like a great time to scoop up some of the best AI stocks out there.\n\nI've got three companies that I think can emerge stronger than ever, and investors need to pay attention to them, as they likely won't stay beaten down for long.\n\nNvidia is riding a boom\n\nAlthough AI hyperscalers have built a ton of computing capacity, they are far from finished. A massive amount of money is being spent on AI infrastructure, and those numbers are expected to reach record levels this year.\n\nThis clearly benefits the companies that are on the hardware side of AI, meaning companies including Nvidia (NVDA -4.91%), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM -5.76%), and ASML (ASML -3.44%) are primed to emerge from this correction even stronger.\n\nNvidia has been powering the AI arms race since it kicked off, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) being the computing muscle behind AI models. GPUs can process multiple calculations in parallel, unlike a CPU, which can do one at a time. This effect can be multiplied by connecting thousands of GPUs in clusters. By doing this, AI hyperscalers can quickly train AI models.\n\nWith each generation of AI modes becoming more complex, this requires more computing capacity, and Nvidia benefits.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang sees massive growth in data center computing. He has predicted data center buildout of $1 trillion.\n\nWhile that may be a bold projection, with the way AI spending is going, a figure like that wouldn't surprise me. And I think Huang better understands where the industry is heading than most people do, so this prediction could be more accurate than most think.\n\nRegardless, Nvidia's business will be just fine over the next few years, and the most recent stock market dip looks like a great reason to scoop up shares, especially because they're trading for 26 times forward earnings.\n\nConsidering Nvidia's potential growth, this seems like a no-brainer price to pay for the stock, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it soar throughout the rest of 2025.\n\nMore chips are needed to fulfill demand\n\nMore GPUs mean more chips, and with Nvidia not having the manufacturing capabilities to produce chips itself, it farms out that work to Taiwan Semiconductor. With President Donald Trump ramping up tariffs on goods imported to the U.S., TSMC in early March announced an additional $100 billion investment in U.S. production capabilities.\n\nWhile critics say that Trump's pressure caused this, Taiwan's president and Taiwan Semiconductor's CEO said that the reason for the U.S. expansion was the massive demand for U.S.-produced chips, which have sold out production capacity through 2027.\n\nThere is a huge demand for more chips, and Taiwan Semiconductor's management sees significant growth ahead. They expect AI-related chip revenue to increase at a 45% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years, with companywide revenue increasing at around a 20% CAGR. That's monster growth and makes for a fantastic stock to buy right now.\n\nASML has a key role\n\nWhen you hear about chip companies standing up new facilities, you should think of ASML, which makes extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which are critical in the manufacturing process of high-end chips. ASML is the only company in the world with the technology to do this, so it's a company that everyone must work with when they're expanding production capacity.\n\nBy holding a technological monopoly, ASML is a great way to play the expansion of chip demand. With its stock off around 35% from its all-time high, right now makes for an excellent time to scoop up shares, as much better times are ahead for ASML.\n\nAlthough the sell-off hasn't been fun, it has opened up several fantastic investment opportunities in the market's best AI stocks. Now's a great time to pick up winning companies on sale.",

            "content": "Three members of the Intel board will not be standing for re-election at the annual shareholders\u2019 meeting in 2025, the chip manufacturer announced in an official statement on Thursday.\n\nSince the end of last year, Intel has been reorganizing its board of directors to attract more expertise from the chip industry. Under new leadership, the company is attempting to regain its former position in the market.\n\nWith this change, Intel is reducing the board of directors to eleven members. Among the departing board members is Omar Ishrak, former CEO of Medtronic. Ishrak stepped down as chairman of the board in January 2023, but remained on as a regular member. Tsu-Jae King Liu, dean of the College of Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, and Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, former professor of public health and health inequality at the University of Pennsylvania, are also leaving the board.\n\nIntel appointed Eric Meurice, former CEO of ASML, and Steve Sanghi, interim CEO of Microchip Technology, in December to strengthen the board. These appointments followed the departure of former CEO Pat Gelsinger.\n\nThis has significantly changed the composition of the board. Whereas the board previously consisted of people with backgrounds in academic institutions, finance, medical technology and aviation, Intel is now more emphatically opting for expertise within the semiconductor industry. According to chairman Frank Yeary, Intel wants to put together a board that has the right combination of skills, qualifications and technical knowledge.\n\nFocus on foundry activities continues\n\nIn a letter to shareholders on Thursday, the new Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said that he believes it is important to focus not only on Intel\u2019s product development but also on the division for contractual chip production (the foundry activities). This last component is an essential element of the recovery plan previously introduced under former CEO Gelsinger.\n\nIntel also announced that Gelsinger received a severance package totaling approximately 7.9 million dollars upon his departure and relinquished all of his non-vested stock options.\n\nTan left the board in August of last year due to differences of opinion about the company\u2019s recovery plan but returned as a director when he was appointed CEO. In his explanation, he indicated that he would continue to focus on implementing the cost-cutting plan previously set up by Gelsinger. This plan includes simplifying the product range, reducing the complexity of the organization, reducing operational expenses and investments, and reducing the workforce by 15 percent.",

            "content": "ASML (ASML) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this equipment supplier to semiconductor makers have returned -5.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry, which ASML falls in, has lost 5.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nASML is expected to post earnings of $6.12 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +81.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.6%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $25.37 points to a change of +21.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.8%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $29.55 indicates a change of +16.5% from what ASML is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ASML is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of ASML, the consensus sales estimate of $8.08 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +40.7%. The $34.34 billion and $37.97 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +12.4% and +10.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nASML reported revenues of $9.88 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +26.8%. EPS of $7.30 for the same period compares with $5.60 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.76 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.2%. The EPS surprise was +1.67%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nASML is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ASML. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nOnly $1 to See All Zacks' Buys and Sells\n\nWe're not kidding.\n\nSeveral years ago, we shocked our members by offering them 30-day access to all our picks for the total sum of only $1.

Firms like Huawei, SMIC, and many others have played their part in ensuring that China builds its chip production lines, and to some extent, they have been successful in doing so. One name that isn't mentioned enough is SiCarrier, which is said to be a Huawei-backed firm that specializes in building chipmaking tools. At SEMICON 2025 in China, the firm unveiled its next lineup of equipment, showing the intention that they won't be held back.\n\nMassive release from SiCarrier/Huawei\n\nThey went ALL IN pic.twitter.com/SgaPcvwjUU \u2014 Zephyr (@zephyr_z9) March 26, 2025\n\nIn the company's latest catalog, published at SEMICON and revealed by @zephyr_z9, SiCarrier is said to have developed numerous chip tools, including RTP (Rapid Thermal Processing) systems used in semiconductor fabrications for IC devices. The catalog features numerous other tools, but none of them are for lithography since that might be something SiCarrier wants to keep undercover. This lineup of chipmaking products is an attempt to compete against the likes of ASML, Applied, LAM, and many others, although we are still unaware of how effective these tools are for the domestic market.\n\nImage Credits: SCMP\n\nAt SEMICON, SiCarrier's President Du Lijun claimed that domestic chipmaking tools have the ability to produce 5nm chips, but employing non-optical technology means that the firm will face yield rate challenges, making the output much more expensive compared to global alternatives. However, SiCarrier is working with SMIC and Huawei to figure out a solution, and given how big it is for China to achieve chip production independence, we expect a breakthrough soon.\n\nThere might be a path where we can use non-optical technologies, that is, using our process equipment to solve some of the lithography issues. - Du Lijun via Reuters\n\nThe primary aim of SiCarrier is to tilt the semiconductor balance away from nations like the Netherlands, which is a primary source of chipmaking tools. In a previous report, we disclosed how the firm is working with Huawei and the Shenzhen government to develop custom EUV prototypes focused on laser-induced discharge plasma (LDP), which will be the first step towards China developing its very own EUV lithography equipment, which might be the only barrier from the nation creating its cutting-edge nodes.",

            "content": "A microchip is an electronic lasagne: a base of transistors topped with layers of copper wiring shuttling data and power. A leading-edge processor can pack over 100 billion transistors, contain more than 70 layers and have more than 100 kilometres of wiring, all on a piece of silicon around 1\u00bd times the size of a standard postage stamp. To build these tiny features, a lithography machine works in stages by etching patterns of transistors and metal wires on a wafer, layer by layer. A single wafer can contain hundreds of chips.\n\nASML\u2019s tool is complex, yet its basic principle is much like that of an old slide projector: light passes through a stencil to project an image onto a surface. The smallest feature an optical lithography tool can print depends mainly on two factors. The first is the wavelength of light. Just as a finer paintbrush allows for more detailed strokes, shorter wavelengths enable smaller patterns. ASML\u2019s older systems used deep ultraviolet (DUV) light, with wavelengths between 248nm and 193nm, producing features as small as 38nm.\n\nTo shrink chip features even more, ASML turned to EUV light, with a wavelength of 13.5nm. Whereas EUV is naturally emitted in space by the solar corona, producing it on Earth is far trickier. EUV light is also completely absorbed by air, glass and most materials, so the process must be enclosed in a vacuum, using special mirrors to reflect and guide the light. ASML spent two decades perfecting the method that fires lasers at molten-tin droplets to create and generate this elusive beam.\n\nThe other dial that sets the smallest feature size is the numerical aperture (NA) of the mirrors, a measure of how much light they can collect and focus. ASML\u2019s latest systems, called high-NA EUV, use mirrors with an aperture of 0.55, allowing it to print features on chips as small as 8nm. To go smaller still, the firm is studying what it calls hyper-NA by cranking the aperture up to more than 0.75 while still using existing EUV light. A higher NA means that the mirrors collect and focus light coming in from a broader range of angles, improving precision. This comes at a cost. Larger NAs require bigger mirrors to intercept and direct the expanded light paths. When ASML increased the NA of their machines from 0.33 to 0.55, the mirrors doubled in size and became 10 times heavier, now weighing several hundred kilograms. Increasing the NA again will only add bulk, raising concerns about power consumption.\n\nAnother obstacle is pricing. ASML does not disclose precise figures, but its latest EUV machine was almost twice as expensive as its predecessor. A hyper-NA system would be dearer still. Though the company cautions that there are no guarantees of it ever being produced, Jos Benschop, ASML\u2019s head of technology, believes a hyper-NA machine could arrive within the next five to 10 years, pending demand.",

            "content": "Chinese chipmakers have been gradually shifting some of their production to tools made in China in a bid to support the local wafer fab equipment ecosystem and reduce reliance on tools produced abroad. China already has several well-known manufacturers of chipmaking tools that specialize in one or two types of equipment, which set sales records in 2024. However, there is a little-known Huawei-linked company, Si Carrier Technologies, that has revealed it has almost all types of wafer processing tools in its catalog published at Semicon China and re-published by Zhininren.\n\nSiCarrier Technologies is a startup widely discussed at this year\u2019s Semicon China, but is little known outside of the People\u2019s Republic. The company is closely linked to Huawei and was founded four years ago in Shenzhen to develop world-class fab tools that would compete against front-end chip production equipment made by market leaders ASML, Applied Materials, KLA, and Lam Research, according to Nikkei. SiCarrier's main investor is Shenzhen Major Investment Group, a government-backed fund supporting other chip ventures connected to Huawei, including PengXinWei Integrated Circuit Manufacturing and SwaySure Technology.\n\nSiCarrier currently operates R&D centers in Shanghai, Beijing, Xi\u2019an, Wuhan, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and overseas. Its end-to-end development chain covers materials, components, and full systems. To support rapid development, the company aggressively recruits senior engineers from top global companies like ASML and Applied Materials.\n\nThe SiCarrier catalog presented at Semicon China includes a wide range of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, metrology tools, and inspection systems. The catalog does not include any lithography tools (possibly to keep its lithography advancements a secret), but Nikkei reports that the company already has litho tools capable of processing 300-mm wafers on 28nm process technologies and older. Even without lithography machines, the company lists dozens of tools that can perform the vast majority of steps in the front-end semiconductor production flow. The company also has metrology, inspection, and testing tools.\n\nOn the process side, the catalog includes tools used for atomic layer deposition (ALD) for dielectrics and metal gates, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD) blanket film deposition and metal contact deposition, epitaxy, etching, and annealing. The catalog does not explicitly characterize tools and their capabilities in terms of actual fabrication processes, but it does frequently refer to \u2018advanced process nodes\u2019 as well as \u2018future advanced nodes.\u2019\n\nOn the metrology and inspection front, the catalog includes tools for the optical inspection of both patterned and unpatterned wafers, atomic force microscopy for morphology inspection at nanoscale resolution, and advanced measurement systems for thin film thickness, element composition, and crystallinity.\n\nFinally, SiCarrier also has various testing machines, including wafer electrical performance tests, known-good die tests, and functional tests. However, these tools are currently aimed mostly at power semiconductors.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

It is also unclear whether these machines are compatible with existing production flows that rely on machines from ASML, Applied, KLA, Lam, TEL, and others.\n\nHowever, Nikkei claims that SiCarrier has partnered closely with Huawei, which has assembled a large internal team focused on semiconductor manufacturing and equipment, and that they are working to improve process implementation and identify technical challenges across production lines. This could mean that SiCarrier and Huawei intend to build tools for a \u2018proprietary\u2019 production flow involving exclusively Chinese tools. If this is the case, it could take years before the first fab with such a flow comes online. Nonetheless, given SiCarrier\u2019s pace so far, it could well impress the industry.",

While 9 EU countries, including the Netherlands, in the Semicon Coalition, ASML shares have recently fallen by almost 3%. The problem is competitive pressure and a wave of global initiatives such as American and Chinese chip funds. The Semicon Coalition, whose members include Belgium, Germany, and France, is focused on innovation and faster market introduction. However, with so much dependence on ASML in Europe, the outcome of these efforts will be significant for the continent's technological autonomy.\n\nThe critical role of ASML in Europe's semiconductor industry\n\nASML plays a crucial role in the European semiconductor industry thanks to its unique position as the only equipment producer capable of reliably etching the most advanced semiconductors. This makes them indispensable for producing a wide range of technologies, from AI accelerators to chips in smartphones and household appliances. Despite this monopoly position, there is growing concern about protecting this crucial industry within Europe. Christophe Fouquet has expressed his concerns about the possibility that critical European companies could be tempted to move to more favorable economic climate zones if they are not sufficiently protected. This could have dramatic consequences for Europe's technological autonomy and economic prosperity.\n\nEuropean chip sector unites in Semicon Coalition Nine European countries, including the Netherlands, want to strengthen the chip industry and support European assets. Read More\n\nCooperation within Europe for autonomy and resilience\n\nTen European countries have joined Semicon Coalition forces to anticipate the industry's imminent shifts. This cooperation aims to increase innovation capacity and improve the production and market introduction speed of semiconductors. The coalition comprises the Netherlands, Germany, and France, among others, and is committed to intensifying economic and strategic cooperation. This initiative is a sign of a shift towards more European independence in the sector, aimed at less dependence on external powers and strengthening the European technological infrastructure.\n\nEuropean Proactive Legislative Initiatives\n\nIn addition to joining forces in the Semicon Coalition, several European countries are working on a new chips law, the successor to the existing Chips Act. This law is designed to support semiconductor technologies. The new bill will focus specifically on allocating funds for developing chip design, materials, and equipment, considering the needs of major European players such as ASML. The bill will be presented before the summer of 2025, as part of a broader plan to face global competition and protect technologies crucial to the European economy.\n\nNetherlands introduces brand new center to boost innovation in semiconductors The ChipNL Competence Centre should position the Netherlands as a hub for innovation in semiconductors. Read More\n\nASML's shares\n\nDespite the prospects for European cooperation and legislation, ASML's shares have recently nearly 3% its semiconductor industry. Since ASML's products provide 90% of the global market demand for advanced semiconductor equipment, this decline demonstrates the importance of concrete steps to strengthen this essential industrial sector.\n\nInfluence of international competition\n\nInternational competition in semiconductor development is escalating, with countries like the United States and China deploying considerable funds to promote their industries. The American Chips & Science Act and the Chinese Big Fund are examples of such initiatives. This global escalation emphasizes the need for Europe to strengthen and protect its autonomous production capacities. The competition is not only economic; it also touches on issues of national security and geopolitical influence, especially given the strategic applications of semiconductors in modern warfare and communication infrastructures.\n\nThe coming months will be crucial for ASML and the European semiconductor industry. How effective the Semicon Coalition and the renewed European legislative and regulatory initiatives will be depends on all countries' willingness to cooperate substantially and invest in joint growth and protection.

            "content": "Christophe Fouquet, CEO of ASML, warns Europe that the continent's leading position in the field of semiconductors could be jeopardized if it is not better protected. While 9 EU countries, including the Netherlands, in the Semicon Coalition, ASML shares have recently fallen by almost 3%. The problem is competitive pressure and a wave of global initiatives such as American and Chinese chip funds. The Semicon Coalition, whose members include Belgium, Germany, and France, is focused on innovation and faster market introduction. However, with so much dependence on ASML in Europe, the outcome of these efforts will be significant for the continent's technological autonomy.\n\nThe critical role of ASML in Europe's semiconductor industry\n\nASML plays a crucial role in the European semiconductor industry thanks to its unique position as the only equipment producer capable of reliably etching the most advanced semiconductors. This makes them indispensable for producing a wide range of technologies, from AI accelerators to chips in smartphones and household appliances. Despite this monopoly position, there is growing concern about protecting this crucial industry within Europe. Christophe Fouquet has expressed his concerns about the possibility that critical European companies could be tempted to move to more favorable economic climate zones if they are not sufficiently protected. This could have dramatic consequences for Europe's technological autonomy and economic prosperity.\n\nEuropean chip sector unites in Semicon Coalition Nine European countries, including the Netherlands, want to strengthen the chip industry and support European assets. Read More\n\nCooperation within Europe for autonomy and resilience\n\nTen European countries have joined Semicon Coalition forces to anticipate the industry's imminent shifts. This cooperation aims to increase innovation capacity and improve the production and market introduction speed of semiconductors. The coalition comprises the Netherlands, Germany, and France, among others, and is committed to intensifying economic and strategic cooperation. This initiative is a sign of a shift towards more European independence in the sector, aimed at less dependence on external powers and strengthening the European technological infrastructure.\n\nEuropean Proactive Legislative Initiatives\n\nIn addition to joining forces in the Semicon Coalition, several European countries are working on a new chips law, the successor to the existing Chips Act. This law is designed to support semiconductor technologies. The new bill will focus specifically on allocating funds for developing chip design, materials, and equipment, considering the needs of major European players such as ASML. The bill will be presented before the summer of 2025, as part of a broader plan to face global competition and protect technologies crucial to the European economy.\n\nNetherlands introduces brand new center to boost innovation in semiconductors The ChipNL Competence Centre should position the Netherlands as a hub for innovation in semiconductors. Read More\n\nASML's shares\n\nDespite the prospects for European cooperation and legislation, ASML's shares have recently nearly 3% its semiconductor industry. Since ASML's products provide 90% of the global market demand for advanced semiconductor equipment, this decline demonstrates the importance of concrete steps to strengthen this essential industrial sector.\n\nInfluence of international competition\n\nInternational competition in semiconductor development is escalating, with countries like the United States and China deploying considerable funds to promote their industries. The American Chips & Science Act and the Chinese Big Fund are examples of such initiatives. This global escalation emphasizes the need for Europe to strengthen and protect its autonomous production capacities. The competition is not only economic; it also touches on issues of national security and geopolitical influence, especially given the strategic applications of semiconductors in modern warfare and communication infrastructures.\n\nThe coming months will be crucial for ASML and the European semiconductor industry. How effective the Semicon Coalition and the renewed European legislative and regulatory initiatives will be depends on all countries' willingness to cooperate substantially and invest in joint growth and protection. With the pressure of international competition and semiconductors' essential role in the modern economy, the stakes are high. Europe must act decisively to maintain its position on the world stage and expand its technological leadership.",

            "content": "Members of the European Parliament are calling on the European Commission to act quickly and launch the Chips Act 2.0. In a recent letter, they emphasized the need for more significant investment in AI chips and other semiconductor technologies, especially because of the increasing geopolitical tensions affecting supply chains. The letter follows a similar appeal from the European chip industry last week. Christophe Fouquet, CEO of ASML, also warned this week that the European chip sector must be better protected.\n\nFailure to act quickly could result in the EU losing its relevance in the global semiconductor industry. Currently, Europe produces only 10% of the world's chips, far behind countries such as the US and Asia. This new legislation should focus on expanding R&D funding and attracting new investments to strengthen Europe's position in advanced semiconductor technologies. Parliamentarians warn that Europe could fall behind in the global technology race without an adequate strategy and resources.\n\nFouquet warns: 'EU needs to protect its champions better' Christophe Fouquet warns that Europe could lose its leading companies if better protection is not provided. Read More\n\nGeopolitical pressure on the semiconductor market\n\nWhile Europe currently accounts for only 10% of global semiconductor production, the urgency for a more substantial European presence is increasing. Major players such as the US and China are continuing their developments and rapidly increasing their investments in the semiconductor industry. There is increasing pressure due to geopolitical instability and dependence on foreign suppliers, particularly from Taiwan and the US, further complicates the situation. The new legislative initiative should promote strategic independence and strengthen Europe's role as a frontrunner by actively supporting advanced chip technologies.\n\nInitiatives to strengthen R&D\n\nOne key to implementing the Chips Act 2.0 successfully is increasing subsidies for strategic partners such as TSMC and Intel. Although previous attempts have not effectively attracted companies, it is essential to emphasize the importance of a robust R&D infrastructure. With an emphasis on AI and high-performance computing (HPC) chips, the EU must adapt its policies to promote innovation within its borders. This also includes investments in public-private partnerships to stimulate research and development.\n\nThe new Chips Act 2.0 must implement significant changes to go further than its predecessor. Objectives include strengthening Europe's domestic semiconductor supply chains and promoting investments in AI chips and HPC. As the European Commission recently emphasized, it is essential to meet current geopolitical demands while supporting the green, digital, and defense transitions, which depend on a strong semiconductor ecosystem.\n\nASML\u2019s drive for innovation and performance is matched by its urge for reliability During Holland Innovative\u2019s Reliability Symposium, Bas Dielissen explains the logic behind ASML's relentless pursuit of perfection in semiconductor manufacturing. Read More\n\nNecessary economic security strategy\n\nIn light of increased global competition, as seen in the rivalry between the US and China, European policymakers emphasize the need to implement a robust economic security strategy. Without this strategy, European driving forces risk being influenced by extraterritorial challenges. By promoting technological leadership and building up production capacities and a strong R&D ecosystem, the EU aims to safeguard its sovereignty in times of increasing uncertainty.\n\nLooking to the future, European policymakers face the challenge of effectively implementing the Chips Act 2.0 to prevent Europe from falling behind in the global technology race. Although the legislation has mobilized significant investments, such as the \u20ac80 billion demonstrated by the original Chips Act, the question remains whether future strategies will be sufficient to bring about substantial changes in the semiconductor industry. The emphasis on an integrated approach that addresses geopolitical and technological factors will be crucial for securing Europe's place in the global semiconductor arena.",

With AI-related demand expected to surge further in 2025, semiconductor equipment spending is on track for another major expansion. Against the backdrop of escalating US sanctions, China is positioning itself to leverage the AI boom as a possible rebound strategy, drawing intense global attention to its next move.\n\nChina is forecast to take nearly 40% of global semiconductor equipment orders, underscoring its role as a key demand driver. Whether Chinese companies can capitalize on AI momentum and navigate international restrictions will be in sharp focus at SEMICON China 2025, which opens on March 26 in Shanghai.\n\nKey international players retreat as Chinese manufacturers advance\n\nInterestingly, several key international players are skipping the event. US-based Applied Materials and Dutch lithography leader ASML will not be exhibiting. Applied Materials is participating only in affiliated forums and the CSTIC conference, while ASML continues its years-long absence from the show floor.\n\nHeld alongside SEMICON China, the ongoing CSTIC 2025 is running from March 24\u201325 in Shanghai, featuring ten technical symposiums spanning semiconductor science and technology.\n\nFilling the vacuum are Chinese homegrown equipment manufacturers such as Naura Technology, Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment (AMEC), and Acm Research (Shanghai), Inc. These firms are gaining momentum both in China's domestic substitution push and in global markets.\n\nGrowing financial strength of domestic suppliers\n\nChina's top equipment makers are posting robust double-digit growth. Naura projects 2024 revenue between CNY27.6 billion (US$3.81 billion) and CNY31.78 billion, representing a 25% to 43.93% year-over-year increase. Net profit is expected to reach CNY5.17\u20135.95 billion, up 32.6% to 52.6%.\n\nAcm Research (Shanghai) forecasts 2024 revenue of CNY5.618 billion, up 44.48% year over year. Net profit is projected at CNY1.153 billion, a 26.65% increase. Its core cleaning equipment segment is expected to generate CNY4.057 billion\u2014roughly 72.22% of total revenue\u2014with a 55.18% annual gain.\n\nHangzhou Changchuan Technology (CCTech), a specialist in IC testing equipment, expects 2024 net profit to soar between CNY400 million and CNY500 million\u2014representing explosive growth of 785.75% to 1,007.18%, driven primarily by expanded overseas shipments.\n\nAI wave propels industry-wide growth\n\nWith AI adoption accelerating, Chinese semiconductor equipment makers are riding a rising tide. Industry projections put global chip sales at over US$700 billion in 2025, with equipment investment forecast to hit US$112.8 billion. Chinese suppliers are well-positioned to capitalize on this uptrend.\n\nChina continues to be the world's largest market for semiconductor equipment. The domestic AI boom, led by startups like DeepSeek, is fueling demand for both chips and manufacturing tools.\n\nSEMI projects global semiconductor equipment sales will hit US$109 billion in 2024, up 18.7% from 2023. Momentum is expected to carry into 2025, with sales reaching US$128 billion\u2014another 18% annual gain. China is projected to account for nearly 40% of global demand.\n\nChina's expansion in domestic chip production\u2014especially in mature-node processes\u2014is a key driver of rising equipment investment and technology upgrades.\n\nAs geopolitical challenges and AI momentum converge, SEMICON China 2025 will be a critical litmus test for whether China's homegrown semiconductor equipment makers can translate ambition into execution.\n\nArticle edited by Jerry Chen",

That was just enough to nudge Danish weight loss drugmaker Novo off the top spot.\n\nSAP\u2019s stock has risen more than 40% in the past year, amid booming demand for its AI-driven enterprise resource planning software (ERP). The cloud-based software centralises business data, allowing multiple departments to access and share information in one place.\n\nIn contrast, Novo is having a tougher time on the stock market. Novo\u2019s flagship product is Ozempic, a weight loss drug championed by celebrities and the ultra-wealthy, including Elon Musk. However, trials of the firm\u2019s newest weight loss therapy, CagriSema, haven\u2019t generated the same excitement. The drug was shown to be less effective than anticipated, causing shares to drop 50% from their 2024 high.\n\nNovo isn\u2019t the only company feeling the impact of SAP\u2019s stock rally. In October, the software firm rode overtook ASML to become Europe\u2019s most valuable tech company.\n\nASML, based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, makes chip-making equipment for most of the world\u2019s largest semiconductor companies. As the only firm that manufactures the EUV lithography machines required to produce the world\u2019s most advanced computer chips, the Dutch business has become an investor darling.\n\nHowever, ASML\u2019s shares plummeted dramatically in in October, wiping \u20ac50bn off its market cap in one fell swoop.\n\nThe plunge came after the Dutch firm said it did not receive the expected number of orders for its lithography machines and expects fewer net sales for 2025 than previously estimated.\n\nThat news also sparked a global sell-off on chip stocks, as investors worried that demand may be faltering. However, analysts were quick to point out that weak orders at ASML were more a sign that chipmakers had been stockpiling chips than a longer-term problem.\n\nSince then, ASML\u2019s stock has soared, plunged, and risen again. In January, shares jumped as much as 12% \u2014 the largest increase in nearly five years \u2014 following a surge in order bookings. The company currently ranks as Europe\u2019s fourth most valuable, with Paris-based LVMH in third place behind SAP and Novo.\n\nThe shifting fortunes of Europe\u2019s biggest companies reflect the volatility of today\u2019s global markets. In recent months, stock prices have been rattled by fluctuating interest rates, geopolitical tensions, and new technological developments.\n\nMany of Europe\u2019s biggest tech companies will be at TNW Conference, which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

As long as the export ban remains in place, there is no possible way for China to get a hold of this advanced equipment, meaning that the only way to compete with its biggest rival is to develop in-house chip-making tools. As it happens, a new report talks about SiCarrier, a firm closely linked with Huawei, is working diligently to ensure that ASML is no longer a dependent source of EUV machines.\n\nThe development of advanced machines from SiCarrier is getting some much-needed support from the Chinese government\n\nWith the help of Huawei, a previous report stated that custom EUV prototypes focused on laser-induced discharge plasma (LDP) will enter trial production in the third quarter of 2025. Nikkei does not report if this hardware is the same one being tested by SiCarrier, but the latest information states that the company is developing not one but a wide range of machines to replace ASML while reducing the grip of foreign rivals to help China climb out of the rabbit hole and start producing in-house wafers.\n\nThe report states that SiCarrier has received backing from the Shenzhen government, which will help catalyze its operations. According to sources familiar with the matter, the equipment is currently focused on chip fabrication, with firms like ASML, Applied Materials, and Lam Research serving as its benchmark. Other hardware involved in lithography, chemical vapor deposition, measurement, physical vapor deposition, etching, and atomic layer deposition are also being worked on.\n\nBear in mind that all of these categories are dominated by companies from the Netherlands, the U.S., and Japan, with SiCarrier aiming to bridge the technological gap by working closely with Huawei and its growing team of experts in chip production and chip-making equipment. The report does not mention when the first prototype will enter production, but at this time, the most advanced lithography that China has ever come up with is the 5nm technology that was developed by SMIC.\n\nUnfortunately, the company has yet to mass produce wafers on this manufacturing process at a larger scale since the DUV equipment it currently employs takes up too much time and churns out a higher volume of defected wafers, which only adds to the mounting costs. With the efforts from SiCarrier, Huawei and the Chinese government, perhaps it will not take long before the region finally advances in chip manufacturing.\n\nNews Source: Nikkei Asia",

For investors with some cash on the sidelines, here are three top tech stocks to consider.\n\nNvidia\n\nIf there is one stock the market revolves around at the moment, it is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker has grown to become one of the largest companies in the world and is a litmus test on market sentiment, especially when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nAI is still in its early innings, but it is already starting to reshape the world we live in. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), meanwhile, are the main source of computing power behind AI model training and inference. At the same time, AI infrastructure spending is continuing to grow. This can be seen in the capital expenditure (capex) budgets of the leading cloud computing companies, as well as those investing in creating foundational AI models.\n\nFor its part, Nvidia sees AI-related data center capex topping $1 trillion in 2028. That would be more than double where it is today. Meanwhile, the company is poised to continue to be the biggest beneficiary of this spending, as it remains at the forefront of both AI hardware and software.\n\nTo top it off, the stock is attractively priced, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 26 based on this year's analyst estimates and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio below 0.5, with PEGs under 1 usually considered undervalued.\n\nASML\n\nWhile Nvidia has a lock on the GPU market, ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) has a virtual monopoly on the equipment that is used to make advanced chips like GPUs. It is the clear-cut leader in a technology known as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which is behind the equipment needed to manufacture these chips.\n\nMeanwhile, the company also already introduced its next-generation technology, high-NA (numerical aperture) EUV technology. This will allow for the printing of smaller features and higher density on chips. ASML's machines are expensive, with EUV machines running around $200 million and its new high-NA EUV machines costing around $370 million.\n\nThe company has already sold some of these new machines although the leading foundries (chip manufacturers) are being a bit cautious given the high price tag. As such, the bigger benefit from these newer machines is likely a few years down the line.\n\nHowever, leading foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) and Intel are looking to greatly expand to keep up with rising chip demand. TSMC is building new manufacturing facilities (called fabs) around the globe and has pledged to invest $165 billion in the U.S. over the next few years. Intel, meanwhile, continues to plan to invest $100 billion in new U.S chip manufacturing capacity over the next five years. All of these new facilities will need to be fitted with equipment from ASML.\n\nWhile trading at a forward P/E of 29.5 based on this year's analyst estimates may not seem like a bargain, it drops to a P/E of 24 based on 2026 estimates given the current outlook for new fab spending, making this industry leader a solid buy at current levels.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nAnother strong company in the semiconductor value chain to buy on the market pullback is Taiwan Semiconductor (or TSMC). It is the leading semiconductor contract manufacturer in the world. It makes chips for leading chip designers such as Nvidia and is a customer of ASML.\n\nWhile contract manufacturing in many lines of business isn't that exciting, semiconductor manufacturing requires a lot of technological expertise. TSMC has been able to take a wide lead on this front by continually pushing down chip sizes, which allow for more transistors to fit onto chips. This increases processing speeds and lowers power consumption.\n\nThis has led TSMC to command a more than two-thirds market share in the pure-play foundry space and be the clear leader in advanced chips. As such, the company has become an integral partner to the world's largest semiconductor designers, such as Nvidia and Apple.\n\nIts importance in the semiconductor value chain to its partners has also given it strong pricing power. This has also helped the company to expand its gross margin, which is leading profitability to grow faster than revenue.\n\nLike Nvidia, TSMC continues to be a big beneficiary of increasing AI infrastructure spending, as more AI chips are needed to run AI workloads. Increasing capacity, higher prices for its services, and an expanding gross margin all make TSMC an attractive growth stock.\n\nAt the same time the stock is cheap, trading at a forward P/E of only 19.5 and a PEG below 0.7.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "SAP claims the title of Europe\u2019s most valuable listed company, taking over from Danish producer of weight-loss drugs Novo Nordisk.\n\nSAP shares rose 1.6% on Monday, driven by growing investor optimism about the company\u2019s cloud-based software. This brought the German company\u2019s valuation to approximately \u20ac314 billion ($340 billion). This caused SAP to overtake Novo Nordisk, whose shares fell by 16% this year. According to Bloomberg, this decline is partly due to disappointing test results for the new weight loss drug CagriSema.\n\nSwitching to the cloud helps SAP\n\nSAP shares rose 42% last year. This is partly thanks to the accelerated shift of customers from traditional on-site servers to cloud infrastructure. This shift enables the company to offer more profitable products, often bundled with artificial intelligence. According to the manufacturer, this combination has given a significant boost to sales growth.\n\nProbably the highest growth percentage in a decade\n\nAnalysts estimate that SAP\u2019s sales will increase by an average of 12% this year. If they are successful, this would be the highest annual growth rate in ten years. Operating profit is expected to increase even more, thanks in part to a restructuring program announced in January 2024.\n\nSAP\u2019s steady rise stands in contrast to other European blue-chip companies that are facing major challenges. ASML, for example, is dealing with weak orders from several major customers. This is accompanied by much stricter export restrictions on chip equipment to China, mainly at the initiative of the US.\n\nASML also sees bright spots\n\nIncidentally, according to the Dutch company itself, ASML\u2019s expectations do not seem to be that negative at all. Like other players in the chip industry, ASML is admittedly cautious about the short-term future. Trade restrictions with China are indeed a dark cloud over the ASML order book, while Intel\u2019s uncertain nature can also lead to less demand for chip machines. Chinese customers accounted for almost half of all orders in Q2, for example, but this share will fall due to trade restrictions. Nevertheless, the longer term is said to be unabatedly positive for the Dutch company.\n\nThe company therefore stands by its prediction that it will bring in between 44 and 60 billion euros in orders by 2030. Given that current sales figures based on the last quarter amount to around 30 billion euros per year, this would represent a significant increase in six years\u2019 time.",

All of these new facilities will need to be fitted with equipment from ASML.\n\nWhile trading at a forward P/E of 29.5 based on this year's analyst estimates may not seem like a bargain, it drops to a P/E of 24 based on 2026 estimates given the current outlook for new fab spending, making this industry leader a solid buy at current levels.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nAnother strong company in the semiconductor value chain to buy on the market pullback is Taiwan Semiconductor (or TSMC). It is the leading semiconductor contract manufacturer in the world. It makes chips for leading chip designers such as Nvidia and is a customer of ASML.\n\nWhile contract manufacturing in many lines of business isn't that exciting, semiconductor manufacturing requires a lot of technological expertise. TSMC has been able to take a wide lead on this front by continually pushing down chip sizes, which allow for more transistors to fit onto chips. This increases processing speeds and lowers power consumption.\n\nThis has led TSMC to command a more than two-thirds market share in the pure-play foundry space and be the clear leader in advanced chips. As such, the company has become an integral partner to the world's largest semiconductor designers, such as Nvidia and Apple.\n\nIts importance in the semiconductor value chain to its partners has also given it strong pricing power. This has also helped the company to expand its gross margin, which is leading profitability to grow faster than revenue.\n\nLike Nvidia, TSMC continues to be a big beneficiary of increasing AI infrastructure spending, as more AI chips are needed to run AI workloads. Increasing capacity, higher prices for its services, and an expanding gross margin all make TSMC an attractive growth stock.\n\nAt the same time the stock is cheap, trading at a forward P/E of only 19.5 and a PEG below 0.7.",

With research contracts worth CNY53.98 billion (US$7.46 billion) in 2025 and industrial sales exceeding CNY160 billion in five years, CIOMP plays a key role in China's push for technological self-sufficiency. Beyond high salaries, PhDs receive CNY300,000\u2013600,000 annually in research funding, plus local government subsidies for living and housing. This reflects China's broader strategy to overcome semiconductor bottlenecks as it competes with the US in technology dominance.\n\nTSMC board member dismisses Intel foundry takeover rumors, calls them unfounded\n\nPaul Liu, head of Taiwan's National Development Council (NDC) and a TSMC board member, dismissed speculation that TSMC is considering acquiring Intel's struggling foundry business, calling it an incompatible move. Speaking before Taiwan's Legislative Yuan Economic Committee, Liu assured lawmakers that the topic was never discussed at the board level despite international reports suggesting potential US partnerships. Industry analysts warn that acquiring Intel's foundry operations could be more harmful than beneficial to TSMC. Liu also addressed concerns about TSMC's US expansion, explaining that new process nodes take 18\u201324 months to stabilize and that US production lines would lag behind Taiwan's by three years. He urged lawmakers not to view the US as a semiconductor rival, emphasizing global cooperation over confrontation.\n\nIntel CEO Lip-Bu Tan's appointment sparks renewed hopes for India\n\nIntel's appointment of Lip-Bu Tan as CEO has reignited speculation about the company's potential entry into India's semiconductor sector, particularly in outsourced semiconductor assembly and testing (OSAT). Although an immediate investment is unlikely, analysts believe Tan's leadership could revive Intel's interest in an OSAT facility in India. An Intel OSAT facility in India could accelerate its semiconductor ecosystem, introducing a mature supplier network and advanced packaging technologies. Intel's leadership in Advanced Packaging (EMIB, FOVEROS, ODI, and Co-Packaged Optics) could help India leapfrog 5\u20137 years in semiconductor development.\n\nHuawei turns to SMIC's 7nm for Kirin X90 PC chip, cutting ties with Intel and Microsoft\n\nHuawei is accelerating its self-sufficiency in personal computing, developing in-house chips, and transitioning away from Intel, Microsoft, and Qualcomm. Its latest Kirin X90 processor has earned China's Level 2 security certification, a key step toward domestic alternatives to Western semiconductor giants. With strong government support and a maturing supply chain, China's semiconductor sector is moving from catching up to leading in key areas.\n\nIntel's new CEO and breakthrough in 18A process technology signal a new era\n\nIntel is making a strong comeback with two major announcements\u2014the appointment of Tan as CEO and the successful production of Intel 18A wafers at its Arizona plant. These developments have temporarily silenced speculation about Intel's future in semiconductor manufacturing. The company aims to become a top-tier foundry player, leveraging its superior salaries, US-based expansion, and leading-edge technology. However, success will depend on assembling an experienced team and achieving cost-efficient, high-yield manufacturing.\n\nSamsung's HBM3E reportedly receives high marks during Nvidia audit\n\nSamsung Electronics' fifth-generation HBM3E memory has performed well in Nvidia's recent audit and is on track to receive quality certification by June, according to South Korean reports. The industry is closely watching for potential announcements about Samsung's entry into Nvidia's HBM supply chain.\n\nChina's AI infrastructure surge fuels SSD boom, fast-tracks local memory supply chain\n\nThe rapid expansion of AI infrastructure in China\u2014driven by large-scale models like DeepSeek\u2014is significantly increasing demand for enterprise SSDs, DRAM, and NAND flash storage across healthcare, finance, and government sectors. With strong AI investment, growing domestic manufacturing, and increasing NAND flash localization, China's enterprise SSD market is poised for rapid expansion, challenging global leaders in the long term.\n\nArticle edited by Jerry Chen",

Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nThe S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) last week sank into a correction, defined as a drop of 10% or more from a recent peak, as investors have responded to weakening consumer sentiment and other signs of macroeconomic headwinds by selling stocks. And the uncertainty around the on-again, off-again tariffs has weighed on business and investor confidence.\n\nWhile concerns about a recession might be premature, President Trump and other administration leaders have acknowledged that short-term pain might be necessary to reset the economy according to his vision of strengthening the U.S. manufacturing base and erasing trade deficits with the country's top trading partners. Most economists believe that tariffs will have a negative impact on economic growth and raise prices, and a number of business leaders from a wide range of industries have echoed those statements.\n\nNot surprisingly, some investors are looking to invest outside of the U.S. as a hedge against the volatility and risk around tariffs and weakening economic indicators.\n\nDiversifying your portfolio with international stocks isn't so easy, especially since companies outside of the U.S. often receive limited coverage. But one seamless way to do it is by investing in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds international stocks. One Vanguard ETF in particular could be just right for the current market environment.\n\nGrab your passport\n\nOne of the top-performing ETFs this year has been the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF(NYSEMKT: VEA), which invests in large-cap stocks outside the U.S. Through Friday's close, the ETF is up 10.8% in 2025, easily outperforming the S&P 500, which is down 3.5%.\n\nFor the first few weeks of the year, the two investments essentially traded in tandem, but they began to bifurcate shortly after Trump took office, as the chart below shows.\n\nThe Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF holds a number of top companies from Europe and other parts of the world, including SAP, Novo Nordisk, ASML, and Nestl\u00e9. Top holdings from outside of Europe include HSBC Holdings and Toyota Motor.\n\nAbout 55% of its holdings come from Europe, while 34.5% come from the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe fund holds nearly 4,000 stocks, with a median market cap of $45.9 billion. But the top 10 holdings, which include the names above, make up roughly 10% of the total portfolio. The Vanguard ETF is designed to track the FTSE Developed All-Cap ex-US Index.\n\nIn addition to offering investors the benefit of exposure to stocks that aren't directly in the line of fire from U.S. tariffs, the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF also has another advantage over the S&P 500: It's significantly cheaper.\n\nThe ETF currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 15.9, compared to the S&P 500 at 25.\n\nThat premium is the result of the S&P 500's earlier outperformance during the bull market that began in 2023, which was driven by the surge in \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks following the launch of ChatGPT and the beginning of the AI boom.\n\nThe reversal in that trend seems to show that investors are rotating out of the U.S. to capitalize on the better value represented by the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF.\n\nIs this Vanguard ETF a buy?\n\nGiven the valuation gap between the international-focused ETF and the S&P 500, the Vanguard FTSE ETF looks like a good bet to outperform, especially if the uncertainty around tariffs and weakening economic sentiment continues.\n\nIf you're looking to diversify from U.S. stocks in these uncertain times, this developed markets ETF is an easy way to get exposure to large, profitable companies in Europe and elsewhere around the world.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

But a new initiative signals the continent's intent to compete with leading semiconductor markets such as the United States and Asia.\n\nA coalition of nine European Union countries, led by the Netherlands, has been formed to accelerate plans for a potential second funding package under the European Chips Act. This initiative aims to present proposals by summer, following the mixed results of the 2023 Chips Act, which, despite preventing a decline in Europe's industry, failed to meet its key objectives due to slow approval processes and less state support than that provided by the U.S. and China.\n\nDutch Economy Minister Dirk Beljaarts emphasized the need for a more targeted approach in the potential second funding program. \"We need to allocate funds,\" Beljaarts told Reuters. \"Both private and public funds to push the sector, also to make sure that the trickle-down effect takes place and that (small and medium-size) companies also benefit.\" This strategy aims to address gaps in areas such as chip packaging and advanced production, particularly after Intel shelved plans for a cutting-edge factory in Germany.\n\nThe coalition, which includes Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the Netherlands, is focused on three main priorities: enhancing production capabilities, mobilizing public and private investment, and fostering talent within the sector.\n\nEurope boasts strong research and development capabilities, with companies like ASML leading the chipmaking-tools market. However, the region lags behind in advanced chip production, with only Intel utilizing cutting-edge technology in Ireland. The industry's stakeholders include major chip manufacturers like Bosch, Infineon, NXP, and STMicroelectronics, along with equipment suppliers ASML and ASM.\n\nFollowing a meeting in Brussels, organizations such as ESIA and SEMI Europe are set to formally propose their needs to the European Commission's digital official, Henna Virkkunen. Their requests include direct support for semiconductor design, manufacturing, R&D, materials, and equipment.\n\nThe European Chips Act, launched in 2023, aimed to reduce Europe's dependence on foreign semiconductor supplies and bolster the region's technological sovereignty. However, it has faced challenges, including a scarcity of skilled workers and slow approval processes.\n\nThe Act has a total investment goal of \u20ac43 billion, with the Chips Joint Undertaking playing a pivotal role in bridging the gap between research and commercialization. Despite these efforts, critics argue that government intervention may not be the most effective strategy, as it can distort competition and favor inefficient producers.",

(NASDAQ:ASML) stands against the other stocks widely held by individuals in 2025.\n\nIndividual investors, often called retail investors, typically invest their personal capital directly into the stock market, driven primarily by personal research, news sentiment, social media trends, or recommendations from peers. They often favor stocks of recognizable brands or companies whose products and services they use regularly, as well as growth stocks perceived to offer high return potential. While their success varies widely (often marked by emotional decision-making and mixed results) monitoring retail investor trends can be valuable, as these investors collectively have the power to significantly influence stock prices and market volatility. Understanding where retail attention is focused can provide early signals of market shifts, speculative bubbles, or emerging investment opportunities. Just to recall two recent instances when retail investors successfully short-squeezed and caused billions of losses to the smartest hedge funds in the world \u2013 as they say, even the less informed parties may occasionally win big, and it is, therefore, important to be aware of their tendencies and trends.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Stocks That Members of Congress Own\n\nThe type of stocks most widely held by individuals has been changing over time, from consumer-centered brands that were popular in the \u201980s and \u201990s to popular dot-com names in the 2000s, and finally to technology stocks in the 2010s, as retail investors had firsthand experience with their products and platforms. One thing is certain \u2013 retail investors are often the last to jump on the ship, and periods of active inflow of retail money into stocks coincide with market peaks. A similar situation happened in the last two years, as the majority of the returns of the US stock market have been driven by a handful of 7\u20138 stocks with primary exposure to the AI megatrend \u2013 as you will see below, many of these stocks are now among the most widely held by individuals. It is no surprise that at this exact moment, the Magnificent 8 category, which confidently outperformed the whole market in the last two years, is finally lagging behind.\n\nIt should be noted that retail investors are not always wrong; in fact, you can frequently find quite promising high-growth names among those preferred by individuals. This category of investors often flocks together on social media platforms and actively shares knowledge with each other, meaning that the latest technological breakthroughs and inventions are already in their sights. In the current market, with uncertainties and fear looming from all directions (recall the tariff wars expected in April, large public spending cuts, layoffs, and Medicare/Medicaid threats), the \u201csmart money\u201d has been very cautious with US stocks. In fact, there has been a noticeable rotation of money from US stocks to the less overvalued foreign markets, like Germany and China, which have been using stimulus to fuel growth. With the US market becoming less favored by institutional investors, retail investors could enter the spotlight again and decide who the major winners will be.",

Learn More \u00bb\n\nTwilio and ASML have enough catalysts in the bag that could send them soaring, both in the short and the long run. Let's take a closer look at why these two stocks are built for impressive upside.\n\n1. ASML Holding\n\nASML manufactures and supplies chipmaking equipment to the leading foundries and chipmakers across the globe, and it plays a central role in the proliferation of AI. ASML is the only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. The strong demand for AI-related semiconductor chips created a strong demand for these machines capable of making chips based on advanced process nodes.\n\nThese advanced chips use process nodes measuring 7-nanometer (nm), 5nm, 3nm, and lower. The small size of these nodes allows chipmakers and foundries to pack more transistors into a smaller area, which eventually leads to better performance and lower power consumption and also reduces the cost of manufacturing chips.\n\nNot surprisingly, advanced process nodes are being used by multiple companies, ranging from Nvidia to Apple to Qualcomm to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, to manufacture AI chips. For instance, Apple's latest iPhones that support AI features are powered by the A18 chip, which is manufactured using a 3nm process node. These new chips are reportedly 15% faster than the previous generation processor and consume 20% less power.\n\nAI chip giant Nvidia, on the other hand, has moved to a 4nm process for its latest generation of Blackwell processors from the 5nm process that was used for manufacturing its popular Hopper generation processors. All this explains why ASML saw a significant increase in orders for its machines.\n\nThe company's net bookings jumped by a whopping 170% sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2024 to 7.1 billion euros. ASML points out that 42% of its bookings last quarter were for EUV machines. The Dutch giant says that the strong demand for EUV machines, thanks to AI, could help it achieve the higher end of its 2025 revenue guidance of 30 billion euros to 35 billion euros.\n\nAnother thing worth noting here is that chipmakers, foundries, and cloud computing giants have all said they plan to ramp up their spending on AI infrastructure in 2025. For example, tech giants Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon are set to raise their combined capital spending by an impressive 46% this year to $325 billion. Foundry giant TSMC said it is going to raise its capital spending in 2025 by 33% to $40 billion (at the midpoint of its guidance range). The company is going to spend 70% of its capital expenditure on advanced processes. These developments suggest that ASML could end up delivering stronger-than-expected growth in 2025.\n\nAnalysts expect ASML's earnings growth to pick up the pace from 2025 following a small decline of 3.3% last year to $20.82 per share.\n\nEven better, the company should be able to sustain such impressive growth for a much longer time as the demand for AI chips is likely to increase thanks to the growing application of this technology in multiple areas such as data centers, smartphones, automotive, and other edge applications. It may not be long before ASML stock starts flying higher, which is why it may be a good idea to buy this semiconductor stock while it trades at an attractive 27 times forward earnings.\n\n2. Twilio\n\nOne of the industries where AI technology is set to gain rapid adoption is cloud-based contact centers. Twilio is a leading player in this market. The company's application programming interfaces (APIs) enable businesses to remain in touch with customers through various channels such as voice, text, email, and others.\n\nFuture Market Insights estimates that the AI-based cloud contact center market could generate nearly $20 billion in revenue in 2034 as compared to $3.7 billion last year. This lucrative opportunity is already having a positive impact on Twilio's performance.\n\nThe company reported 7% revenue growth in 2024 to $4.5 billion, but its top line jumped at a more impressive pace of 11% in the final quarter of the year. Twilio's improved growth can be attributed to the growing demand for its AI-focused tools. Management pointed out on the February earnings conference call that 90% of the Forbes 50 AI start-ups are building applications using Twilio's solutions. Meanwhile, the company saw 9,000 customers using its services to build AI communications tools last year.\n\nTwilio has been pushing the envelope in the cloud communications market by partnering with the likes of OpenAI to bring AI tools to customers. The good part is that its AI communications solutions are gaining traction among clients. This is evident from the impressive 47% year-over-year increase in the number of deals worth at least half a million dollars that Twilio signed in the communications business last quarter.\n\nWith the adoption of AI in the contact center market still in its early phases, Twilio has a huge growth opportunity ahead of itself, considering that it has built a strong active customer base of 325,000. The majority of these customers have not yet adopted its AI solutions, opening up cross-sale potential.\n\nAnalysts expect a 19% increase in Twilio's earnings this year, followed by healthy growth in the next two years as well.\n\nWhat's more, the stock's 12-month median analyst price target of $160 points toward potential gains of 61%. As such, this cloud stock seems well-placed to make a parabolic move in the coming year due to the improving adoption of its AI tools. Twilio trades at an attractive 23 times forward earnings right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

That's not surprising given the rapid adoption of AI in hopes of capturing long-term productivity gains. Ernst & Young's global strategy consulting arm estimates that generative AI could lift the global gross domestic product (GDP) by as much as $2.4 trillion over the next decade thanks to stronger productivity. As a result, it is not surprising to see why companies and governments across the globe have been pouring a lot of money into bolstering their AI infrastructure.\n\nThat's why now might be a good time to take a look at two companies that already benefit from this growing AI-related demand.

However, perspectives on scaling solid-state lasers are unknown.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBefore we discuss how the CAS method works, let's recap the de facto industry-standard method of creating light with a 193-nm wavelength used by ASML, Canon, and Nikon for their DUV litho machines. Also, keep in mind that the CAS system is in its early stages of development, and we are talking about a test vehicle at best.\n\nTraditional approach\n\nDUV lithography machines by ASML, Canon, and Nikon generate 193-nm light using an argon fluoride (ArF) excimer laser. The laser chamber contains a gas mixture of argon and fluorine and a buffer gas like neon. When high-voltage electrical pulses are applied, the argon and fluorine atoms become excited and briefly form an unstable molecule called ArF (or excimer), which quickly returns to its ground state, releasing a photon with a wavelength of 193 nm.\n\nThe laser emits these photons as short, high-energy pulses at an output power of up to 100W\u2014120W and at frequencies between 8 kHz and 9 kHz for modern immersion DUV tools. The 193-nm beam is then directed through an optical system that shapes, guides and stabilizes the light. It passes into the lithography scanner, where it shines through a photomask containing the chip pattern.\n\nThe CAS approach\n\nThe test device developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences generates 193 nm light using a fully solid-state approach, avoiding gas-based excimer lasers entirely. It begins with a homemade Yb:YAG crystal amplifier, which produces a 1030-nm laser beam. This beam is then split into two optical paths, each undergoing a different optical process to create the components needed for 193-nm generation.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn the first path, the 1030-nm beam is converted into a 258-nm beam through fourth-harmonic generation (FHG, a nonlinear optical process that transforms a laser beam to one-fourth of its original wavelength, in this case, a 258-nm beam). This part delivers an output power of 1.2 W. In the second path, the other half of the 1030-nm beam is used to pump an optical parametric amplifier, resulting in a 1553-nm beam with a power of 700 mW.\n\nThese two beams \u2014 258 nm and 1553 nm \u2014 are combined in cascaded lithium triborate (LBO) crystals to generate a coherent light with a 193 nm wavelength with an average power of 70 mW operating at a frequency of 6 kHz. CAS says that the test system has a linewidth narrower than 880 MHz, a performance comparable in spectral purity to that of commercial systems used today.\n\nA comparison?\n\nThe CAS system produces 193 nm light using a solid-state laser with a 70 mW average power and a 6 kHz frequency, achieving a narrow linewidth below 880 MHz. The test system's output is orders of magnitude lower than ASML's ArF excimer-based production systems, which deliver 100 \u2013 120W at a 9 kHz frequency.\n\nWhile the initial CAS system demonstrates capabilities, its low power output makes it unsuitable for commercial semiconductor manufacturing, where high throughput and process stability are essential. It's likely that multiple generations of development would be needed to make this a viable chipmaking light source.",

            "content": "Europe Launches Semiconductor Alliance, Greece Left Behind Amid significant support for the semiconductor industry, Greece's inaction raises concerns about its future in technology.\n\nIn a significant move for the European semiconductor industry, nine European Union nations have recently established the Semiconductor Alliance, aimed at boosting competitiveness in a sector that is crucial for digital devices and technology. Announced on March 12, 2025, the alliance includes Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the Netherlands but notably excludes Greece, prompting conversations about the adequacy of the Greek Ministry of Development's response to the semiconductor strategy.\n\nThe Semiconductor Alliance\u2019s primary objective is to accelerate the development of a robust semiconductor industry in Europe and to launch a subsequent EU funding initiative known as Chips Act 2.0, which seeks to strengthen the continent's semiconductor capabilities and reduce dependence on Southeast Asia for critical technologies.\n\nDespite these advancements in the EU, Greece's absence from the alliance highlights a troubling trend of inaction by the Greek Ministry of Development. Although the former Minister, Kostas Skrekas, had made plans for a national semiconductor strategy by contracting McKinsey to devise it, the process has stalled. Reports indicate that although funding was secured in November 2024 as part of the ministry\u2019s Sectoral Development Program, the necessary contract with McKinsey has yet to be signed.\n\nCurrent Minister Takis Theodorikakos assured stakeholders of a commitment to finance the establishment of Greece\u2019s first Semiconductor Competence Center, promising 3.6 million euros for its development. However, progress in implementing these initiatives has been criticized as sluggish, with industry insiders warning that Greece risks missing out on opportunities in a rapidly evolving market.\n\nFurthermore, while the local industry is small but thriving, the inability to tap into the expertise of Thomas Skordas, the deputy director-general of the EU\u2019s Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content and Technologies (DG Connect), remains a significant missed opportunity for Greece.\n\nIn parallel, shares of Dutch semiconductor giant ASML Holding have faced declines, despite the growing anticipation surrounding new European legislative actions aimed at enhancing the semiconductor landscape. Following reports that nine EU countries are collaborating to finalize proposals to boost the chip industry by summer 2025, Dutch Economy Minister Dirk Beljaarts commented on the preparations being made for this new act, which he referred to as a follow-up to the 2023 Chips Act.\n\nASML has found itself in a challenging position, as investor confidence waned with its shares dropping nearly three percent amid caution regarding immediate outcomes from the initiatives. This concern among investors comes despite the Dutch government expressing optimism about targeted funding approaches, promising to allocate both private and public funds aimed at supporting small and medium-sized enterprises within the sector.\n\nBeljaarts has emphasized the need for a focused strategy moving forward, stating, \u201cWe need to allocate funds, both private and public, to push the sector, also to make sure that the trickle-down effect takes place and that small and medium-size companies also benefit.\u201d This statement echoes concerns from industry experts who note that the overarching ambitions of the first Chips Act did not translate into tangible achievements due to the slow pace of project approvals by the European Commission and member states.\n\nIn response to these concerns, recent gatherings of chip manufacturers and semiconductor supply chain companies, including ASML, have called for supporting measures that focus not only on boosting manufacturing capacity but also enhancing areas like chip design, materials, and equipment. The potential for a second funding package appears promising, but the demand for expedited processes remains loud and clear.\n\nIntel and Wolfspeed, both significant players in the semiconductor landscape, have recently announced delays in establishing new production facilities in Europe, citing that economic conditions shifted during the protracted approval period. This further highlights the urgency for Europe to reinforce its semiconductor prowess if it is to keep pace with formidable competitors such as the US and China.\n\nAs the landscape unfolds, it becomes evident that while some progress is being made across European nations to bolster the semiconductor industry, Greece\u2019s hesitance to engage effectively in these initiatives casts shadows over its future potential in this ever-critical technology sector. With nine nations rallying around the Semiconductor Alliance and discussions of Chips Act 2.0 gaining traction, it raises the question: will Greece manage to catch up, or will it continue to lag behind as Europe forges ahead in the global semiconductor race?",

I think of the AI revolution as similar in many ways to the changes the internet brought to our overall economy. Today, a significant amount of value is created and transferred online, and these trends continue to this day.\n\nKey Points\n\nThese two top AI stocks have the potential to outperform on more than hype \u2013 they\u2019ve got solid fundamentals supported by the artificial intelligence revolution.\n\nLast year we published our comprehensive report on AI named \u2018The Next NVIDIA.\u2018 We\u2019ll soon be removing it making this your last chance to get this complimentary research report before its gone for good. One of the stocks we featured last year has more than tripled since we launched this report.

Click here to apply now (Sponsor)\n\nJust how artificial intelligence technologies are rolled out and permeate our society is a whole different discussion. But it's clear that companies in all parts of the market are scrambling to add compute, as the key limitation to growth many companies are having right now is their ability to spend on AI chips.\n\nAs such, it should be no surprise to readers that I've picked two top chip-related companies benefiting from the AI revolution that are worth considering right now. These are companies that should have plenty of upside potential over the long-term, if the growth we've seen materialize in the world of AI can continue at a rate that's even close to where it is right now.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM)\n\nA leading semiconductor manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is among the top AI chip players for investors looking for a true picks and shovels way to play this space. Producing chips for the likes of Nvidia, Apple and AMD, Taiwan Semi remains an integral player in this high-growth space, and one investors may feel the need to own in order to maintain relatively broad exposure to the growth AI provides.\n\nIn my view, Taiwan Semi remains among the more undervalued names in this sector, with a price-earnings ratio of 25-times despite the company's roles as the cornerstone of the entire chip making world. Given the rather sharp decline in TSM stock since the start of the year, this is one particular name I think could be due for a nice reversion rally, as investors step back into companies with industry leadership in attractive areas of the market.\n\nDespite a 200% surge over five years, Taiwan Semi remains attractively valued and could catch a bid, particularly if the ongoing geopolitical issues that have plagued China/Taiwan relations simmer down. We'll have to see - nothing seems to be simmering down these days. But as the picture on tariffs and other key factors becomes clearer and more capital flows into Asian stocks, this is one name that could have meaningful upside if these trends continue.\n\nASML Holdings (ASML)\n\nASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML) is another top chip-related company I've long thought has a significant growth runway ahead.\n\nThe company's status as an effective monopoly in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography makes this Dutch company one worth considering. That's because EUV lithography is the process by which next-generation chips are produced. In other words, ASML makes the machines that make the chips that power our lives.\n\nAgain, this company is yet another picks-and-shovels play on the overall AI chip sector. With strong pricing power due to the company's monopoly status (and sky-high demand being seen by ASML's customer base), one can hope that this demand growth will bleed through to a larger backlog of EUV machines.\n\nSuch a situation hasn't really materialized of late, and there are actually some concerns brewing with some investors that backlog growth may actually be slowing. But with strong revenue growth of more than 16% in recent years, this is a company that's continuing to grow despite export curbs, tariffs and other headwinds the market has been pricing in over the past year. For those with a long enough investing time horizon, ASML stock looks like a decent pick here.",

            "content": "ASML is the world\u2019s undisputed leader in the design and provision of advanced chip-making equipment. The manufacture of the most state-of-the-art semiconductors by industry titans like TSMC, Intel, and Samsung is highly reliant on equipment from this Dutch firm, founded in 1984. However, like many household names in tech, ASML has quite a humble origin story. In ASML\u2019s case, company lore states that it all began in a \u201cleaky shed.\u201d\n\nThe current kings of the lithography machine world, ASML (Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography), started as a collaboration between Philips, a household name in the electronics business, and Advanced Semiconductor Materials International (ASMI). The vision was to set up a new company laser-focused on lithography systems, which the partners identified as a growing market.\n\nStanding on the shoulders of giants | ASML - YouTube Watch On\n\nASML\u2019s first base was the aforementioned leaky shed, and this isn\u2019t just a humorous name; it really leaked. The building was located on the former Philips campus in Eindhoven, Strijp-T. A photo of the ramshackle single-story prefab-style construction shows it is joined to the first floor of the Philips TQ building, home of the firm\u2019s \u2018Industrial Electronics\u2019 division.\n\nBuilding on R&D that had been in the pipeline since the early 1970s, ASML\u2019s first system, called the PAS 2000 stepper, was quickly realized by the team. According to the company's post, the shipping container visible on this side of the leaky shed was put there \u201cto keep everyone sane.\u201d Apparently, the PAS 2000\u2019s hydraulic oil pumps were so noisy the team was inspired to externalize them this way.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: ASML on LinkedIn) (Image credit: ASML on LinkedIn)\n\nThankfully for ASML and all the employees from the leaky shed, it wasn\u2019t long until the operation\u2019s business flourished, and the move to a purpose-built office and factory unit was possible in 1985. Another year later, the refined PAS 2500 came to market and would become the foundation for many future machines. Coincidentally, ASML\u2019s partnership with lens manufacturer Carl Zeiss was inked at this time and continues to this day.\n\nIn the 1990s, ASML says its \u201cbreakthrough platform,\u201d dubbed the PAS 5500, was launched. Off the back of this success, credited to the classic litho system\u2019s \u201cindustry-leading productivity and resolution,\u201d ASML enjoyed a successful IPO in both the Amsterdam and New York stock exchanges.\n\nThe first Twinscan machines with revolutionary dual-stage technology were launched in 2001. This same litho tool series stepped up a notch in 2010 with the introduction of the Twinscan NXE:3100, which leveraged EUV technology. Closer to the present day, ASML is again pushing the boundaries like no rival can with its EXE platform and High NA technology.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

            "content": "Given that it includes three of the 10 largest companies in the world by market capitalization, the semiconductor and chipmaking industry sets a lofty standard for what it means to be an average-sized firm. Similarly, \"small\" semiconductor companies, or at least those that are smaller than titans like NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA, might still be valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Nonetheless, because a few major players have dominated semiconductor news cycles in recent quarters, many of these other companies get overlooked.\n\nThree such firms, Arm Holdings plc NASDAQ: ARM, Lam Research Corp. NASDAQ: LRCX, and ASML Holding N.V. NASDAQ: ASML, have captivated analyst attention. While NVDA shares have fallen by about 15% year-to-date (YTD) as of March 18, 2025, shares of these other smaller firms have either dipped to a smaller degree or even climbed so far this year, helping them to further stand out for investors willing to look beyond the big names.\n\nGet ARM alerts: Sign Up\n\nWhy Now Might Be the Right Time to Buy Arm Stock\n\nARM Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$165.23\n\n38.76% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 27 Analyst Ratings Current Price $119.07 High Forecast $225.00 Average Forecast $165.23 Low Forecast $100.00 ARM Stock Forecast Details\n\nDriven by strong sales of its Armv9 AI architecture, Arm reported a record $983 million in total revenue for the most recent quarter, up 19% year-over-year (YOY). The firm also noted strong growth in royalty and licensing revenue as well, as its products continue to see high demand. What's more, Arm maintained an excellent gross margin of 98.1%, while its operating margin increased to 45% from 43.8% in the prior year period.\n\nArm has developed a reputation for processors that are highly energy efficient while remaining affordable. This combination is likely to be a key driver of continued sales, particularly as those within and outside of the AI industry seek ways to increase computing power while keeping costs and energy usage down.\n\nInvestors may long have shied away from investing in Arm, despite its compelling company profile within the AI space, because of its valuation. Now that shares have dropped by about 7% YTD in a sell-off period, though, the company is presenting investors with new opportunities to buy. To be sure, with a P/E ratio of 156.3, ARM shares are still valued quite high. However, analysts see more than 39% in upside potential as well.\n\nAnalysts See 27% Upside for Lam Research Stock\u2014Is It a Buy?\n\nLam Research Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$98.06\n\n26.45% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 23 Analyst Ratings Current Price $77.55 High Forecast $125.00 Average Forecast $98.06 Low Forecast $75.00 Lam Research Stock Forecast Details\n\nLam Research occupies a unique space in the semiconductor industry because it develops and supplies the equipment other companies use to build chips. It has become particularly well known for its equipment used in the production of NAND and DRAM memory products, both of which are in increasingly high demand for a wide variety of applications.\n\nThe largest share of Lam's revenue comes from China, where a number of competitors could threaten the company's dominance going forward. Still, Lam has a distinct advantage because of its strong cash reserves, which were about $5.7 billion as of the end of the December quarter. This allows it to invest heavily in R&D to develop cutting-edge tools like its recently announced atomic layer deposition product, ALTUS Halo.\n\nAs of March 18, 17 out of 22 analysts believe Lam has room to grow and have assigned it a Buy rating. The company's consensus price target is $98.22, with more than 27% upside potential.\n\nASML\u2019s Lithography Monopoly Gives It a Competitive Edge\n\nASML Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$937.00\n\n27.65% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 11 Analyst Ratings Current Price $734.06 High Forecast $1,100.00 Average Forecast $937.00 Low Forecast $767.00 ASML Stock Forecast Details\n\nAt a market cap of $286 billion, ASML is the largest firm on our list and another major player in the development of equipment used to build and service semiconductors. ASML's lithography equipment is unmatched across the industry, giving it what essentially amounts to a monopoly among high-end chipmaker clients. This may have played a role in ASML's share price increase of nearly 4% YTD, even amid a brief sell-off scare for some other major semiconductor firms.\n\nAnalysts see plenty of room for optimism in ASML's future, including more than 16% of projected earnings growth and nearly 29% upside potential based on a consensus price target of $937 per share.\n\nNine out of 11 analysts rated the company and assigned it a Buy. It is worth noting, however, that ASML recently missed on its estimated EPS, coming in at $7.30 when analysts had predicted $7.67. As always, some caution is advised despite the healthy support of analysts across Wall Street.\n\nBefore you consider ARM, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and ARM wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile ARM currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

Learn More\n\nIf you've seen the highlights from Nvidia's GTC conference this week, you may be feeling partially bullish about the semiconductor industry.\n\nFor those who haven't had a chance to check it out, Nvidia Founder and CEO Jensen Huang showcased the latest developments in artificial intelligence (AI). This included the latest in agentic and generative AI, as well as other exciting developments.\n\nSemiconductors, also known as semis or chips, are found in a wide range of products, including computers, smartphones and gaming hardware.\n\nAccording to Global X, the semiconductor industry is positioned for significant growth. The next generation of innovative technology, from large language models (LLMs) to robotics, will require semiconductors to power it.\n\n\n\nPwC expects global semiconductor revenues to grow twice the speed of global GDP, exceeding $1 trillion by 2030.\n\nNot just Nvidia\n\nWhile Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the poster child for AI, other companies within the AI ecosystem also offer compelling investments.\n\nFor example, ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ: ASML) manufactures lithography machines, which are fundamental to producing semiconductor chips. This is the most expensive step in the chip-making process, with machines going for north of US$200 million. ASML is essentially the only player in this field, meaning companies like Nvidia and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have no choice but to buy these machines to maintain their competitive position. This gives ASML incredible pricing power.\n\nASML's technology is also extremely capital intensive and complicated, and therefore difficult to replicate. This means their competitive position is rock solid.\n\nSemiconductor exposure in a single trade\n\nBullish on the semiconductor industry, but can't pick a winner?\n\nThe good news for ASX investors is that they don't have to. They can gain exposure to the semiconductor industry in a single trade without having to pick a winner.\n\nIn fact, the ASX-listed exchange-traded fund (ETF) Global X Semiconductor ETF (ASX: SEMI) could be one of the hottest ASX ETFs to own this decade.\n\nIt contains a basket of companies with exposure to the semiconductor industry. While it contains 30 holdings, it is relatively concentrated in its top five positions.\n\n\n\nAs of 28 February, 2025, these were:\n\n\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (9.7%)\n\nNvidia (9.5%)\n\nBroadcom (9.2%)\n\nASML Holding NV (9.2%)\n\nTexas Instruments (6.0%)\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, 64% of holdings are in the United States, 13% are based in Taiwan, and the remainder are dispersed around the world.\n\n\n\nWith SEMI down around 4% over the past month following a broad tech sector sell-off, ASX investors have the chance to buy it now on sale.\n\nSEMI has enjoyed strong capital growth over the past 5 years, climbing nearly 65%. This follows the AI phenomenon that has captivated investors over the past few years.\n\nASX investors can pick up this ETF for a management expense of 0.45%.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) stands against other stocks that may be splitting soon.\n\nStock splits change the number of outstanding shares of a company, but not the company\u2019s overall value. A forward split makes each share cheaper and easier to buy. Splits can range from 2-for-1 to 100-for-1 or more. In a 2-for-1 split, one share becomes two by cutting the price in half. For instance, a $100 share becomes two $50 shares. This makes shares more affordable and attracts more investors. Even though the price per share drops, the total value held by shareholders stays the same. So, splits don\u2019t change who controls the company. The main reason for a split is to make the stock more appealing, or accessible for retail investors.\n\nUncertainty is Driving Selloff\n\nDan Suzuki, Deputy CIO at Bernstein Advisors, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk on the Street\u2019 on March 14 to share his perspective on the recent persistent three-week downtrend in the indexes during an interview. He explained that the sell-off is largely driven by uncertainty and its negative impact on sentiment. According to Suzuki, analyzing market movements reveals that the stocks that rallied most after the election until mid-February have seen significant declines since then and create a mirror image effect. Additionally, the most expensive and high-beta stocks have been hit hardest as the market prices are in an uncertainty risk premium. These dynamics are central to what is driving markets currently. Despite this, Suzuki noted that hard economic data remains strong and suggests that relief from headline uncertainties could reduce the risk premium.\n\nSuzuki noted concerns over soft retail sales and spending figures, which might be due to weather or seasonal factors. However, he highlighted resilience in weekly retail sales and strong leading indicators. Prolonged uncertainty could still impact growth. Suzuki linked consumer trends to disappointing corporate guidance and persistently high inflation, which affected sentiment. He also pointed out the wealth effect caused by a stock market decline of 10% or more, particularly for investors in crowded names. Markets are adjusting to persistent uncertainty, which will continue even with relief anticipated within the next month or two, which will prevent a return to the high multiples seen in 2020-2023.\n\nIn an uncertain market with heightened risk premiums, companies considering stock splits may need to weigh the potential benefits against the backdrop of overall market sentiment. The ongoing economic uncertainty and changes in consumer behavior might impact how companies approach decisions about stock splits, especially if they are concerned about maintaining investor confidence in a volatile market.",

But it's clear that companies in all parts of the market are scrambling to add compute, as the key limitation to growth many companies are having right now is their ability to spend on AI chips.\n\nAs such, it should be no surprise to readers that I've picked two top chip-related companies benefiting from the AI revolution that are worth considering right now. These are companies that should have plenty of upside potential over the long-term, if the growth we've seen materialize in the world of AI can continue at a rate that's even close to where it is right now.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM)\n\nA leading semiconductor manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is among the top AI chip players for investors looking for a true picks and shovels way to play this space. Producing chips for the likes of Nvidia, Apple and AMD, Taiwan Semi remains an integral player in this high-growth space, and one investors may feel the need to own in order to maintain relatively broad exposure to the growth AI provides.\n\nIn my view, Taiwan Semi remains among the more undervalued names in this sector, with a price-earnings ratio of 25-times despite the company's roles as the cornerstone of the entire chip making world. Given the rather sharp decline in TSM stock since the start of the year, this is one particular name I think could be due for a nice reversion rally, as investors step back into companies with industry leadership in attractive areas of the market.\n\nDespite a 200% surge over five years, Taiwan Semi remains attractively valued and could catch a bid, particularly if the ongoing geopolitical issues that have plagued China/Taiwan relations simmer down. We'll have to see - nothing seems to be simmering down these days. But as the picture on tariffs and other key factors becomes clearer and more capital flows into Asian stocks, this is one name that could have meaningful upside if these trends continue.\n\nASML Holdings (ASML)\n\nASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML) is another top chip-related company I've long thought has a significant growth runway ahead.\n\nThe company's status as an effective monopoly in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography makes this Dutch company one worth considering. That's because EUV lithography is the process by which next-generation chips are produced. In other words, ASML makes the machines that make the chips that power our lives.\n\nAgain, this company is yet another picks-and-shovels play on the overall AI chip sector. With strong pricing power due to the company's monopoly status (and sky-high demand being seen by ASML's customer base), one can hope that this demand growth will bleed through to a larger backlog of EUV machines.\n\nSuch a situation hasn't really materialized of late, and there are actually some concerns brewing with some investors that backlog growth may actually be slowing. But with strong revenue growth of more than 16% in recent years, this is a company that's continuing to grow despite export curbs, tariffs and other headwinds the market has been pricing in over the past year. For those with a long enough investing time horizon, ASML stock looks like a decent pick here.",

For years, China has been denied access to the current lithography standard from market leader ASML. Rumor has it that Huawei has therefore built its own EUV equipment.\n\nTwinscan EXE:5000 is ASML's most advanced lithography machine, utilizing High-NA EUVL (High Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography) (Image: ASML)\n\nEUV lithography (Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography) is a state-of-the-art manufacturing technology for semiconductors that uses extreme ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 10 ft-lb. This allows for the creation of extremely fine structures on silicon wafers, which is crucial for producing modern chips in the 5 ft-lb, 4 ft-lb, and soon also in the 2 ft-lb or 1 ft-lb range. Without EUV, chip manufacturers would have to resort to complex multiple exposures, which are more expensive and prone to errors. Additionally, without EUV, it would be nearly impossible to technically produce advanced chips with high performance and density at these small structure sizes.\n\nSo far, EUV exposure machines come exclusively from the Dutch company ASML. Although there are efforts in China to develop their own systems, these are not yet market-ready. The extremely complex and expensive EUV exposure machines from ASML cost several hundred million dollars per unit in the High-NA-EUVL range.\n\nBring on the EUVL\n\nInterest in these apparatuses comes not only from major manufacturers in the USA, Taiwan, or South Korea\u2014namely Intel, TSMC, and Samsung\u2014but also from China. As one of the world's largest contract manufacturers and a leading company in the country, SMIC has been trying for several years to compensate for the technological disadvantage due to import restrictions on ASML's EUV equipment with its own developments in DUV multi-patterning (Deep Ultraviolet Lithography) to manufacture advanced structures without EUV technology.\n\nA breakthrough in the field of extreme ultraviolet lithography may have been achieved by the Chinese electronics giant Huawei, but caution: it is a rumor that currently cannot be definitively confirmed or refuted.\n\nEUV equipment from Huawei with tests in the second quarter of 2025\n\nThe following happened: On March 7 and 8, 2025, two users of the social platform X shared the same photo, reportedly of an interferometer of a Huawei EUV system. The interferometer is used for precise position measurement in chip manufacturing. One of the two sources claims:\n\n\"The EUV machine developed in China, which operates with laser discharge-induced plasma technology (LDP), is being tested at the Huawei facility in Dongguan. Test production is planned for the third quarter of 2025, with mass production for 2026.\" Additionally, on the side of the machine, translated from Chinese, according to eenewseurope, it reads \"EUV lithography objective and alignment interferometer. Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics (CIOMP).\" According to the source, the allegedly developed EUV machine is based on laser discharge-induced plasma technology (LDP), which, if true, would mean an alternative approach to light source development.\n\nLDP is a more cost-effective light source than the laser-produced plasma (LPP) used by ASML. LPP is more difficult to handle but generates higher plasma power, which corresponds to a higher wafer throughput in the lithography machine.\n\nA big step for Huawei?\n\nThe tests with the interferometer for positioning the lenses of the EUV machines suggest that Huawei has made a significant step towards advanced chip manufacturing. However, an EUV system consists of several large and complex components that need to be integrated and adjusted for effective yield, which can take months.\n\nEven if Huawei has developed its own EUV machine, building an entire ecosystem for pellicles, masks, and resists remains a significant challenge, as these are essential for efficient production. Therefore, the industry does not expect Huawei to catch up to other advanced chip manufacturers in the near future. However, in the long run, if this development is indeed accurate, it could mean that Chinese chip manufacturers would no longer be limited by import restrictions on essential manufacturing materials.

            "content": "U.S. markets have struggled with volatility as trade tensions and economic uncertainties persist. The Magnificent Seven tech stocks have lost momentum, and recent economic projections indicate a potential slowdown. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies continue to introduce unpredictability, prompting investors to seek alternatives. European stocks, offering lower valuations and higher dividend yields, have emerged as an attractive option against this backdrop. With the recent Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) showing the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing contraction easing to its mildest level in two years, investor confidence in the region has strengthened.\n\nAccording to CNBC, Eurozone inflation eased to 2.4% in February, aligning with expectations ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s upcoming policy decision. The euro also rebounded, rising nearly 1% against the dollar after earlier declines. Meanwhile, discussions around a \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment plan in Germany have fueled speculation about a broader fiscal expansion, further enhancing Europe\u2019s market appeal.\n\nA primary driver of Europe\u2019s market rally has been increased defense spending, as reported by World Economic Forum (WEF). Following a Ukraine peace summit hosted by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, European leaders pledged to boost military investments, propelling the broad measure of the European equity market up 1% and the aerospace and defense index by 6.5%. Germany\u2019s blue-chip index also climbed 0.9% amid reports of a potential defense fund.

However, their call impacted one of its own \u2013 Dutch semiconductor group ASML Holdings (ASML) whose stock dropped.\n\nDigital Sovereignty Boost\n\nIn the latest of a series of moves in Europe against the U.S. tech sector, the Dutch Parliament today passed motions urging the government to slash its reliance on software companies from across the Atlantic. The motions even included a proposal from politicians to establish a cloud services platform controlled by the Netherlands state to enhance its digital sovereignty. This would prioritize investment in and the development of a national digital framework that can support local businesses and protect data privacy.\n\nThe move to gain independence from Stars and Stripes software giants comes amid growing concerns over issues such as data sovereignty, technological dependence, and what has been seen by some European regulators as market abuse by the American tech titans.\n\nThis includes potential fines for Apple (AAPL) and MetaPlatforms (META) from the European Union for breaking the Digital Markets Act and market abuse claims against Alphabet (GOOGL) in Italy.\n\nImpact on ASML\n\nWhat the Parliament\u2019s move means for Dutch semiconductor group ASML (ASML) is unclear, although its shares were down nearly 1% today.\n\nASML is facing challenges on a number of fronts given President Trump\u2019s tariffs tirade. It supplies the necessary tools and materials used for the manufacturing of semiconductors and designs the machines that build microchips. Its three largest customers are thought to be TSM (TSMC), Intel (INTC) and Samsung Electronics.\n\nA Dutch crackdown on any element of U.S. tech could lead to an even more fulsome negative reaction from the Trump administration. Although, a reduction in perceived U.S. interference, which has included an attempt to restrict ASML\u2019s engineers from maintaining semiconductor equipment in China, could be welcome.\n\nIs ASML a Good Stock to Buy Now?\n\nOn TipRanks, ASML has a Moderate Buy consensus based on 5 Buy and 2 Hold ratings. Its highest price target is $1,100. ASML stock\u2019s consensus price target is $931.88 implying an 27.96% upside.\n\nSee more ASML analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "One of the most important decisions an investor can make is to choose the right stocks and keep them on the path to building wealth over the years. Understanding how to make these picks is paramount to financial sovereignty and success in the long run, which is why today\u2019s list is so important to keep in mind moving forward.\n\nThese companies would surprise most investors if they were not around a decade from now, as they have been ingrained into the way most consumers go about their everyday spending and activities. While change will always come, brands have more staying power, especially as they build customer loyalty through value add, quality delivery, and more.\n\nA few stocks fit these descriptions today, names like Ulta Beauty Inc. (NASDAQ: ULTA) in the retail sector, ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) as a pivotal player in the semiconductor branch of the technology sector, and even Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) coming in as one of the most entrenched digital economy names in the world. Here are some of the factors that make them a potential buy and keep for the next decade.\n\nLoyalty for Ulta\u2019s Brand Will Stick Around\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s financial reports, Ulta derives over 90% of its revenue from its membership program, meaning that customers are not only happy with the brand\u2019s service and value delivery but also willing to lock themselves in an indirect loyalty contract of only buying skincare and makeup products from Ulta.\n\nThis \u201cownership\u201d in the market allows Ulta to do a few things. First, management can leverage this market presence into a higher gross margin of 38.8%, which is leading across the retail industry as the company understands that loyalty in its industry translates to pricing power and good relationships with suppliers.\n\nThe second benefit is being able to more accurately predict future revenue, and this stability lets management not only retain but reinvest most of this capital in an efficient way, ending up in further growth and compounding for the company. Measuring this through a 27% return on invested capital (ROIC) gives investors a fast track to compound their wealth over the years through this return gauge.\n\nConsidering that the stock now trades at 66% of its 52-week high, it makes sense for some institutional buyers to come in and take advantage of the value proposition being made by Ulta\u2019s business setup, such as those from Deutsche Bank with a 1.4% boost in the stock as of February 2025 to bring them up to a stake worth of $285.1 million today.\n\nWall Street Analysts Bullish on ASML\u2019s Future Growth Potential\n\nASML holds one of the biggest monopolies in the semiconductor industry, yet most investors have no idea of how this company really operates today. This is the company that produces the only extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines that enable the production of today\u2019s most advanced chips.\n\nMost of the market thinks that NVIDIA Co. (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the most important piece of this puzzle, but in reality, there couldn\u2019t be an NVIDIA without ASML\u2019s machines, and likewise, there wouldn\u2019t be Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and other key players in the technology space.\n\nThe fact that the stock now trades at 65% of its 52-week high makes it a potential buy and keep for the coming decades, as such an important name in the global economy should never be trading that low in the first place. This is an opportunity being reiterated by Wall Street analysts today, as it is an easy win to boost reputations for being right.\n\nThose from JPMorgan Chase & Co. decided to reiterate their Overweight rating on ASML stock as of January 2025, this time keeping a valuation of up to $1,100 per share on the company as well. Compared to today\u2019s low price, this valuation would call for not only a new 52-week high in the stock but also an implied rally of as much as 50.6% from today.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Market Dominance: A Decade-Long Winning Stock\n\nWhether it is maps and navigation, internet searches, online streaming, or even digital advertising, Google is there to provide it all for consumers worldwide. This level of entrenchment in the everyday aspects of life across the economy has made Google one of the stocks to hold over the past decade.\n\nSpeaking on numbers, this level of scale and penetration in the marketplace allows Google to retain up to 58.2% of each revenue dollar that comes into the business.\n\nLike Ulta, management is able to reinvest most of this massive capital retainment and achieve up to 26.8% in ROIC to allow investors to compound their purchases in Google stock over the years. Investors have a chance to tap their portfolios into this theme at only 79% of the company\u2019s 52-week high, a fantastic entry point into this leader.\n\nBefore you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.\n\nOur team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.\n\nThey believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...\n\nSee The Five Stocks Here\n\nThe article \"3 Must-Own Stocks to Build Wealth This Decade\" first appeared on MarketBeat.",

Yet, it is in Veldhoven, a quiet Dutch town near the Belgian border, where the most consequential player in this global game resides: ASML Holding N.V..\n\nHome to just over 46,000 residents, Veldhoven has transformed from pastoral anonymity to the nerve centre of the semiconductor lithography industry. Towering above its windmills, ASML\u2019s \u20ac4 billion headquarters stands as a modern-day Brabantian Burj Khalifa, overseeing what is effectively a monopoly on extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV)\u2014the technology that enables the world\u2019s most advanced semiconductors. From Apple\u2019s iPhones to Nvidia\u2019s AI accelerators, ASML\u2019s machines are essential components in global supply chains underpinning the AI-powered digital economy.\n\nBut as China, Japan, and other nations ramp up domestic semiconductor efforts, an inevitable question arises: Can anyone crack ASML\u2019s grip on the lithography market?\n\nASML: Master of a Critical Chokepoint in Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nASML\u2019s dominance lies in its EUV lithography systems, highly sophisticated machines that etch complex circuitry onto silicon wafers using extreme ultraviolet light. EUV machines are so complex that each one costs upwards of \u20ac200 million and takes months to assemble, drawing on a supply chain of 5,000 suppliers (ASML Technology).\n\nThese machines are indispensable for producing chips with features smaller than 7 nanometres\u2014critical for the AI revolution, autonomous vehicles, and next-generation consumer electronics. With 44,000 employees globally, ASML commands a market share that no competitor has managed to erode.\n\nA Booming Market\u2014And a Strategic Position No One Can Ignore\n\nThe semiconductor market itself is surging. In 2023, global sales jumped 19% to $627 billion, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. The World Semiconductor Trade Statistics forecasts nearly $700 billion in sales for 2024, while Deloitte predicts revenues could hit $1 trillion by 2030.\n\nASML is positioned squarely at the centre of this explosive growth. In 2023, it reported record sales of \u20ac28 billion ($30.5 billion), a gross margin of 51%, and \u20ac7.6 billion ($8.3 billion) in net income (ASML Annual Report).\n\nGovernments and private sector players alike are investing hundreds of billions to onshore chip production and secure technological sovereignty:\n\nThe United States announced $280 billion through the CHIPS and Science Act to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nSouth Korea is investing $470 billion over 20 years to build a semiconductor cluster with Samsung and SK Hynix (Reuters).\n\nJapan has pledged $66 billion for semiconductor and AI development, with \u00a527 trillion yen earmarked for next-gen chip production (Nikkei Asia).\n\nThese monumental investments signal a secular demand for ASML\u2019s technologies.\n\nCracks Beneath the Surface: Market Volatility and Geopolitical Strains\n\nDespite ASML\u2019s unparalleled market position, it is not immune to geopolitical crosscurrents and cyclical demand pressures.\n\nIn October 2023, ASML\u2019s Q3 earnings triggered alarm bells when booked orders plunged to \u20ac2.6 billion ($2.8 billion), well below the \u20ac5.4 billion ($5.8 billion) forecast by analysts (Bloomberg). The result was a 16% share price crash, wiping out \u20ac48.7 billion ($53 billion) in market capitalisation\u2014the company\u2019s steepest one-day loss in two decades.\n\nEven after Q4 earnings beat expectations, with \u20ac7 billion ($7.6 billion) in new orders, ASML\u2019s stock has continued to drift downward, losing 7% over the past month (CNBC). Nevertheless, TD Cowen analysts reaffirmed their Buy rating, citing the 1.5 price/earnings-to-growth ratio, near its five-year low.\n\nChina: Racing Against Time for Lithography Autonomy\n\nOne of ASML\u2019s greatest geopolitical challenges remains China. Although ASML has never sold its EUV machines to China due to Dutch export restrictions\u2014recently tightened again in September 2023\u2014the company has significantly expanded sales of less advanced deep ultraviolet (DUV) equipment (Reuters).\n\nIn 2023, ASML\u2019s China revenue surged to \u20ac9 billion ($9.8 billion), up from \u20ac6.4 billion ($6.9 billion) the previous year (Bloomberg).\n\nMeanwhile, China is accelerating its homegrown lithography initiatives, spearheaded by Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE). Yet, SMEE\u2019s machines remain years behind ASML\u2019s EUV systems, with significantly lower overlay accuracy, limiting their capacity to produce chips under 14nm (South China Morning Post).\n\nThe Competitive Landscape: Nikon and Canon\u2019s Uphill Battle\n\nOutside China, Japan\u2019s Nikon and Canon are ASML\u2019s primary competitors in photolithography. Both have historical pedigree, but neither has made meaningful progress in EUV technology. Nikon, once a market leader, has seen its share shrink dramatically, and Canon has largely focused on legacy nodes and non-semiconductor lithography (Nikkei Asia).\n\nASML: Still the Most Critical Player in the Semiconductor Industry\n\nDespite cyclical headwinds and geopolitical pressures, ASML remains the indispensable enabler of the world\u2019s AI and digital future. Its technological moat in EUV lithography is fortified by decades of R&D investment, IP protection, and engineering expertise that are difficult, if not impossible, to replicate in the near term.\n\nFor nations and companies betting on AI, quantum computing, and next-generation technologies, ASML is the bottleneck\u2014and the gateway.\n\nConclusion: Who Will Challenge ASML?\n\nASML\u2019s dominance is not accidental; it is the result of sustained innovation and strategic alliances. While China and Japan race to develop alternatives, ASML continues to advance toward high-NA EUV systems, which promise even finer resolution and faster processing for 2nm nodes and below (ASML Technology Roadmap).\n\nFor now, no competitor is close. The question for investors and policymakers is not whether ASML will remain dominant, but how to manage global dependence on a single company at the heart of a strategic industry.",

            "content": "Despite the market sell-off centered around tech stocks, investors need to keep their focus on the long term. We're still in the early innings of the AI investment wave. We've barely scratched the surface of integrating AI into business and regular life, and there will be more development in this space over the next five years.\n\nAs a result, I think investors need to look at which stocks look like strong bargains, as the market is full of many opportunities to purchase the best AI stocks on sale.\n\nThe AI race is still in full swing\n\nI'm focusing on four companies that are key suppliers in the AI race: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 1.31%), ASML (ASML 2.36%), Nvidia (NVDA -1.50%), and Broadcom (AVGO -0.49%). These are critical companies and without them, the AI revolution wouldn't look the same.\n\nI'll start with Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), as all roads lead to it. Taiwan Semiconductor is the world's leading chip foundry, and clients like Broadcom and Nvidia come to it with chip designs that they want to have fabricated. Because TSMC has leading technology and a strong track record for innovation, it's the top option in this space, which gives it great insight into what trends are occurring in the chip industry.\n\nOver the next five years, Taiwan Semiconductor's management expects AI-related revenue to grow at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) pace. That's monster growth, but it makes sense in the grand scheme of things. TSMC expects its revenue compound annual growth rate to approach 20%, which is fantastic considering the company's size.\n\nThis massive demand is also why Taiwan Semiconductor announced an additional $100 billion investment, on top of the $65 billion it already committed, in building more facilities in the U.S. TSMC's management said the company is building where the demand is, and with its U.S. production facilities already selling out capacity through 2027, it's clear that the U.S. is a great place to build new factories.\n\nThis also boosts ASML, as ASML makes machines that every high-end chip fabricator needs. ASML's top machine is an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machine that helps lay the microscopic electrical traces on chips. Nobody in the world has ASML's technology, giving it a technological monopoly status. As a result, when TSMC announces capacity expansion, you should automatically think that ASML will benefit.\n\nNvidia and Broadcom are large customers of TSMC, and they are a large part of the reason it is projecting a massive increase in AI-related revenue growth. Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) that are incredibly useful for handling large and complex computing tasks like AI training. Nvidia has a strong grip on this market and shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nBroadcom has a similar product line, as it has helped some tech giants design custom AI accelerators called XPUs. XPUs can outperform GPUs in specific tasks, as a workload must be set up in a particular way to take full advantage of an XPU design. This makes them critical in developing AI models, but not the greatest at other workloads that GPUs can sometimes be assigned.\n\nThere's a massive market for both of these products, and although they will be competing for sales, there's a large enough market that both of them can thrive.\n\nAll four of these companies have incredibly strong tailwinds blowing in their favor, and it would take a lot to derail the AI investment movement in the industry. As a result, I think all of these companies will be just fine over the long term. But right now, each one looks like it can be purchased for a great price.\n\nAll the stocks are much cheaper than they've been over the past year\n\nBecause each company is growing so much, I'll focus on its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is a better measure of where a company is going.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is clearly the cheapest, at less than 20 times forward earnings, which is an unbelievable bargain. If you would make me choose one stock from this group of four, it would undoubtedly be TSMC.\n\nHowever, the price tags on ASML, Nvidia, and Broadcom are also much cheaper than they've been in the past, giving investors the green light to invest in some of these AI leaders.\n\nWhile these four could experience some more short-term pain, I have a hard time picturing a future in which they aren't significantly higher five years from now. I'm using today's weakness as an opportunity to scoop up these stocks for a great price.",

Everyone wants to know what\u2019s going to happen next and Williams believes he has answers.\n\nIn a YouTube video posted by StockCharts TV on Saturday, Williams explained that he sees a rally ahead because the market is undervalued, smart money has been buying and cycle data says it\u2019s time to buy.\n\n\u201cYou can have a good stock but if you don\u2019t buy it at the right time you can still have problems \u2026 right here right now is probably the right time,\u201d Williams said.\n\nSome stocks that he\u2019s watching include Tesla Inc TSLA, NVIDIA Corp NVDA, ASML Holding N.V. ASML and Apple Inc AAPL.\n\nSmart money has proven to be a strong predictor of Tesla\u2019s future stock performance based on Williams\u2019 charts. The trader noted that smart money stepped out of Tesla stock last year but money has started to flow back in as the stock has given back some of its gains.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at the conditions of this stock, I see what I like to see,\u201d Williams said, adding that it\u2019s undervalued, a bullish cycle should be coming and smart money is starting to buy the name.\n\nCheck This Out: S&P 500 Price Trend Flashes Warning Signals But This Expert Says \u2018Start Looking For A Buy Signal\u2019 After Last Week\u2019s Drawdown\n\nNvidia is another stock that fits the bill and could be poised to rip higher, according to Williams. The legendary trader said Nvidia shares just recently reached undervalued territory in his model. At the same time, smart money is starting to buy more aggressively.\n\nWilliams noted that the one thing he doesn\u2019t like on the Nvidia chart is that the stock recently made a lower low than it did in January. He offered ASML Holding as a potential alternative as it has held up better than Nvidia during the most recent selloff.\n\n\u201cThis was in stronger hands coming down than Nvidia was coming down. I like to buy stocks that have been in strong hands,\u201d Williams said.\n\nFinally, Williams highlighted Apple as potentially being ripe for a bounce. The stock is at a point where it\u2019s expected to rally based on seasonal patterns. Apple shares also held up comparatively better than the overall market during the most recent selloff, he said.\n\nIn order for any of these stocks to work, the overall market is going to need to recover. Williams believes the market is set to do just that if the Trump administration can put an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI think that is most likely going to be the trigger mechanism to see things like Apple start to move back to the upside,\u201d Williams said.\n\nPrice Action: At publication time, Tesla shares were down 5.95% at $235, Nvidia shares were down 1.7% at $119.59, ASML Holding shares were down 1.57% at $725.02 and Apple shares were down 1.28% at $210.75, per Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThis illustration was generated using artificial intelligence via Midjourney.",

At its high, Alphabet attained a valuation worth over $2.5 trillion. Now, it sits at $2 trillion. That's a huge amount of value erased from one of the world's top tech companies in just a few weeks. But was the sell-off justified for Alphabet?\n\nAlphabet is now the cheapest stock in the Magnificent Seven cohort by far, yet it has better finances than many of the others in that grouping. As a result, I think Alphabet is a solid buy here, but there is one thing investors need to look out for.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nAlphabet's advertising business is the bedrock of the company\n\nAlphabet is less recognizable as a brand of its own than it is for the companies that are under its umbrella -- Google, YouTube, and Android, among others. While that seems like a wide-ranging product lineup, the reality is that Alphabet's business is centered around one thing: Advertising.\n\nAlphabet derives about three-quarters of its revenue from ads, so it's critical that it stay on top of its game in this sector. Alphabet has done this by developing various generative AI tools based on its proprietary Gemini model, which is part of the reason why it's spending so much on AI infrastructure.\n\nFor 2025, Alphabet informed investors that they should expect around $75 billion in capital expenditures, which is by far the most money it has invested in the business.\n\nAnother reason Alphabet is spending so much is its need to build its cloud computing infrastructure. Cloud computing is a huge component of the AI arms race, as few companies want the upfront cost of buying a data center outfitted with best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs) and then maintaining it throughout its service life. they'd rather just rent the computing power and run workloads on the cloud.\n\nGoogle Cloud is a top-three player in this sector and Alphabet's fastest-growing business unit, with revenue rising 30% year over year in the fourth quarter. The cloud computing market is growing rapidly and is still in the early stages of its buildout.\n\nAlphabet's great balance between a steady bedrock business (advertising) and the upsides of AI and cloud computing makes for a fantastic investment story. However, there is one negative that must be considered.\n\nThe DOJ still wants Alphabet broken up\n\nWith all of Alphabet's success comes scrutiny, and the U.S. government has investigated it for a long time to understand if it was acting as an illegal monopoly. Former President Joe Biden's Department of Justice (DOJ) indicated that it wanted to break up Alphabet by forcing the sale of its Google Chrome browser. In a rare sign of agreement, President Donald Trump's DOJ has maintained that same opinion and will continue pushing for the breakup of Alphabet.\n\nThis is clearly a cause of concern for investors, but Alphabet will fight this action through the courts. Still, if Alphabet is broken up, it may be worth more as a separate business rather than one conglomerate, as Alphabet's stock looks dirt cheap right now.\n\nAt 18.6 times forward earnings, Alphabet is much cheaper than the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), which trades for 21.2 times forward earnings. Furthermore, it's the cheapest Magnificent Seven stock, with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) being the next cheapest in the cohort at 24.4 times forward earnings.\n\nThis shows how much pessimism is baked into Alphabet's stock, and I think that pessimism is why investors should swoop in and buy this dominant tech company for cheap. Although there are some concerns about how the company will look five years from now, it will take some time before a settlement is reached between Alphabet and the DOJ, giving it plenty of time to figure out a contingency plan.\n\nI think Alphabet is a top buy in today's market, and investors looking for a bargain in the latest sell-off should have Alphabet near the top of their lists.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

The study showed that 39% of fast-growing companies (those expecting greater than 15% growth over the next two years) consider trade compliance to be a competitive advantage and not only a regulatory requirement, compared to 22% of slower-growing companies (those with less than 5% growth expectations).\n\nFurthermore, 57% of companies surveyed believe technology is also very or extremely important for competitive advantage in trade compliance strategies (see Figure 1). This view is even more pronounced in growth businesses versus non-growth companies: 72%, or almost three quarters, of fast-growing companies believe technology is a valuable competitive differentiator, compared to just 41% of businesses predicting shrinking, limited, or no growth.\n\nFigure 1: Importance of technology for competitive advantage in trade compliance strategies\n\nSource: Descartes/SAPIO\n\nThe study also revealed that 86% of fast-growing companies indicated technology is fundamental or highly important to growth strategies. Underscoring a strong link between technology, business expansion and trade compliance, 47% of fast-growing companies confirm investing in technology is the top approach to tackling international trade challenges\u2014compared to just 18% of those expecting shrinking, limited, or no growth.\n\nIn addition to gaining competitive advantage by leveraging trade compliance and investing in technology, higher-growth companies are focused on building a well-resourced compliance team. The study found that companies with greater than 15% expected growth in the next two years allocate an average of eight people to trade compliance activities, compared to six people in companies anticipating shrinking, limited, or no growth.\n\n\u201cGiven the volatility of the current trade landscape, rife with evolving tariffs, trade barriers, sanctions and regulations, effective and efficient global trade compliance is a distinct competitive differentiator,\u201d said Jackson Wood, Director, Industry Strategy at Descartes. \u201cCompanies that invest in building their compliance teams view compliance as a strategic advantage. They leverage leading technologies to turn compliance into an engine for growth while creating more resilient supply chain operations.\u201d\n\nDescartes and SAPIO Research surveyed 887 corporate decision makers in international trade compliance and/or supply chain intelligence across Argentina, Benelux, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, UK and USA.

Almost every week, a new initiative appears in which companies and organizations call for investment, cooperation and government support. From a Tech Champions Manifesto to calls for investments and innovation agreements, the message is invariably the same: if we do not act now, Europe will inevitably fall behind. But how many of these calls will it take before something actually happens?\n\nDespite all these calls, structural financing for scale-ups remains a problem, there are hardly any new industrial policy measures, and the technology we need to keep Europe competitive is still mainly produced elsewhere. Last week, there was another example: the European chip sector is uniting under the Semicon Coalition. That's all well and good, but where is the real action?\n\nTrump and the F-35\n\nThis week's most-read articles were all about the shifting geopolitical landscape. What if the United States suddenly stops providing the software updates crucial to the operation of the F-35 fighter jets? Or even worse, what if a secret back door in the system allows others to access your military intentions? In a world where technology determines the battlefield, Europe's dependence on one country \u2013 the United States \u2013 is perhaps its greatest weakness.

            "content": "ASML (ASML) stock rose 4.3% Wednesday after the Dutch semiconductor equipment company posted better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings and its CEO dismissed concerns that DeepSeek's latest breakthrough would hurt demand for AI chips.\n\nASML invented the technology required to make the world\u2019s most advanced artificial intelligence chips and is the only manufacturer of the complex machines that use its EUV lithography technology. The latest version of those EUV machines costs nearly $400 million.\n\nASML sells its machines to chip manufacturers such as TSMC (TSM), which uses those machines to produce chips for Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and other tech heavyweights.\n\nThe Dutch firm on Wednesday reported earnings per share of 6.85 euros, ahead of the 6.68 euros expected, and its quarterly revenue of 9.2 billion euros topped the 9 billion euros forecast, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. The company reported taking orders of more than 7 billion euros worth of its tools in the fourth quarter, double the 3.5 billion euros expected. Half of that value came from orders of its EUV machines for AI chips, the company said in a call with analysts Wednesday.\n\nASML\u2019s 2025 first quarter sales forecast also surpassed expectations, with its guidance range of 7.5 billioneuros to 8 billion euros ahead of the 7.2 billion euros consensus estimate, per Bloomberg.\n\n\"Consistent with our view from the last quarter, the growth in artificial intelligence is the key driver for growth in our industry,\u201d CEO Christophe Fouquet said in a statement.\n\n\"It has created a shift in the market dynamics that is not benefiting all of our customers equally, which creates both opportunities and risks as reflected in our 2025 revenue range.\u201d\n\nASML\u2019s results were under more scrutiny than usual after its prior quarterly earnings came in far below expectations and sent its stocks \u2014 and those of other chipmakers \u2014 tumbling.\n\nShares have been under pressure in recent weeks amid announcements of more restrictive export controls from the Netherlands and the US, which seek to disrupt China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors.\n\nWhile ASML has never been permitted to export EUV lithography machines to China, its sales of other equipment to the region have surged in recent years. ASML\u2019s revenue from China rose to roughly 9 billion euros in 2024 from 6.4 billion euros the previous year, per Bloomberg data.\n\nFouquet said in the call with analysts that ASML's expectations for its China business haven't changed. The company already expected China sales to moderate in 2025 and beyond to represent around 20% of its total revenue. Still, the executive contended that geopolitics present risks that could push sales toward the lower end of its 2025 guidance.\n\nThe stock tumbled this week as news of a cost-effective artificial intelligence model from Chinese firm DeepSeek cast doubt on Western Big Tech companies' ultra-high spending on AI infrastructure, such as semiconductors made by ASML\u2019s machines.\n\nFouquet dismissed those concerns in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cA lower cost of AI could mean more applications,\" Fouquet said. \"More applications means more demand over time. We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand.\"\n\nCEO of Dutch tech giant ASML, Christophe Fouquet speaks during the presentation of the company's quarterly and annual results in Veldhoven on Jan. 29, 2025.

            "content": "Shareholders appeared unconcerned with ASML Holding N.V.'s (AMS:ASML) lackluster earnings report last week. We think that the softer headline numbers might be getting counterbalanced by some positive underlying factors.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for ASML Holding\n\nENXTAM:ASML Earnings and Revenue History March 13th 2025\n\nZooming In On ASML Holding's Earnings\n\nAs finance nerds would already know, the accrual ratio from cashflow is a key measure for assessing how well a company's free cash flow (FCF) matches its profit. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. The ratio shows us how much a company's profit exceeds its FCF.\n\nThat means a negative accrual ratio is a good thing, because it shows that the company is bringing in more free cash flow than its profit would suggest. While having an accrual ratio above zero is of little concern, we do think it's worth noting when a company has a relatively high accrual ratio. To quote a 2014 paper by Lewellen and Resutek, \"firms with higher accruals tend to be less profitable in the future\".\n\nOver the twelve months to December 2024, ASML Holding recorded an accrual ratio of -0.14. Therefore, its statutory earnings were quite a lot less than its free cashflow. In fact, it had free cash flow of \u20ac9.1b in the last year, which was a lot more than its statutory profit of \u20ac7.57b. ASML Holding shareholders are no doubt pleased that free cash flow improved over the last twelve months.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On ASML Holding's Profit Performance\n\nASML Holding's accrual ratio is solid, and indicates strong free cash flow, as we discussed, above. Because of this, we think ASML Holding's earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better! And the EPS is up 34% annually, over the last three years. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. If you want to do dive deeper into ASML Holding, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of ASML Holding.\n\nThis note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of ASML Holding's profit. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business. So you may wish to see this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with high insider ownership.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

            "content": "Bank of America Securities analyst Didier Scemama has reiterated their bullish stance on 0QB8 stock, giving a Buy rating on March 10.\n\nDidier Scemama has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors including ASML Holding NV\u2019s potential to meet its 2025 revenue guidance and its attractive valuation. Scemama notes that the midpoint of ASML\u2019s 2025 revenue guidance of \u20ac32.5 billion is achievable, with the company needing approximately \u20ac6.4 billion in DUV bookings, which aligns with their revenue estimates for China. Additionally, ASML\u2019s IBM revenues are expected to exceed company guidance, suggesting either higher EUV forecasts or overly conservative management guidance.\n\nFurthermore, Scemama highlights the increase in EUV unit shipments, which have been raised from 43 to 45, driven by stronger demand from TSMC. Despite expected declines in China revenues due to export control restrictions, ASML\u2019s overall valuation remains attractive at 20 times the FY25E EV/EBITDA, which is a discount compared to its five-year historical multiple of 26.3 times. These factors collectively support the Buy rating with a price objective of \u20ac859.\n\nAccording to TipRanks, Scemama is an analyst with an average return of -6.1% and a 34.62% success rate. Scemama covers the Technology sector, focusing on stocks such as Logitech, STMicroelectronics, and ASML Holding.\n\nIn another report released on March 10, Kepler Capital also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a \u20ac950.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "ASML and Imec have decided to get cosy for the next five years, ensuring that the Belgian research lab gets a High-NA EUV lithography machine.\n\nThe unholy alliance is all about cracking sub-2nm process technology, a feat that requires the most ludicrously expensive kit money can buy.\n\nImec will ensure that engineers from academia and various companies have the latest equipment for their research, while ASML will ensure its tools are incorporated into leading-edge process technologies.\n\nUnder the deal, Imec will be rolling out the red carpet for ASML\u2019s Twinscan NXT (DUV), Twinscan NXE (Low-NA EUV with a 0.33 numerical aperture), and the Twinscan EXE (High-NA EUV with a 0.55 numerical aperture) and YieldStar metrology wizardry and some HMI inspection gear.\n\nAll this gear will find a new home in Imec\u2019s Belgian pilot line, which the EU and the deep pockets of the Flemish government bankroll. The goal is to push semiconductor production below 2nm, a threshold that demands lithography tools capable of an 8nm resolution in a single pass.\n\nOnly ASML\u2019s high-NA EUV machines can pull off that trick, but at a wallet-crushing $350 million apiece finding a startup with that kind of spare change is tricky.\n\nUntil now, Imec boffins had to pop over to ASML\u2019s Veldhoven lab to play with High-NA EUV gear, but this new agreement means they\u2019ll have their own multi-million-dollar toys to tinker with in Leuven. This should dramatically speed up research.\n\nThe deal is part of the Next Gen-7A project (IPCEI22201) and has been rubber-stamped by the Dutch government as a vital piece of the EU\u2019s tech sovereignty ambitions.

            "content": "Source The Motley Fool\n\nMany growth-oriented investors flock to the tech sector in search of the next millionaire-maker stocks. But for a stock to churn $10,000 in $1 million, it would need to deliver a 100-bagger gain. Most hot stocks will fail to achieve those kind of life-changing gains, even if they consistently stay ahead of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.\n\nIt's tough to predict which tech stocks will be the next to generate millionaire-making gains. But to see what qualities those candidates might share, we should look back at three tech stocks that minted millionaires over the past few decades: ASML (NASDAQ: ASML), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nASML\n\nASML is the world's top producer of lithography systems, which are used to optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. All of the world's top foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) and Samsung, use its systems to manufacture their chips.\n\nASML, which is based in the Netherlands, listed its American depositary receipts in the U.S. on March 15, 1995. A $10,000 investment in its IPO would be worth about $4.04 million today and paying out nearly $43,300 in annual dividends.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2024, ASML's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16%. During those three decades, it pulled far ahead of its smaller competitors as the world's largest producer of deep ultraviolet systems. It also became the only producer of high-end extreme ultraviolet systems, which are required to manufacture the world's smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips.\n\nASML's monopolization of that crucial market made it a linchpin of the semiconductor market. It faces some near-term challenges from tighter export curbs against China and tariffs, but it still has plenty of room to grow over the next few decades.\n\nBroadcom\n\nBroadcom, which was known as Avago until it acquired the original Broadcom and inherited its brand in 2016, is another millionaire-maker semiconductor stock. A $10,000 investment in Avago when it went public on Aug. 6, 2009, would be worth $1.23 million today and generating about $16,300 in annual dividends as the \"new\" Broadcom.\n\nAvago's takeover of the original Broadcom made it one of the world's largest producers of chips for the mobile device, data center, networking, wireless, storage, and industrial chip markets. But after that acquisition and rebranding, Broadcom expanded into the infrastructure software market by acquiring CA Technologies in 2018, Symantec's enterprise security division in 2019, and the cloud software giant VMware in 2023.\n\nThose acquisitions transformed Broadcom into a diversified tech company, and its annual revenue grew at a CAGR of 27% from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2024, which ended in November 2024. That rapid expansion indicated that its bold inorganic growth strategies were paying off. Broadcom is also well exposed to the booming AI market: Its sales of networking, optical, and custom accelerator chips for AI-oriented data centers more than tripled in fiscal 2024 and accounted for 24% of its top line.\n\nAmazon\n\nWhen Amazon went public on May 15, 1997, many investors were skeptical of the e-commerce company's future. It was still deeply unprofitable and it faced tough competition across a fragmented market. However, investors who took a chance on Amazon with a $10,000 investment in its divisive IPO would be sitting on a whopping $25.87 million today.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2024, Amazon's revenue grew at a CAGR of 36%. That growth was driven by the rapid expansion of its e-commerce marketplace in the U.S. and international markets, the stickiness of its Prime memberships, and the robust growth of its cloud infrastructure platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The expansion of AWS's higher-margin business offset the lower margin of its e-commerce business, and its profit soared.\n\nToday, Amazon owns the world's largest e-commerce and cloud infrastructure platforms, and its scale keeps it far ahead of its competitors in both markets. It's still expanding its e-commerce ecosystem with more hardware devices and media services, and it's locking in its cloud customers with a growing number of analytics tools and AI services. Those core growth engines could generate healthy returns for its investors for decades to come.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it\u2019s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nNvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you\u2019d have $277,401 !*\n\nif you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, !* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you\u2019d have $43,128 !*\n\nif you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, !* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you\u2019d have $467,393!*\n\nRight now, we\u2019re issuing \u201cDouble Down\u201d alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nContinue \u00bb\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of March 10, 2025\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

It signals our joint ambitions to develop solutions for the semiconductor industry and fits our strategy of investing in technology and innovation that will benefit society at large,\u201d said ASML\u2019s president and CEO Christophe Fouquet.\n\nLuc Van den hove, president and CEO at Imec, added: \u201cThe inclusion of ASML\u2019s full product portfolio will allow us to expand and further mature the capabilities of our pilot line, providing the entire semiconductor ecosystem with the most advanced R&D to tackle the challenges of AI-driven technological advancements.\u201d\n\nThe NanoIC pilot line is not the first time Belgian R&D company Imec and Netherlands-based semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML have worked together.\n\nThe two companies operate a joint lab in Veldhoven, the Dutch city where ASML is headquartered, and in June 2024, the two companies announced plans to open the lab up to customers. The facility has seen a number of chip making breakthroughs, including the successful printing of circuit patterns for logic chips with 9.5nm dense metal lines, corresponding to a 19nm pitch and achieving sub-20 nm tip-to-tip dimensions.",

In 2023, both parties made a declaration of intent for this. \u201cThis agreement is a formalization of that memorandum,\u201d ASML spokesman Marc Assinck told De Tijd.\n\nThe research institute will develop a pilot line with the High NA EUV machines. On that line, research can be conducted on new chips. The primary objectives are to improve and make the production process more sustainable.\n\nHigh NA EUV machines\n\nIntel is the first customer to have purchased the latest chip machines. Each device costs around 350 million euros. The company recently announced that 30,000 wafers were produced on these machines in one quarter. The company is particularly positive about the machines in that they produce smaller chips at a higher rate. Productivity is said to be at 200 wafers per hour. Also, printing with beams of light requires less illumination than in previous generations of machines.\n\nTip! Newest ASML machine at Intel is ready to go, with plenty of R&D ahead\n\nEuropean strength\n\nSubstantial investments have already been made in the Flemish test line from the Chips Act. A total of 2.5 billion euros is involved, of which Europe and Flanders have put in 1.1 billion euros. To accommodate the developments, it appears that Imec\u2019s current building is becoming too cramped. Therefore, Imec will expand by 10,000 square meters.",

The move is focused on sub-2nm process technologies that will require ASML's latest lithography (including High-NA), metrology, and inspection tools. Imec will ensure that engineers from academia and various companies have the latest equipment for their research, whereas ASML will ensure that its tools are incorporated into leading-edge process technologies.\n\nUnder the partnership, Imec will gain access to ASML's comprehensive range of advanced wafer fabricating equipment (WFE), including range-topping Twinscan NXT (DUV), Twinscan NXE (Low-NA EUV tools with a 0.33 numerical aperture optics), and Twinscan EXE (High-NA EUV tools with a 0.55 numerical aperture optics) lithography systems. Additionally, imec will incorporate ASML's YieldStar optical metrology solutions and HMI\u2019s single- and multi-beam inspection tools into its facilities.\n\nThese tools will be installed in Imec's pilot line in Belgium and incorporated in the EU- and Flemish-funded NanoIC pilot line.\n\nThe latest-generation of equipment from ASML will be used to develop next-generation semiconductor production technologies, particularly sub-2nm fabrication technologies. It is believed that for efficient manufacturing at fabrication nodes below 2nm, lithography tools must support an 8nm resolution with a single exposure, something that only High-NA EUV tools can achieve. However, each High-NA EUV system costs $350 million, which makes it impossible for new players or researchers to obtain one.\n\n(Image credit: Imec)\n\nASML and Imec researchers previously worked with High-NA (0.55 NA EUV) tools primarily at ASML\u2019s dedicated research facilities in Veldhoven, Netherlands. ASML installed these first-generation High-NA EUV machines at its own sites for initial tests, evaluations, and collaborative research with Imec and other partners.\n\nNow, under the new agreement, Imec will have direct, on-site access to High-NA equipment within its own research lines in Leuven, Belgium, specifically in its state-of-the-art pilot facility and the EU- and Flemish-funded NanoIC pilot line. This marks the first time Imec researchers can use the High-NA EUV technology directly at their own facility, which will speed up their work.\n\nProviding Imec with access to the High-NA EUV technology was included in the Next Gen-7A project (IPCEI22201) and financed by the Dutch government as an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI).\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Since Imec has a strong focus on sustainable innovation, having this explicitly included in our partnership is a great addition.\"\n\nIn addition to working collaboratively on next-generation sub-2nm nodes for logic chips, ASML and Imec plan to collaborate on DRAM process technologies, silicon photonics, and advanced packaging solutions.",

Meanwhile further fab locations, mainly in China, were added to the export blacklist.\n\nIn retaliation, Beijing kicked off an investigation in January to decide if US subsidies to chipmakers are harming its semiconductor companies and amount to unreasonable trade practices.\n\nThis was days before President Donald Trump's administration - which itself isn't keen on the CHIPs Act - took over in Washington and introduced a further hardening of its stance on China, hiking tariffs on goods imported from the country by an extra ten percent.\n\nASML is currently the world's only supplier of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photolithography equipment, used in the making of advanced chips with smaller features to cram in more circuitry. Export of these products to China was blocked by the Dutch government several years ago.\n\nFresh reports from China now suggest local researchers may have found a way to produce light at a 13.5 nm wavelength \u2013 the same in ASML's EUV kit \u2013 and are working to produce homegrown tech to sidestep the export ban.\n\nAccording to TechPowerUp, Chinese megacorp Huawei is testing the system at a facility in the city of Dongguan, with trial production runs scheduled from September, and mass manufacturing targeted for 2026. It is said to use a technique called laser-induced discharge plasma (LDP), claimed to be simpler and less costly than ASML's laser-produced plasma (LPP) technology.\n\n$373M ASML chipmaker shrinks to $228 \u2013 but it's made of Lego READ MORE\n\nHuawei has previously caught the US off-guard by introducing a smartphone using a homegrown 7nm processor, technology it was not believed capable of producing.\n\nThe Register asked Huawei to comment but it decliend the invitation. ASML had not responded at the time of publication.\n\nIn contrast to ASML, IBM shuttered its Chinese research and development operations at the start of March.\n\nBig Blue signalled last year that it intended to close its China Development Lab and China Systems Lab after 32 years of operations, due to fractious relations between Washington and Beijing.\n\nIt was also reported at the time that the closure was blamed on competition from China's state-subsidized rivals, and that IBM was shifting R&D work outside the country. It is believed to impact more than 1,800 staff.\n\nIn other chip news, the Office of the US Trade Representative has announced a public hearing this week for an investigation into claims of China \"targeting of the semiconductor industry for dominance.\"\n\nThis refers to China ramping up production of so-called mature nodes \u2013 manufacturing processes that are no longer at the cutting edge but still used to make chips for a wide variety of applications including automotive, industrial, and consumer products.\n\nThe European Commission is similarly concerned that China could flood the global market with cheap chips, undercutting Western manufacturers and pushing them out \u00ae.\n\nUpdated to add on March 11\n\nDespite describing its plans as opening \"a new\" Reuse & Repair Center in Beijing \"in 2025\" in its annual report, ASML got in touch with The Reg to say that the \"new\" center was \"an upgrade to our existing repair center,\" and replaced an older unit. It has many such repair centers all over the world.\n\nIt added that all its business in China, including the repair center, is \"compliant with applicable export control rules and laws.\"",

Therefore, today's fears over a tariff-induced recession is causing a big sell-off.\n\nIn addition, tariffs that increase trade tensions with China tend to especially complicate things for semiconductor stocks. This is because China is a big purchaser of chips, and its government is also investing heavily in domestic chipmaking alternatives, including homegrown semiconductor equipment stocks.\n\nOn that note, there was also a report today that China is developing an alternative to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology. That may have hit ASML especially, which currently has a monopoly on EUV and dominates lithography technology generally.\n\nRecession fears, China tensions aren't a good recipe for semi stocks\n\nOver the weekend, President Trump gave an interview to Fox News' Maria Bartiromo. Bartiromo asked Trump if he predicted a recession as a consequence of the tariffs his administration has implemented, and the additional tariffs it's still considering.\n\nAfter the past few weeks' turmoil, investors were likely hoping for reassurance. Instead, Trump wouldn't say whether a recession would occur, nor did he give any reassurance he would change his tariff stance should such a slowdown occur, saying:\n\nI hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We are bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing. And there are always periods of -- it takes a little time.\n\nThose comments hit basically all economically sensitive stocks, which includes tech stocks, and especially semiconductor and other hardware stocks.\n\nIn addition, tariffs on China can doubly affect semiconductor stocks. This is because China is a huge buyer of chips, and its government is feverishly investing to develop more homegrown semiconductors. Therefore, restrictions on selling equipment to China, or greater restrictions on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and memory chips, could lead China to blacklist U.S.-made semiconductors in retaliation.\n\nNow, for some semiconductor categories, there aren't really alternatives to U.S.-designed semiconductors today. But for others, China could increasingly look to domestic alternatives, or potentially alternatives that are made in Europe or South Korea.\n\nThe biggest hurdle to China producing more semiconductors is in the semiconductor equipment space, which is still dominated by these three stocks and their peers. Advanced chip manufacturing is extremely technologically complex. Therefore, China has not been able to make much headway in the semiconductor equipment space.\n\nBut that doesn't mean China isn't trying. According to Trendforce, China has increased its usage of domestic chipmaking tools to 13.6% last year. While most of that is on trailing nodes, China is also trying to crack the code of more challenging leading-edge chipmaking, too.\n\nOn that note, on Monday, TechPowerUp reported that China is about to unveil its own alternative to ASML's EUV technology later this year. According to the publication, researchers in China have developed laser-induced discharge plasma (LDP) technology, an alternative to producing 13.5nm light. That's the wavelength of ASML's low-NA EUV machines, which are banned in China and critical to producing leading-edge semiconductors below 7nm.\n\nThis new LDP technology had been reported on in the South China Post back in January. But TechPowerUp is an international publication, and its reporting that China's LDP technology will go to trial production in the third quarter could indicate China is getting closer to having the ability to make its own advanced chips.\n\nWhere to go from here\n\nGoing back to 2018, semiconductor stocks plunged on similar trade war and macroeconomic fears during a chaotic period in the first Trump administration. That proved to be a terrific long-term buying opportunity for semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks.\n\nMoreover, while China's LDP technology is certainly worth monitoring, it's far from clear that it will be able to mimic the capabilities of EUV, especially in a production setting. ASML's EUV technology took nearly 20 years of development before it produced its first commercial chip in a production setting. So, color this investor skeptical that China's LDP technology is on the verge of being a viable lithography competitor anytime soon.\n\nOf course, these stocks aren't quite as cheap as they were back at the 2018 bottom. Nevertheless, that was also before cloud computing, work-from-home, and the AI revolutions took off in a big way. All these megatrends should act as a tailwind to chip and chip equipment stocks going forward.\n\nWhile it's hard to say how the cloudy macroeconomic picture may affect these stocks in the near term, these harsh sell-offs in semiconductor industry leaders tend to be buying opportunities. If I had to bet, I'd say this is likely to be a similar opportunity, rather than the beginning of the end.",

            "content": "A new ASML facility in Beijing is intended to make existing chip manufacturing equipment more easily reusable for Chinese customers. However, those same customers could turn to Huawei as early as next year to get their EUV machine fix, as the Chinese giant hopes to break the ASML monopoly on the frontier of lithography for the first time.\n\nThe plans for expansion in China are found in ASML\u2019s annual report, as The Register writes. It is a striking turn of events, given that export restrictions from both the Netherlands and the U.S. have only gotten tighter in recent years. Nevertheless, ASML would still like to serve the highly lucrative Chinese market, and even better than it has before. It aims to use its new Beijing facility for maintenance and refurbishment, avoiding costly replacements.\n\nReplacement and refurbishment\n\nReplacing and refurbishing ASML machines is a familiar approach of the Dutch chip machine maker. Similarly, the brand-new, state-of-the-art High-NA EUV lithography machines consist of 10 discrete modules, each separately upgradeable and replaceable. Thus test units, intended for the initial exploration for new chip production techniques, can be gradually transformed to be suitable for mass production. Customers such as TSMC and Intel thus will not have to make their initially shipped High-NA EUV devices a write-off anytime soon. And that would be a major benefit, as each unit costs around 350 million euros.\n\nHowever, the newly revealed Chinese maintenance facility would only work on machines based on DUV (deep ultraviolet) light. The deployment of EUV (extreme ultraviolet) light has proven considerably more difficult than DUV owing to it being more advanced and complex, which has resulted in the pair of Japanese ASML competitors Nikon and Canon to have never made the move to this side of the light spectrum for their chip equipment.\n\nHuawei steps up\n\nNow it appears Huawei does plan to join ASML in this EUV spectrum. This weekend, it was revealed that the Chinese company has developed a device in this category and is currently readying it for mass production in 2026. Utilizing a process called laser-induced discharge plasma (LDP) technology, Huawei may even be able to undercut its western rival. Despite consuming less energy than ASML\u2019s laser-produced plasma (LPP) technology, this methodology is equally capable of creating 13.5 nanometers of EUV radiation. This feat is required to perform this kind of lithography.\n\nBy the way, Canon was already a potential rival to ASML, but not specifically for EUV lithography. With nanoimprint (NIL) machinery, it hopes to make a stab at chip processes that are more advanced than what\u2019s possible with DUV, but without the exorbitant costs associated with EUV. As with Huawei, practical proof is yet to come to make the underlying technology an ASML alternative.\n\nLimit reached?\n\nThe breakthrough, if more than a promise, would be a major setback for ASML. With a monopoly in the EUV spectrum, customers have no other option if they wish to compete for the world\u2019s most advanced chips. It would also disprove a prediction made by ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet within just a few months. Indeed, he stated in December that China\u2019s semiconductor industry is some 10 to 15 years behind the West (read: ASML).\n\nAnother prediction, made by then-CEO Peter Wennink, may yet come true. He has always vehemently opposed export restrictions against China, which he said would motivate the nation to make it to EUV lithography on its own. It\u2019s certainly motivated now.\n\nTo emphasize the need for this innovation: local Chinese chipmakers such as SMIC already seem to have reached the limits of DUV technology, a development direction to which they are condemned by the aforementioned export restrictions. It\u2019s a similar problem Intel ran into between 2015 and 2023, when it operated without EUV machines whereas its rival foundry TSMC did. EUV chip machines are simply breaking through natural limits that chip makers can\u2019t avoid with DUV, which does not contain the precision required for the latest chip manufacturing processes, or nodes.\n\nConclusion (for now): not a DeepSeek moment\n\nAt the end of the day, Huawei must first prove that it is seriously entering EUV-based chip production in 2026. A \u201cDeepSeek moment\u201d has yet to transpire. Until a chip is produced that can compete with the state-of-the-art from ASML equipment, the export restrictions have clearly limited China\u2019s reach. With the Huawei Kirin 9000S processor, which seemed seemingly impossible to manufacture with DUV machines, it seems that SMIC otherwise had accepted unacceptably low yields (yields) to produce such an advanced chip on the old equipment. At scale, such low yields are simply not maintainable with ASML\u2019s EUV approach. Only if the efficiency gains from Huawei\u2019s LDP technology for EUV may offset any low yields initially. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if this claim also pops up in about 18 months\u2019 time.\n\nAlso read: ASML: from a leaky shed to the chip industry\u2019s key player",

It is not an addition, it replaces the older repair center.\u201d\n\nIn addition to mainland China, ASML also has repair centers in South Korea and Taiwan in Asia; Wilton, Connecticut, San Diego, California, and Vancouver, Washington State, in the US; and Veldhoven in the Netherlands.\n\nASML is the sole global supplier of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) photolithography machines that are needed to make the most advanced 3nm and 5nm chips. Based in the Eindhoven suburb of Veldhoven, the company has been at the center of the US government\u2019s ongoing trade war with China, with the Dutch government increasingly succumbing to pressure from the Biden administration to block exports of ASML products to China.\n\nThe company has previously been banned from selling its most advanced equipment to China, and then in January 2024, had an export license revoked to stop the shipment of two older lithography machines to Chinese customers.\n\nThe US government claims this is to stop China from developing advanced AI systems and to prevent it from having access to technology that could be used for military modernization and human rights abuses however, former ASML CEO Peter Wennink argued in 2024 that the export restrictions are largely ideologically driven rather than based on facts.\n\nASML had been operating in China for 30 years and Chinese companies bought 36 percent of ASML's lithography systems sold in 2024, generating around $10.9bn in revenue for the company in FY24.\n\nIn its annual report, ASML said it aims to have \u201czero waste from our operations to landfill and incineration by 2030,\u201d adding that it contributes to the circular economy by \u201cmaintaining, repairing, upgrading, refurbishing, remanufacturing, repurposing and/or recycling our systems, parts, packaging, assets and non-product related goods.\u201d\n\nIn January 2025, the company reported that it had sold 38 refurbished systems in 2024, a ten-unit increase on 2023, and to date, has refurbished and resold over 500 lithography systems.\n\nAccording to the annual report, 95 percent of systems sold by ASML in the past 30 years are still active in the field.",

This suggests potential value for long-term investors looking for growth opportunities in the semiconductor field.\n\nASML's robust financial health is underscored by an Altman Z-score of 7.09, indicating strong financial stability. Furthermore, the company's interest coverage ratio stands at a comfortable 710.44, highlighting its ability to meet interest obligations with ease. The company's dividend yield is currently close to its one-year high, making it an attractive option for income-focused investors.\n\nValuation metrics show that ASML is modestly undervalued with a GF Value estimation of GF Value $838.93, reflecting growth potential despite current market challenges. The company also demonstrates efficient cash flow management, with a free cash flow yield of 3.55%. This, combined with an expanding operating margin, reinforces ASML's position as a key player in the industry.\n\nGiven the ongoing trade tensions and technological advancements from competitors such as China, ASML faces certain risks; however, its leadership in EUV technology and strong financial metrics provide a solid foundation to navigate future challenges. Investors may view the current price dip as a buying opportunity, considering the company's long-term growth prospects and strategic importance in the semiconductor landscape.",

            "content": "The use of DUV equipment has greatly impacted the progress of China\u2019s largest semiconductor firm, SMIC. Even though the latter was previously said to have successfully produced its 5nm wafer, mass production continues to suffer from inflated costs and low yields. These setbacks also negatively affect Huawei, which has been unable to cross the 7nm threshold.\n\nSadly, with ASML barred by U.S. trade sanctions from providing any Chinese entity with \u2018state-of-the-art\u2019 EUV machinery, the only possible route for the country\u2019s experts is to produce in-house equipment. According to the latest report, those ambitions are laid out in black and white, with trial production expected to commence in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nThese custom EUV machines are said to employ laser-induced discharge plasma (LDP), which is slightly different from ASML\u2019s laser-produced plasma (LPP). Below, we discuss the impact this technological variation will bring to the table.\n\nActual mass production of China\u2019s homegrown EUV machinery could commence in 2026, with the new approach introducing a simpler design that is also more power-efficient\n\nThe full-scale production of these EUV machines is exactly the arsenal that China requires to not just obtain dependency from companies under the influence of the U.S. but also to acquire a competitive advantage. Images shared by X accounts @zephyr_z9 and @Ma_WuKong indicate that a new system is being tested at Huawei\u2019s Dongguan facility. A previous report mentioned that a research team from Harbin Provincial Innovation developed a discharge plasma extreme ultraviolet lithography light source.\n\nThis source could produce EUV lights with a 13.5nm wavelength, which meets the demands of the photolithography market. Under the new system currently being trialed at one of Huawei\u2019s facilities, LDP is used to generate 13.5nm EUV radiation. This process involves vaporizing the tin between electrodes and converting it to plasma through high-voltage discharge, with electron-ion collisions producing the required wavelength. How is this approach different from ASML\u2019s LPP?\n\nThe Dutch-based giant relies on high-energy lasers and complex Field Programmable Gate Array-based controls. Based on the trial production report, the prototype under testing at the Huawei facility leveraging the laser-induced discharge plasma is said to feature a simpler and smaller design while also consuming less power and costing less to manufacture. Before these tests commenced, China and SMIC continued to rely on older DUV machinery.\n\nThe earlier-generation lithography systems use 248nm and 193nm wavelengths, which are significantly inferior compared to EUV\u2019s 13.5nm radiation. SMIC would have to rely on attaining multiple patterning steps to obtain advanced nodes, which not only increased wafer production costs but was a time-consuming process that resulted in a massive bill. It was estimated that SMIC\u2019s 5nm chips would be 50 percent more expensive than TSMC\u2019s when produced on the same lithography, which would explain why the technology has yet to debut in any application.\n\nHuawei is currently limited to developing its Kirin chipsets on the 7nm process, with the former Chinese giant limited to making minor tweaks to make its successive SoCs slightly more capable than their immediate predecessors. With this development, Huawei can significantly bridge the gap between the likes of Qualcomm and Apple, but we have noticed a pattern where such firms experience more roadblocks than a healthy progression. Hopefully, both Huawei and China will overcome these odds and deliver much-needed competition.",

            "content": "China has become the world\u2019s No.1 country in publishing semiconductor-related papers, more than the following three ranked countries combined, according to a report published by the Emerging Technology Observatory (ETO) at Georgetown University.\n\nThe ETO report said that from 2018 to 2023, Chinese scholars published 160,852 academic articles, more than the US (71,688), India (39,709), Japan (30,401), and South Korea (28,345). Regarding the number of citations per article, the US achieved 17.6, compared with China\u2019s 14.8.\n\nAll the top 10 research organisations were based in China, except France\u2019s Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, which ranked No.3.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2023, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) published 14,387 chip-related articles, followed by the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (7,849), the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (5,446), and the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (5,237).\n\nHowever, China only ranked fifth globally regarding the number of papers published by chip makers.\n\nSamsung published 1,940 articles from 2018 to 2023, followed by STMicroelectronics (1,070), Intel (951), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (TSMC, 611) and China Electronic Technology Group Corp (CETC, 594).\n\nIn terms of the number of citations per article, Intel achieved 17.3, followed by Samsung (16.8), IBM (15.4), and Samsung (16.8). CETC ranked only 10th.\n\nThe South China Morning Post (SCMP), owned by Alibaba\u2019s co-founder Jack Ma, reported on the ETO report with the headline \u201cTech war: China leads US in quantity, quality of semiconductor research, report finds.\u201d It referred to \u201cquantity\u201d as Chinese researchers\u2019 high number of citations per article.\n\nZachary Arnold, a lead analyst at the ETO, told Nature magazine that although the study\u2019s findings do not mean that China is currently leading the chip-making field, \u201cit\u2019s showing us where things are headed.\u201d\n\nThe ETO report added that if China develops its research work into commercial applications, the US might soon find it impossible to use export controls to retain its competitive advantage in high-performance microchip design and production.\n\nChen Yunji, a co-founder of AI-chip design firm Cambricon, told Nature that China\u2019s ability to make high-end chips lags behind its chip design, partly due to US export controls.\n\nMeanwhile, the quality of some academic papers in China is in doubt due to the activities of \u201cpaper mills,\u201d which refer to businesses that produce fraudulent or low-quality manuscripts and sell authorship.\n\nOn December 31 last year, China\u2019s Supreme People\u2019s Court issued guidance calling for a crackdown on \u201cpaper mills.\u201d It also called for lower courts to crack down on \u201cpaper industry chains\u201d and severely punish those who committed research fraud.\n\nUS export controls\n\nIn 2019, the Trump administration asked ASML, the world\u2019s largest chip equipment supplier in the Netherlands, to stop shipping extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines to China. EUV lithography can make 7nm chips in a single exposure and 2-3nm chips in multiple exposures.\n\nSince then, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) has tried making 7nm chips using deep-ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machines and multiple exposure techniques. It successfully made Kirin 9000s chips for Huawei Technologies\u2019 Mate60 smartphones, which were launched in September 2023.\n\nAt the beginning of 2024, the Dutch government stopped granting licenses for ASML to export its NXT:2000i and subsequent DUV immersion systems to China.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s scientific and technological innovation has more than once defied people\u2019s imagination,\u201d Minister Wang Yi, member of the politburo of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and Foreign Minister, said in a press conference in Beijing on March 7.\n\n\u201cThis journey has not been smooth. Be it missile technology, space science or chip making, unjustified external suppression has never stopped. But where there is a blockade, there is a breakthrough; where there is suppression, there is innovation.\u201d\n\nCiting an ancient Chinese verse, \u201cNo mountains can stop the surging flow of a mighty river,\u201d Wang said blockade cannot stop China\u2019s technological advancement.\n\nHe said science and technology should not be used to create an iron curtain but be shared by all; China is ready to share its technology with the Global South.\n\nHe stressed that \u201chigh fences and small yards,\u201d a policy that forbids China from obtaining US high technology during the Biden era, could not suppress China\u2019s spirit of innovation. He said decoupling and disruption of supply chains will only lead to self-isolation.\n\nUS President Donald Trump, who began his second term on January 20 this year, also thinks Biden\u2019s \u201chigh fences and small yards\u201d policy does not work.\n\nWhite House officials have recently met with Japanese and Dutch officials to discuss stopping Tokyo Electron and ASML from maintaining semiconductor gear at Chinese chip fabs.\n\nThey said Japan and the Netherlands should ask their firms to match the limits the US has placed on its own companies, including Lam Research Corp, KLA Corp and Applied Materials Inc.\n\nSurpassing South Korea?\n\nChina has been trying to make its lithography for a decade by pouring tens of billions of dollars into the semiconductor industry. However, the program failed to achieve the expected results due to corruption. In July 2022, a dozen top Chinese officials and executives of a national investment fund and related companies were arrested.\n\nChina now focuses on chip design and packaging technologies, which do not rely on EUV lithography.\n\nThe Korea Institute of S&T Evaluation and Planning (KISTEP), a think tank in South Korea, said in a recent survey that China has overtaken Korea in nearly every major area of semiconductor technology.\n\nThe survey, which interviewed 39 industry experts, said China now leads in high-intensity and resistance-based memory technology, scoring 94.1% compared to Korea\u2019s 90.9%. The highest benchmark is 100%.\n\nResistance-based memory, or resistive random access memory (ReRAM or RRAM), is a future technology suitable for deep learning computations.

Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nChinese technology giant Huawei might have enough chips to manufacture one million Ascend 910C AI chips, according to sources quoted in a fresh report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). The report quotes industry sources to reveal that China's primary chip manufacturer, the Semiconductor International Manufacturing Corporation (SMIC), has managed to overcome a key bottleneck in scaling its 7-nanometer semiconductor fabrication by acquiring US deposition and other chip manufacturing tools.\n\nWhile SMIC cannot compete with Taiwan's TSMC in making either 7-nanometer or advanced chips, the CSIS adds that its partnership with Huawei can yield an EUV breakthrough courtesy of extensive resources dedicated to overcoming the key bottleneck.\n\nChina's SMIC Aiming To Manufacture 50,000 7-nanometer Wafers By 2025 End, Says Report\n\nThe CSIS's report covers DeepSeek's entry into the AI race and shares that while the Chinese AI model's ability to demonstrate lower costs is commendable, it is only a natural part of AI evolution. One factor that might have enabled the Chinese firm to develop its AI models is US government policy, which \"inferred that Chinese customers would be restricted to using the\" older NVIDIA V100 GPUs.\n\nHowever, the report shares that government officials missed was that \"Nvidia had a mechanism for post-manufacturing modification of its existing chip products,\" according to the CSIS. As per its report:\n\nIndustry sources confirmed to CSIS that Nvidia blew fuses on A100 chips to reduce their interconnect speed (but not their processing power) below the export control performance thresholds, thus creating the A800 product lines.\n\nAs a result, the A800 China-specific GPUs designed by NVIDIA to conform with US export restrictions closely resembled the A100 GPUs. CSIS adds that while the China-specific H800 did differ somewhat from the restricted H100 GPUs, demand for the A800 and H800 boomed, and the demand for the H100 and A100 GPUs from China was immaterial due to their similar performance parameters.\n\nWhile DeepSeek has relied on NVIDIA's GPUs for its AI development, sanctions covering the latest GPUs have also forced it to consider alternatives. NVIDIA's key moat with its GPUs is the CUDA language, and as per CSIS, the Chinese AI company has also evaluated Huawei's CUDA alternative, CANN. However, it is unimpressed by CANN and according to sources, DeepSeek has assessed \"that it would be years before the combination of Ascend chips and CANN-compatible software was a viable alternative.\"\n\nUS sanctions against Taiwan's TSMC have aimed to prevent Huawei from developing and producing the latest AI chips. Two of the Chinese firm's latest AI chips are its Ascend 910B and Ascend 910C chips.\n\nAccording to the CSIS' government sources, ahead of the US sanctions, TSMC \"manufactured more than 2 million Ascend 910B logic dies and that all of these are now with Huawei.\" Since one Ascend 910C ties two 910Bs together, this leads the researchers to conclude that Huawei can produce as many as one million Ascend 910C chips. As this process, called packaging, also introduces defects, CSIS's industry sources shared that \"roughly 75 percent of the Ascend 910Cs currently survive the advanced packaging process.\"\n\nA systems engineer operates DUV lithography machine. Image: ASML\n\nWhile US and Dutch sanctions against China's SMIC have prevented it from acquiring EUV equipment to make the most advanced chips, older DUV equipment in its possession has enabled the firm to produce 7-nanometer chips. SMIC plans to significantly expand its 7nm production as it has acquired US etching, deposition and other tools used in chip manufacturing.\n\nThese tools can also help SMIC improve its 7nm yields from the currently dismal 20% for fully functional chips, outlines the CSIS. According to its report:\n\nIndustry sources told CSIS that SiEn, Pensun, and Huawei\u2019s fab in Dongguan all were able to legally acquire the needed etching, deposition, and inspection/metrology equipment that SMIC needs for two reasons: (1) the equipment was not restricted on a country-wide basis to all of China and (2) the equipment was restricted on an end-use and end-user basis, but SiEn and Pensun told U.S. firms that it would exclusively be used for producing chips less advanced than 14 nm.\n\nThrough these machines, sources believe that \"SMIC was targeting 50,000 WPM of 7 nm specifically by the end of 2025.\" Combined with a 20% yield rate, 50,000 wafers-per-month can allow it to manufacture 400,000 910C chips per month. Chinese firms SiEn and Pensun sold the equipment to SMIC, and the sale \"was negotiated in Q4 of 2024 and completed in Q1 of 2025.\"\n\nAs a result, the report concludes that \"all the margin for sloppy implementation of export controls or tolerance of large-scale chip smuggling has already been consumed. There is no more time to waste.\"",

And in any future strategic competition with Washington, Europe has an overlooked trump card: manufacturing prowess.\n\nWhether or not the United States now qualifies as Europe\u2019s adversary, it\u2019s clear that its postwar role as guarantor of Europe\u2019s security is over.

Friedrich Merz has already called for European strategic independence from Washington\u2014a watershed declaration for a likely incoming German chancellor.\n\nFor European leaders, meeting this historical moment will mean preparing to defend their national interests on their own\u2014including, potentially, against the United States. And in any future strategic competition with Washington, Europe has an overlooked trump card: manufacturing prowess.\n\nLed by Germany, Europe collectively outproduces the United States in steel, vehicles, ships, and civil aircraft. European Union member countries, on average, also pay less to service their debts than the United States. This gives the EU the industrial heft and financial firepower to support Ukraine and embark on domestic rearmament as U.S. President Donald Trump abandons Kyiv and NATO. But it will require the bloc to invest in its defense and defend the manufacturing base that underpins it against China\u2019s trade dumping and US tariffs.\n\nMany European leaders look with envy on the U.S. tech sector. But manufacturing plays a far greater role in the EU economy than in the United States. On average, manufacturing accounts for 16.4 percent of the EU\u2019s gross value added compared to just 11 percent in the United States. The EU\u2019s manufacturing sector employs 30 million people versus just 13 million in the United States. While U.S. tech is highly profitable, the industry employs just 6.5 million people.\n\nThe stagnant EU economy has fueled calls for Europe to prioritize high-tech sectors over its \u201cold\u201d industrial base. But while new technologies matter, this is a false dichotomy. There are three reasons why maintaining Europe\u2019s manufacturing edge is critical not just for its growth, but also for its security.\n\nFirst, manufacturing drives the little productivity growth that Europe still generates. While digital technologies have propelled U.S. productivity growth, in the eurozone\u2019s five largest economies, so-called mid-tech manufacturing\u2014such as cars and machine-building\u2014has dominated the top 10 sectors, with some of the fastest productivity growth since 2012.\n\nIf the EU is to fund large and immediate increases in defense spending, it will need the income created by its industrial sector to generate tax receipts and keep its debt levels sustainable. These sectors are far from a lost cause. For example, ASML, widely seen as Europe\u2019s most important tech company, is a machine-builder. Exports of clean technology account for 4 percent of Germany\u2019s GDP, a figure unmatched in any other G-7 economy or even China.\n\nSecond, industrial production is a precondition for Europe to rearm quickly. Not only does Europe produce more vehicles than the United States and 50 percent more steel, but Airbus also produced twice as many planes as crisis-stricken Boeing in 2024. And Europe maintains critical upstream industries for defense production, such as steel and chemicals, although they are reeling from high energy costs.\n\nToday, supply chains for modern industry double up as defense supply chains. The United States serves as a warning of the risks of letting them etiolate: It maintains a military shipbuilding industry that struggles with cost overruns and inefficiencies, partly because of the small number of commercial ships it produces, eroding its supply chains. In contrast, Europe still produces a significant number of highly specialized ships each year.\n\nThird, even as Europe aims to catch up with the United States in advanced technologies, its comparative advantage in the trans-Atlantic relationship will continue to lie in manufacturing. Because U.S. industrial capacity cannot match domestic demand, EU has long run a surplus in goods trade with the United States, dominated by machines, cars, and chemicals. Much of its advanced manufacturing is outsourced to Europe and Asia. On the flip side, Europe is mainly reliant on the United States for its tech and software services.\n\nWashington is aiming to reindustrialize and rebalance the trading relationship. But in an economy already operating above full capacity, with a tight labor market and planned controls on immigration, there will be constraints on expanding domestic supply. Manufacturing can ensure that the EU remains an indispensable partner to a more transactional U.S. administration.\n\nBut Europe\u2019s trump card is being jeopardized by both neglect and hesitancy. The defense industry is weakened by fragmented, bespoke production and years of underspending. Even if defense budgets now rise, the cumulative deficit over the last decade relative to NATO spending target of 2 percent of each nation\u2019s GDP amounts to 850 billion euros ($916.9 billion).\n\nAt the same time, the EU is equivocating as the wider manufacturing sector is progressively squeezed by China. Since its property bubble burst in 2021, China has doubled down on investment in autos, machinery, clean tech, and aviation\u2014despite a lack of domestic demand for these goods. By exporting its overproduction, China is cutting into EU producers\u2019 global export markets.\n\nThe auto industry is the tip of the spear. As recently as 2020, China was not a net car exporter. Now, it exports 5 million more vehicles than it imports annually, while Germany\u2019s net car exports have halved since before the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014dragging down supply chains from Italy to Czechia.\n\nChinese overproduction is even a direct security risk in some sectors. Last year, China cut off U.S. drone-maker Skydio from batteries, throttling deliveries to Ukraine. Critics of a European industrial policy reflexively warn of the risks of propping up so-called losers. Yet Europe let Northvolt go bankrupt\u2014 threatening to deepen the continent\u2019s reliance on China.\n\nAdding to Europe\u2019s woes, Trump plans to impose tariffs on EU goods soon and is rolling back former President Joe Biden\u2019s green subsidies benefitting EU car and wind turbine makers. With China flooding global markets and the United States apparently unwilling to accept more EU imports, foreign markets will not rescue Europe or Germany as they did after the euro crisis.\n\nBut the EU can take its fate into its own hands. Germany is the country most exposed to China\u2019s imbalances, and it also has the most fiscal space to respond. The incoming Merz government just announced a massive defense and infrastructure spending package worth at least 11 percent of its GDP\u2014ditching Germany\u2019s debt brake, which acted as an unnecessary fiscal straitjacket. This will likely prove crucial to end the investment drought plaguing Europe\u2019s largest economy. Higher investment will stoke domestic demand and offset lost export markets. But simply increasing aggregate demand is not enough: The EU must also direct it toward strategic industries.\n\nThe EU should use trade and industrial policy to steer civilian demand away from China and toward \u201cmade in Europe\u201d production. The EU is about to negotiate a clean industrial deal. Its goal should be to put in place sector-wide policies that concentrate European demand, allowing fierce intra-EU competition but avoiding firm-specific handouts.\n\nThe fiscal cost of these changes is manageable. The International Monetary Fund estimates that the clean tech subsidies of the Inflation Reduction Act cost the United States around 0.25 percent to 0.4 percent of its GDP annually. Europe, with its lower average debt and deficit levels, can easily afford similar scale of investment.\n\nAnother challenge is retaining openness toward free trade partners: to maintain market scale, ensure competition, and invest in new alliances as the United States withdraws from the global scene. One simple fix would be to include the EU\u2019s 72 partners with free trade agreements in local content rules and demand reciprocal access. Another option would be to design subsidy schemes scoring products based on environmental, national security, and labor standards\u2014ensuring that partners such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and Mercosur qualify while cutting China out.\n\nIn parallel, the continent needs to move toward producing standardized military kit for mass production. The promise of stable defense contracts is already revitalizing Germany\u2019s stock market, proving that targeted demand can restore Europe\u2019s industrial core.\n\nThere are two ways to do so. One is by relying on national specializations: France in aircraft production, Germany in tanks, the Netherlands in radar, and Poland in drones. Another approach is to share the spoils by requiring leading EU defense manufacturers to spread their plants across the continent, much like how Airbus operates.\n\nBiden\u2019s signature bills\u2014the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act\u2014aimed to arrest the United States\u2019 long-standing industrial decline and reduce its reliance on China. Ironically, it is now the EU, not the United States, in urgent need for these policies.\n\nSome changes are already underway: The EU is increasing defense spending, negotiating a clean industrial deal, and deploying its trade defense tools against China. But these efforts need to be more ambitious and better coordinated. Europe\u2019s large market, head start in manufacturing and a large, well-trained workforce give it a chance of success. A 50-year-old German car engineer is unlikely to reincarnate as a digital entrepreneur, but such a worker can retrain for clean technology or defense manufacturing\n\nGetting industrial policy right will strengthen Europe\u2019s strategic position. It will not address immediate defense deficiencies such as a lack of intelligence capability or insufficient long-range precision strike assets. But despite its existential angst, Europe remains a wealthy region with a powerful industrial base that can drive both rearmament and the productivity growth needed to fund it.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs alone are unlikely to bring back U.S. manufacturing anytime soon. In the future, the United States may face a choice: continuing to import the EU\u2019s manufacturing surplus or cementing its dependence on China. The biggest risk is that EU leaders bicker among themselves rather than defend their industrial strength. In that sense, U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance was right to say that Europe should worry about the enemy from within.",

            "content": "It\u2019s a question being considered by plenty of investors right now: If China invades Taiwan which stocks would be impacted? This question is particularly pertinent right now with Taiwan\u2019s presidential election, recent military simulations of an invasion by Beijing and even some predictions that it could happen in 2027.\n\nWhy China invading Taiwan is considered a realistic prospect in the coming years\n\nThe country elected William Lai Ching-te as President, a figure who Beijing makes no secret of despising (both his party and him personally). He has said in the campaign trail that he sees Taiwan as an independent sovereign state and promising among other things to spend more on the local military and try and build closer relationships with other states. Wanting independence from Beijing has been something many of his predecessors may have believed privately, but been more cautious publicly, not wanting to be the trigger for China invading Taiwan. It is also clear that Xi Jinping sees \u2018reunification\u2019 as a goal of his, having noted publicly that it cannot be put off forever.\n\nIn late May 2024, Lai Ching-te was sworn in and made barbs at Beijing. Shortly thereafter, China released a dramatic video simulating an all-out attack on Taiwan. And US defence officials believe that Xi has ordered 2027 to be the year it happens\n\nWe still don\u2019t see China invading Taiwan as something that could happen in the very short-term (i.e. this calendar), it is not unrealistic to see it as something that could happen eventually (i.e. by the end of this decade) and consider the impact. Bloomberg Economics has estimated the price would be $10tn, about 10% of global GDP. This would be even worse than COVID-19, the GFC and the War In Ukraine. In this context, it isn\u2019t unreasonable to ask which stocks would be impacted, and how so. It could be bad news for some sectors, but good news for others.\n\nIf China invades Taiwan which stocks would be impacted?\n\nSemiconductor stocks\n\nTaiwan makes 90% of the world\u2019s semiconductor chips, particularly through TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company). TSMC is only behind Intel and Samsung amongst the biggest chip companies in the world. We suspect that one of the reasons China wants Taiwan is because it wants TSMC, given TSMC has the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in the world, specifically the Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV) manufacturing systems that could be used for military purposes. ASML sells plenty of these, to customers around the world (including the US) but none to China.\n\nObviously if China invaded Taiwan, it would be bad for investors in TSMC because it would become a state enterprise that only produces and sells semiconductor technology for itself. At least, in theory. It is plausible that TSMC might just shift its operations elsewhere \u2013 if successful, it might even be a better situation than the status quo because the world is so reliant on Taiwan. And it is building a facility in Arizona that it expects to be complete in 2025.\n\nFor other semiconductor stocks, there would be significant pressure on the price of chips \u2013 specifically massive inflation, and it would flow through to practically all end products from cars to mobile phones.\n\nStocks that rely on supply chains through the Taiwan Strait\n\nThe Taiwan Strait is one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes, as ships from North Asian factories (China and elsewhere) tend to pass through there. It is estimated that over 50% of the entire world\u2019s shipping containers pass through it.\n\nThe invasion, even if it was quick and successful, would obviously dent global supply chains for at least the short term. And from there, companies relying on ships that transit through the Strait would be at the mercy of Beijing. We all saw post-COVID supply chain disruptions that led to shipping delays and price increases. An invasion of Taiwan would be this all over again, on steroids.\n\nEven companies relying on the Strait via the air instead of by water would be impacted, as flight paths would inevitably have to change. Australia would see a significant impact given the Taiwan Strait forms part of a \u2018straight line\u2019 between China and Australia.\n\nAll stocks\n\nEven though those two are the ones that would be affected most directly, it is inevitable that all stocks would be impacted. We think it is highly plausible that there could be a substantial stock market crash as we saw at the outbreak of COVID-19 and during the GFC. There would be a significant global liquidity crunch, given how much China lends to the world, inevitable sanctions and consequences at the very least. And if the West decides to respond with military force, all bets are off. Of course, China too would be impacted as investors would seek to move money out of China, stop borrowing money and domestic economic confidence would fall.\n\nNonetheless, it is important to single out semiconductor stocks as important, because Taiwan\u2019s own TSMC is one of the reasons why China wants Taiwan. It is also important to note companies that rely on the Taiwan Strait as a shipping route, that would be impacted.\n\nObviously, we all hope given all these potential impacts, that none of this comes to past. Unfortunately, the mere prospect of this has to be entertained by investors.\n\nWhat are the Best ASX Stocks to invest in right now?\n\nCheck our buy/sell tips",

            "content": "ASML (ASML) stock rose 4.3% Wednesday after the Dutch semiconductor equipment company posted better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings and its CEO dismissed concerns that DeepSeek's latest breakthrough would hurt demand for AI chips.\n\nASML invented the technology required to make the world\u2019s most advanced artificial intelligence chips and is the only manufacturer of the complex machines that use its EUV lithography technology. The latest version of those EUV machines costs nearly $400 million.\n\nASML sells its machines to chip manufacturers such as TSMC (TSM), which uses those machines to produce chips for Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and other tech heavyweights.\n\nThe Dutch firm on Wednesday reported earnings per share of 6.85 euros, ahead of the 6.68 euros expected, and its quarterly revenue of 9.2 billion euros topped the 9 billion euros forecast, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. The company reported taking orders of more than 7 billion euros worth of its tools in the fourth quarter, double the 3.5 billion euros expected. Half of that value came from orders of its EUV machines for AI chips, the company said in a call with analysts Wednesday.\n\nASML\u2019s 2025 first quarter sales forecast also surpassed expectations, with its guidance range of 7.5 billioneuros to 8 billion euros ahead of the 7.2 billion euros consensus estimate, per Bloomberg.\n\n\"Consistent with our view from the last quarter, the growth in artificial intelligence is the key driver for growth in our industry,\u201d CEO Christophe Fouquet said in a statement.\n\n\"It has created a shift in the market dynamics that is not benefiting all of our customers equally, which creates both opportunities and risks as reflected in our 2025 revenue range.\u201d\n\nASML\u2019s results were under more scrutiny than usual after its prior quarterly earnings came in far below expectations and sent its stocks \u2014 and those of other chipmakers \u2014 tumbling.\n\nShares have been under pressure in recent weeks amid announcements of more restrictive export controls from the Netherlands and the US, which seek to disrupt China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors.\n\nWhile ASML has never been permitted to export EUV lithography machines to China, its sales of other equipment to the region have surged in recent years. ASML\u2019s revenue from China rose to roughly 9 billion euros in 2024 from 6.4 billion euros the previous year, per Bloomberg data.\n\nFouquet said in the call with analysts that ASML's expectations for its China business haven't changed. The company already expected China sales to moderate in 2025 and beyond to represent around 20% of its total revenue. Still, the executive contended that geopolitics present risks that could push sales toward the lower end of its 2025 guidance.\n\nThe stock tumbled this week as news of a cost-effective artificial intelligence model from Chinese firm DeepSeek cast doubt on Western Big Tech companies' ultra-high spending on AI infrastructure, such as semiconductors made by ASML\u2019s machines.\n\nFouquet dismissed those concerns in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cA lower cost of AI could mean more applications,\" Fouquet said. \"More applications means more demand over time. We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand.\"\n\nCEO of Dutch tech giant ASML, Christophe Fouquet speaks during the presentation of the company's quarterly and annual results in Veldhoven on Jan. 29, 2025.

            "probability": null,
            "content": "The leading semiconductor equipment maker is still a great long-term investment.\n\nASML Holding (ASML 1.91%) is one of the world's most important semiconductor equipment companies. It's the largest supplier of photolithography systems for optically etching circuit patterns onto silicon wafers.\n\nIt's also the only producer of high-end extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems for manufacturing the world's smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips. All of the world's top foundries -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung, and Intel -- use those systems.\n\nBut over the past 12 months, ASML's stock declined 25% as the Nasdaq Composite rallied nearly 20%. That pullback, which was largely driven by macro and regulatory concerns, could represent a great buying opportunity for three simple reasons.\n\n1. It's monopolized a crucial semiconductor technology\n\nIt took ASML, which is based in the Netherlands, more than two decades to develop its cutting-edge EUV technology. These massive systems require multiple planes to ship and dedicated teams for on-site assembly and testing. Its current-gen low-NA (numerical aperture) systems, which are used to produce chips as small as 2 nanometers (nm), cost about $180 million. Its new high-NA systems, which are used to produce even smaller chips, cost roughly $380 million.\n\nASML's entrenched position and high production costs have prevented any other smaller lithography system makers from cracking the EUV market. In other words, it's monopolized a crucial technology for developing the world's most advanced chips -- so it will remain a linchpin of the semiconductor sector for the foreseeable future.\n\n2. Its cyclical slowdown is temporary\n\nASML's sales grew by the double digits from 2020 to 2023 as PC shipments accelerated during the pandemic's height, new 5G smartphones hit the market, and the AI market heated up.\n\nMetric 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Revenue Growth 8% 18% 33% 14% 30% 3% Gross Margin 44.7% 48.6% 52.7% 50.5% 51.3% 51.3% EPS Growth 1% 38% 69% (2%) 41% (3%)\n\nIn 2024, its revenue and earnings growth slowed down as it lapped the AI market's initial growth spurt, dealt with tighter restrictions on its system sales to Chinese chipmakers, and gradually transitioned from its low-NA EUV systems to its high-NA EUV systems. But even as it faced those headwinds, its gross margins held steady as it maintained its pricing power.\n\nFor 2025, ASML expects its revenue to rise 6% to 24% with a gross margin of 51% to 53%. Analysts expect its revenue and EPS to grow 15% and 23%, respectively.\n\nThat acceleration, which ASML mainly attributes to the robust growth of the AI market and the expansion of the memory market, suggests its cyclical downturn has ended. It also expects its sales in China -- which temporarily surged to 41% of its system sales in 2024 as its chipmakers ramped up orders in anticipation of tighter export curbs -- to drop back to a more \"normal ratio\" of around 20% in 2025.\n\nASML has already been banned from shipping its EUV systems to China since 2019. The latest restrictions, effective in late 2024, will also prevent it from selling its higher-end deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems (which are used to manufacture older chips) to Chinese chipmakers.\n\n3. It's still reasonably valued\n\nASML's stock got a bit overheated last year, but it now looks reasonably valued at 29 times this year's earnings. That's probably because its valuations are being squeezed by the near-term concerns regarding the Trump Administration's unpredictable tariff plans, the threat of even tighter export curbs against Chinese chipmakers, and other macro headwinds.\n\nBut over the long term, ASML should weather these challenges and continue to dominate the lithography market with its high-NA systems. So if you expect the semiconductor market to keep expanding over the next few decades, it could be a great time to load up on ASML's stock as the bulls look the other way.",

            "content": "ASML has achieved unprecedented financial success in 2024, recording sales of 28.3 billion euros and a net profit of 7.6 billion euros. The Dutch chip machine manufacturer is experiencing a significant boost from the growing demand for advanced AI-related chips, while simultaneously navigating complex export restrictions.\n\nIn his annual report, CEO Christophe Fouquet emphasized the significant impact of artificial intelligence on the semiconductor industry. He projected robust global sales growth of nine percent annually over the next five years, with the market potentially reaching a remarkable $1 trillion valuation by the end of that period.\n\nMarket shifts and challenges\n\nEmerging market dynamics could potentially introduce unexpected variables to the company\u2019s sales trajectory. For instance, the rise of cost-effective AI solutions, such as those developed by Chinese company DeepSeek, might potentially reduce demand for high-end chips. This could directly influence sales of ASML\u2019s sophisticated machinery. However, Fouquet suggested earlier that the chips hold substantially more strategic value for AI-implementing companies than for their developers, and he remains optimistic about the overall market impact.\n\nHowever, geopolitical tensions did lead to tighter export restrictions. That, in turn, affected the orders ASML received. While 36 percent of the company\u2019s sales originated from China in 2024, this proportion is anticipated to contract to 20 percent in 2025.\n\nTip: Netherlands further tightens export restrictions on chip equipment\n\nThe manufacturer already characterized 2024 as a \u201ctransition year\u201d from the onset of the fiscal year. The previous CEO, Peter Wennink, articulated this mention. The change at the top was part of this statement, but declining sales from China also added to the changes. It was well estimated that tighter export restrictions would affect 15 percent of sales to China. Earlier, Chinese customers represented 49 percent of all ASML orders. This has now been reduced to 36 percent. The downward trend is expected to continue in the upcoming year.\n\nOutlook and strategic adjustments\n\nNotwithstanding these challenges, ASML maintains robust revenue expectations for 2025, forecasting earnings between 30 and 35 billion euros. This optimistic projection is anchored in the sustained robust demand for EUV lithography systems critical to AI applications.\n\nThe company remains committed to substantial investments in research and development, strategically positioning itself to adapt to evolving market dynamics and preserve its industry-leading status.",

            "content": "Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML (ASML) is pinning its hopes on an imminent boost from artificial intelligence investments by major tech companies after customers were cautious last year. In its annual report released on Wednesday, the chip company said that macroeconomic uncertainty had \u201cled certain customers to remain cautious and control capital expenditure and cash flow more carefully in 2024.\u201d\n\nIt also said it had faced disruptions to its supply chain because of reduced material availability and higher prices, while persistent inflationary pressures had affected suppliers.\n\nASML Is Bullish on AI\n\nBut ASML sounded bullish on AI, saying it will be a \u201ckey driver for growth in the semiconductor industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cAI has come to life and proved itself to be a major force. It is going to drive new applications and growth in the next five to ten years \u2013 there\u2019s no doubt about this, and a lot of our peers in the industry have also expressed similarly bullish views about the opportunity ahead,\u201d ASML said in its report.\n\nToday, the impact is mainly evident in the sales of very advanced servers and high-power computing, but ASML says it expects a lot more to come, though it is uncertain exactly the direction the technology will take.\n\nIt also warned that the future geopolitical outlook and regulatory changes could affect it. ASML noted for instance that export control restrictions and customer capital expenditure cuts created volatility in the investment community last year. Looking ahead, ASML said export control policies and regulations will impact on plans to increase capacity.\n\nASML Faces Twin Challenges\n\nASML faces twin challenges of tighter restrictions on exports and the risk of tariffs.\n\nOn tariffs, the risk of 25% or higher levies on chip exports to the U.S. could force up prices for ASML\u2019s end customers. ASML supplies the necessary tools and materials used for the manufacturing of semiconductors and designs the machines that build microchips. ASML\u2019s three largest customers are thought to be TSMC (TSM), Intel (INTC) and Samsung Electronics.\n\nOn export controls, Bloomberg reported recently that the White House is looking to further tighten Biden-era restrictions on China. Dutch and Japanese officials met U.S. counterparts to discuss ASML\u2019s and Tokyo Electron\u2019s (TOELY) respective chipmaking operations, with the goal in the administration being to restrict their engineers from maintaining semiconductor equipment in China. The White House would like these companies to face the same restrictions on dealing with China as the U.S. has already placed on American chip equipment companies Lam Research (LRCX), KLA (KLAC), and Applied Materials (AMAT).\n\nIs ASML a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nOverall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on ASML stock, based on four Buys and two Holds. The average ASML price target of $927.38 implies over 30% upside.\n\nSee more ASML analyst ratings\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

            "content": "Chipamchine manufacturer ASML published its 2024 annual report today. The report reveals a marked decrease in demand from customers in 2024, largely attributed to complex export controls, particularly those imposed by the U.S. The report highlights that uncertainties around technological sovereignty prompted a cautious approach amongst ASML's clientele, leading to reduced capital expenditures.\n\nThe semiconductor industry's complex geopolitical landscape has significantly impacted ASML's market dynamics. The company's latest annual report reveals that Chinese entities, which represented 36% of ASML's sales in 2024, are increasingly falling under restrictive measures. In response to these challenges, ASML projects a substantial decrease in Chinese market share, with expectations of sales dropping to approximately 20% by 2025.\n\nASML's financial outlook\n\nDespite current headwinds, ASML maintains an optimistic financial trajectory. The company forecasts sales between \u20ac30-35 billion for 2025, building upon its 2024 performance of \u20ac28.3 billion. This growth projection is particularly supported by increasing demand for ASML's EUV lithography systems, which are crucial components in advanced chip manufacturing, especially in the expanding artificial intelligence sector.\n\nMoreover, ASML has strengthened its leadership structure with key political appointments. The company announced the upcoming addition of Karien van Gennip, former Dutch Social Affairs minister, to its supervisory board. This appointment follows other significant recruitments, including former French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire as special advisor to the executive board, and former deputy Economy Minister Frank Heemskerk as Global Affairs Chief. These appointments signal ASML's proactive approach to navigating complex international trade dynamics and regulatory challenges.",

            "content": "ASML Faces Growth Challenges Amid Export Restrictions Despite export control risks, ASML projects sales growth boosted by EUV technology.\n\nASML, the prominent computer chip equipment manufacturer, has reported significant challenges affecting its growth as detailed in its annual report released on March 5, 2025. The document reveals troubling trends characterized by weakening demand, primarily due to complex export controls and heightened geopolitical tensions.\n\nAccording to ASML's comprehensive annual report, uncertainties surrounding export controls have spurred caution among its clientele, leading to restricted capital expenditures for 2024. The report states, \"Macroeconomic uncertainty - including [over] technological sovereignty and export controls - led certain customers to remain cautious and control capital expenditure,\" highlighting the financial and strategic hesitations currently faced by businesses reliant on semiconductor technology.\n\nASML's figures indicate a marked dependence on the Chinese market, which accounted for 36% of the company's sales last year. Unfortunately, as geopolitical tensions increase, many Chinese entities are now subject to strict limitations. ASML anticipates this situation will significantly diminish its market presence, projecting the Chinese market share to drop to around 20% by 2025.\n\nDespite these challenges, ASML remains optimistic about its financial future. The company forecasts sales between \u20ac30-35 billion for 2025, building on its 2024 performance, which was already pegged at \u20ac28.3 billion. This positive outlook is bolstered by the growing demand for its cutting-edge extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems\u2014a cornerstone of advanced chip manufacturing, particularly as the artificial intelligence sector expands.\n\nAdding to the positive developments, ASML unveiled the opening of its joint High NA EUV Lithography Lab with imec, allowing significant partners like Intel to begin testing innovative technologies. This facility is seen as pivotal for advancing semiconductor manufacturing prospects, especially as industry requirements grow increasingly sophisticated.\n\nTo navigate the turbulent waters of international trade regulations and restrictions, ASML has bolstered its leadership team with key political figures. Karien van Gennip, the former Dutch Social Affairs minister, is set to join ASML's supervisory board. This appointment aligns with other significant hires, including Bruno Le Maire, the former French Finance Minister, acting as special advisor to the executive board, and Frank Heemskerk, who has been named Global Affairs Chief.\n\nThe integration of these political leaders within ASML not only reflects the company's proactive approach to governance but also signals its intent to harmonize business strategies with broader political contexts amid changing global dynamics.\n\nASML's annual report and its forecasts suggest recovery is possible yet tethered tightly to the international economic climate and associated political pressures. With changing market landscapes, especially impacting their extensive operations with Chinese customers, ASML acknowledges the intricacy of contemporary global trade.\n\nOverall, as ASML transitions through these challenging times, the focus remains on leveraging innovation and political engagement to sustain growth. The company aims to solidify its market presence, but vigilance will be needed to adapt to potential unforeseen fluctuations within the semiconductor industry. Only time will tell if ASML's optimistic forecasts will materialize amid these pervasive uncertainties.",

            "content": "The market\u2019s machine is all connected to one simple theme: the level of volatility in the current environment. When volatility is on the rise, fear starts to spread across participants, from individual investors to systematic funds that rely on algorithms to shift and balance their positions. When volatility is rising, even the machines know it\u2019s time to cut back on stocks and seek safety.\n\nThat is why during today\u2019s potential market correction, which has started to make its way in the S&P 500 after a decline of just over 6% from the all-time highs made in February 2025, there are signs of institutional capital looking for safer places to guard their money in the markets, as seen in the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF NYSEARCA: IVE outperforming the broader S&P 500 by as much as 1.5% over the past trading week alone.\n\nGet NVIDIA alerts: Sign Up\n\nStill, there are plenty of individual stocks to be picked in this value and growth preference from the markets, which is where today\u2019s list comes into play for investors looking for that same setup. Names like Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. NYSE: CLF in the basic materials sector, ASML Holding NASDAQ: ASML in the technology space, and even Rocket Companies Inc. NYSE: RKT in the financial sector all offer similar setups to help investors escape this potential market correction today.\n\nCleveland-Cliffs Stock: A Safter Double-Digit Upside\n\nCleveland-Cliffs Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$16.43\n\n67.77% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 10 Analyst Ratings High Forecast $23.00 Average Forecast $16.43 Low Forecast $11.00 Cleveland-Cliffs Stock Forecast Details\n\nShares of Cleveland-Cliffs are now trading at 47% of their 52-week high, which offers a much better risk-to-reward setup for investors to consider today moving forward. As the stock goes this low compared to its highs, it becomes evident that some of the worst-case scenarios might already be priced in for the company\u2019s underlying trends.\n\nMore than that, investors have access to a low-risk setup in Cleveland-Cliffs and double-digit upside. Wall Street analysts see a consensus price target of up to $16.5 a share today, implying a net rally of as much as 52.8% from where the stock trades.\n\nBut, investors still need a fundamental reason to get behind the idea of buying into this potential upside. The current Wall Street earnings per share (EPS) forecasts expect Cleveland-Cliffs stock to deliver $0.05 in EPS by the fourth quarter of 2025, significantly better than today\u2019s net loss of $0.68 per share.\n\nThere\u2019s also a recent shift in the manufacturing sector for the United States economy, as seen in the latest surprise expansion in the manufacturing PMI index readings, which shows investors where the pick-up in economic activity might land next.\n\nShort Sellers Say No More For ASML Stock\n\nASML Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$937.00\n\n33.22% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 11 Analyst Ratings High Forecast $1,100.00 Average Forecast $937.00 Low Forecast $767.00 ASML Stock Forecast Details\n\nAfter a recent scare of a risk-off attitude in the market, shares of NVIDIA Co. NASDAQ: NVDA were the ones punished first, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that every single company exposed to chipmaking is going to encounter a similar fate. This is where shares of ASML come into play, especially as short sellers realize that the downside has been capped.\n\nBecause the stock now trades at 66% of its 52-week high, there seem to be no concrete bearish scenarios that could take it further into new lows, leaving investors with a fantastic risk-to-reward setup moving forward. The upside can now be discussed by understanding where the odds fall for ASML stock.\n\nAs of February 2025, the Wall Street consensus price target on ASML stock stands at $937 per share, calling for as much as 32.2% upside from where the stock trades today. However, those from J.P. Morgan Chase decided to shoot a bit higher to a valuation of up to $1,100 for an implied rally of 55.2%.\n\nWhen it comes to the race for artificial intelligence and chipmaking to support its development, investors can see how the risk-to-reward ratio favors ASML over other names in this race.\n\nLower Rates Could Boost Mortgage Activity\n\nRocket Companies Today RKT Rocket Companies $14.28 +1.11 (+8.38%) 52-Week Range $10.06 \u25bc $21.38 Price Target $13.83 Add to Watchlist\n\nWhen it comes to market corrections, one thing always remains true: Capital tends to flow into a flight-to-safety mode, favoring bonds or currency. From that reaction, interest rates typically come down to ease the environment for stocks and the economy to move forward.\n\nWhen this happens, mortgage rates come down as well, which is where the upside can go now for shares of Rocket Companies. Considering that the mortgage market index is still hovering around a 1996 low today, a demand shock could suddenly spike earnings and activity for this company moving forward.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly where the premiums in Rocket stock are justified, considering the company now trades at a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 3.4x today, nearly three times as much as the mortgage industry\u2019s 1.8x valuation today. Some would call this expensive and be wary of buying it. However, seasoned investors will reiterate that markets always overpay for stocks they believe can outperform.\n\nBefore you consider NVIDIA, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and NVIDIA wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile NVIDIA currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about ASML (ASML).\n\nASML currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.42, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 24 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.42 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 24 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 19 are Strong Buy, representing 79.2% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ASML\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ASML here>>>\n\n\n\nThe ABR suggests buying ASML, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs ASML Worth Investing In?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for ASML, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $25.17.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for ASML. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for ASML.\n\nOnly $1 to See All Zacks' Buys and Sells\n\nWe're not kidding.\n\nSeveral years ago, we shocked our members by offering them 30-day access to all our picks for the total sum of only $1.

(MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft has invested nearly $14 billion in OpenAI and has integrated ChatGPT into its Bing search engine. Microsoft has also combined all its AI copilots into a single AI experience called Microsoft Copilot. In fiscal 2025, Microsoft plans to invest $80 billion on AI-enabled data centers to train AI models. Analyst Joseph Bonner says Microsoft is ramping up its investments in generative AI both internally and via external investments in AI startups. He says CEO Satya Nadella sees AI as a critical long-term growth opportunity for Microsoft. Argus has a \"buy\" rating and $526 price target for MSFT stock, which closed at $388.49 on March 3.\n\nNvidia Corp. (NVDA)\n\nHigh-end chipmaker Nvidia provides the massive processing power needed to run advanced AI applications. Nvidia has been one of the best-performing stocks in the entire market in recent years, and it's largely due to the company's AI exposure. Orders for Nvidia's H20 chips have reportedly surged in China as companies push to adopt DeepSeek's AI models. Analyst Jim Kelleher says DeepSeek hasn't posed as much risk to Nvidia's demand as some investors initially feared. Kelleher says Nvidia has a significant competitive advantage in graphics processing unit design. Argus has a \"buy\" rating and $175 price target for NVDA stock, which closed at $114.06 on March 3.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL)\n\nGoogle and YouTube parent company Alphabet uses AI and automation in virtually every facet of its business, from ad pricing to content promotion to Gmail spam filters. Google launched its Bard AI chatbot in March 2023 and its Gemini generative AI model in December 2023. Alphabet raised some concern within the AI community in February when the company lifted its ban on using AI technology to develop weapons and surveillance tools. Bonner says Google is heavily investing in its Gemini model and integrating it throughout its product stacks. Argus has a \"buy\" rating and $220 price target for GOOGL stock, which closed at $167.01 on March 3.\n\nAmazon has integrated AI into every aspect of its business, including its targeted advertisements, its marketplace search and recommendation algorithms, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon offers a wide range of AI and machine learning services to its AWS cloud customers, including advanced text analytics, automated code reviews and chatbots. In February, Amazon announced Alexa+, a revamped version of its Alexa personal assistant that uses AI technology to be smarter, more conversational and more capable than previous Alexa versions. Kelleher says AI investments have rekindled AWS sales. Argus has a \"buy\" rating and $270 price target for AMZN stock, which closed at $205.02 on March 3.\n\n\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (META)\n\nMeta Platforms is a market leader in social media and online advertising and is the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and other platforms. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has adopted a bold strategy of making Meta's AI technology free and open to the public in an effort to gain market share and drive down competitors' prices. Meta is reportedly in talks to build a new $200 billion data center campus for its future AI projects. While Meta's AI costs are spiking, Bonner says the company's overall profitability is still improving. Argus has a \"buy\" rating and $775 price target for META stock, which closed at $655.05 on March 3.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM)\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world\u2019s largest pure-play semiconductor foundry. Taiwan Semi manufactures all the advanced AI semiconductors for Nvidia and other AI chipmakers. In December, Reuters reported TSMC is in talks with Nvidia to manufacture Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips at TSMC's new plant in Arizona. Kelleher says Taiwan Semi may get hit by new semiconductor export restrictions, but AI investments, receding inflation and a rebound in electronic device demand will support ongoing growth. TSMC is also expected to begin Apple chip production in Arizona soon. Argus has a \"buy\" rating and $270 price target for TSM stock, which closed at $172.97 on March 3.\n\nASML Holding NV (ASML)\n\nASML produces photolithography systems and other processing equipment used in semiconductor fabrication. ASML is the only major producer of the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography equipment necessary to produce advanced AI chips. Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung Electronics are two of ASML's largest customers. Booming AI demand helped ASML generate record fourth-quarter bookings. Kelleher says demand from generative AI applications and premium edge devices will trigger an acceleration of EUV sales in 2025. In addition, he says ASML has a strong balance sheet and is committed to shareholder returns. Argus has a \"buy\" rating and $1,000 price target for ASML stock, which closed at $699.86 on March 3.\n\nAdobe Inc. (ADBE)\n\nAdobe produces creative content software and other applications used for marketing and e-commerce. The company's Firefly generative machine learning model is generating customer interest across Photoshop, Illustrator and other platforms. Adobe has also applied its Sensei AI and machine learning technology to its Adobe Analytics, Campaign and Target products. Adobe's newest batch of generative AI tools includes Firefly Bulk Create, an app that allows users to resize or replace the backgrounds of up to 10,000 images in a single click. Bonner says Adobe's AI innovation is impressive. Argus has a \"buy\" rating and $600 price target for ADBE stock, which closed at $440.72 on March 3.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp. (IBM)\n\nFor years, IBM has been developing ways to adapt its AI supercomputer Watson to revolutionize health care, finance, law and academia. IBM's portfolio of Watson AI solutions includes applications to improve customer service, automate workflow processes and predict outcomes. IBM's Watson Studio even helps enterprise customers build AI applications. In December, IBM announced a collaboration with defense intelligence company Janes that will integrate open source defense and security intelligence data into IBM's watsonx AI and data platform. Kelleher says IBM has momentum in AI and hybrid cloud solutions. Argus has a \"buy\" rating and $290 price target for IBM stock, which closed at $250.19 on March 3.\n\nArista Networks Inc. (ANET)",

            "content": "European stock markets closed at or near record highs on March 3 as economic data showed inflation continuing to decline across the continent, and after European leaders pledged to boost their military spending.\n\nFrance\u2019s CAC 40 Index closed just shy of its May 2024 record high, while Germany\u2019s DAX index gained 2.6% for its biggest one-day increase since 2022. The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 1.1% as many defense stocks posted double-digit gains and the group added a combined $35 billion to their market capitalization.\n\nA basket of European defense stocks tracked by U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS) rose 15% on the day to a record, bringing gains for the year to more than 60%. The rally in European defense stocks comes as Europe\u2019s political leaders build what\u2019s being called a \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d to help defend Ukraine and secure a ceasefire between that country and Russia.\n\nEuropean stocks that were higher on the day include Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk (NVO), Swiss bank UBS Group (UBS), and Dutch semiconductor concern ASML Holding (ASML).\n\nInflation Declines\n\nEuropean stocks also got a boost from news that the inflation rate on the continent declined to an annualized rate of 2.4% in February. The main reason for the February decline in inflation was energy prices, which rose only 0.2% during the month compared to a 1.9% increase in January.\n\nThe European Central Bank has indicated that policymakers believe inflation is on its way to meeting its 2% target, a situation that paves the way for further interest rate cuts. The central bank meets later this week and is widely expected to announce another 25-basis point trim, which would mark its sixth rate reduction since it started easing monetary policy last summer.\n\nEurope\u2019s benchmark Stoxx 600 index has outperformed America\u2019s S&P 500 index so far this year.

That rating is based on 684 Buy, 521 Hold, and 53 Sell recommendations assigned in the last three months. The average VGK price target of $79.28 implies 11.44% upside from current levels.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

            "content": "Source The Motley Fool\n\nASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) is one of the world's most important semiconductor equipment companies. It's the largest supplier of photolithography systems for optically etching circuit patterns onto silicon wafers.\n\nIt's also the only producer of high-end extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems for manufacturing the world's smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips. All of the world's top foundries -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung, and Intel -- use those systems.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nBut over the past 12 months, ASML's stock declined 25% as the Nasdaq Composite rallied nearly 20%. That pullback, which was largely driven by macro and regulatory concerns, could represent a great buying opportunity for three simple reasons.\n\n1. It's monopolized a crucial semiconductor technology\n\nIt took ASML, which is based in the Netherlands, more than two decades to develop its cutting-edge EUV technology. These massive systems require multiple planes to ship and dedicated teams for on-site assembly and testing. Its current-gen low-NA (numerical aperture) systems, which are used to produce chips as small as 2 nanometers (nm), cost about $180 million. Its new high-NA systems, which are used to produce even smaller chips, cost roughly $380 million.\n\nASML's entrenched position and high production costs have prevented any other smaller lithography system makers from cracking the EUV market. In other words, it's monopolized a crucial technology for developing the world's most advanced chips -- so it will remain a linchpin of the semiconductor sector for the foreseeable future.\n\n2. Its cyclical slowdown is temporary\n\nASML's sales grew by the double digits from 2020 to 2023 as PC shipments accelerated during the pandemic's height, new 5G smartphones hit the market, and the AI market heated up.\n\nMetric 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Revenue Growth 8% 18% 33% 14% 30% 3% Gross Margin 44.7% 48.6% 52.7% 50.5% 51.3% 51.3% EPS Growth 1% 38% 69% (2%) 41% (3%)\n\nIn 2024, its revenue and earnings growth slowed down as it lapped the AI market's initial growth spurt, dealt with tighter restrictions on its system sales to Chinese chipmakers, and gradually transitioned from its low-NA EUV systems to its high-NA EUV systems. But even as it faced those headwinds, its gross margins held steady as it maintained its pricing power.\n\nFor 2025, ASML expects its revenue to rise 6% to 24% with a gross margin of 51% to 53%. Analysts expect its revenue and EPS to grow 15% and 23%, respectively.\n\nThat acceleration, which ASML mainly attributes to the robust growth of the AI market and the expansion of the memory market, suggests its cyclical downturn has ended. It also expects its sales in China -- which temporarily surged to 41% of its system sales in 2024 as its chipmakers ramped up orders in anticipation of tighter export curbs -- to drop back to a more \"normal ratio\" of around 20% in 2025.\n\nASML has already been banned from shipping its EUV systems to China since 2019. The latest restrictions, effective in late 2024, will also prevent it from selling its higher-end deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems (which are used to manufacture older chips) to Chinese chipmakers.\n\n3. It's still reasonably valued\n\nASML's stock got a bit overheated last year, but it now looks reasonably valued at 29 times this year's earnings. That's probably because its valuations are being squeezed by the near-term concerns regarding the Trump Administration's unpredictable tariff plans, the threat of even tighter export curbs against Chinese chipmakers, and other macro headwinds.\n\nBut over the long term, ASML should weather these challenges and continue to dominate the lithography market with its high-NA systems. So if you expect the semiconductor market to keep expanding over the next few decades, it could be a great time to load up on ASML's stock as the bulls look the other way.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "NVDA, AVGO and TSM are among some of the best-performing semiconductor stocks.\n\nSemiconductor stocks are companies involved in the making of computer chips. Some are integrated manufacturers, while others are specialized.\n\nWhat do NVIDIA (NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have in common?\n\nA couple of things, actually: They\u2019ve all outperformed the S&P 500 index by a wide margin in the last year, and they\u2019re all semiconductor stocks.\n\nWhat are semiconductor stocks?\n\nSemiconductor stocks are shares of publicly-traded companies that design or manufacture computer chips, also known as semiconductors.\n\nTechnically speaking, a semiconductor is a material whose electrical properties allow tiny circuits to be embedded into it. But in common parlance, the word \u201csemiconductor\u201d refers to the products made from these materials \u2014 that is, computer chips with integrated circuitry.\n\nThere are many different types of semiconductors with different levels of sophistication, from simple chips in kitchen appliances to cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications, as well as cryptocurrency mining.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is also differentiated into several segments, and we\u2019ll look at some of those in a moment. First, let\u2019s look at the top-performing semi-conductor stocks.\n\n7 top semiconductor stocks by one-year performance\n\nBelow is a table of the seven best-performing stocks in the PHLX Semiconductor Index, ordered by one-year returns.\n\nTicker Company Performance (Year) NVDA NVIDIA Corp 59.64% AVGO Broadcom Inc 58.88% TSM Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ADR 42.67% MRVL Marvell Technology Inc 38.32% COHR Coherent Corp 32.83% ADI Analog Devices Inc 22.05% TXN Texas Instruments Inc 21.98% Source: Finviz. Data is current as of 2025-03-03 and is intended for informational purposes only.\n\nWhat are the different types of semiconductor stocks?\n\nJust as there are many different types of semiconductors, there are many types of semiconductor stocks. These include fabrication equipment manufacturers, integrated device manufacturers, fabless designers, foundries, assembly and testing firms and distributors.\n\nIt\u2019s worth understanding the ins and outs of these segments, as some are dominated by a small handful of firms, and others contain worldwide monopolies.\n\nFabrication equipment manufacturers\n\nThe semiconductor supply chain starts with fabrication (or \u201cfab\u201d) equipment manufacturers \u2014 the people who make the machines that semiconductor companies use to fabricate chips by embedding tiny circuits into semiconductor materials.\n\nThere\u2019s actually only one company in the entire world that knows how to make the machines needed to fabricate advanced semiconductors: ASML (ASML).\n\nASML is a Netherlands-based firm whose machines use ultraviolet lasers to etch circuitry into semiconductors. This process, which is called extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) photolithography, relies on incredibly complex physics. ASML invented it, and is the only company that understands it well enough to provide it commercially.\n\nASML controls most of the global photolithography market, and has an absolute monopoly on EUV photolithography, which is necessary for the fabrication of all but the simplest semiconductor chips.\n\nThere are, however, other fabrication equipment manufacturers that use non-EUV technologies. Lam Research (LRCX) and Entegris (ENTG) are both examples.\n\nIntegrated device manufacturers (IDMs)\n\nIntegrated device manufacturers (IDMs) are companies that make electronic devices like computer processors from start to finish \u2014 they design their own semiconductor chips, fabricate them in-house, and then assemble them into finished electronic components. Intel (INTC), Micron (MU) and Texas Instruments (TXN) are all examples of IDMs.\n\nThe IDM model is one of two semiconductor manufacturing schemes. The other is the \"fabless-foundry\" model, in which design, fabrication and assembly are all outsourced to separate, specialized firms.\n\nFabless semiconductor designers and GPU makers\n\nFabless semiconductor designers are firms that only invent new types of semiconductors, and outsource the actual manufacturing to foundries.\n\nGPU makers like NVIDIA and AMD are examples of fabless designers. Broadcom, Marvell (MRVL) and Rambus (RMBS) are also part of this segment.\n\nSemiconductor foundries\n\nSemiconductor foundries manufacture semiconductors on behalf of fabless design firms.\n\nThis segment is dominated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), which controls more than 50% of the global market for foundry services. There are a few smaller firms in this segment as well: Globalfoundries (GFS) and United Microelectronics (UMC) are minor players in the semiconductor foundry market.\n\nOutsourced assembly and testing (OSAT)\n\nThe final segment of the fabless-foundry model is outsourced assembly and testing (OSAT) \u2014 which, as its name implies, consists of companies that test semiconductors and assemble them into finished electronic components on behalf of fabless designers and foundries. Amkor (AMKR) is an example of an OSAT stock.\n\nSemiconductor distributors\n\nWhen we talk about the \u201cfinished electronic components\u201d produced by the IDM and fabless-foundry models, we\u2019re talking about computer parts, like processors and GPUs \u2014 not consumer products.\n\nThis segment of the semiconductor industry consists of distributors \u2014 companies that buy these things and then resell them to consumer electronics manufacturers, who put them in consumer products like laptops and appliances; or to AI or cloud computing companies, who use them in data centers.\n\nArrow Electronics (ARW) and Avnet (AVT) are examples of semiconductor distributor stocks.\n\nPros and cons of investing in semiconductor stocks\n\nDue to the relative scarcity of its companies \u2014 and its growing importance to AI \u2014 the semiconductor industry has a unique set of upsides and downsides for investors, relative to other tech stocks.\n\nPros of investing in semiconductor stocks\n\nLack of competition: Two segments of the semiconductor industry \u2014 photolithography and foundries, both of which are critical to the global electronics supply chain \u2014 are dominated by single firms (ASML and TSM, respectively). It\u2019s hard to invest in the wrong photolithographer or foundry when there\u2019s only one major player in each segment.\n\nAI-related momentum: GPUs have become the preferred hardware for running AI models like GPT (the AI behind ChatGPT). Fabless semiconductor designers like NVIDIA have benefitted from a perception that their GPUs are in high demand from AI companies like Microsoft (MSFT), as well as from AI research organizations like OpenAI.\n\nCons of investing in semiconductor stocks\n\nGeopolitical risk: Taiwan is a crucial part of the global semiconductor industry, given TSM\u2019s position as the globally-dominant semiconductor foundry. That puts the industry at risk if, for example, China were to invade Taiwan, which Chinese leader Xi Jinping has indicated is a possibility.\n\nRegulatory risk: There\u2019s a downside to the importance and low headcount of the industry \u2014 governments increasingly see control of semiconductor technology as a national security matter. Many Western governments, including both the Trump and Biden administrations, have restricted semiconductor exports to China, hurting the sales of companies like NVIDIA and bringing volatility to semiconductor stocks.\n\nHow to buy semiconductor stocks\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in investing in semiconductor stocks, you\u2019ll need to open brokerage account first if you don\u2019t already have one.\n\nThen you\u2019ll need to choose between buying individual semiconductor stocks, or semiconductor exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nIndividual semiconductor stocks\n\nIndividual semiconductor stocks, as mentioned above, can provide market-beating returns. But there is always the possibility they'll trail the market at points, too.\n\nSemiconductor shares also can be expensive, which could make some companies unaffordable for investors whose brokers don\u2019t offer fractional shares (the ability to buy less than 1 share at a time).\n\n\u00bb Dive deeper: See the best brokers for buying fractional shares\n\nSemiconductor stock ETFs\n\nAnother option is to invest in semiconductors via semiconductor ETFs, which can give you exposure to dozens of semiconductor stocks in a single purchase, and often for much less than the cost of one NVIDIA share.\n\nIt\u2019s still important to research ETFs before investing, just as you would research stocks. Check out an ETF\u2019s holdings, expense ratio and historical performance before buying.\n\nTrading options on semiconductor stocks\n\nSome traders use options to speculate on high-volume stocks such as semiconductor stocks. Traders might buy call options if they think a semiconductor stock might rise in price, or they might buy put options if they think it will fall in price.\n\nHowever, these techniques may not be right for novice investors.

While these tests don't involve complete chip designs yet, they represent a crucial step toward potential manufacturing contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThe path forward isn't entirely smooth. Sources say Intel has pushed back its timeline for supporting certain contract customers to mid-2026, primarily due to delays in qualifying essential intellectual property rights for the 18A process.\n\nIntel projects its foundry revenue will reach $16.47 billion in 2025, though most of this will come from manufacturing its own chips. The segment's performance has been rocky, with sales dropping 60 percent last year. The company doesn't expect to reach profitability in this division until at least 2027.\n\nAd\n\nAd THE DECODER Newsletter The most important AI news straight to your inbox. \u2713 Weekly \u2713 Free \u2713 Cancel at any time Please leave this field empty\n\nHigh-profile partnerships emerge amid uncertainty\n\nWhile Intel has secured agreements with Microsoft and Amazon for 18A chip production, specific details about products and volumes remain unclear. AMD is also evaluating the 18A process, though it's unknown if testing has begun.\n\nThe new manufacturing technology marks Intel's entry into the Angstrom era of chip production. According to Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi, Intel's foundry performance currently sits between TSMC's most advanced process and its previous generation.\n\nThe competitive landscape might shift toward cooperation.

            "content": "As winter starts to wrap up and we head into March, one thing is clear: Artificial intelligence (AI) investing will still be a major theme in 2025. As a result, investors need to ensure their portfolios are properly positioned to take advantage of this massive investment trend.\n\nI have four stocks that look like top-notch buys in March. They can be divided into two categories: AI facilitators and AI hardware providers.\n\nAI facilitators: Alphabet and Meta Platforms\n\nAlphabet (GOOG 1.82%) (GOOGL 1.87%) and Meta Platforms (META 2.29%) are two key companies facilitating the AI arms race. Both have generative AI models to offer potential users, with Alphabet's Gemini and Meta's Llama models. How these two models are set up and utilized is entirely different, but each has a strong user base.\n\nBy facilitating the AI arms race, each is locking in a potential user base, which will pay off over the long term. Because Meta's model is free to use, it does not benefit from a subscription cost. Instead, it's using all the data it gets from being a free-to-use platform to train future models. Gemini is available as a free offering, but a premium subscription unlocks further capabilities. However, Alphabet has also woven its Gemini model into its primary business: Google Search.\n\nAI has a huge effect on both companies, and each is heavily investing in its AI capabilities to ensure that the demand is met. Furthermore, each stock sold off substantially over the past week, as the broad tech market weakness hit both. This opens up a potential investment opportunity, as each is fairly priced, considering their growth levels.\n\nAt 26 times forward earnings (Meta) and 19.5 times forward earnings (Alphabet), each stock looks like a very strong buy, considering how much they benefit from the AI trend. I think each is a great buy in March, and investors should use this near-term weakness to their advantage.\n\nAI hardware: Taiwan Semiconductor and ASML\n\nNone of these AI innovations would be possible without chip manufacturers and suppliers' equipment, which is why Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 3.63%) and ASML (ASML 1.91%) made this list.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, making chips for many of the world's most advanced tech companies. It's seeing a massive boom on its AI chip side, with management expecting around a 45% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years for its AI-related chips. That's a massive growth rate, and it shows the high demand for hardware to power all the AI innovations.\n\nHowever, Taiwan Semi has to buy machines to fulfill this capacity, which is where ASML comes in.\n\nASML is the only company in the world that makes extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, which lay microscopic traces on a chip. The chip technology we enjoy today wouldn't be impossible without its machines. Furthermore, ASML's technological monopoly is protected by decades of research and billions of investment dollars, so it will be almost impossible to unseat it from its leadership position.\n\nBoth ASML and Taiwan Semi are key beneficiaries of the AI arms race but also benefit from the general proliferation of chip usage. Fortunately for investors, each stock is also priced at an attractive entry point.\n\nBoth of these prices for TSMC's and ASML's stock are reasonable, considering their market leadership positions in their respective industries. These stocks look like fantastic buys in March, and investors should use any weakness to load up on them. Thanks to the AI arms race, they should be long-term market winners.",

This target suggests a potential upside of over 40% from its current price. Analysts, led by Alexander Duval, are optimistic about ASML's revenue guidance for 2025, projected between \u20ac30 billion and \u20ac35 billion. This optimism is based on the company's robust order book, which minimizes risks from potential client delays.\n\nThe report highlights several factors that could drive ASML's growth. Progress in Intel (INTC) and Samsung's (SSNLF) foundry operations, accelerated capacity expansion by TSMC (TSM) and SK Hynix, and improvements in its IBM (IBM) business could help ASML reach the upper end of its revenue guidance. Additionally, the expansion of ASML's 2nm capacity is expected to boost demand for its tools in the coming years, particularly in the DUV market outside of China. The increase in EUV orders for the 2nm node is anticipated to continue for several years, as maximum construction capacity for this node will not be reached soon.\n\nHowever, any revenue growth will depend on the sustained strength of the advanced logic market and stability in foundational markets. ASML remains confident in China's market potential, expecting it to contribute about 20% of the group's sales by 2025. Despite potential regulatory restrictions, ASML believes the impact on its service business will be limited.\n\nOverall, Goldman Sachs maintains an optimistic outlook for ASML, despite risks such as EUV delivery delays, cyclical capital expenditures, and adverse market share changes.",

While the company exceeded expectations, its revenue of $23.9bn, up 7% year-over-year, slightly missed analyst consensus from Visible Alpha.\n\nA key driver of growth was Dell\u2019s (DELL) servers and networking division, where revenue surged by 37%, reaching $6.6bn. This rise was fuelled by strong demand for both AI and traditional server products.\n\nLooking forward, Dell (DELL) anticipates significant growth in its AI business. For the fiscal year ending in January 2026, the company expects to ship $15bn worth of AI servers, marking a 50% increase over the $9.8bn shipped in the prior fiscal year.\n\nRead more: Will Nvidia remain the stock market's AI darling? Yahoo Finance readers have their say\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well positioned to capture growth across every segment of our business,\u201d Jeff Clarke, vice chairman and chief operating officer, said. \u201cOur prospects for AI are strong, as we extend AI from the largest cloud service providers, into the enterprise at-scale, and out to the edge with the PC.\u201d\n\nStill, Dell (DELL) said its gross margin in the fiscal year will decline one percentage point from a year earlier. AI hardware has squeezed the company\u2019s profitability, largely due to the need for expensive chips from Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nTotal earnings, excluding some items, will be about $9.30 a share on sales of $101bn to $105bn in the fiscal year ending in January 2026, the Texas-based company said in the statement. Analysts, on average, projected profit of $9.24 a share on revenue of $103bn.\n\nAlibaba (BABA)\n\nShares in the e-commerce company were lower in pre-market trading, as were most Asian equities, as the world\u2019s second largest economy prepares for fresh tariffs to be imposed by Donald Trump.\n\nThe Chinese president said: \u201cAt present, the unfavourable impact of changes in the external environment has deepened, and China\u2019s economy still faces numerous difficulties and challenges.\u201d\n\nXi Jinping, who was writing in the ruling Communist Party\u2019s official journal, said: \u201cAt the same time, it must be recognised that China\u2019s economic fundamentals remain solid, with numerous advantages, strong resilience, and vast potential.\n\n\u201cThe conditions supporting long-term growth and the overall positive trajectory have not changed.\u201d",

            "content": "Welcome back to the Wolf of Harcourt Street Newsletter.\n\nEvery month, I'll provide you with an update on my portfolio, including all of the transactions, the current allocation, and my buy list. In addition, I'll share a recap of the articles you may have missed from the previous month.\n\nTransactions\n\nASML (ASML)\n\nI opened a position in ASML, a stock that has been on my watchlist for almost two years. Since the news of DeepSeek broke in January, I have been conducting extensive research into the area of semiconductors and AI. For better or worse, I realised that I have little to no direct exposure to AI, with only indirect exposure via the hyperscalers and Meta. This was intentional, as I did not feel comfortable investing in Nvidia and similar companies due to their complexity. This is where ASML comes in. It sits at the beginning of the value chain, developing and manufacturing machines used to produce semiconductor chips. If Nvidia and others are chasing the gold rush, then ASML is selling the shovels.\n\nGenerative Value\n\nAs you can see in the excellent chart above from\n\n,\n\ncustomers are the foundries such as\n\nand\n\n.\n\nhas a monopoly in\n\n, and for good reason. The complexity of these machines is such that more than 100,000 components are sourced from specialty providers. The average price of an\n\nmachine is close to \u20ac400 million.\n\nWhat I find attractive about ASML at the moment is that it has not seen the explosion in earnings and revenues that other AI stocks like Nvidia have. Revenue only grew by 3% in 2024, but this is because it is a cyclical business. As ASML comes out of this trough, revenue is expected to grow by double digits over the next couple of years as the first modules of its TwinScan EXE:5200 will be delivered to customers. Intel has already received the first two cutting-edge lithography machines from ASML, which are now in production at its factories. Early results showed that the machines can do what previously took three exposures and about 40 processing steps with just one exposure and a single-digit number of processing steps.\n\nLast year, TSMC began construction of its first \u20ac10 billion semiconductor plant in Germany, expected to be operational by 2027. This plant will need machines supplied by ASML.\n\nFinally, ASML is not just an AI play. Its business is diversified well beyond this area, as semiconductor chips are in everything from household appliances to smartphones and electric vehicles. At 29 times forward earnings, I think this is a reasonable valuation for a business that could grow earnings at a compounded annual growth rate of close to 20% over the next three to five years.\n\nKoyfin\n\nUber (UBER)\n\nUber reported strong Q4 earnings earlier this month, yet the stock sold off by 8%. While I don\u2019t spend much time trying to predict market behaviour, this reaction really puzzled me. I initiated this position in December, and while it had already provided double-digit returns, it was still quite small, so I used this opportunity to add to my position. The very next day, the stock recovered and soared even higher as Bill Ackman disclosed that he had accumulated a $2 billion position. This was another great example of the importance of doing your own objective work rather than reacting to short-term price movements.\n\nThe full earnings review is linked below.\n\nPayPal (PYPL)\n\nI decided to sell my full position in PayPal, worth 1% of my portfolio, after it reported Q4 earnings. PayPal is in a tough spot at the moment and is in turnaround mode with a new CEO at the helm. When the stock was trading below $60 in 2024, I had even considered adding to the position. In hindsight, I probably should have sold when the stock hit $90, as this was always a turnaround play despite owning the stock for several years.\n\nPersonally, I see no reason to own PayPal over a business like Adyen, other than comparative valuations. Cheap is not always better, and cheap stocks are often cheap for a reason. Adyen is continuing to thrive, while PayPal\u2019s Braintree has completely ground to a halt, only growing 2% in Q4. While overall revenue grew 7%, a large-cap business growing revenue and earnings at low single digits is not where I want to allocate capital when there are so many better opportunities out there.\n\nWhat made this decision easier was the fact that this position represented only 1% of my portfolio, and I am looking to consolidate my holdings. If I wasn't prepared to increase my weight, there was little point in holding such an immaterial position.\n\nAllocation\n\nMarket value\n\nSector\n\nI\u2019ve been using Portseido to track my portfolio for years, and I highly recommend it. It consolidates all my transactions in one place, while its data visualisation and analytics capabilities guide my future decision-making and, ultimately, enhance my returns.

This month saw very positive developments in the UK. This week, InPost launched label-free delivery in the UK. Until now, InPost was only available to customers who bought items from online retailers. Now, customer-to-customer deliveries are available, starting at \u00a31.99, undercutting Royal Mail\u2019s lowest price of \u00a33.25. RIP Royal Mail.\n\nEarlier in the month, InPost expanded its locker network at Aldi stores in the UK. First trialled in December 2023 and rolled out to 22 stores across the UK in March 2024, the lockers have received positive feedback from customers and have now expanded to 260 stores.\n\nLastly, the InPost app reached 14 million users in Poland this month, with 7.5 million using InPost Pay despite it only being launched one year ago. 22 times forward earnings for a business with such a long growth runway ahead of it feels too cheap to ignore.\n\nASML (ASML)\n\nASML is a new position, and one that I would like to build into a much larger weight. I am very comfortable adding below \u20ac700.\n\nIn Case You Missed It\n\nSome of the articles you might have missed during the past month:\n\nShare\n\nFinal Words\n\nFebruary was an extremely busy month for me, with a lot of earnings to cover. I\u2019ve shared a number of reviews already, and you can expect more to come in March, starting with Sea Limited next week. The standout performers this month were Adyen and Mercado Libre, which is quite apt given they are my two largest positions. Despite a very strong start to the year for the portfolio, I am still seeing plenty of opportunities to deploy new capital. As the broader market index has remained relatively flat, these opportunities could become even better.\n\nIf you'd like to support the work of an independent analyst, you can buy me a coffee.

            "content": "Intel has revised the construction schedule for its Ohio One semiconductor manufacturing site in New Albany, Licking County, delaying its launch to the next decade. The first phase (Mod 1) will now be completed in 2030, with production starting between 2030 and 2031. Mod 2 is set to finish in 2031, with operations launching in 2032. The company is slowing down the facility's construction to align its investments with market conditions. However, Intel stressed that it could accelerate construction if needed.\n\nIntel originally planned to complete the first phase of its Ohio site \u2014 once called the Silicon Heartland \u2014 in 2025. However, massive investments amid uncertain demand made Intel push the completion of the first module to 2027 or 2028. Now, the company believes it will need its fabs in Ohio only in 2030 and beyond. The delay suggests that it does not expect demand for its production capacity to skyrocket soon, which may be a not-so-positive development. On the other hand, Intel will also not have to invest heavily in its Ohio site now, which is good news for the company's balance sheet as it is struggling to return to profitability. Investments in production equipment are the most significant investments in semiconductor fabrication facilities, so by delaying them, Intel significantly cuts its capital expenditures for the 2025 \u2013 2028 period.\n\nThe upcoming campus will cover approximately 1,000 acres (4 square kilometers), accommodate up to eight semiconductor fabrication plants, and foster space for support operations and industry partners. Intel previously estimated that fully developing the site would require an investment of around $100 billion. The first round of investments was set at around $28 billion.\n\nGiven the new schedule for the Ohio One (or the Silicon Heartland?) fabs, expect the new facilities to use process technologies that the company will develop after its 14A and 14A-E, currently set for 2026 \u2013 2027 introduction. These nodes will rely on ASML's Twinscan EXE:5200 or more advanced High-NA EUV tools that cost $350 million per unit.\n\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\n\"We are taking a prudent approach to ensure we complete the project in a financially responsible manner that sets up Ohio One for success well into the future,\" wrote Naga Chandrasekaran, executive vice president, chief global operations officer and general manager of Intel Foundry Manufacturing, in a message to employees. \"We will continue construction at a slower pace, while maintaining the flexibility to accelerate work and the start of operations if customer demand warrants, but I want to be upfront and transparent with you all about our current plan.\"\n\nIntel began work at the site in 2022. Since then, construction at the site has advanced significantly. The project recently reached a milestone as the underground foundation was finished, and construction above ground has begun. According to Intel, since the beginning of the construction, the site has accepted 36 superloads (through February 4), including four extra-large superloads containing the fabs' air separation units. More than 6.4 million labor hours have been invested, covering key installations such as underground piping, 200,000+ cubic yards of concrete, and sub-utility trenches (SUTs). Office structures are also taking shape.\n\nOne interesting thing about the Ohio fab is that despite the revised timeline, hiring has already begun, with Ohio employees training in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon ahead of the local facility's launch. Presumably, Intel is training employees to install production tools and other machinery. Workforce initiatives are set to expand as operational dates approach.",

            "content": "\u201cEngineers are often in too much of a hurry to find solutions. We don't take enough time to get to the bottom of a problem and understand the context,\u201d says Jeroen Voeten, scientific director of the High Tech Systems Center (HTSC) at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). This may sound paradoxical: our society faces significant challenges, like the energy transition. It may appear ideal for engineers to speed up and discover solutions, but this is tougher in practice.\n\nAccording to Voeten, those working quickly towards a solution often have the wrong one in mind. It is, therefore, essential to fully understand a problem before looking for solutions. Overseeing the whole scenario is the pre-eminent task of systems engineers. Examples are the completion of a process in a company or the development of a fully-functional product.\n\nBuilding a bridge\n\n\u201cSystems engineers build the bridge between the technology and the user. To translate this into a system design, you need to have knowledge of various domains and understand the language of the other disciplines,\u201d says Tom Castenmiller, Senior Systems Engineer at ASML and fellow at the HTSC. Engineers currently acquire this knowledge after years of experience in the field. \u201cA good systems engineer can deal with uncertainties and act on his intuition by identifying and objectifying them. Training to learn the basic principles of design and to experience how uncertainties play a role in the design process is thus important. It can be done, for example, through a challenge-based learning project.\u201d\n\nSpecial quality\n\nSystem thinking is not a skill that can be quickly learned, agrees Pascal Etman, associate professor of Mechanical Engineering at the TU/e. \u201cIt is an attitude or a quality that is not present to the same degree in everyone. It is good that students are already introduced to this way of working during their training. They can build their careers around it if it appeals to them.\u201d\n\nPascal Etman \u00a9Bart van Overbeeke\n\nAccording to Ton Peijnenburg, CTO at VDL Enabling Technologies Group and fellow at the HTSC, learning and developing systems thinking is essential even after finishing studies. \u201cGraduating does not make you a good systems thinker - and it doesn't happen by itself. It is important to continue developing yourself in this area.\u201d That is why the NXTGEN Hightech program includes a continuous learning path for systems engineering.\n\nDifference between complex and complicated In systems thinking, we often discuss complex problems. But what exactly are they? There is a clear difference between a complicated problem and a complex one. Castenmiller explains: \u201cA complicated problem is an issue with various aspects, but the facets and associated disciplines are clearly defined. This is also the most prominent difference with a complex problem. Different aspects arise when dealing with a complex problem, and not all the components are precise yet. Information is still lacking, which means you are dealing with more uncertainty. The consequences of choices are not evident in advance. That makes it much more challenging to arrive at solutions. In those kinds of cases, systems thinking is vital to make progress.\n\nChip machines\n\nChip machines are a good example of complex systems. \u201cThey must work with extreme precision, productivity must be incredibly high, and there is virtually no room for error,\u201d says Castenmiller. The TU/e is among the world's top universities regarding research in the semiconductor industry. To remain at the forefront, the university wants to strengthen its key position in the coming years, including through the Future Chips Flagship. Through its research, the university contributes to solving technological challenges in the semiconductor industry and, through education, trains the much-needed talent in the sector.\n\nVoeten: \u201cIn the future, companies in the chip industry, such as ASML and NXP, will need each other even more to develop the next generation of chips. That is why it is important to put systems thinking on the map in the Netherlands.\u201d\n\nCastenmiller thinks one step further: \u201cUltimately, other industries that utilize similar qualities and skills can also learn from the experiences we gain in the high-tech sector. This way, we can better use each other's knowledge.\u201d\n\nTraining more systems engineers\n\nThe increasing complexity of technologies is driving up the demand for systems engineers. The TU/e is investigating possibilities for training more and better systems engineers. \u201cPreviously, knowledge was transferred from a professor or mentor to a student. That knowledge was mainly focused on one specific field,\u201d says Voeten. Future designers and engineers need to be able to look beyond disciplines. That is why the HTSC organized a symposium on 18 February on system engineering and complexity in high-tech equipment, together with NXTGEN Hightech program from the National Growth Fund.\n\n\u00a9 Bart van Overbeeke\n\nChallenge-based learning\n\nThe TU/e is taking various steps to teach students more about systems thinking and how to work together in multidisciplinary teams. Challenge-based learning is an integral part of this. Students work together in an interdisciplinary team and are given a challenge \u2013 by the teacher or from the business community \u2013 for which they must find a solution.\n\nIn that context, a group of students worked on an open challenge together with DAF. How can you make batteries for electric trucks as sustainable as possible, give them a second life, and make a business out of it? The truck manufacturer posed this question to a group of students. Voeten: \u201cStudents are not presented with a ready-made plan to solve the problem but with an open challenge. That helps them think creatively, work together, and deal with uncertainties.\u201d The thirty student teams on the TU/e campus also often work on multidisciplinary system challenges, gaining valuable experience. The teams focus on making mobility more sustainable or building a circular house, for example.\n\nEindhoven student team introduces new, circular car Up to 75% of the car materials can be reused at the end of its lifecycle, four times more than conventional cars. Read More\n\nNew methods for collaboration\n\nThe TU/e is researching how future systems engineers can work together more effectively. \u201cOne person can never oversee the entire system, so the weight of decisions must be distributed among several people,\u201d says Pascal Etman. \u201cBut decisions influence each other, requiring an integrated system solution. Formal models and methods from fundamental research can help improve such a decision-making process.\u201d\n\nCastenmiller: \u201cA good approach helps with complicated problems, but uncertainties play a role in complex issues. We do not know what will be technologically possible in three years, but we still have to consider that uncertainty in our choices.\u201d That is why researchers work with different scenarios. Etman adds: \u201cIn this way, we explore various possibilities and adjust where necessary. This specific way of working is not self-evident for many students. They have to learn to deal with this.\u201d\n\nCooperation is important\n\nPeijnenburg believes good cooperation between the university and the business community is vital to train good systems thinkers. Thanks to the Brainport collaboration, the TU/e has been connected to high-tech companies such as ASML, NXP, and Philips for years, and recently to their suppliers such as VDL. \u201cWe can fathom the complexity of the high-tech systems in the region. We work closely together and have a smooth way of doing business. Everyone is flexible and thinks along with us.\u201d\n\nKnowledge institutes and companies in the Brainport region understand the art of collaboration. That is fertile ground for improving systems thinking. Jeroen Voeten, scientific director of the HTSC, sees it the same way. \u201cBoth scientists and people from the business community feel the urgency to take steps in systems thinking. But it is not easy to put this into practice. A symposium helps people to meet each other and get a better grip on the concept of complexity in high-tech machine development. Together we look for the most optimal scenarios to remain successful in the region in the future.\u201d",

            "content": "Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.\n\nThe fortune of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is closely tied to Big Tech hyperscalers. Although the AI/GPU designer didn\u2019t name its largest clients in the latest 10-K filing on Wednesday, Nvidia\u2019s \u201cDirect Customers\u201d A, B, and C accounted for 36% of the company\u2019s total revenue for FY2024.\n\nGiven that these sales come from Nvidia\u2019s Compute & Networking division, it is safe to say these clients are likely from the Big Tech cluster such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms and even Tesla for its Grok 3 integration.\n\nIn turn, this dynamic between Big Tech and Nvidia is critical for the company\u2019s valuation. When the more cost-effective DeepSeek AI model came under the public spotlight, Nvidia\u2019s valuation plummeted by over $600 billion at the end of January, the largest panic sale in US stock history.\n\nAfter all, reduced assumed compute power means fewer data centers for Big Tech hyperscalers, lowering demand for Nvidia\u2019s AI chips. In other words, NVDA shareholders should account for the concentration risk in Nvidia\u2019s client profile. But how big of a risk is it?\n\nIs Microsoft Indicative of Data Center Slowdown Risk?\n\nOver the week, rumors sprung that Microsoft is scaling back on data center infrastructure. Namely, analysts from TD Cowen brokerage speculated, based on supply chain channels, that Microsoft cancelled data center leases worth \u201ca couple of hundred megawatts\u201d worth of capacity.\n\nSuch a rumor perfectly complemented the DeepSeek fallout. However, Microsoft promptly dismissed this speculation as unfounded.\n\n\u201cLast year alone, we added more capacity than any prior year in history. While we may strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions.\u201d Microsoft spokesperson to CNBC\n\nMicrosoft emphasized that there is no shift in \u201cany change to their DC [data center] strategy\u201d. By the end of fiscal 2025, it is expected that the company will deploy ~$80 billion into DC infrastructure, most of it located in the US.\n\nFor those who paid attention to the latest ASML earnings, Microsoft\u2019s rebuke of these rumors is not surprising. ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet believes that DeepSeek\u2019s compute cost optimizations will only serve to boost AI market penetration:\n\n\u201cA lower cost of AI could mean more applications. More applications means more demand over time. We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand,\u201d\n\nIt is anyone\u2019s guess how big of a client Microsoft is to Nvidia, but the aforementioned 36% share of the company\u2019s revenue ($35.1B) is relatively equally divided between three \u201cDirect Customers\u201d, at 12% (A) and 11% (B and C).\n\nEnding October for Q3, Direct Customers A, B, and C fully equalized at 12% quarterly revenue each. Given Microsoft\u2019s $14 billion investment in OpenAI by the end of 2024, in addition to its Azure cloud compute infrastructure, it is likely that Microsoft is \u201cDirect Customer B\u201d based on last year\u2019s prominent position of 13%.\n\nImage credit: Nvidia\n\nBy region, notwithstanding Singapore as invoicing and distribution hub, Nvidia owes its sales to the US the most at 47%, followed by Taiwan at 16% and China by 13%.\n\nImage credit: Nvidia\n\nFrom fiscal 2023 to 2025, Nvidia\u2019s sales to outside-US clients dropped from 69% to 53% of total revenue respectively, indicating that Nvidia will have to continue to work around US-imposed export controls.\n\nJoin our Telegram group and never miss a breaking digital asset story.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Next Wave of AI Scaling\n\nThe entire AI hype was built on Nvidia\u2019s H100 chips, securing the company\u2019s ~90% dominance in the AI training and infrastructure market. Even DeepSeek owes its training to H100 workloads, as somewhat nerfed H800s with similar compute power. Nvidia deployed these chips to circumvent the first wave of export controls in October 2022.\n\nNow that the AI market is more mature, diversified and AI models are more robust in their outputs, hyperscalers will count on Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell architecture. One such premium cluster, consisting of 36 CPUs and 72 GPUs, comes in the form of GB200 NVL72 solution, offering drastically greater performance than equivalent H100s.\n\nPerformance uptick of Nvidia\u2019s GB200 NVL72 platform. Image credit: Nvidia\n\nPrior to DeepSeek reveal, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described Blackwell demand as \u201cinsane\u201d in October. In the latest earnings call, Huang reiterated this bullish line, pointing to Blackwell demand as \u201cextraordinary\u201d.\n\nAnnualized, Nvidia\u2019s revenue jumped by 114% for fiscal 2024 to $130.5 billion. Compared to the LSEG estimate of $38.05 billion, Nvidia topped it at $39.33 billion for the quarter, boosting shareholder confidence at $0.89 earnings per share (EPS) vs $0.84 expected.\n\nBased on Blackwell demand, Nvidia now expects ~$43 million in Q1, with a 2% variation against the LSEG estimate of $41.78 billion. And just like ASML CEO, Huang too considers DeepSeek development as a boost to the entire AI sector.\n\n\u201cFuture reasoning models can consume much more compute. DeepSeek-R1 has ignited global enthusiasm. It\u2019s an excellent innovation. But even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model.\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in February\u2019s earnings call\n\nInvestors should also consider that DeepSeek might actually increase compute power demand by inviting more experimentation with different models that adopt some of its optimized workflows.\n\nMoreover, even if DeepSeek lowers the overall compute demand through efficiency improvements, it is exceedingly likely that text-to-video computation alone will push the demand envelope. According to Verified Market Research, text-to-video AI market size should have a CAGR of 36% between 2024 and 2031.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAt first glance, the demand for AI data centers might appear inflated compared to the tangible gains achieved so far, especially given the hard problem of AI confabulation. However, it would be shortsighted to overlook the transformative potential of AI as a revolutionary technology.\n\nThe current push to build AI-powered systems is not a fleeting trend but a deliberate, strategic effort. AI\u2019s applications are virtually limitless, ranging from mundane content generation to hegemony technology developed by Palantir.\n\nIn this context, Nvidia stands out as a first-mover with unmatched competitive advantage in this rapidly expanding sector. Since the initial wave of AI hype three years ago, Nvidia has consistently stayed ahead of the curve, with its Blackwell architecture now positioned as the next major upgrade cycle for the industry.\n\nIn turn, the Blackwell platform is poised to become the foundation for the next wave of AI application proliferation. Big Tech hyperscalers, through their cloud computing solutions, will drive this adoption, and Nvidia\u2019s market leadership ensures it remains the primary beneficiary of the resulting economies of scale.\n\nConsidering recent DeepSeek improvements, have you considered running your own local AI? Do you think such decentralization potential outside hyperscalers will further aid Nvidia?

            "content": "A small town in the Netherlands hosts the only factory that produces the only chip-making machines that generate a type of light found nowhere naturally on Earth: extreme ultraviolet, a light emitted by young stars in outer space.\n\nThis light, known as EUV, is the only way to make one of the world\u2019s most valuable and important technologies at scale: cutting-edge semiconductor chips. The factory is forbidden from selling its EUV machines to China.\n\nBelow we explain how the chips are made, why they have become the focus of the US-China trade wars, how Taiwan was drawn into the maelstrom, and what could come next. The answers take us from deep underground to outer space, from the dirtiest places in the world to the cleanest, from the hottest temperatures to the coldest, from man-made structures smaller than a virus to equipment so large it takes three planes to move, and finally, to a state in physics that is two opposites at the same time.\n\nHow are they made? Chips are made up of layers of thin, flat pieces of silicon \u2013 called wafers \u2013 that hold electric circuits. These circuits are comprised of billions of switches called transistors. Highly complex, powerful chips containing these networks of transistors are commonly referred to as semiconductors. If you want to make semiconductors, you\u2019ll need $380m. This is the cost of the latest EUV machine from Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography (ASML). Shipping is a nightmare: the machine is so large and so delicate that it requires 40 freight containers, three cargo planes and 20 trucks to transport it from the Dutch factory in Veldhoven. All this to create and focus light with wavelengths almost as short as X-rays, with enough energy to penetrate solid objects. Chipmakers strive to meet a prediction called Moore\u2019s law: that capacity \u2013 or the number of transistors on a chip \u2013 tends to double every two years. If chips are to stay the same size, and ideally get smaller, this means that transistors must be ever finer. ASML\u2019s machine carves the patterns into the silicon wafers that hold the transistors. The finer the patterns, the more computing power you can pack on to a chip. Marc Assinck, a company spokesperson, likens light wavelengths to the thickness of a pen stroke. The more detail you want on a page, the thinner your pen should be. EUV light has a wavelength so narrow that it is invisible to the human eye and passes right through most materials. The light is produced by firing a laser at microscopic balls of tin. The tin evaporates into plasma, and the plasma emits light, which is moved through the lithography machine, hitting specially made mirrors. The light is shone through a \u201cmask\u201d, which is the pattern of one layer of a chip, on to the wafer. The area exposed to light hardens and the area not exposed is dissolved in a chemical solution, leaving behind a 3D pattern. Think of a chip like a building with 100 floors. Each building takes four months to produce, and each floor has its own layout, only the features of this layout can be just 25 nanometres: smaller than particles of influenza viruses, which are about 100 nanometres. EUV and other lithography machines carve the patterns of these layers, one by one. The machines aren\u2019t easy to make. Like chips themselves, they\u2019re assembled in dust-free rooms, the cleanest spaces on earth. Chips function at the level of atoms: a single speck of dust can render them useless. View image in fullscreen Illustration showing semiconductor chip structure. Illustration: ASML\n\nWhy is Taiwan so important? ASML makes the machines that make chips, but it doesn\u2019t make the chips themselves. That is done, chiefly, by another remarkable company with another unremarkable name: TSMC, or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which produces nine in every 10 of the world\u2019s most advanced semiconductors \u2013 including those that power iPhones. Because Taiwan makes and supplies so many of the US\u2019s semiconductor chips, the US has an added interest in protecting Taiwan amid concerns that China will invade. How Taiwan secured semiconductor supremacy \u2013 and why it won\u2019t give it up Read more In 2022, the US convinced the Dutch government to place export controls on ASML\u2019s machines, restricting their sale to China. To date, ASML says, no EUV lithography machines have been shipped to China, which means that unless \u2013 or until \u2013 it invents its own EUV lithography machines, China will be working with technology a few years older, and less powerful, than that of western countries \u2013 deep ultraviolet lithography, for example, instead of extreme ultraviolet. These machines can still produce very complex chips at scale \u2013 just not as complex. Artificial intelligence, another technology in which the US and China are fiercely competing to advance, relies on among the world\u2019s most complex and powerful semiconductor chips. The leading designer of these chips is an American company called Nvidia. Its chips are produced by TSMC on machines made by ASML. 5:03 How China uses \u2018salami-slicing\u2019 tactics to exert pressure on Taiwan - video China\u2019s lack of access to EUV lithography explains why the debut of the Chinese chatbot DeepSeek came as such a shock to markets. A Chinese company produced a product as powerful as Chat GPT with less advanced \u2013 cheaper \u2013 technology. DeepSeek claims that it cost just $6m to train, compared with the billions of dollars spent by US companies to do the same thing. \u201cThe US believes that AI will be a transformative technology, impacting nearly every sector of the economy,\u201d says Chris Miller, the author of Chip War: the Fight for the World\u2019s Most Critical Technology. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t want China to gain an advantage.\u201d It is also crucial for defence and intelligence. The Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army has made \u201csignificant progress\u201d in its efforts to use AI in combat in recent years, according to the Centre for Security and Emerging Technology. But not everyone believes that China\u2019s access to ASML\u2019s machines should be restricted, including ASML. Asked at a Bloomberg conference in October how much the restrictions were really about security threats, its CEO, Christophe Fouquet, said: \u201cMore and more people are asking themselves this exact question \u2026 Is it really about national security?\u201d The debate might not need to continue for long: in 2024, Chinese company Shanghai Microelectronics Equipment (SMEE) revealed that, a year earlier, it had filed a patent for an EUV lithography machine.\n\nWhere do rare earths come in? China boasts other advantages over western countries in the race to produce chips. In addition to silicon, semiconductors require critical and rare earth minerals. Among the critical minerals are germanium and gallium. By 2030, gallium demand is projected to increase more than 350% from 2015 levels. Germanium demand is expected to double over the same period. China produces 98% of the world\u2019s raw gallium, and more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s raw germanium. Rare earths are a group of metals used in chips, as well as defence and green technologies, that are often particularly difficult to process. In 2024, China produced 60% of the world\u2019s rare earths, but processed 90%, according to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. This is one reason why Donald Trump is pressuring Ukraine into handing over its rare earths in exchange for aid, and why, after Trump\u2019s first meeting with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, the pair announced they had agreed to launch \u201ca recovery and processing initiative\u201d for rare earths.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this equipment supplier to semiconductor makers have returned +4.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry, which ASML falls in, has gained 2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nASML is expected to post earnings of $6.02 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +78.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +7.6%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $25.17 points to a change of +20.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $29.27 indicates a change of +16.3% from what ASML is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -9.7%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ASML is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, says.\n\n\u201cOur open and highly connected economy, a strength in an era of globalisation, may now be a vulnerability as the superpowers raise trade barriers and controls in a bid to stem leakage and diversions,\u201d he adds.\n\nNews reports of a US probe into whether China may have circumvented US restrictions on advanced Nvidia chips by buying them from third parties in other countries, including Singapore, recently put the Republic under the spotlight.\n\nIt is a sobering reminder that the global economic order, premised on open markets and multinationals spreading their supply chains across the world, will face greater stress as geopolitics and national security take centre stage, with US-China competition becoming a defining feature.\n\nKey nodes in high-tech sectors will come under greater scrutiny and face increasing risk of collateral damage.\n\nSingapore is particularly susceptible to a US-China tech confrontation, as host to a series of activities in the chips value chain \u2013 from research and development to testing and manufacturing.\n\nThe Republic\u2019s additional roles as a key transshipment hub along major sea lanes of communication and an attractive business hub for over 7,000 multinationals, with more than half making it their regional headquarters, mean more points of vulnerability.\n\nWhere will the new shockwaves come from?\n\nThe curbs reportedly under consideration by the Trump administration include further restrictions on the type and quantity of artificial intelligence (AI) chips that can be exported without a licence, and the addition of more Chinese firms to a list of trade entities that cannot receive US tech, goods and services without special US government approval.\n\nTrump officials are also expected to put greater pressure on key partners to further limit China\u2019s access to semiconductor equipment, especially Japan and the Netherlands, home to the two biggest firms that build chipmaking tools outside the US \u2013 Tokyo Electron and ASML \u2013 as well as Taiwan\u2019s TSMC, the world\u2019s largest foundry.\n\nThe news comes after DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, sent shockwaves across the global tech sector in January, claiming to have trained its AI model at a fraction of the cost and computing power needed by top US AI models like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Meta\u2019s Llama and Google\u2019s Gemini.\n\nMost recently, the US introduced a tiered approach to friendly countries that AI chips can go through.\n\nWill the US broaden restrictions to more chips, including trailing-edge ones previously assumed not to make a qualitative difference to China\u2019s computing power? Will it also tighten what can go through countries like Singapore?\n\nCan chips be regulated like weapons?\n\nThe implementation of any new US restrictions is not without challenges.\n\nDr Raska notes: \u201cIt would be very hard for any one government to regulate such dual-use technology as if they were weapons systems.\n\n\u201cDoing so would require restrictions across every part of the assembly line, which is a profoundly difficult endeavour, even if the US were to enact the strictest and most comprehensive regulations centred on end users.\u201d\n\nThe end-user certificate (or EUC) regime that governs arms sales ensures weapons are delivered only to approved recipients and not diverted to unauthorised parties.\n\nIt requires buyers to provide exporters with a legally binding document specifying the purpose and user of the equipment.\n\n\u201cEUC supply chains are also very well established, with clear exporters and customers. But how do you apply that to a technology like chips?\u201d Mr Alex Capri, senior lecturer at NUS Business School, asks.\n\n\u201cThe trouble also is that most governments do not have the resources available to be able to verify that such regulated technology ends up where it\u2019s supposed to go.\u201d\n\nHe thinks, however, that advances in regulatory technology like tracer dust could resolve that headache by employing microscopic particles that can track at all times products and verify their origin, and is already being deployed to fabrics and cocoa beans. But, he notes, this could create fresh legal challenges around data management, privacy and security.\n\nWhatever the case and in whatever form curbs materialise in, Singapore will have to tread carefully, given the high stakes.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament on Feb 18, Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng emphasised the importance of continued access to AI compute to the country\u2019s national AI ambitions.\n\n\u201cOur economic competitiveness is based on our commitment to the rule of law, zero tolerance for corruption, transparent regulations and an open, inclusive business environment.\n\n\u201cWe have painstakingly built up this reputation over time. That is why we take firm and decisive action against individuals and companies that violate our laws,\u201d Dr Tan said.\n\nForeign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, in response to questions, told Parliament that Singapore is not legally obliged to enforce the unilateral export measures of countries around the world.\n\n\u201cBut we will enforce the multilateral agreed-upon export control regimes,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Balakrishnan also emphasised that it is not in Singapore\u2019s national interest to be exploited, stressing that companies will not be allowed to use their links with Singapore to evade unilateral export control measures that apply to them.\n\nChina pushed to accelerate its learning curve\n\nDespite a slew of US restrictions rolled out since 2018 aimed at limiting China\u2019s access to the most advanced chips and slowing its tech development, China has, over the past two years alone, achieved an impressive series of technological breakthroughs across a range of industries years earlier than predicted.\n\nAfter Huawei\u2019s use of Google\u2019s Android was blocked in 2019, the company put thousands of engineers to work continuously in shifts over 24 hours to solve the problem and rewrite code.\n\nThe firm announced in November 2024 that its new smartphones and tablets from 2025 will run on a new operating system stripped of Android tech.\n\nThis same storyline of technological breakthroughs on an accelerated timeline is playing out across the wider Chinese economy, with China\u2019s first domestically made 7nm chip revealed in 2023, and on the defence front, its first fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, the J-35 Gyrfalcon, unveiled in 2024.\n\n\u201cChina is closing the technological gap and signalling that the days of American monopoly on advanced technologies across all domains may be coming to an end,\u201d Dr Raska says.\n\n\u201cThis fight in chips is only symptomatic of an intensifying competition for strategic technology.\n\n\u201cWe have seen how denying China access to high-end chips motivated the Chinese to put even more money and people behind the goal of catching up.\u201d\n\nLin Suling is senior columnist at The Straits Times\u2019 foreign desk, covering global affairs, geopolitics and key developments in Asia.\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.",

(Intel Corporation/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo)\n\nBy Stephen Nellis | REUTERS\n\nIntel on Monday said that the first two cutting-edge lithography machines from ASML Holding are \u201cin production\u201d at its factories, with early data indicating they are more reliable than earlier models.\n\nAt a conference in San Jose, California, Intel senior principal engineer Steve Carson said Intel has produced 30,000 wafers, the large discs of silicon that can yield thousands of computing chips, in a single quarter with ASML\u2019s high numerical aperture (NA) lithography machines.\n\nIntel last year was the world\u2019s first chipmaker to take delivery of the machines, which are expected to produce smaller and faster computing chips than earlier ASML machines. The move was a shift in strategy for Intel, which lagged rivals in adopting the previous generation of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines.\n\nIt took Intel seven years to put those earlier machines into full production, which contributed to it losing its lead to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Intel struggled with the reliability of those previous EUV models in the initial stages of production.\n\nHowever, Carson said ASML\u2019s new high NA machines are about twice as reliable as the earlier generation in initial testing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting wafers out at a consistent rate, and that\u2019s a huge boon to the platform,\u201d Carson said.\n\nThe new ASML machines, which print features onto chips using beams of light, can also do the same work as earlier machines using fewer exposures, saving time and money.\n\nCarson said early results at Intel\u2019s factories showed that the high NA machines can do what took earlier machines three exposures and about 40 processing steps with just one exposure and a \u201csingle digit\u201d number of processing steps.\n\nIntel has said it plans to use the high NA machines to help develop what it calls its 18A manufacturing technology, which is scheduled for mass production with a new generation of PC chip later this year.\n\nIt has said it plans to put the high NA machines into full production with its next generation of manufacturing technology called 14A, but has not given a mass production date for that technology.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Jose, California; Editing by Leslie Adler and Sam Holmes",

The company\u2019s exclusive technology in the advanced chip market has made it a highly sought-after asset.\n\nOften referred to as \"Korea\u2019s ASML,\" HPSP dominates the market for high-pressure hydrogen annealing equipment, securing major global chipmakers such as Samsung Electronics, TSMC and Intel as clients \u2014 similar to how Dutch firm ASML dominates the lithography equipment sector.\n\nGlobal PE giants eye stake\n\nThanks to its exclusive technology and lucrative business model, HPSP attracted five leading PE firms \u2014 KKR, Blackstone, Carlyle Group, Bain Capital and MBK Partners \u2014 in its preliminary bidding round earlier this month for the 40.9 percent controlling stake held by Crescendo Equity Partners.\n\nSince Crescendo acquired a 51 percent stake in 2017, HPSP\u2019s revenue has skyrocketed, surging from 24 billion won in 2018 to 1.59 trillion won in 2022, following its Kosdaq listing. In 2023, the company posted revenue of 1.79 trillion won and an operating profit of 95.2 billion won, achieving an impressive 53 percent operating margin.\n\nDespite strong investor interest, concerns remain over HPSP\u2019s high asking price and whether its technological advantage can be sustained long-term. Crescendo is reportedly seeking a sale price of around 2 trillion won, adding a significant premium \u2014 even though HPSP\u2019s current market capitalization stands at approximately 2.6 trillion won.\n\n\"HPSP's technological strengths, its client portfolio, its potential for growth and global expansion will be the key factors to determine the value of the company,\" an industry official said, adding that the surging demand for high bandwidth memory chips \u2014 the critical component in AI processors \u2014 will spur its growth.\n\nUnrivaled technology\n\nHPSP\u2019s high-pressure hydrogen annealing equipment is critical to the production of advanced semiconductors \u2015 an industry experiencing soaring demand amid the AI boom.\n\nDuring chip production, annealing \u2014 a heat treatment process \u2014 neutralizes defects and enhances ductility before transistors are assembled into semiconductor chips.\n\nTraditionally, annealing machines used heat or oxygen, but as chips shrink to 2-3 nanometers, the heat generated in conventional annealing can damage ultra-fine chip materials, which are more heat-resistant in larger chips.\n\nTo solve this issue, HPSP pioneered a method using high-pressure hydrogen gas, which lowers annealing temperatures from over 600 degrees Celsius to below 450 C, ensuring greater defect removal without material damage. However, the technology is extremely difficult to commercialize due to the high risk of hydrogen explosions.\n\n\"HPSP\u2019s market dominance will continue through at least 2026,\" Samsung Securities noted in a November 2024 report, highlighting that demand for its technology spans the entire semiconductor market, including memory chips, logic chips and foundries.\n\nKorea Investment & Securities also forecast that HPSP would maintain its market leadership for at least five years, citing the complex regulatory approval process for new competitors in handling hydrogen-based semiconductor technology.\n\nHigh price tag\n\nDespite HPSP\u2019s technological edge, several hurdles remain in closing the M&A deal, according to industry insiders.\n\n\"The biggest challenge will be addressing concerns that the company\u2019s stock price is inflated relative to its actual value,\" an industry official stated.\n\nSince HPSP is publicly traded, its market capitalization fluctuates with stock prices, making price negotiations difficult for potential buyers.\n\nWithout additional premiums, Crescendo\u2019s stake is valued at approximately 1 trillion won, yet the private equity firm is seeking a 100 percent premium in the deal.\n\nAdditionally, the complexity of HPSP\u2019s semiconductor technology presents a challenge for investment firms, which would need to scale the business before reselling it at a profit.\n\n\"The industry is too technical for a private equity firm to fully grasp,\" a PE firm executive reportedly said to a local media outlet, signaling their withdrawal from the bidding process.\n\nCrescendo aims to begin the main bidding process in the first half of this year and complete the deal before the end of this year.\n\nBy Jo He-rim (herim@heraldcorp.com)",

(Photo: Shutterstock)\n\nIntel has confirmed that two high numerical aperture (NA) lithography machines from ASML are now in operation at its manufacturing facilities, with initial production data suggesting improved reliability compared to earlier models. The semiconductor company, which became the first in the industry to receive ASML\u2019s high NA machines last year, reported that these systems have already processed 30,000 wafers in a single quarter. Wafers, the foundational material for semiconductor production, are used to fabricate computing chips at scale.\n\nIntel senior principal engineer Steve Carson, speaking at a conference in San Jose, California, outlined the performance of the new systems, stating that the high NA lithography machines have demonstrated approximately twice the reliability of previous extreme ultraviolet (EUV) models. \u201cWe\u2019re getting wafers out at a consistent rate, and that\u2019s a huge boon to the platform,\u201d Carson said.\n\nThe deployment of ASML\u2019s advanced lithography technology represents a strategic shift for Intel, which had faced setbacks in previous technology transitions. The company had been slower than competitors, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), in adopting the prior generation of EUV lithography tools. The integration of those systems had taken Intel seven years, contributing to delays in its manufacturing roadmap.\n\nASML\u2019s high NA lithography machines are claimed to introduce efficiencies in semiconductor production by reducing the number of exposures required during the photolithography process. Carson explained that operations that previously involved three exposures and approximately 40 processing steps can now be completed with a single exposure and a reduced number of steps. The streamlined process is expected to enhance production throughput and lower complexity.\n\nIntel prepares for 18A and 14A manufacturing using high NA EUV\n\nIntel plans to test the high NA lithography systems in its 18A manufacturing process, which is slated for mass production later this year alongside a new generation of PC chips. The company has also indicated that the machines will be integrated into its future 14A manufacturing technology, though a timeline for full-scale deployment has not yet been disclosed.\n\nASML\u2019s EXE platform, the latest generation of its high NA EUV lithography technology, is designed to enhance resolution and transistor density for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. According to ASML, EXE systems improve resolution by increasing the NA from 0.33 in NXE systems to 0.55. This advancement enables an 8 nm critical dimension, allowing for transistors that are 1.7 times smaller and 2.9 times denser than those produced using NXE systems.\n\nThe higher NA required larger mirrors, which altered the angle at which light strikes the reticle, reducing reflectivity and making pattern transfer more challenging. Instead of switching to larger reticles, ASML adopted an anamorphic optics approach, demagnifying patterns by 4x in one direction and 8x in the other. This design preserves traditional reticle sizes while improving resolution, allowing chipmakers to adopt the technology without significant changes to existing manufacturing processes.\n\nLast month, ASML reported stronger-than-expected financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by continued demand for its advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The company posted net sales of \u20ac9.3bn, surpassing its prior guidance, with a gross margin of 51.7% and net income of \u20ac2.7bn. Order activity also saw a significant increase, with net bookings reaching \u20ac7.1bn, more than doubling from the \u20ac2.6bn recorded in the third quarter. Of these orders, \u20ac3bn were attributed to EUV systems, highlighting ongoing investment in high-precision lithography technology.",

This layered approach, intoduced in the final week of the Biden administration, places countries into three categories, with a limited number of U.S. allies in the first group with unlimited access to U.S. technology. The second includes U.S. adversaries who cannot import any chips. The third features a majority of countries from the Middle East and Asia who would face a limit on the total amount of computing power they could import.\n\nIt comes after Trump signed a memorandum on Friday directing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to restrict Chinese investments in strategic areas. The memo said China is \u201cexploiting our capital and ingenuity to fund and modernize their military, intelligence, and security operations, posing direct threats to United States security.\u201d\n\nIs ASML a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nOverall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on ASML stock, based on five Buys and two Holds.

            "content": "Intel has started using two leading-edge ASML High-NA Twinscan EXE:5000 EUV lithography tools, the company revealed on Monday at an industry conference, Reuters reports. The company uses these systems for research and development purposes, and so far, Intel has processed tens of thousands of wafers using them.\n\nIntel installed and started using two High-NA EUV lithography tools from ASML at its D1 development fab near Hillsboro, Oregon, last year and has now processed as many as 30,000 wafers using these systems, Intel engineer Steve Carson revealed at the SPIE Advanced Lithography + Patterning conference. Intel was the first leading chipmaker to get High-NA EUV machines (which are believed to cost \u20ac350 million each) last year and plans to use them to produce its 14A (1.4nm-class) chips several years down the road.\n\nAdopting an all-new manufacturing tool ahead of competitors is important, as it enables Intel to develop various High-NA EUV manufacturing aspects (such as glass for photomasks, pellicles for photomasks, chemicals, etc.) that could eventually become industry standards. Also, ASML is poised to develop its Twinscan EXE:5000 High-NA EUV tools with feedback provided by engineers from Intel, which could give the American giant an edge over competitors over time.\n\nProcessing 30,000 wafers in a quarter is far below what commercial-grade systems can do. However, the number is massive for R&D usage, demonstrating how serious Intel is about becoming the leading chip maker in the High-NA EUV era.\n\nAlthough ASML considers its Twinscan EXE:5000 High-NA EUV lithography tools to be pre-production tools not designed for high-volume manufacturing, Intel has reportedly said these systems are \u201cmore reliable than earlier models.\u201d Still, the report does not elaborate on whether ASML\u2019s Twinscan EXE:5000 is more reliable than the company\u2019s pre-production Twinscan NXE:3300 tool from 2013, which was used to develop the existing EUV ecosystem, or the production-grade Twinscan NXE:3600D or NXE:3800E that are used for high-volume manufacturing (HVM) today. Considering that ASML uses similar light sources for NXE and EXE machines, they may indeed be very reliable.\n\nASML\u2019s Twinscan EXE High-NA EUV lithography tools can achieve a resolution of down to 8nm with a single exposure, a substantial improvement compared to Low-NA EUV systems that offer 13.5nm resolution with a single exposure. While current-generation Low-NA EUV tools can still achieve an 8nm resolution with double patterning, this lengthens the product cycle and can affect yields. High-NA EUV tools reduce the exposure field by half compared to Low-NA EUV systems, which require chip developers to alter their designs. Given the costs and peculiarities of High-NA EUV litho systems, all chipmakers have different strategies for their adoption. Intel clearly wants to be the first adopter, whereas TSMC is a little more cautious.",

Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo criticized Intel\u2019s 18A process, noting Panther Lake samples yield only 20-30%, far below mass production needs for late 2025, and highlighted organizational and supply chain weaknesses that lag behind TSM\u2019s foundry dominance.\n\ncriticized Intel\u2019s 18A process, noting Panther Lake samples yield only 20-30%, far below mass production needs for late 2025, and highlighted organizational and supply chain weaknesses that lag behind TSM\u2019s foundry dominance. Breakup rumors swirl as Broadcom (AVGO) targets Intel\u2019s design arm and TSMC (TSM) eyes its foundries, potentially valuing Intel at $167-$237 billion, though geopolitical and financial challenges threaten the feasibility of such a split.\n\nIntel\u2019s (INTC) push into the future of chipmaking took a tangible step forward as the company announced Monday that the first two high numerical aperture (High-NA) lithography machines from ASML Holding (ASML) are now operational in its factories, churning out 30,000 wafers \u2013 silicon discs that yield thousands of chips \u2013 according to senior principal engineer Steve Carson at a San Jose conference. These cutting-edge tools, which Intel received last year as the first chipmaker to adopt them, promise smaller, faster chips and early data suggests they\u2019re outpacing the reliability of their predecessors, a rare bright spot for a company wrestling with its identity and market position. Yet, even as Intel flexes this technological muscle, its broader narrative is clouded by breakup rumors, with Broadcom (AVGO) eyeing its design business and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) circling its foundries, a potential split that could value the semiconductor giant between $167 billion and $237 billion but faces steep hurdles from geopolitical risks and regulatory oversight.\n\nThe High-NA machines represent a lifeline for Intel, a once-dominant force now straining to reclaim its edge in a chip world ruled by specialists like TSM, the undisputed leader in pure-play foundry work. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo\u2019s recent X post casts a sharp shadow over these efforts, zeroing in on Intel\u2019s 18A process at its Foundry Services (IFS), where Panther Lake engineering samples are being tested by major PC makers but yield only 20-30%\u2014a far cry from the efficiency needed for mass production slated for late 2025. Kuo doesn\u2019t stop at technical gripes; he digs into Intel\u2019s organizational inefficiencies, supply chain struggles, and a culture that\u2019s failed to adapt to the cutthroat game of winning external foundry clients, leaving it exposed as TSM and others surge ahead.\n\nIntel\u2019s journey with ASML\u2019s machines is a microcosm of its high-stakes gamble to pivot from its legacy as a do-it-all chipmaker to a hybrid model that can compete in both design and fabrication. Producing 30,000 wafers is no small feat \u2013 each wafer could spawn thousands of advanced chips, potentially bolstering Intel\u2019s case as it fends off breakup speculation \u2013 but the 18A yield woes signal that the road to relevance is bumpy. A Broadcom-TSM carve-up could unlock shareholder value, offloading design to a high-margin player and foundries to a manufacturing titan, yet the financial burden of Intel\u2019s foundry overhaul and the specter of U.S.-China tensions complicate any deal. Carson\u2019s update in San Jose offers a glimmer of progress, but Kuo\u2019s critique underscores a deeper truth: Intel\u2019s technological strides must outpace its structural flaws if it\u2019s to avoid being a giant dismantled rather than revitalized.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The fund experienced an excellent quarter to end another successful year. The fund increased 11.7% (Institutional Shares) in the fourth quarter compared to a 7.1% gain for the Russell 1000 Growth Index and a 2.4% increase for the S&P 500 Index. For the full year, the fund returned 37.8% compared to 33.4% and 25.0% gains for the indexes. In addition, please check the fund\u2019s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2024 investor letter, Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund emphasized stocks such as ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML). ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is an advanced semiconductor equipment systems manufacturer for chipmakers. The one-month return of ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) was 6.82%, and its shares gained 22.20% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On February 21, 2025, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) stock closed at $737.21 per share with a market capitalization of $290.854 billion.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is a Dutch company that designs and manufactures photolithography equipment for semiconductor manufacturing. While ASML is the leader across all types of lithography, most importantly, it is the only manufacturer of extreme ultra-violet lithography tools, which are critical for the manufacturing of leading-edge chips. Shares fell 16.6% during the fourth quarter (finishing the year down 7.7%) on reduced guidance for 2025 as well as growing investor concerns about the potential impact of U.S. government restrictions on Chinese demand and the possibility of peaking lithography intensity. Despite near-term noise, we believe that the growing demand for chips in general and AI chips in particular will continue to support long-term growth for the wafer fab equipment industry with ASML\u2019s competitive positioning remaining unassailable. While lithography as a percentage of capital expenditure may decrease from current levels, the chip layer count requiring lithography will continue to increase, in our view, as chips continue to become more complex. As a monopoly on critical lithography tools supporting an industry with growing demand fueled by the proliferation of AI, we see strong long-term upside for ASML.\"\n\nIs ASML Holding N.V.

            "content": "When you hear about artificial intelligence (AI) investing, you may think of the software powered by the technology or the hardware that trains the model. However, investors should also think of the chips that go into these devices to power the AI models.\n\nThe chip market is a huge investment opportunity, as these companies make chips for all competitors in the AI arms race, making them a neutral way to invest in the trend. Two of my favorite companies in this space are Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 3.63%) and ASML (ASML 1.91%). Without these two, none of the technologies seen today would be possible, and both companies are vital suppliers in the AI arms race.\n\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a contract chip manufacturer, which means that companies like Apple and Nvidia design the chip, and then TSMC fabricates it. This is a great position to be in, as it allows TSMC to focus on being a top-notch manufacturer and not have to worry about marketing its products. Additionally, TSMC has the unique position of being able to sell to both sides of the competition, as TSMC manufactures chips for AMD as well as other custom AI accelerators that are competing against Nvidia for market share.\n\nAs a neutral party, TSMC also has a great view of the future demand for AI chips. Over the next five years, Taiwan Semi's management is extremely bullish on the prospects of its AI-related chips. They project these chips will grow revenue at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over that five-year period. That's rapid growth, and it all flows into the company's overall projected revenue growth rate of 20% for the next five years.\n\nClearly, TSMC has some massive tailwinds blowing in its favor, and thanks to its culture of continuous improvement, it will continue to be a top chipmaker for some time.\n\n2. ASML\n\nWhile ASML doesn't manufacture chips, it produces the machines required to make these cutting-edge chips. Its extreme ultraviolet lithography machines allow clients to lay the microscopic electrical traces on a chip, and it is the only company in the world with the technology to do so. This technological monopoly is unlikely to be overtaken, as it took decades of research and billions of investment dollars to get ASML where it is today.\n\nBecause ASML's machines are essentially a gateway to producing the world's most powerful chips, its machines are highly regulated. There are many machines that ASML cannot sell to China, as the Netherlands (where ASML is based) and the U.S. do not want the devices to fall into China's hands, which could allow them to gain an advantage over Western countries in many important fields. While ASML is still allowed to sell some of its lower-powered models, the list of what it is allowed to sell to China is continuously shrinking.\n\nThis caused ASML to tweak its 2025 revenue guidance from a range of 30 billion to 40 billion euros to 30 billion to 35 billion euros. However, this still indicates solid growth, as ASML generated 28.2 billion euros in sales during 2024.\n\nRegardless, ASML's machines are required in this high-end chip manufacturing process, so as the industry grows, so will its sales. TSMC's overall growth pace for the next five years (20% CAGR) is a good clue into the general direction of the chip market, and any growth there will help ASML's sales rise.\n\nWhy are they strong buys now?\n\nBoth stocks look attractively priced at their current levels. Taiwan Semiconductor is the cheaper of the two, trading for 22 times forward earnings.\n\nConsidering that the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.49%) trades at 22.5 times forward earnings, this shows that most investors value TSMC as a market-average stock. With how quickly Taiwan Semiconductor is expected to grow over the next five years, this seems like an error, and investors should use this cheap stock price now to their advantage to load up.\n\nASML isn't as cheap as Taiwan Semi, but its technological monopoly status is also priced into its stock.\n\nAt 30 times forward earnings, the stock is the cheapest it has been since the start of 2024, and this price isn't all that high when you factor in ASML's likely unassailable moat.\n\nWith both stocks trading at a discount to their normal valuations, I think right now is an excellent time to scoop up both companies and let them sit in your portfolio for at least five years. With the substantial growth expected in the chip market during that time, these two will likely crush the market and make you a solid profit along the way.",

The MSCI Europe Index\u2019s 1.1 per cent per-share earnings growth is also ahead of expectations of a 1.3 per cent decline.\n\nAlong with healthcare and financial companies, technology is one of three sub-indexes that has surprised most positively so far this season. That\u2019s with companies accounting for more than 70 per cent of the MSCI Europe index\u2019 market value having reported. While pharmaceutical companies and banks have been bright spots for European earnings in the past year, technology is a newcomer.\n\nThe sector\u2019s main growth drivers for the fourth quarter were ASML and Nokia, according to Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) strategists Kaidi Meng and Laurent Douillet. The main drag on the industry has come from STMicroelectronics and Infineon Technologies.\n\nWhile semiconductor companies themselves have struggled, the equipment makers are in better shape. Infineon and STMicroelectronics have \u201clow visibility\u201d and are still looking for the bottom in weak automotive and industrial end-markets, while their AI exposure remains limited compared with ASML, Sara Russo, a Bernstein analyst, said in an interview.\n\nASML, the biggest company in the sub-index by market value, reported bookings worth twice as much as analysts expected in the quarter. The company is set to benefit from surging demand for chipmaking machines, as companies are spending heavily on AI.\n\nBT in your inbox Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox. Sign Up Sign Up\n\nMeanwhile, Nokia\u2019s mobile networks division, which makes 5G equipment, showed signs of improvement after two years of operators holding back on expensive upgrades. Overall sales were also driven by an increase in the network infrastructure unit, where one \u201ckey focus area is the upcoming growth in data centres\u201d, outgoing chief executive officer Pekka Lundmark said on the earnings call.\n\nThe second-largest company in the sub-index, software giant SAP, is also embracing the AI boom. SAP raised its revenue outlook for 2025 and reported 29 per cent growth in its cloud backlog, as clients increasingly take up its AI business services offering.\n\n\u201cAI-driven growth has just started to show in the EPS (earnings per share)\u201d for companies such as ASML and SAP, BI\u2019s Meng said, adding that AI demand is still in an early stage. Beyond 2025 and 2026, the outlook for ASML will depend on whether AI adoption by end-users can justify even higher capital spending, BI\u2019s Douillet added.\n\nLooking ahead, estimates for the wider technology sector are trending higher, though a sustained recovery is not guaranteed, Meng and Douillet said. Threats include US tariffs, headwinds for the chip segment from lower electric vehicle demand and industrial manufacturing, and persistent economic weakness in China and Europe.\n\nTariffs could hurt primarily Infineon and STMicroelectronics, though the impact might trickle down to ASML, according to Bernstein\u2019s Russo.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s lower demand for chips because of tariffs, semiconductor companies may not buy as much equipment, but it\u2019s a second-order problem as opposed to a direct issue for ASML,\u201d she said.

The ETF owns big stakes in stocks like Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Apple, all of which soared in 2024.\n\nHowever, the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF isn't the best performer in the Vanguard family so far in 2025. Instead, it's an ETF that doesn't own a single share in Nvidia, Meta, Amazon, Apple, or any other so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stock. In fact, this Vanguard ETF doesn't hold any stock in the S&P 500.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nLook across the pond\n\nWhich Vanguard ETF am I talking about? It's the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF(NYSEMKT: VGK). This fund is up roughly 11% year to date, a higher return than any other Vanguard ETF.\n\nThe ETF's name gives away its focus. The Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF owns only the stocks of companies based in Europe. It attempts to track the performance of the FTSE Developed Europe All Cap Index, which includes companies located in the following major European markets: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThis Vanguard ETF currently owns 1,269 stocks. No single holding makes up more than 2.43% of the entire portfolio. The ETF's top five positions are German software company SAP, Dutch semiconductor-fabrication equipment leader ASML Holding NV, Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, Swiss food and beverage company Nestl\u00e9, and Swiss healthcare giant Roche Holding AG.\n\nLike all Vanguard ETFs, the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF is cost-effective for investors to own. Its annual expense ratio is a low 0.06% compared to an average of 0.93% for similar funds.\n\nWhy is this Vanguard ETF outperforming so far in 2025?\n\nThe Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF has emphatically not been the best Vanguard fund to own over the long term. Since its inception on March 4, 2005, the ETF's average annual return is only 5.14%. The S&P 500 delivered a return roughly 10.7 times higher during the period. Including dividends helps narrow the gap somewhat. However, the S&P 500's total return was still more than 3.6 times greater than the total return of the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF.\n\nThe Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF performed dismally in 2024. While the S&P 500 jumped 23%, this Vanguard ETF declined by nearly 2%.\n\nSo, what happened to turn things around this year? The simple answer is that several of the European stocks in the ETF's portfolio have started 2025 with a bang.\n\nFor example, SAP's shares have soared close to 17% year to date. Roche isn't far behind. British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca, Nestl\u00e9, Novartis, and British financial services giant HSBC Holdings, all top 10 holdings for the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF, have risen by double-digit percentages. Many European stocks have risen in recent weeks as expectations increased for a ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\nIs the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF a no-brainer buy?\n\nEverybody loves a winner. Is the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF a no-brainer buy? I wouldn't go that far.\n\nIt's not a bad idea to diversify your portfolio geographically. If you own nothing but U.S. stocks, adding the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF could be a practical thing to do.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that just because this Vanguard ETF is outperforming all other Vanguard ETFs now doesn't mean it will continue to do so. A deal to end hostilities between Russia and Ukraine could fail to materialize. The prospect of steep tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on European imports could also derail the momentum of the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF.\n\nWe're less than one-sixth of the way through 2025. While the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF could deliver solid gains this year, I predict other Vanguard ETFs will be bigger winners before the year is over.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The MSCI Europe Index\u2019s 1.1% per-share earnings growth is also ahead of expectations of a 1.3% decline.\n\nAlong with health care and financial companies, technology is one of three sub-indexes that has surprised most positively so far this season. That\u2019s with companies accounting for more than 70% of the MSCI Europe index\u2019 market value having reported. While pharmaceutical companies and banks have been bright spots for European earnings in the past year, technology is a newcomer.\n\nThe sector\u2019s main growth drivers for the fourth quarter were ASML Holding NV and Nokia Oyj, according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Kaidi Meng and Laurent Douillet. The main drag on the industry has come from STMicroelectronics NV and Infineon Technologies AG.\n\nWhile semiconductor companies themselves have struggled, the equipment makers are in better shape. Infineon and STMicro have \u201clow visibility\u201d and are still looking for the bottom in weak automotive and industrial end-markets, while their AI exposure remains limited compared with ASML, Sara Russo, a Bernstein analyst, said in an interview.\n\nASML, the biggest company in the sub-index by market value, reported bookings worth twice as much as analysts expected in the quarter. The company is set to benefit from surging demand for chipmaking machines, as companies are spending heavily on AI.\n\nMeanwhile, Nokia\u2019s mobile networks division, which makes 5G equipment, showed signs of improvement after two years of operators holding back on expensive upgrades. Overall sales were also driven by an increase in the network infrastructure unit, where one \u201ckey focus area is the upcoming growth in data centers,\u201d outgoing chief executive officer Pekka Lundmark said on the earnings call.\n\nThe second-largest company in the sub-index, software giant SAP SE, is also embracing the AI boom. SAP raised its revenue outlook for 2025 and reported 29% growth in its cloud backlog, as clients increasingly take up its AI business services offering.\n\n\u201cAI-driven growth has just started to show in the EPS\u201d for companies like ASML and SAP, BI\u2019s Meng said, adding that AI demand is still in an early stage. Beyond 2025 and 2026, the outlook for ASML will depend on whether AI adoption by end-users can justify even higher capital spending, BI\u2019s Douillet added.\n\nLooking ahead, estimates for the wider technology sector are trending higher, though a sustained recovery is not guaranteed, Meng and Douillet said. Threats include US tariffs, headwinds for the chip segment from lower electric vehicle demand and industrial manufacturing, and persistent economic weakness in China and Europe.\n\nTariffs could hurt primarily Infineon and STMicro, though the impact might trickle down to ASML, according to Bernstein\u2019s Russo.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s lower demand for chips because of tariffs, semiconductor companies may not buy as much equipment, but it\u2019s a second order problem as opposed to a direct issue for ASML,\u201d she said.",

That\u2019s even as DeepSeek\u2019s lower cost model raises issues over artificial intelligence spending.\n\nKey Points About This Article\n\nUp about $38 a share, Dutch semiconductor giant ASML reported a substantial jump in fourth-quarter net bookings, which tells us demand for its chipmaking tools is still strong.\n\nNet bookings, a key indicator of demand, were up to 7.09 billion euros, which is up about 170% from its third quarter. It was also well above estimates for 3.99 billion euros.\n\nPlus, analysts argue the reaction to DeepSeek was overblown.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for more stock ideas, don\u2019t forget to grab a copy of our \u201cThe Next NVIDIA\u201d report that\u2019s free. It details the war between NVIDIA and one stock that rose 114% in 2024. The report is loaded with research on top AI stocks and is available complimentary for a limited time.\n\nIn its latest quarter, the company posted net sales of 9.26 billion euros ($9.64 billion), as compared to estimates for 9.07 billion euros. Net profit came in at 2.69 billion euros, as compared to estimates for 2.64 billion euros.\n\nNet bookings, a key indicator of demand, were up to 7.09 billion euros, which is up about 170% from its third quarter. It was also well above estimates for 3.99 billion euros.\n\nWith regards to DeepSeek, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet says he doesn\u2019t see any signs of a slowdown in demand for AI-focused chips. Instead, he says \u201cA lower cost of AI could mean more applications. More applications mean more demand over time. We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand,\u201d as quoted by CNBC.\n\nMaking it even more attractive, ASML just declared a dividend of 1.52 euros, which is payable on February 19. The company also expects to declare a total dividend for the year of 6.40 euros which is about 5% higher year over year.\n\nAnalysts are Just as Bullish\n\nGoldman Sachs just reiterated a buy rating with a price target of 1,010 euros. All after strong earnings and expectations of continued strength in advanced memory. The firm added that ASML expects its 2025 business to go back to a more normalized sales ratio.\n\nBank of America reiterated its buy rating with a price target of 803 euros. The firm is bullish on strong earnings and expectations of a sales drop of 16% quarter over quarter, which is still 9% above Wall Street expectations.\n\nDeepSeek Reaction Was Also Overdone\n\nIf you're looking for a reason to be bullish, consider this. Analysts at Citi pointed out that US companies still maintain a substantial advantage thanks to sophisticated chips.\n\nPlus, according to Cantor Fitzgerald, the AI advancement with DeepSeek is \u201cvery bullish\u201d for chip stocks, \u201cciting the increasing demand for processing power as artificial general intelligence comes closer to reality,\u201d as noted by Investing.com.\n\nBernstein analysts also say the Street\u2019s reaction was overblown.\n\n\u201cI am not of the belief that we're anywhere close to the cap on compute needs for artificial intelligence,\u201d said the analysts, as quoted by Yahoo Finance. \u201cI'm of the belief that if you're freeing up compute capacity, it likely gets absorbed \u2026 We're going to need innovations like this if you're going to be able to keep things going.\u201d\n\nOther analysts say the latest innovation will help create more solutions with less overhead expenses, which will eventually lead to higher EPS numbers.\n\n\u201cIf DeepSeek is everything they're saying, this is ultimately positive for productivity around the world for all sectors \u2026 it certainly isn't the end of the story of the US exceptionalism and productivity,\u201d added Principal Asset Management, as also quoted by Yahoo Finance.",

Sometimes research that changes the investing world can come from the halls of academia. Partha Mohanram is a great example of this. While academic research has shown that value investing works over time, it has found the opposite for growth investing. Mohanram turned that research on its head by developing a growth model that produced significant market outperformance. His research paper \"Separating Winners from Losers among Low Book-to-Market Stocks using Financial Statement Analysis\" looked at the criteria that can be used to separate growth stocks that continue their upward trajectory from those that don't. Mohanram is currently the John H. Watson Chair in Value Investing at the University of Toronto and was previously an Associate Professor at the Columbia Business School.\n\nAdditional Research Links\n\nTop NASDAQ 100 Stocks\n\nTop Technology Stocks\n\nTop Large-Cap Growth Stocks\n\nHigh Momentum Stocks\n\nTop Chip Stocks\n\nHigh Insider Ownership Stocks\n\nAbout Validea: Validea is aninvestment researchservice that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

His inaugural message stressed the importance of a \u201crapid ramp-up\u201d of foundry production using the 2-nm process.\n\nKim Hyung-jun Kim of South Korea\u2019s Next-Generation Intelligent Semiconductor Foundation Group and Seoul National University told the Korea Economic Daily that if Taiwan Semiconductor could employ Intel\u2019s .U.S factories, it could help boost the former\u2019s market share to ~75% (up from 64.9% in the third quarter of 2024) at the cost of Samsung, which has a 9.3% market share.\n\nNeedham\u2019s Charles Shi expects the takeover to lead to capital efficiency, a long-term negative for Semiconductor Capital Equipment (Semicap) companies. Shi noted that the takeover would negatively impact ASML Holding ASML and KLA Corp KLAC due to the cancellation or scaling back of Intel\u2019s aggressively pushing high-NA EUV program.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nPhoto by wakamatsu.h via Shutterstock",

            "content": "Source The Motley Fool\n\nIt's only February, but it's already been a wild year for semiconductor stocks.\n\nThe launch of a new chatbot from Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek led to the biggest single-day loss ever in value for the chip sector. DeepSeek claimed to have spent just $5.5 million to train its model and used more efficient architecture to generate results that were similar to state-of-the-art \"frontier models\" from the likes of OpenAI, Alphabet, and others.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nSince then, investor nervousness has settled down as big tech companies have reaffirmed their commitment to spending on capital expenditures to drive progress in artificial intelligence. All of the big cloud infrastructure companies and Meta Platforms pledged to increase spending on capex, which should drive more revenue toward Nvidia and the rest of the semiconductor sector.\n\nOne of the stocks that is poised to win over the long term from the AI boom is ASML (NASDAQ: ASML), the leading maker of lithography equipment used to make semiconductors. Let's take a look at three reasons why ASML looks like a good bet to outperform the market.\n\n1. The stock is on sale\n\nThe semiconductor equipment sector operates on a different cycle than chipmakers do, and demand has been underwhelming in recent quarters. Restrictions on exports to China have also weighed on the sector.\n\nAs a result, ASML stock is now down 32% from its peak last July, but for patient investors, that sell-off sets up a buying opportunity.\n\nThe company is on track to return to growth in 2025, forecasting revenue of 30 billion to 35 billion euros, or 15% growth from the 28.3 billion it reported in 2024.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the company also delivered solid sequential growth and reported strong bookings of 7.1 billion euros, indicating that the plunge in bookings in the third quarter was just a one-time blip. In addition to ASML's revenue forecast, the company also sees gross margin improving from 51.3% to between 52% and 53%, which should pay off on the bottom line.\n\n2. The company has a wide economic moat\n\nThere's no shortage of commentary about the importance of competitive advantages, but ASML has one of the strongest economic moats in tech.\n\nThe company, which has been developing lithography equipment for decades, is the only producer of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) equipment in the world, and EUV machines are necessary for making the most advanced chips. ASML's machines work by using light to transfer complex circuit patterns onto silicon wafers.\n\nThese machines are very expensive and complex, creating high barriers to entry, as no other company has the technology to match ASML. As billions from TSMC, Intel, and others pour into new foundries, ASML looks well positioned to benefit as semiconductor manufacturers are poised to increase spending over the coming years.\n\n3. The AI tailwind is coming\n\nWhile AI has taken over the narrative in the semiconductor industry, the majority of the industry is still devoted to conventional chips.\n\nHowever, AI demand will drive growth for ASML.\n\nOn the fourth-quarter earnings report, CEO Christophe Fouquet said, \"Artificial intelligence has become the key driver for growth in our industry at this moment.\" He also noted that strong AI demand could lead to additional capacity coming online, which would lead the company to hit the high range of its guidance.\n\nBased on increasing demand for high-performance computing and high bandwidth memory, the company expects 2030 revenue of 44 billion to 60 billion euros, which represents 13% annual growth at the high end of that range.\n\nAdditionally, the company sees gross margins moving significantly higher to between 56% and 66%, which would drive significant growth in profit.\n\nIf AI stocks keep climbing, ASML is well positioned to be a winner.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $850,946!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

While good news for shareholders, the company has traded much higher in the past year. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let\u2019s examine ASML Holding\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.\n\nView our latest analysis for ASML Holding\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In ASML Holding?\n\nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It\u2019s trading around 10% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy ASML Holding today, you\u2019d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is \u20ac817.69, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since ASML Holding\u2019s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nCan we expect growth from ASML Holding?\n\nENXTAM:ASML Earnings and Revenue Growth February 17th 2025\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. ASML Holding's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 72%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in ASML\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on ASML, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.",

            "content": "Late last year, Tom Miedema, Walter Scott Investment Manager visited ASML\u2019s headquarters in Veldhoven, Netherlands, to hear directly from management about the company\u2019s strategy and growth outlook. While third-quarter results had triggered a sector-wide sell-off, largely due to timing-related factors, in Walter Scott view, the long-term case for ASML remains strong.\n\nWhy ASML matters\n\nASML is the dominant player in lithography, the process of transferring patterns onto silicon wafers using light. Importantly, the company holds a monopoly position in the most advanced iteration of the technology, extreme ultra-violet (EUV). Capable of producing incredibly small and complex patterns, EUV allows manufacturers such as TSMC and Intel to compress more transistors on a single semiconductor. Without it, securing the massive computational power demanded by AI chips would be extremely challenging. ASML is one of the few companies that can legitimately claim to be indispensable to the AI revolution.\n\nReflecting its linchpin status in the global semiconductor supply chain, the company\u2019s fortunes are often viewed as a barometer for the wider industry.\n\nIn late 2024, ASML reported a slight downgrade to its 2025 outlook and a drop in quarterly orders, triggering a 16% decline in its share price and broader semiconductor sector volatility. This news was interpreted by some investors as a worrying indicator for both ASML and for others in the semiconductor ecosystem. However, Walter Scott took a more measured view, seeing little to undermine the long-term investment case, outlined below.\n\nA question of time\n\n1. Delayed Capex: Samsung and Intel, both major customers of ASML, have been deferring capex due to the ongoing struggles of their semiconductor businesses. Both are suffering from low production yields and a lack of customer interest in their efforts.\n\nThe result is a deferral of capex and a requirement for less leading-edge lithography equipment over the next few quarters. TSMC, ASML\u2019s largest customer, is the obvious beneficiary of this and would ultimately replace demand should Samsung and Intel fail to sort out their challenges.\n\n2. Weaker memory demand: Slower-than-expected recovery in DRAM and NAND memory has led key industry players such as Micron, Samsung, and Hynix to defer spending by a few quarters. However, with new fabrication plants under construction, demand for ASML\u2019s technology remains. The only question concerns timing.\n\nBack to normality: China\u2019s contribution to ASML revenues",

DeepSeek claimed to have spent just $5.5 million to train its model and used more efficient architecture to generate results that were similar to state-of-the-art \"frontier models\" from the likes of OpenAI, Alphabet, and others.\n\nSince then, investor nervousness has settled down as big tech companies have reaffirmed their commitment to spending on capital expenditures to drive progress in artificial intelligence. All of the big cloud infrastructure companies and Meta Platforms pledged to increase spending on capex, which should drive more revenue toward Nvidia and the rest of the semiconductor sector.\n\nOne of the stocks that is poised to win over the long term from the AI boom is ASML (ASML 1.91%), the leading maker of lithography equipment used to make semiconductors. Let's take a look at three reasons why ASML looks like a good bet to outperform the market.\n\n1. The stock is on sale\n\nThe semiconductor equipment sector operates on a different cycle than chipmakers do, and demand has been underwhelming in recent quarters. Restrictions on exports to China have also weighed on the sector.\n\nAs a result, ASML stock is now down 32% from its peak last July, but for patient investors, that sell-off sets up a buying opportunity.\n\nThe company is on track to return to growth in 2025, forecasting revenue of 30 billion to 35 billion euros, or 15% growth from the 28.3 billion it reported in 2024.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the company also delivered solid sequential growth and reported strong bookings of 7.1 billion euros, indicating that the plunge in bookings in the third quarter was just a one-time blip. In addition to ASML's revenue forecast, the company also sees gross margin improving from 51.3% to between 52% and 53%, which should pay off on the bottom line.\n\n2. The company has a wide economic moat\n\nThere's no shortage of commentary about the importance of competitive advantages, but ASML has one of the strongest economic moats in tech.\n\nThe company, which has been developing lithography equipment for decades, is the only producer of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) equipment in the world, and EUV machines are necessary for making the most advanced chips. ASML's machines work by using light to transfer complex circuit patterns onto silicon wafers.\n\nThese machines are very expensive and complex, creating high barriers to entry, as no other company has the technology to match ASML. As billions from TSMC, Intel, and others pour into new foundries, ASML looks well positioned to benefit as semiconductor manufacturers are poised to increase spending over the coming years.\n\n3. The AI tailwind is coming\n\nWhile AI has taken over the narrative in the semiconductor industry, the majority of the industry is still devoted to conventional chips.\n\nHowever, AI demand will drive growth for ASML.\n\nOn the fourth-quarter earnings report, CEO Christophe Fouquet said, \"Artificial intelligence has become the key driver for growth in our industry at this moment.\" He also noted that strong AI demand could lead to additional capacity coming online, which would lead the company to hit the high range of its guidance.\n\nBased on increasing demand for high-performance computing and high bandwidth memory, the company expects 2030 revenue of 44 billion to 60 billion euros, which represents 13% annual growth at the high end of that range.\n\nAdditionally, the company sees gross margins moving significantly higher to between 56% and 66%, which would drive significant growth in profit.\n\nIf AI stocks keep climbing, ASML is well positioned to be a winner.",

            "content": "ASML Holding N.V. ( ) saw a decent share price growth of 19% on the ENXTAM over the last few months. Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let\u2019s take a look at ASML Holding\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Is ASML Holding Worth?\n\nAccording to our valuation model, ASML Holding seems to be fairly priced at around 10% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy ASML Holding today, you\u2019d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is \u20ac817.65, then there isn\u2019t much room for the share price grow beyond what it\u2019s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because ASML Holding\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company\u2019s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\n\nCan we expect growth from ASML Holding?\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 72% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for ASML Holding. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in ASML\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on ASML, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nSo if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

            "content": "The run-up in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks has attracted numerous investors into the sector. Given the anticipated potential for returns and the recent run-up in some AI-related names, determining return potential can become challenging.\n\nAmid that focus, investors may often forget the two stocks most responsible for manufacturing the hardware that makes AI possible: ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) (NYSE: TSM). Both play different but essential roles in the manufacturing process, and while one could not exist without the other in their current forms, only one is more likely to deliver higher returns.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nThe state of two businesses\n\nOf the two companies, ASML appears to have the edge on which is the more foundational technology. ASML has had (at least until recently) a monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. This technology makes it possible to manufacture the world's most advanced chips.\n\nIndeed, researchers from Japan have developed technology that makes EUV lithography simpler and more cost-effective. That could bring companies such as Nikon and Canon, which serve the more competitive deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography segments, into ASML's market. However, until alternate products emerge, investors should assume ASML remains dominant.\n\nIt is that dominance that makes TSMC dependent on ASML to provide the equipment that allows it to make the world's most advanced chips. TSMC takes chip designs from Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, and others, producing the chips for such clients.\n\nIndeed, it has competitors such as Samsung and Intel. Also, a heavy concentration of facilities in Taiwan prompted Western governments to try to move more chip production to North America and Europe.\n\nNonetheless, TSMC has established a technical lead in chip production, allowing it to claim 62% of the foundry market, according to TrendForce. That factor alone probably makes it indispensable, despite political pressures.\n\nComparing the financials\n\nThanks to the dominance of a part of the market involved with making semiconductors for AI, both stocks can beat the market over time. Still, the question as to which can more likely outperform the market may lie in the financials.\n\nIn the first three quarters of 2024, ASML reported 19 billion euros ($19.6 billion), a 6% yearly decline. Analysts blame slowing demand in China. That pullback trickled down to the company's net income, which dropped to 4.9 billion euros ($5.0 billion) in the first nine months of the year, down from 5.8 billion euros in the same year-ago period.\n\nIn contrast, TSMC remains in growth mode, with its $63 billion in revenue for the first nine months of the year up 32% yearly. Expense growth roughly stayed in line with revenue, so its comprehensive income of $26 billion for the first three quarters of 2024 surged 33% higher over the previous 12 months.\n\nNot surprisingly, the divergent financials meant that TSMC dramatically outperformed ASML over the last year.\n\nTSM Chart\n\nTSM data by YCharts\n\nDespite those returns, ASML has a higher P/E ratio of 39, compared to 33 for TSMC. Nonetheless, investors should take the valuation history of both stocks into consideration.\n\nASML has had an average P/E ratio of 43 for the last five years, so it is comparatively cheap at the moment. Conversely, TSMC has averaged a 24 earnings multiple over the same timeframe, signaling it could pull back if business conditions worsen.\n\nASML or TSMC?\n\nAdmittedly, the valuation averages make choosing between these AI stocks a more difficult call, but I still think investors are more likely to earn higher returns from TSMC.\n\nIndeed, the fact that TSMC needs ASML more than the other way around should bode well for ASML. Still, with the shrinking revenue, it is likely cheaper for a reason.\n\nIndeed, paying a higher-than-average earnings multiple on TSMC makes it riskier. However, a 33 times earnings multiple is relatively inexpensive for an AI stock. Moreover, the AI boom means TSMC benefits from rapid revenue and earnings growth. That factor should make paying the relative valuation premium less risky and, ultimately, lead to higher investor returns going forward.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming our world, promising to revolutionize everything from human interaction and environmental stewardship to space exploration. This technological revolution, driving us toward what's known as Industry 5.0 (the next phase of industrialization, characterized by human-centric, sustainable, and resilient production through human-machine collaboration), is creating immense opportunities for innovative companies.\n\nTwo such companies at the forefront of this AI-powered future are chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and ASML (NASDAQ: ASML), a lithography giant specializing in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology. Both have already seen significant growth thanks to the AI boom, but their potential for future returns remains strong.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nWhich of these top AI stocks is the better buy right now? Let's break down their core value propositions and risk factors to find out.\n\nA humanoid robot working on a laptop.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: The chipmaker making the AI revolution possible\n\nNvidia is the dominant force in AI hardware, powered by its industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs) and Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) -- a software platform that enables developers to harness GPU computing power for AI applications. This powerful combination creates a wide competitive moat, though competition from other chipmakers and potential alternative AI solutions pose long-term risks.\n\nBeyond hardware, Nvidia is strategically expanding into AI software and robotics, particularly in healthcare, diversifying its revenue streams and strengthening its position in the broader AI ecosystem. However, the emergence of potentially more efficient AI models like China's DeepSeek and the cyclical nature of its gaming GPU business create uncertainty around near-term demand.\n\nTrading at approximately 30 times forward earnings compared to the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 24 times, Nvidia's premium valuation reflects its strong position in the AI market. The tech stock also pays a minimal dividend yield of 0.03%, meaning its shares are better used as a growth vehicle rather than an income generator.\n\nIn short, Nvidia's value proposition lies in its AI leadership and ongoing ecosystem expansion, with key risks including competition, evolving AI technologies, and gaming market cycles.\n\nASML: A monopoly at the heart of the AI boom\n\nASML is the undisputed leader in lithography equipment, holding a near-monopoly on the crucial extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology required for manufacturing the most advanced chips. This dominance creates a wide economic moat, driven by substantial R&D investments and deep relationships with key customers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), Intel, and Samsung, making it incredibly difficult for competitors to emerge.\n\nASML's machines, while expensive, deliver value to chipmakers by reducing the cost per wafer through increased productivity. The long lifespan of these machines, often exceeding 30 years, generates significant recurring revenue through service contracts and high-margin upgrades, further bolstering ASML's financial strength.\n\nHowever, ASML's stock trades at a premium to the S&P 500, with a forward earnings multiple of 29.3 times, reflecting its crucial role in the semiconductor industry and the ongoing AI boom. While the stock's dividend yield is a modest 0.95%, the company's growth prospects and dominant market position are the primary drivers of investor interest.\n\nDespite its strong position, ASML faces some risks. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry can impact demand for its high-priced equipment. Additionally, increasing geopolitical tensions and potential export restrictions, particularly concerning China, could negatively affect ASML's growth trajectory.\n\nWhich stock is the better buy?\n\nWhile both companies are exceptionally well-positioned in the AI revolution, ASML emerges as the more compelling investment at current valuations. Its monopolistic position in EUV technology makes it essential to all major chipmakers, including Nvidia. This unique market position, combined with its robust recurring revenue model and slightly lower valuation multiple, provides a more balanced risk-reward profile.\n\nNvidia remains an outstanding company with tremendous growth potential, but its direct exposure to AI market sentiment and gaming cycles introduces more near-term volatility. ASML's fundamental role in semiconductor manufacturing offers a similar tailwind with greater insulation from market swings, making it the better choice for investors seeking AI exposure with a wider margin of safety.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "The market\u2019s memory is still fresh when it comes to the volatility induced by the NVIDIA Co. NVDA flash sell-off that came from the DeepSeek debacle in China. However, the relationship between NVIDIA and China goes well beyond that recent incident. What investors may or may not know is that this connection goes back over eight years.\n\nThat\u2019s right, since 2017, according to an initial public offering (IPO) prospectus, NVIDIA has been a partner with another Chinese company, WeRide Inc. WRD, which focuses on the automotive sector with a particular interest in autonomous driving and logistics. Whether this relationship has anything to do with today\u2019s chipmaking rivalry between the United States and China is up for debate. However, there are other angles that can be taken from this relationship.\n\nFor example, China is leading the way in global electric vehicle demand, which, according to the latest research done by Albemarle Co. ALB, now represents up to 60%. With this in mind, the partnership between NVIDIA and WeRide can be taken as a potential backdoor strategy to supply China with the chips it needs to make autonomous driving a reality.\n\nNot a Recent Collaboration\n\nWhile WeRide stock surged over 63% in a single day following the news, NVIDIA\u2019s investment in the company wasn\u2019t recent. The stock is up so much because, as WeRide has just gone public in the fourth quarter of 2024, the information behind NVIDIA\u2019s holdings is now becoming mainstream.\n\nThis might have been taken as a misrepresentation of a recent purchase. However, it merits some bullishness in WeRide nonetheless since one of America\u2019s largest companies in the technology sector should have a very strong reason to partner with WeRide in the first place.\n\nAccording to WeRide's IPO prospectus, this investment involves NVIDIA providing the graphic processing units (GPUs) needed for WeRide to develop its autonomous driving and logistics fleet according to its demand and needs projections. In return, NVIDIA would share in the success by being an equity stakeholder.\n\nNow, most of these shares held by NVIDIA in WeRide are still in what\u2019s called a \u201clock-up period,\u201d meaning that NVIDIA cannot dispose of them until the period ends, considering they were pre-IPO shares. With this in mind, there are a few things to consider moving forward for NVIDIA shareholders and for those feeling like they\u2019re missing out on WeRide.\n\nThe Market\u2019s Take on News\n\nWhat investors need to focus on now is the impact that this sudden spike in valuation for WeRide might have on NVIDIA, especially as the company is getting ready to report its latest quarterly earnings results. First is the fact that over $4 billion in market capitalization has been created for NVIDIA\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nSecond, the stock's potential to keep moving higher would only add more value to NVIDIA. According to accounting standards, this could be taken as \u201cOther income\u201d if NVIDIA chooses to report this increase in valuation from equity holdings that way, meaning that earnings per share (EPS) could come out better than expected.\n\nThis is, of course, why the stock was up over 1.7% the same day WeRide spiked and why the market is still willing to pay such massive premiums for NVIDIA. Not only does NVIDIA trade at 90% of its 52-week high today, but the market is willing to pay a 32.7x forward price-to-earnings (P/E) valuation for it.\n\nCompared to peers like ASML Holding ASML, which trades at only 23.8x forward P/E, this premium shows investors the market\u2019s willingness to overpay for NVIDIA\u2019s future earnings. When the market shows this high level of conviction, investors would be best served by not fighting against it.\n\nMore than that, some Wall Street analysts, such as those from Tigress Financial, have reiterated their bullish outlook for NVIDIA ahead of its earnings announcement. These analysts not only kept a Strong Buy rating on NVIDIA stock but also placed a $220 per share valuation on the company, which calls for up to 60.3% upside from today\u2019s price.\n\nUltimately, what matters is whether the market will be right to pay such a high premium for NVIDIA\u2019s future earnings. Considering Wall Street earnings per share (EPS) forecasts for the second quarter of 2025, which land at $3.28, a fourfold increase in the stock\u2019s EPS indeed seems to justify today\u2019s premiums, which are only expanded by this boost in WeRide\u2019s valuations.\n\nBefore you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.\n\nOur team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.\n\nThey believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...\n\nSee The Five Stocks Here\n\nThe article \"NVIDIA's Hidden AI Play: The Truth Behind Its WeRide Investment\" first appeared on MarketBeat.",

CEO Hamed Sadeghian announced these plans amid growing demand for their measurement technology, driven primarily by the AI boom in the chip industry.\n\nSadeghian revealed the plans in an interview with Reuters. The Rotterdam-based company, which counts Samsung among its clients, already announced this week that it has received multiple orders from a U.S. customer. Additionally, the company intends to open offices in the United States.\n\nInnovative Measurement Technology\n\nFounded in 2016, Nearfield Instruments raised \u20ac135 million in July from investors, including Walden Catalyst and Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, Temasek. The company employs atomic force microscopy to measure silicon wafers, allowing it to work with dimensions smaller than most wavelengths of light. This enables Nearfield\u2019s equipment to detect defects in chip manufacturing processes, ideally at an early stage.\n\nPreviously, Nearfield Instruments secured \u20ac17.5 million in 2021 and \u20ac27 million in 2023. At the end of 2023, the company also received government subsidies for further development, with the then-Rutte IV cabinet allocating \u20ac230 million to Nearfield, NXP, and ASML.\n\nExpanding Applications\n\nWhile the technology is primarily used for advanced processors, the company is also seeing growing interest from memory chip manufacturers and producers of older chip generations in the automotive and telecom sectors.",

            "content": "Netherlands Unveils Comprehensive Policy Updates Amid Socioeconomic Challenges From boosting startups to ensuring raw material supplies, the Dutch government addresses key issues affecting the nation\u2019s economy and integration efforts.\n\nThe Netherlands is making strides to address various challenges facing its economic and social fabric through recent policy updates aimed at bolstering the startup ecosystem, securing raw materials supply, retaining international students, supporting language education, and mitigating housing risks.\n\nPrime Minister Dick Schoof has recently acknowledged the slowdown of startup funding and the need for government intervention. Speaking at TechLeap's annual event, Schoof revealed plans to reduce bureaucratic barriers and increase investment in artificial intelligence, which is pivotal for boosting the tech sector. According to TechLeap's report, there has been a stark drop in the number of startups securing significant investments, with the percentage of firms receiving over \u20ac100,000 plummeting. Although venture capital investment increased by 47% in 2024, most funding came from foreign investors, indicating potential deficiencies within the domestic investment environment.\n\nHighlighting the urgency of the matter, Schoof emphasized, \"If we do not act quickly, Europe risks trailing behind the United States and China.\" Eindhoven, the home of chip manufacturer ASML, serves as a major economic driver; the concerns raised about the sustainability of this growth are palpable, especially as the country produced only two unicorns last year, namely hotel software provider Mews and AI auditing firm DataSnipper. Streamlined regulations and targeted investments, as promised by the government, are envisioned to reinvigorate the nation\u2019s startup ecosystem.\n\nOn another front, the Dutch government has announced it will strictly monitor the supply of raw materials, deemed \"critical\" for the green transition. With materials like lithium and cobalt playing fundamental roles in electric cars and wind turbines, the Ministry of Economic Affairs outlined plans to identify supply risks and reduce reliance on non-European sources. The establishment of the Nederlands Materialen Observatorium (NMO) is aimed at fostering collaborations between knowledge institutions and the business community to bolster resilience and independence.\n\nDirk Beljaarts, the Minister of Economic Affairs, remarked, \"The Netherlands is taking its responsibility to tackle high-risk European dependencies,\" acknowledging the country's limited natural resources. Europe\u2019s heavy dependence on external nations, particularly Russia and China, raises red flags for the future of the energy sector. The EU mandates ambitious targets for raw material extraction, refining, and recycling by 2030, emphasizing the urgency for domestic production to counter vulnerabilities.\n\nMeanwhile, the education sector is also witnessing significant changes as the Dutch government grapples with declining international student enrollment amid competing global markets for talent. According to the Universities of the Netherlands (UNL), international undergraduate enrollment has decreased by 6% to its lowest level since the COVID-19 pandemic. This decline has been attributed to the government\u2019s strategies to limit English-language programs and stricter immigration policies.\n\nCaspar van den Berg, chair of UNL, expressed concern over these measures, stating, \"The labor market is missing out on highly qualified talent.\" Recognizing the economic contributions of international graduates, the government has initiated measures to retain these individuals, including the introduction of the \"Orientation Year\" residence permit, allowing them to seek employment post-graduation. Yet, the overall retention rate remains low compared to competitors like France.\n\nLegislators across political parties are beginning to advocate for policies to facilitate the retention of international students\u2014this shift is particularly evident as regions like Limburg face demographic challenges linked to declines in foreign student populations.\n\nFurther addressing integration challenges, State Secretary for Participation and Integration Jurgen Nobel announced new initiatives to improve language acquisition among foreign nationals, particularly those not required to participate in mandatory civic integration programs. The government seeks to empower employers to play significant roles in providing language training. This shift, coupled with increased funding for local authorities, aims to equip newcomers with the language skills necessary for socioeconomic integration.\n\nNobel underscored the urgency of these measures, especially for vulnerable groups, including migrants from Ukraine and labor migrants from the EU. The emphasis on language skills ties directly to the larger narrative of integration, as language is seen as pivotal for job acquisition and social participation.\n\nA final pressing issue relates to housing stability, where Minister Mona Keijzer has revealed shocking statistics: 425,000 buildings across the Netherlands are at risk of foundation problems due to climate change effects and inadequate infrastructure. The introduction of the \u201cpand zakking kaart\u201d aims to inform homeowners of areas susceptible to sinking foundations. While the government is creating funding provisions, Keijzer cautioned homeowners about the burdens of repairs.\n\nConcerns over property values have arisen, with warnings from economists about significant declines as panic sets among homeowners aware of potential costs. Addressing the need for legislative measures to protect both buyers and sellers, the government is exploring solutions alongside stakeholders, including banks and real estate agents.\n\nWith these multifaceted issues at the forefront of national policy, the Dutch government shows determination to adapt and innovate. Whether it\u2019s fostering the tech sector, ensuring access to necessary materials, supporting international talent, enhancing language skills, or resolving housing concerns, the urgency to tackle such challenges reflects broader societal needs and aspirations. The interplay between these policies will signify how effectively the Netherlands positions itself as both resilient and future-ready.",

The company was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between Advanced Semiconductor Materials International and Phillips in order to develop lithography systems for the semiconductor industry. The company\u2019s vision and mission is helping chipmakers advance global technology for the better of mankind, the company\u2019s IPO was in 1995.\n\nThese systems are used to embed layer upon layer of information onto microchips using a variety of methodologies. The three main segments of ASML Holdings operations are lithography, metrology, and inspection-related systems for the memory and logic semiconductor industry. The company\u2019s claim to fame is its ability to empower chipmakers to mass produce patterns in silicon. Two of the key areas of advancement are the resolution of projection the company is able to achieve and the size (very small) of the chips its products can make.\n\nASML Holding was formerly known as ASML Lithography Holding N.V. but changed its name in 2001. The company is headquartered in Veldhoven, the Netherlands and has operations in Europe, North America, Japan, China, and Taiwan among others. ASML Holdings employs more than 32,000 people including 122 nationalities working in more than 60 locations globally but the road to succes was not without difficulty. ASML Holdings nearly went out of business in the late \u201880s but an investment from Phillips board member Henk Bodt and the development of the PAS 5500 lithography system sealed the company\u2019s fate. The PAS 5500s turned out to be such an advancement in microchip lithography there are many still in use today.\n\nASML is the only company currently offering Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography systems to the chipmaking industry and the technology is widely used. The lithography systems project and imprint a pattern onto the chip and then repeat the pattern over and over again building layers of patterns that drive its functionality. Because ASML Holdings technology is so widely used, it is highly likely the device you are using to read this company profile is powered by chips made with ASML devices.\n\nThe company not only provides extreme ultraviolet lithography systems but it also manufactures deep ultraviolet lithography systems comprising immersion technology and dry lithography solutions to manufacture various ranges of semiconductor nodes and technologies. This is important because each layer of semiconductor patterns may require a different methodology to imprint.\n\nIn addition to lithography technology, ASML Holding also offers metrology and inspection systems to gauge and maintain the quality of production. ASML metrology tools include YieldStar optical metrology solutions which measure the quality of patterns embedded on the semiconductor wafers. ASML also offers HMI e-beam solutions that can locate and analyze production defects on individual chips.\n\nAnother of the cutting-edge services provided by the company is computational lithography and the software solutions to go along with it. Computational lithography is a science of advancing semiconductor technology and the processes behind semiconductor manufacturing and is in high demand on a global scale. Along with this, ASML has a suite of products and services for maintaining and rebuilding used semiconductor lithography equipment.",

The company was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between Advanced Semiconductor Materials International and Phillips in order to develop lithography systems for the semiconductor industry. The company\u2019s vision and mission is helping chipmakers advance global technology for the better of mankind, the company\u2019s IPO was in 1995.\n\nThese systems are used to embed layer upon layer of information onto microchips using a variety of methodologies. The three main segments of ASML Holdings operations are lithography, metrology, and inspection-related systems for the memory and logic semiconductor industry. The company\u2019s claim to fame is its ability to empower chipmakers to mass produce patterns in silicon. Two of the key areas of advancement are the resolution of projection the company is able to achieve and the size (very small) of the chips its products can make.\n\nASML Holding was formerly known as ASML Lithography Holding N.V. but changed its name in 2001. The company is headquartered in Veldhoven, the Netherlands and has operations in Europe, North America, Japan, China, and Taiwan among others. ASML Holdings employs more than 32,000 people including 122 nationalities working in more than 60 locations globally but the road to succes was not without difficulty. ASML Holdings nearly went out of business in the late \u201880s but an investment from Phillips board member Henk Bodt and the development of the PAS 5500 lithography system sealed the company\u2019s fate. The PAS 5500s turned out to be such an advancement in microchip lithography there are many still in use today.\n\nASML is the only company currently offering Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography systems to the chipmaking industry and the technology is widely used. The lithography systems project and imprint a pattern onto the chip and then repeat the pattern over and over again building layers of patterns that drive its functionality. Because ASML Holdings technology is so widely used, it is highly likely the device you are using to read this company profile is powered by chips made with ASML devices.\n\nThe company not only provides extreme ultraviolet lithography systems but it also manufactures deep ultraviolet lithography systems comprising immersion technology and dry lithography solutions to manufacture various ranges of semiconductor nodes and technologies. This is important because each layer of semiconductor patterns may require a different methodology to imprint.\n\nIn addition to lithography technology, ASML Holding also offers metrology and inspection systems to gauge and maintain the quality of production. ASML metrology tools include YieldStar optical metrology solutions which measure the quality of patterns embedded on the semiconductor wafers. ASML also offers HMI e-beam solutions that can locate and analyze production defects on individual chips.\n\nAnother of the cutting-edge services provided by the company is computational lithography and the software solutions to go along with it. Computational lithography is a science of advancing semiconductor technology and the processes behind semiconductor manufacturing and is in high demand on a global scale. Along with this, ASML has a suite of products and services for maintaining and rebuilding used semiconductor lithography equipment.",

            "content": "Chinese entities have led the purchase of chipmaking tools for several years now. Still, this year's wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) sales to Chinese chipmakers will drop because of sanctions and overcapacity, according to a Reuters report citing a TechInsights webinar.\n\nAccording to TechInsights, China's investment in semiconductor manufacturing tools is set to drop from $41 billion in 2024 to $38 billion, a 6% reduction. In recent years, much of China's investments were driven by stockpiling, as companies sought to secure tools before additional U.S. restrictions took effect. The upcoming downturn is attributed to tighter U.S. export restrictions and an oversupply of chips.\n\nWhile a $3 billion drop is significant, a $38 billion spending means that China will remain the world's largest market for wafer fabrication equipment, followed by Taiwan, South Korea, and the U.S. In 2023, Chinese companies purchased $36.6 billion worth of WFE, billings to South Korean companies totaled $16.94 billion, and Taiwanese entities procured semiconductor production tools worth $19.62 billion. In contrast, according to SEMI, American chipmakers trailed with $12.05 billion.\n\nAlthough U.S. sanctions have limited China's access to advanced semiconductor production technologies (particularly those used for AI and supercomputers), China has made significant strides in mature-node chips, ramping production and gaining ground on American and Taiwanese competitors. This segment includes older but widely used process technologies, such as 28nm, 45nm, 90nm, and 130nm.\n\nWhile this expansion has strengthened China's position on the market, SMIC recently warned of potential oversupply risks, which could impact profitability as demand for consumer electronics \u2014 where many of the chips produced on mature nodes are used \u2014 is weak these days.\n\nIt should be noted that analysts and market observers from outside of China primarily track sales of Western tools to the People's Republic. Meanwhile, foreigners have relatively limited visibility on what is happening with domestic wafer fabrication equipment suppliers. The latter have grown their sales and market share in 2024 to record levels. Companies like AMEC and Naura, which specialize in etching and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) tools, produce world-class equipment and are on track to push aside such giants as Applied Materials, KLA, and Lam Research in China.\n\nHowever, China still struggles with key weaknesses in semiconductor production as domestic chipmakers remain heavily dependent on foreign suppliers for lithography machines. Currently, they purchase tools from companies like ASML, Canon, and Nikon as Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) can only make litho tools good enough for process technologies of 90nm and thicker (even though it planned to deliver its first 28nm-capable scanner in 2023). China also lags in testing and assembly equipment. In 2023, domestic companies supplied only 17% of testing tools and 10% of assembly machines used in the country, according to TechInsights.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

This is because it is rapidly building fabs specializing in mature process technologies. Once these fabs are equipped, they will have formidable production capacity and likely flood the market with simplistic chips like display driver ICs (DDICs) and power management ICs (PMICs), which will hit companies from other regions hard.",

(NASDAQ:ASML) stands against the other international dividend stocks.\n\nDividend stocks have been grabbing investors' attention for a while now. According to JP Morgan, over the last two decades, global dividends per share have increased at an annual rate of 5.6%, but analysts expect this to rise to 7.6% in the future, driven by historically low payout ratios. During the 2020 pandemic, many companies cut dividends, but as earnings have recovered, especially in Big Tech and AI, dividends have not kept up. With payout ratios at 25-year lows, simply returning to normal could add 2% annual growth over the next five years.\n\nAfter slowing down post-COVID, global dividend growth made a surprising comeback last year, increasing 8% and adding an extra $180 billion in payouts despite ongoing economic and geopolitical challenges. According to S&P Global, this was largely driven by record dividend initiations in US tech, European banks, Japan\u2019s auto industry, and solid growth from China. Even oil and gas companies held strong despite market volatility. Looking ahead, experts predict global dividends will hold steady at $2.3 trillion in 2025.\n\nRegionally, developed Asia, which includes Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, South Korea, and Singapore, is looking at a 3% rise in dividends this year. Europe, on the other hand, is expected to see a 3.4% decline. In emerging markets, the trends are mixed. Asia, led by China, India, and Taiwan, is on track for a 5% increase, while dividends in the Middle East and Africa could drop by 20%, mainly because Saudi Aramco\u2019s special dividend program ended. Latin America is also expected to see a small dip of around 4%.\n\nWhen it comes to sectors, banks and energy companies remain the biggest dividend payers. Banks are expected to distribute around $380 billion globally, but after four years of rapid 20% growth, they are now down to just 2%. Banks are playing it safe, waiting to see how interest rates move. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best international dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the BlackRock International Dividend ETF to filter out dividend stocks listed on US exchanges but headquartered internationally.

            "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming our world, promising to revolutionize everything from human interaction and environmental stewardship to space exploration. This technological revolution, driving us toward what's known as Industry 5.0 (the next phase of industrialization, characterized by human-centric, sustainable, and resilient production through human-machine collaboration), is creating immense opportunities for innovative companies.\n\nTwo such companies at the forefront of this AI-powered future are chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA 6.43%) and ASML (ASML 1.91%), a lithography giant specializing in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology. Both have already seen significant growth thanks to the AI boom, but their potential for future returns remains strong.\n\nWhich of these top AI stocks is the better buy right now? Let's break down their core value propositions and risk factors to find out.\n\nNvidia: The chipmaker making the AI revolution possible\n\nNvidia is the dominant force in AI hardware, powered by its industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs) and Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) -- a software platform that enables developers to harness GPU computing power for AI applications. This powerful combination creates a wide competitive moat, though competition from other chipmakers and potential alternative AI solutions pose long-term risks.\n\nBeyond hardware, Nvidia is strategically expanding into AI software and robotics, particularly in healthcare, diversifying its revenue streams and strengthening its position in the broader AI ecosystem. However, the emergence of potentially more efficient AI models like China's DeepSeek and the cyclical nature of its gaming GPU business create uncertainty around near-term demand.\n\nTrading at approximately 30 times forward earnings compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC 0.49%) 24 times, Nvidia's premium valuation reflects its strong position in the AI market. The tech stock also pays a minimal dividend yield of 0.03%, meaning its shares are better used as a growth vehicle rather than an income generator.\n\nIn short, Nvidia's value proposition lies in its AI leadership and ongoing ecosystem expansion, with key risks including competition, evolving AI technologies, and gaming market cycles.\n\nASML: A monopoly at the heart of the AI boom\n\nASML is the undisputed leader in lithography equipment, holding a near-monopoly on the crucial extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology required for manufacturing the most advanced chips. This dominance creates a wide economic moat, driven by substantial R&D investments and deep relationships with key customers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), Intel, and Samsung, making it incredibly difficult for competitors to emerge.\n\nASML's machines, while expensive, deliver value to chipmakers by reducing the cost per wafer through increased productivity. The long lifespan of these machines, often exceeding 30 years, generates significant recurring revenue through service contracts and high-margin upgrades, further bolstering ASML's financial strength.\n\nHowever, ASML's stock trades at a premium to the S&P 500, with a forward earnings multiple of 29.3 times, reflecting its crucial role in the semiconductor industry and the ongoing AI boom. While the stock's dividend yield is a modest 0.95%, the company's growth prospects and dominant market position are the primary drivers of investor interest.\n\nDespite its strong position, ASML faces some risks. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry can impact demand for its high-priced equipment. Additionally, increasing geopolitical tensions and potential export restrictions, particularly concerning China, could negatively affect ASML's growth trajectory.\n\nWhich stock is the better buy?\n\nWhile both companies are exceptionally well-positioned in the AI revolution, ASML emerges as the more compelling investment at current valuations. Its monopolistic position in EUV technology makes it essential to all major chipmakers, including Nvidia. This unique market position, combined with its robust recurring revenue model and slightly lower valuation multiple, provides a more balanced risk-reward profile.\n\nNvidia remains an outstanding company with tremendous growth potential, but its direct exposure to AI market sentiment and gaming cycles introduces more near-term volatility. ASML's fundamental role in semiconductor manufacturing offers a similar tailwind with greater insulation from market swings, making it the better choice for investors seeking AI exposure with a wider margin of safety.",

            "content": "The company\u2019s Q4 performance underscored its resilience and ability to capitalize on industry tailwinds. ASML reported record-high quarterly revenue of \u20ac9.3 billion, exceeding the high end of its own guidance and beating Wall Street estimates by \u20ac300 million. This represented a remarkable 29% year-over-year growth, significantly outpacing the prior quarter\u2019s 12% growth and reversing the declines seen earlier in the year. The rebound in semiconductor demand is now well underway, as industry giants like Intel and Samsung ramp up their fab expansions. This resurgence translates into growing capital expenditures, which directly fuel ASML\u2019s sales and order pipeline.\n\nASML\u2019s monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines positions it as a linchpin in the semiconductor industry. These highly advanced machines are essential for producing the most cutting-edge chips used in AI, data centers, and advanced computing. No other company in the world can match ASML\u2019s technological capabilities, creating an impenetrable moat that ensures its dominance well into the next decade. Demand for AI and advanced semiconductor technology is only accelerating, further cementing ASML\u2019s critical role in the industry. The notion that Deepseek poses a threat to ASML is entirely unfounded, as management confidently stated that lower AI costs will ultimately drive greater chip demand, directly benefiting ASML\u2019s business.\n\nASML remains one of the most dominant and well-positioned businesses in the semiconductor industry, despite recent share price pressure that appears completely unwarranted. The company\u2019s Q4 earnings and guidance silenced critics, delivering a blowout report that exceeded expectations on multiple fronts. Revenue, order intake, and profit margins all came in ahead of consensus, reaffirming ASML\u2019s long-term bullish outlook. Yet, despite this stellar performance, the stock saw only modest gains, as investor caution around AI-related names persisted following the Deepseek scare. This presents an attractive opportunity for long-term investors, as ASML\u2019s fundamental strength remains intact, and its future prospects remain as bright as ever.\n\nWe came across a bullish thesis on ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) on Substack by Daan Rijnberk. In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on ASML. ASML Holding N.V. (ASML)'s share was trading at $727.70 as of Feb 7 th . ASML\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 36.42 and 28.90 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nA key driver of ASML\u2019s outperformance was the strength of its Installed Base business, which includes recurring service revenues. This segment saw 35% year-over-year growth, reaching \u20ac2.1 billion and exceeding both management and analyst expectations. Service revenues are particularly valuable because they are highly predictable and tied to long-term contracts. Every ASML machine sold comes with decades of recurring service revenue, further reinforcing the company\u2019s financial stability. Meanwhile, ASML\u2019s newest high-numerical aperture (high-NA) EUV machines, which command higher prices and margins, contributed to revenue growth and signaled strong demand for its most advanced technology.\n\nThe geographic distribution of ASML\u2019s sales also provided encouraging signs. While China accounted for a significant portion of revenue in 2023 due to an accelerated order backlog, its share of total sales declined from 47% in Q3 to 27% in Q4. This shift alleviates concerns about ASML\u2019s dependence on China, particularly given ongoing export restrictions. Crucially, revenue lost from China was more than offset by increased sales in the U.S. and South Korea, demonstrating the company\u2019s ability to diversify its customer base and reduce geopolitical risk. ASML expects this trend to continue, with China\u2019s revenue contribution normalizing further in 2025 and 2026.\n\nAnother major highlight of the earnings report was ASML\u2019s impressive order intake. The company secured \u20ac7.1 billion in net new orders, far exceeding Wall Street\u2019s expectations of \u20ac4 billion. This robust demand, which included \u20ac3 billion in EUV orders, brings ASML\u2019s total backlog to an astounding \u20ac36 billion. Essentially, ASML has already locked in the high end of its 2025 revenue guidance, further reinforcing the company\u2019s visibility into future growth. While order intake can be lumpy from quarter to quarter, the strong pipeline suggests sustained demand from major chipmakers, particularly as TSMC recently raised its 2025 CapEx guidance by 19% above expectations.\n\nASML\u2019s profitability remains equally impressive. The company reported a Q4 gross margin of 51.7%, exceeding its guidance range of 49% to 50%, driven by higher-margin service revenues and cost efficiencies in high-NA system installations. Net income came in at \u20ac2.7 billion, translating to a net income margin of 29.1% and an EPS of \u20ac6.85. For the full year, ASML generated total revenue of \u20ac28.3 billion, ahead of expectations and up 3% year-over-year. Importantly, this growth was achieved despite a 9% decline in EUV system shipments, underscoring the resilience of ASML\u2019s business model. The strength of its Installed Base business and the accelerating semiconductor recovery set the stage for further growth in 2025 and beyond.\n\nDespite ASML's strong performance, its shares are currently undervalued. The stock has declined 11% over the past year, even though the company\u2019s long-term fundamentals have only strengthened. This presents a rare opportunity to acquire ASML at an attractive price point. With solid prospects for high-teens EPS growth into the next decade and a dominant market position, ASML remains a top-tier long-term investment. At a 28x earnings multiple, this is an exceptional buying opportunity for one of the world\u2019s best companies. After applying various valuation models and cautious assumptions, a conservative target price of \u20ac1050 per share by the end of 2027 suggests potential annual returns of 15%, including dividends, which would significantly outperform global benchmarks.\n\nASML Holding N.V.

            "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ASML (ASML) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nASML currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.42, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 24 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.42 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 24 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 19 are Strong Buy, representing 79.2% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ASML\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ASML here>>>\n\n\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying ASML, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs ASML a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for ASML, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.1% over the past month to $25.17.\n\nAnalysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for ASML.

This advice was shared during a recent Norges Bank podcast, where Fouquet emphasized the importance of controlling one's breathing in the initial moments of a presentation to maintain composure and effectiveness. Such mindfulness practices are echoed by industry leaders like Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, who both underscore the significance of meditation in their success.\n\nUnder Fouquet's leadership, ASML, the $282 billion semiconductor behemoth, is navigating complex geopolitical challenges, particularly amid pressures to limit its technology sales to China. This comes at a time when ASML's shares have seen a nearly 20% decline in the past year, primarily due to softening demand from chipmakers.\n\nExport Opportunities in Reticle Manufacturing Machines\n\nAs the Netherlands' second-largest tech entity, ASML plays a pivotal role in the reticle manufacturing machine sector. In 2024, the Netherlands exported reticle manufacturing machines worth $314 million, a significant rise compared to the $105.8 million in 2023. The primary export destinations in 2023 included Taiwan ($17.2 million), the United States ($16.7 million), South Korea ($15.2 million), China ($12.3 million), and Malaysia ($7.2 million).\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

            "content": "Weekly news roundup: ASML CEO signals US advantage; Tongfu reportedly begins HBM2 trial assembly\n\nThese are the most-read DIGITIMES Asia stories from February 3 \u2013 February 8.\n\nASML CEO signals US advantage as China faces 10~15 year gap in advanced chip technology\n\nChristophe Fouquet, CEO of ASML, discussed the future of the semiconductor industry on In Good Company, highlighting the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions and supply chain vulnerabilities. He noted that while the industry has long thrived on global collaboration, rising strategic decoupling threatens innovation and stability. Taiwan remains a critical factor, though he downplayed the likelihood of a severe crisis.\n\nFouquet emphasized that China faces a significant technological gap without access to EUV lithography, potentially lagging behind the US and its allies by 10\u201315 years. Despite efforts to expand chip production in the US, Japan, and South Korea, he warned that building advanced R&D capabilities is a long-term challenge. Ultimately, Fouquet's analysis suggests a shifting semiconductor landscape, with the US gaining an edge in global technological competition.\n\nChina's Tongfu Microelectronics reportedly begins HBM2 trial assembly\n\nPreviously focused on semiconductor packaging, Tongfu Microelectronics is now leveraging its expertise to assemble HBM2 products. The company has strong industry ties, with AMD as its largest customer, and partnerships with MediaTek. In its 2024 financial report, Tongfu projected a net profit increase of up to 342.64% due to a semiconductor industry rebound, driven by demand from data centers, automotive electronics, and AI advancements.\n\nWith market conditions improving and strategic initiatives yielding success, the company has expanded its product offerings, increased capacity utilization, and improved profitability, positioning itself for continued high-quality growth.\n\nHuawei reports 2024 revenue, Ascend 910C hits 60% of Nvidia H100's AI performance\n\nHuawei's 2024 revenue grew 22% to CNY860 billion (approx. US$118.6 billion), driven by strong ICT infrastructure, smart EV expansion, and AI advancements. Net profit surged 144.4% to CNY87 billion. The company is investing in AI, digitalization, and low-carbon initiatives, with a focus on software development, including HarmonyOS and openEuler. Huawei's Ascend 910C AI chip reached 60% of Nvidia H100's inference performance, reducing China's reliance on Nvidia GPUs despite US sanctions.\n\nBuilt on SMIC's 7nm process, the chip benefits from Huawei's CANN framework, which optimizes AI workflows. DeepSeek researchers suggest that bypassing Nvidia's CUDA ecosystem with alternative AI processing methods could further reduce dependence on US technology. While Huawei continues to face software-hardware integration challenges, experts highlight that advancements in AI model training could weaken reliance on Nvidia's ecosystem, positioning Huawei as a stronger competitor in the global AI and semiconductor industries.\n\nYMTC reportedly begins shipping fifth-generation 3D TLC NAND flash with 294 layers\n\nYangtze Memory Technologies Co. (YMTC) has reached a major milestone with its fifth-generation 3D TLC NAND flash memory, featuring 294 layers (232 active) and using Xtacking 4.0 hybrid bonding for improved storage density and performance. While its 20Gb/mm2 bit density is slightly below Kioxia and Western Digital's BiCS8 QLC NAND, YMTC is now a strong global competitor. China's IC imports in 2024 totaled CNY2.7 trillion (US$375.1 billion), with memory accounting for CNY700 billion.\n\nHowever, as domestic chipmakers like YMTC and ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT) advance, China is reducing reliance on foreign semiconductor firms. CXMT has also introduced its seventh-generation DDR5, competing with industry leaders Samsung Electronics (Samsung), SK Hynix, and Micron, further narrowing the technological gap in the global memory market.\n\nTSMC launches 5-year CoWoS expansion; bolsters Nvidia's AI dominance amid DeepSeek challenge\n\nTSMC's expansion strategy for advanced packaging, particularly its Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) production, remains unchanged despite global uncertainties. Nvidia has secured over 50% of TSMC's CoWoS capacity while rising demand for AI ASICs has solidified TSMC's dominance in AI chip production. By late 2025, TSMC's CoWoS monthly capacity is expected to reach 75,000\u201380,000 wafers, with projections climbing to 150,000 wafers by 2028.\n\nThe emergence of Chinese startup DeepSeek, which offers cost-effective AI solutions, poses a potential challenge to Nvidia's dominance, potentially affecting TSMC's AI-related orders. However, semiconductor insiders believe DeepSeek's impact will take months to verify, and neither Nvidia nor TSMC have adjusted their forecasts.\n\nIf DeepSeek disrupts Nvidia, more ASIC chipmakers may enter the AI market, expanding edge AI applications and increasing demand for TSMC's services. Despite trade tensions and AI chip bans, TSMC continues to scale CoWoS capacity, expecting steady growth through 2029.\n\nSTMicro's worst year in decades: sales drop, job cuts amid continuous market slump\n\nSTMicroelectronics (STMicro) plans to cut 2,000\u20133,000 jobs (about 6% of its workforce) due to downturns in the industrial and automotive sectors. The layoffs, expected to be announced by late February 2025, will mainly affect its Italian and French operations. In 2024, STMicro's revenue declined 23.2% year-over-year to US$13.27 billion, with net profit plummeting 63% to US$1.56 billion.\n\nThe company forecasts a 28% revenue drop in the first quarter of 2025. Key segments, including microcontrollers (-30.2%) and automotive (-20%), saw steep declines. However, its silicon carbide (SiC) business in Catania, Italy, generated US$1.1 billion, securing partnerships with Ampere and Chinese automakers.\n\nSTMicro faces additional risks from potential US trade tariffs on North American automotive imports and a weakening EV market. It has suspended plans for a US$7.72 billion fab in France and is shifting strategy, expanding partnerships in China to cut costs and maintain competitiveness.\n\nMajor NAND makers cut production by 10-20% as industry reshuffling pressure looms\n\nNAND manufacturers are cutting production due to weak demand, with companies like Western Digital (WD), Kioxia, Samsung, Micron, and SK Hynix reducing output by at least 10-20% to stabilize profitability. The only exception is Solidigm, which focuses on enterprise storage. Samsung, the market leader, is expected to cut supply by 20% in 2025, while SK Hynix forecasts a 10-15% NAND bit demand growth this year. Despite these reductions, the market is expected to remain oversupplied in early 2025, with recovery anticipated by mid-to-late 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, NAND stacking technology competition is slowing due to rising development costs. YMTC recently launched 294-layer NAND with Xtacking 4.0, but its market share remains low. Kioxia is lagging, relying on older 112-layer products and positioning its 218-layer BiCS 8 as a transition product. Market shifts show Samsung increasing its share from 33% to 35-36%, while Kioxia and WD saw declines. As China's NAND industry grows, companies like YMTC are pushing for higher stacking layers, forcing competitors to accelerate upgrades.",

My portfolio was shaken by the Deepseek storyline that dragged down NVIDIA by ~20% in one day only. Given that NVIDIA is a very dominant position in my portfolio this month I am lagging behind the SP500. I have not sold a single share of NVIDIA, here is why:\n\nMaybe Deepseek did find a miraculous way to train an AI model at 1/100th of the cost of any other US/EU competitor and nothing will be same\n\nMaybe they used GPUs they were not supposed to have (Singapore?)\n\nMaybe they improperly leveraged OpenAI to cut corners and train their model\n\nThe point is that I (and frankly no one) can be sure and I need to see rock-solid evidence to sell Earth`s best company. Also, another argument that can be made is that cheaper foundational models will democratize the application layer shifting the demand from training to inference. To sustain much bigger inference demand, data centers and GPUs will always be needed. Btw the CEOs of Google, Meta, and Microsoft validated my thesis and in recent earning calls after the release of Deepseek models confirmed the ramp-up in expenditure for AI infrastructure.\n\nThis month I share with you my investment thesis about ASML, arguably the best European company together with LVMH.\n\nNew year, new format \u2192 I\u00b4ll get portfolio data directly through a software connected to my account (goodbye Excel for now). This will also factor in dividends in the lifetime (so the lifetime performance of my portfolio is up from last month even if this month was flat). I plan to stop commenting on important market news and just comment on 1 topic here in the intro section.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Performance:\n\nTotal (from 2020) : +109.6%\n\nJan 2025: +0.4%\n\nJan 205 S&P500: +2.7%\n\n\ud83d\udcbc Portfolio overview:\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Sells:\n\nNothing\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Buys:\n\nWhat: ASML\n\nNew/increase: new position\n\nWhy: I admire ASML and have been a fanboy for a couple of years. Finally, I bought it in January. This is a company with a particularly wide moat, let\u00b4s look at it in more detail. Here you go \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\n\nMakers of the most advanced machines to produce semiconductors \ud83c\udfed\n\nASML is a Dutch company that designs and manufactures advanced equipment used in semiconductor chip production. It is the sole supplier of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, essential for producing the most advanced and powerful microchips used in smartphones, data centers, AI, and other high-tech applications. One machine costs $200-250m and it has more than 100,000 components. Some say EUV is one of the most complex engineering feats ever achieved by mankind.\n\nMoat #1 - manipulating natural light \ud83c\udff0\n\nTransistors are printed using a light ray, this is true not only for EUV but for older technologies as well.\n\nTo further miniaturize transistors ASML needed a light source with a much shorter wavelength than natural light (!!)\n\nVisible light has a wavelength of 400-700nm - EUV light of just 13.5nm (this is about this is 5,000x smaller than a human hair)\n\nThe plasma that generates EUV light reaches 220,000\u00b0C (the surface of the Sun is about 5,500\u00b0C)\n\nTo direct and focus EUV light a system of ultra-precise mirrors is used. These mirrors are polished to an accuracy of 0.1 nanometers (1/10,000th the width of a human hair). The mirrors are so perfect that if they were scaled to the size of Germany, the tallest imperfection would be less than 1 mm high.\n\nIf you want to go even deeper \u2192 Link Link\n\nMoat #2 - supply chain \ud83c\udff0\n\nASML masters strategic relationships with its suppliers.\n\nCymer - supplier of the key component to generate light - acquired Zeiss - supplier of precision mirrors - exclusivity agreement and strategic investment from ASML Trumpf - supplier of laser that enables the EUV process - co-development and strategic partnership agreement\n\nMoat #3 - customer relationship\ud83c\udff0\n\nASML develops their machines together with its top customers, an enlightened monopolist, in fact, ASML's joint ventures with Intel, Samsung, and TSMC facilitate the development of next-generation lithography technologies on both sides.\n\nMoat #4 - software \ud83c\udff0\n\nHere are a few software features that I believe constitute another layer of moat:\n\nMachine Control: Precisely manages all aspects of the complex lithography machines.\n\nOverlay: Ensures nanometer-level alignment of chip layers.\n\nComputational Lithography: Corrects for optical distortions, maximizing pattern fidelity.\n\nIf you want to dig deeper \u2192 Link\n\nMarket bound to grow with multiple catalyzators (AI, Defence, Data centers)\n\nWider market for microchips is bound to grow every year for many years to come. In particular, AI infrastructure ramp-up is the driver for the specific type of microchips produced with ASML machines.\n\nRecently all the hyperscalers announced increased investment in AI infrastructure of a combined $350bn in 2025, when in 2024 they were $223bn.\n\nValuation is now more reasonable\n\nAfter a year priced without room for risks or errors, in January valuation multiples caught a break and provided me with an opportunity to buy.\n\nStrong, stable EBITDA - strong, fluctuating FCF margin\n\nEBITDA margin attractive and stable at the ~35% mark. FCF is more fluctuating because of lumpy revenues and collection dates (remember that a single machine can cost $250m)\n\nMultiple risks with different time horizons \ud83d\udc80\n\nShort-term (now) : microprocessor export ban to China \u2192 The company is successfully rebalancing its revenue mix\n\nMedium-term (2030) : in the event that China somehow takes over Taiwan and TSMC is impacted (for example by not being able to export to the US) \u2192 existential risk as TSMC represents ~25% of ASML\u2019s revenues and there is not so much that ASML can do against it, I just have to price it in my judgement\n\nLong-term (2040): Quantum computer technology makes advanced microchips obsolete. Hard to judge but ASML is mitigating this risk by investing in quantum startups \u2192 Link\n\n\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f A quote from a great investor\n\nThe quote: \"The biggest risk of all is not taking one.\" \u2014 Larry Hite\n\nWhat can you learn from it?\n\nRisk is necessary for growth: Avoiding all risks can mean missing out on valuable opportunities.\n\nCalculated risks are key: Smart investing is about managing risk, not avoiding it entirely.\n\nFear can be costly: Over-caution can lead to stagnation, while informed decision-making helps you take advantage of opportunities.\n\nShare Fede's Portfolio\n\nAnd that's it!

The company was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between Advanced Semiconductor Materials International and Phillips in order to develop lithography systems for the semiconductor industry. The company\u2019s vision and mission is helping chipmakers advance global technology for the better of mankind, the company\u2019s IPO was in 1995.\n\nThese systems are used to embed layer upon layer of information onto microchips using a variety of methodologies. The three main segments of ASML Holdings operations are lithography, metrology, and inspection-related systems for the memory and logic semiconductor industry. The company\u2019s claim to fame is its ability to empower chipmakers to mass produce patterns in silicon. Two of the key areas of advancement are the resolution of projection the company is able to achieve and the size (very small) of the chips its products can make.\n\nASML Holding was formerly known as ASML Lithography Holding N.V. but changed its name in 2001. The company is headquartered in Veldhoven, the Netherlands and has operations in Europe, North America, Japan, China, and Taiwan among others. ASML Holdings employs more than 32,000 people including 122 nationalities working in more than 60 locations globally but the road to succes was not without difficulty. ASML Holdings nearly went out of business in the late \u201880s but an investment from Phillips board member Henk Bodt and the development of the PAS 5500 lithography system sealed the company\u2019s fate. The PAS 5500s turned out to be such an advancement in microchip lithography there are many still in use today.\n\nASML is the only company currently offering Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography systems to the chipmaking industry and the technology is widely used.

            "content": "Source The Motley Fool\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming our world, promising to revolutionize everything from human interaction and environmental stewardship to space exploration. This technological revolution, driving us toward what's known as Industry 5.0 (the next phase of industrialization, characterized by human-centric, sustainable, and resilient production through human-machine collaboration), is creating immense opportunities for innovative companies.\n\nTwo such companies at the forefront of this AI-powered future are chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and ASML (NASDAQ: ASML), a lithography giant specializing in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology. Both have already seen significant growth thanks to the AI boom, but their potential for future returns remains strong.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nWhich of these top AI stocks is the better buy right now? Let's break down their core value propositions and risk factors to find out.\n\nNvidia: The chipmaker making the AI revolution possible\n\nNvidia is the dominant force in AI hardware, powered by its industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs) and Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) -- a software platform that enables developers to harness GPU computing power for AI applications. This powerful combination creates a wide competitive moat, though competition from other chipmakers and potential alternative AI solutions pose long-term risks.\n\nBeyond hardware, Nvidia is strategically expanding into AI software and robotics, particularly in healthcare, diversifying its revenue streams and strengthening its position in the broader AI ecosystem. However, the emergence of potentially more efficient AI models like China's DeepSeek and the cyclical nature of its gaming GPU business create uncertainty around near-term demand.\n\nTrading at approximately 30 times forward earnings compared to the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 24 times, Nvidia's premium valuation reflects its strong position in the AI market. The tech stock also pays a minimal dividend yield of 0.03%, meaning its shares are better used as a growth vehicle rather than an income generator.\n\nIn short, Nvidia's value proposition lies in its AI leadership and ongoing ecosystem expansion, with key risks including competition, evolving AI technologies, and gaming market cycles.\n\nASML: A monopoly at the heart of the AI boom\n\nASML is the undisputed leader in lithography equipment, holding a near-monopoly on the crucial extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology required for manufacturing the most advanced chips. This dominance creates a wide economic moat, driven by substantial R&D investments and deep relationships with key customers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), Intel, and Samsung, making it incredibly difficult for competitors to emerge.\n\nASML's machines, while expensive, deliver value to chipmakers by reducing the cost per wafer through increased productivity. The long lifespan of these machines, often exceeding 30 years, generates significant recurring revenue through service contracts and high-margin upgrades, further bolstering ASML's financial strength.\n\nHowever, ASML's stock trades at a premium to the S&P 500, with a forward earnings multiple of 29.3 times, reflecting its crucial role in the semiconductor industry and the ongoing AI boom. While the stock's dividend yield is a modest 0.95%, the company's growth prospects and dominant market position are the primary drivers of investor interest.\n\nDespite its strong position, ASML faces some risks. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry can impact demand for its high-priced equipment. Additionally, increasing geopolitical tensions and potential export restrictions, particularly concerning China, could negatively affect ASML's growth trajectory.\n\nWhich stock is the better buy?\n\nWhile both companies are exceptionally well-positioned in the AI revolution, ASML emerges as the more compelling investment at current valuations. Its monopolistic position in EUV technology makes it essential to all major chipmakers, including Nvidia. This unique market position, combined with its robust recurring revenue model and slightly lower valuation multiple, provides a more balanced risk-reward profile.\n\nNvidia remains an outstanding company with tremendous growth potential, but its direct exposure to AI market sentiment and gaming cycles introduces more near-term volatility. ASML's fundamental role in semiconductor manufacturing offers a similar tailwind with greater insulation from market swings, making it the better choice for investors seeking AI exposure with a wider margin of safety.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

The company was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between Advanced Semiconductor Materials International and Phillips in order to develop lithography systems for the semiconductor industry. The company\u2019s vision and mission is helping chipmakers advance global technology for the better of mankind, the company\u2019s IPO was in 1995.\n\nThese systems are used to embed layer upon layer of information onto microchips using a variety of methodologies. The three main segments of ASML Holdings operations are lithography, metrology, and inspection-related systems for the memory and logic semiconductor industry. The company\u2019s claim to fame is its ability to empower chipmakers to mass produce patterns in silicon. Two of the key areas of advancement are the resolution of projection the company is able to achieve and the size (very small) of the chips its products can make.\n\nASML Holding was formerly known as ASML Lithography Holding N.V. but changed its name in 2001. The company is headquartered in Veldhoven, the Netherlands and has operations in Europe, North America, Japan, China, and Taiwan among others. ASML Holdings employs more than 32,000 people including 122 nationalities working in more than 60 locations globally but the road to succes was not without difficulty. ASML Holdings nearly went out of business in the late \u201880s but an investment from Phillips board member Henk Bodt and the development of the PAS 5500 lithography system sealed the company\u2019s fate. The PAS 5500s turned out to be such an advancement in microchip lithography there are many still in use today.\n\nASML is the only company currently offering Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography systems to the chipmaking industry and the technology is widely used. The lithography systems project and imprint a pattern onto the chip and then repeat the pattern over and over again building layers of patterns that drive its functionality. Because ASML Holdings technology is so widely used, it is highly likely the device you are using to read this company profile is powered by chips made with ASML devices.\n\nThe company not only provides extreme ultraviolet lithography systems but it also manufactures deep ultraviolet lithography systems comprising immersion technology and dry lithography solutions to manufacture various ranges of semiconductor nodes and technologies. This is important because each layer of semiconductor patterns may require a different methodology to imprint.\n\nIn addition to lithography technology, ASML Holding also offers metrology and inspection systems to gauge and maintain the quality of production. ASML metrology tools include YieldStar optical metrology solutions which measure the quality of patterns embedded on the semiconductor wafers. ASML also offers HMI e-beam solutions that can locate and analyze production defects on individual chips.\n\nAnother of the cutting-edge services provided by the company is computational lithography and the software solutions to go along with it. Computational lithography is a science of advancing semiconductor technology and the processes behind semiconductor manufacturing and is in high demand on a global scale. Along with this, ASML has a suite of products and services for maintaining and rebuilding used semiconductor lithography equipment.",

This is what the Dutch intelligence agency AIVD states in a message to the public prosecutor.\n\nThis revelation was first shared by the Dutch news program Nieuwsuur, which came across the official notice during a discussion by the court in Rotterdam during a pro forma hearing against the suspect. The message was reportedly received as early as December 23.\n\nThe contact between the ex-ASML and NXP employee and the Russians went through the latter\u2019s foreign intelligence service SVR. Spying on high-tech in the Netherlands is anything but new, nor is contact between sources in the Netherlands and the SVR. For example, two diplomats were exposed by the AIVD in 2020 and some expelled Russian intelligence officers were later found to have specifically targeted the chip industry.\n\nSecret documents were sent through a Google Drive folder and an intermediary. The stolen information offered insights into chip manufacturing. By itself, much of that data is not directly useful to Russia: it has no capacity at all to build advanced processors. Nevertheless, Russia wants to develop itself technologically and could also transfer or resell knowledge to China, which is a closer competitor to the west when it comes to technical knowledge for chip manufacturing. However, export restrictions prevent Beijing from using the latest ASML equipment.\n\nKnowledge over hardware\n\nThe restrictions notwithstanding, Russia and China can gradually make real progress with enough puzzle pieces of western tech players, especially if they\u2019re working together. For now, the Chinese are sticking to maximizing the chip equipment they do have access to, with Huawei\u2019s Kirin 9000S chip being the most impressive final product. Nevertheless, its performance pales in comparison to competitors made by Qualcomm, Apple and MediaTek. China\u2019s next move will be to build GPUs that count as Nvidia alternatives. That, or the nation simply smuggles the video cards into the country as is the strong suspicion of many.\n\nAlso read: ASML sets sales record in \u2018transition year\u2019: what will 2025 deliver?",

            "content": "ASML (ASML) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this equipment supplier to semiconductor makers have returned -0.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. The Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry, to which ASML belongs, has gained 3.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, ASML is expected to post earnings of $6.02 per share, indicating a change of +78.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +7.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $25.17 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +20.9%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $29.27 indicates a change of +16.3% from what ASML is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -9.7%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ASML is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of ASML, the consensus sales estimate of $8.08 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +40.7%. The $34.34 billion and $37.97 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +12.4% and +10.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nASML reported revenues of $9.88 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +26.8%. EPS of $7.30 for the same period compares with $5.60 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.76 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.2%. The EPS surprise was +1.67%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nASML is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ASML. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\n7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days\n\nJust released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys. They deem these tickers \"Most Likely for Early Price Pops.\"\n\nSince 1988, the full list has beaten the market more than 2X over with an average gain of +24.3% per year.

The company was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between Advanced Semiconductor Materials International and Phillips in order to develop lithography systems for the semiconductor industry. The company\u2019s vision and mission is helping chipmakers advance global technology for the better of mankind, the company\u2019s IPO was in 1995.\n\nThese systems are used to embed layer upon layer of information onto microchips using a variety of methodologies. The three main segments of ASML Holdings operations are lithography, metrology, and inspection-related systems for the memory and logic semiconductor industry. The company\u2019s claim to fame is its ability to empower chipmakers to mass produce patterns in silicon. Two of the key areas of advancement are the resolution of projection the company is able to achieve and the size (very small) of the chips its products can make.\n\nASML Holding was formerly known as ASML Lithography Holding N.V. but changed its name in 2001. The company is headquartered in Veldhoven, the Netherlands and has operations in Europe, North America, Japan, China, and Taiwan among others. ASML Holdings employs more than 32,000 people including 122 nationalities working in more than 60 locations globally but the road to succes was not without difficulty. ASML Holdings nearly went out of business in the late \u201880s but an investment from Phillips board member Henk Bodt and the development of the PAS 5500 lithography system sealed the company\u2019s fate. The PAS 5500s turned out to be such an advancement in microchip lithography there are many still in use today.\n\nASML is the only company currently offering Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography systems to the chipmaking industry and the technology is widely used. The lithography systems project and imprint a pattern onto the chip and then repeat the pattern over and over again building layers of patterns that drive its functionality. Because ASML Holdings technology is so widely used, it is highly likely the device you are using to read this company profile is powered by chips made with ASML devices.\n\nThe company not only provides extreme ultraviolet lithography systems but it also manufactures deep ultraviolet lithography systems comprising immersion technology and dry lithography solutions to manufacture various ranges of semiconductor nodes and technologies. This is important because each layer of semiconductor patterns may require a different methodology to imprint.\n\nIn addition to lithography technology, ASML Holding also offers metrology and inspection systems to gauge and maintain the quality of production. ASML metrology tools include YieldStar optical metrology solutions which measure the quality of patterns embedded on the semiconductor wafers. ASML also offers HMI e-beam solutions that can locate and analyze production defects on individual chips.\n\nAnother of the cutting-edge services provided by the company is computational lithography and the software solutions to go along with it. Computational lithography is a science of advancing semiconductor technology and the processes behind semiconductor manufacturing and is in high demand on a global scale. Along with this, ASML has a suite of products and services for maintaining and rebuilding used semiconductor lithography equipment.",

The company expects first-quarter revenue of $25.0 billion\u2014$25.8 billion, compared to the $24.97 billion consensus.\n\nCramer correlated advanced process technologies with equipment catering to Nvidia Corp\u2019s NVDA GPUs and other accelerators.\n\nASML Holding, a $292 billion company, trades at a PE multiple of 37.2x versus Applied Materials\u2019 ($147 billion market cap) 18.8x, Lam Research\u2019s ($105 billion market cap) 21.5x and KLA\u2019s ($101 billion market cap) 24.2x.\n\nThe cash-rich chip equipment makers have consistently paid dividends, with a dividend yield of ~1%.\n\nASML Holdings\u2019 gross margin is 51.7%, compared to Applied Materials\u2019 47.3%, KLA\u2019s 60.30%, and Lam Research\u2019s 47.4%.\n\nApplied Materials analysts had flagged the impact of intensifying geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, considering the company\u2019s significant exposure to the country.\n\nThe U.S. is already ASML Holding\u2019s largest market, overtaking China in the fourth quarter. Applied Materials and Lam Research have contacted non-Chinese suppliers to comply with regulations.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari expects Lam Research to outperform its immediate peers in 2025.\n\nIn addition to a quarterly recovery in the overall Wafer Fab Equipment market, he expects distinctive drivers like the adoption of Gate-All-Around transistors in leading-edge Foundry or Logic and the resumption of technology transitions in 3D NAND to support revenue growth that exceeds the overall WFE market.\n\nGlobal sales of total semiconductor manufacturing equipment by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) will likely reach $113 billion in 2024, up by 6.5%, according to SEMI. Semiconductor manufacturing equipment growth will likely reach $121 billion in 2025 and $139 billion in 2026.\n\nRising demand for advanced chips in devices like smartphones, PCs, and IoT gadgets fueled the growth, according to SNS Insider.\n\nCountries have also poured in money to stay ahead in the semiconductor race. Major countries, including the U.S., Japan, China, and Europe, initiated the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, Japan\u2019s \u00a51 trillion R&D investment, China\u2019s Made in China 2025 strategy, and the European Chips Act to boost local semiconductor production.\n\nAccording to SEMI, China, Taiwan, and Korea will likely remain the top three destinations for equipment spending through 2026.\n\nMSCI World Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment Index yielded a 37% return in the last 12 months.

ASML also offers HMI e-beam solutions that can locate and analyze production defects on individual chips.\n\nAnother of the cutting-edge services provided by the company is computational lithography and the software solutions to go along with it. Computational lithography is a science of advancing semiconductor technology and the processes behind semiconductor manufacturing and is in high demand on a global scale. Along with this, ASML has a suite of products and services for maintaining and rebuilding used semiconductor lithography equipment.",

            "content": "DeepSeek sent shockwaves through the AI investing world recently when it announced that it trained its AI model for just $5.6 million. As a result, many investors were worried that the entire AI support industry could come crashing down. They assumed that there wouldn't be as much demand for chips or tools to make chips because the models were going to become more efficient.\n\nHowever, one of the most critical machine providers in the chip manufacturing business is even more bullish on the industry after DeepSeek's R1 launch. This CEO is Christophe Fouquet, head of ASML (ASML 1.91%), and his company may be the most critical in the chip value chain.\n\nASML's CEO believes his company will benefit from improving AI models\n\nASML makes lithography machines that etch the microscopic electrical traces on a chip. Without ASML, none of the cutting-edge chips produced today would be possible. ASML is the only company in the world capable of manufacturing extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines, giving it a rare technological monopoly. It will be nearly impossible to catch or duplicate what ASML has achieved, as it represents billions of investment dollars and decades of research to get to where it is now.\n\nWith its technological monopoly, it has a great pulse on the chip industry, as capacity expansion for these companies is planned years in advance. Fouquet does not see any slowdown in orders; in fact, ASML saw net bookings of 7.09 billion euros, while analysts were only expecting 3.99 billion euros. But probably the most revealing stance is that he believes that low-cost models will increase the demand for chips, not decrease it.\n\nThis idea is known as the Jevons paradox, named after an English economist, William Jevons, who observed that coal usage increased during the Industrial Revolution after more efficient ways to use it came about. As AI models become more accessible and cheaper to run, they're going to attract more users, which will, in turn, require increased computing infrastructure. This is why many investors (like myself) are still bullish on the chip industry.\n\nThe stock is priced to buy\n\nASML hasn't had a straight-up trajectory like some of its chip-manufacturing customers. A few months ago, it reduced its 2025 revenue guidance and didn't update it during its Q4 earnings announcement. For fiscal 2025, ASML projects revenue to come in between 30 billion and 35 billion euros, indicating around 15% growth at the midpoint.\n\nThat's still a strong growth figure, yet the stock is down more than 30% from its all-time high because the original guidance was between 30 billion and 40 billion euros. With ASML's unique market position, I think this is a ridiculous response, as its machines are required to produce all of the cutting-edge chips needed to run AI models.\n\nAs for valuation, ASML shares are fairly reasonable at 30 times forward earnings.\n\nThat 30 times forward earnings makes even more sense when you consider its monopoly position, plus the long-term growth trajectory of the business. At its 2024 investor day, ASML revealed guidance for 2030 that indicated its revenue will be between 44 billion and 60 billion euros. That means its revenue is projected to grow at a compound annual rate between 8% and 13%.\n\nAlongside a 1% dividend and a strong share repurchasing track record, ASML is likely to grow earnings per share at a low- to mid-teens rate, setting it up nicely to beat the market. ASML is in a solid position to grow over the next few years. With the reasonably priced stock and a great capital allocation strategy, ASML makes for a great buy.",

But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.\n\nSome investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at PDD Holdings, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For PDD Holdings, the 200-day moving average sits at $123.03, according to Benzinga Pro, which is above the current price of $114.05. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here.\n\nTraders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.\n\nPrice Action: PDD stock traded lower by 3.35% to $110.51 premarket at the last check on Wednesday.\n\nAlso Read:",

The company was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between Advanced Semiconductor Materials International and Phillips in order to develop lithography systems for the semiconductor industry. The company\u2019s vision and mission is helping chipmakers advance global technology for the better of mankind, the company\u2019s IPO was in 1995.\n\nThese systems are used to embed layer upon layer of information onto microchips using a variety of methodologies. The three main segments of ASML Holdings operations are lithography, metrology, and inspection-related systems for the memory and logic semiconductor industry. The company\u2019s claim to fame is its ability to empower chipmakers to mass produce patterns in silicon. Two of the key areas of advancement are the resolution of projection the company is able to achieve and the size (very small) of the chips its products can make.\n\nASML Holding was formerly known as ASML Lithography Holding N.V. but changed its name in 2001. The company is headquartered in Veldhoven, the Netherlands and has operations in Europe, North America, Japan, China, and Taiwan among others. ASML Holdings employs more than 32,000 people including 122 nationalities working in more than 60 locations globally but the road to succes was not without difficulty. ASML Holdings nearly went out of business in the late \u201880s but an investment from Phillips board member Henk Bodt and the development of the PAS 5500 lithography system sealed the company\u2019s fate. The PAS 5500s turned out to be such an advancement in microchip lithography there are many still in use today.\n\nASML is the only company currently offering Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography systems to the chipmaking industry and the technology is widely used. The lithography systems project and imprint a pattern onto the chip and then repeat the pattern over and over again building layers of patterns that drive its functionality. Because ASML Holdings technology is so widely used, it is highly likely the device you are using to read this company profile is powered by chips made with ASML devices.\n\nThe company not only provides extreme ultraviolet lithography systems but it also manufactures deep ultraviolet lithography systems comprising immersion technology and dry lithography solutions to manufacture various ranges of semiconductor nodes and technologies. This is important because each layer of semiconductor patterns may require a different methodology to imprint.\n\nIn addition to lithography technology, ASML Holding also offers metrology and inspection systems to gauge and maintain the quality of production.

            "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has gotten off to a bad start on the stock market in 2025, losing more than 10% of its value as of this writing, with Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up DeepSeek's launch of a low-cost but capable AI model playing a key role in the semiconductor giant's troubles.\n\nWhen DeepSeek claimed that it spent just $6 million to train its R1 reasoning model that's capable of competing with OpenAI's o1 reasoning model, AI stocks in the U.S. took a big beating. Nvidia stock was one of the biggest victims of the sell-off, dropping 17% on Jan. 27 after it emerged that DeepSeek overtook ChatGPT's downloads on the Apple app store in the U.S.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nDeepSeek's low-cost model sparked concerns about major cloud computing companies and governments reducing their demand for the AI chips Nvidia sells. However, a closer look at recent developments in the AI space suggests that the spending on AI chips could continue to head higher, opening the possibility of Nvidia stock regaining its mojo once it releases its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter results on Feb. 26.\n\nLet's look at why Nvidia could offer a bright update about the state of AI spending later this month along with its quarterly report.\n\nNvidia could win big from this project thanks to its solid share of AI chips\n\nOver the last few years, tech giants and governments around the world have poured a lot of money into the development of AI infrastructure, and President Donald Trump gave AI spending prospects a massive boost last month.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jan. 21, Trump announced at the White House that SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle(NYSE: ORCL) are forming a joint venture that plans to invest $100 billion in AI infrastructure. The joint venture, known as Stargate, is eventually planning to spend up to a whopping $500 billion on building AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years.\n\nStargate's first AI data center is already under construction in Texas, according to Oracle chairman Larry Ellison. The joint venture is expected to construct 20 data centers, creating an estimated 100,000 jobs.\n\nIn a post announcing the Stargate project, OpenAI pointed out that the initial funding will be provided by SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle, and Abu Dhabi's AI-focused investment company, MGX. The post further highlighted that Nvidia is going to be among the \"initial technology partners\" in Stargate.\n\nNvidia has been at the forefront of the AI revolution with its powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) based on the Ampere architecture that helped OpenAI train ChatGPT. It has kept pushing the envelope in the AI accelerator market, churning out more powerful chips in the past three years based on its Hopper and Blackwell architectures.\n\nThis explains why Nvidia has maintained a solid grip on the AI chip market with an estimated share of 90%. Given that Nvidia has created a technology advantage over rivals in the AI chip market, it could remain the dominant force in this space. As Nvidia's GPUs are the basic building blocks of AI data centers given their ability to perform massive calculations simultaneously, allowing companies to train and deploy AI models quickly, Stargate's ambitious investment plan should ideally help improve the chipmaker's addressable market.\n\nFor instance, Oracle has been relying on Nvidia's GPUs to create AI infrastructure to rent out to customers so that they can train AI models in the cloud. In September last year, Ellison remarked that one of Oracle's largest data centers \"is 800 megawatts, and it will contain acres of NVIDIA GP clusters able to train the world's largest AI models.\" This was followed by a remark from Oracle CEO Safra Catz on the December 2024 earnings conference call that the company \"delivered the world's largest and fastest AI supercomputer, scaling up to 65,000 Nvidia H200 GPUs.\"\n\nOracle is planning to deploy an additional 35 cloud regions around the globe in addition to the 17 it already has. It won't be surprising to see the company's appetite for Nvidia's GPUs increasing. More importantly, as Nvidia has been working with its supply chain partners to increase the output of its AI GPUs in 2025, it should be in a position to meet the higher demand for its chips that's likely to arise following Stargate.\n\nMeanwhile, the likes of Meta Platforms and Microsoft aren't going to curtail their spending on AI infrastructure following DeepSeek's breakthrough. Both companies believe that heavy AI investments are required to support the growing demand for AI applications, thanks to the potential arrival of more efficient models as demonstrated by DeepSeek. Dutch semiconductor equipment giant ASMLsuggested something similar after the company witnessed solid growth in orders and received way more bookings than Wall Street was anticipating.\n\nAll this suggests that the AI spending environment could remain robust, and that could help Nvidia deliver solid results and guidance later this month.\n\nStronger-than-expected growth could lead to more upside\n\nAnalysts are currently expecting Nvidia's revenue in fiscal 2026 (which has just begun) to increase 52% to just over $196 billion, followed by a 21% increase in fiscal 2027.\n\nHowever, expect to see those estimates head higher in light of the above discussion, paving the way for more upside in Nvidia stock. It is worth noting that Nvidia's 12-month price target of $175, according to 66 analysts covering the stock, points toward 46% gains from current levels.\n\nNvidia's revenue estimates for both fiscal years 2026 and 2027 have jumped higher of late, a trend that could continue thanks to continued investments in AI. As a result, Nvidia's price target could also witness upward revisions.\n\nSo, investors who have been on the sidelines and are wondering if it is a good idea to buy shares of Nvidia following the stellar returns that the stock has delivered in the past couple of years can consider buying it right away as it can regain its mojo. The stock's forward earnings multiple of 23 is very attractive considering that the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index has a forward earnings multiple of 27. That's why buying Nvidia right now could turn out to be a smart move as its healthy earnings growth momentum is likely to continue.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

He suggested that, instead, \u201call you had to do is charge them tariffs\u201d.\n\nThe US Department of Commerce\u2019s Mike Schmidt, who led the rollout of the legislation for two years, told Bloomberg earlier this month that Trump\u2019s idea for tariffs has \u201ca role to play in industrial strategy\u201d, but that \u201cthe incentives provided by the CHIPS Act were essential\u201d.\n\nThe main concern for chipmakers prior to Trump taking up office was that he could pull funding for the industry. However, the pick for US Secretary of Commerce, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, has indicated that he will likely continue to support the CHIPS and Science Act in some form or another, Bloomberg reported.\n\nWith the future still unclear, let\u2019s take a closer look at three chip stocks: Texas Instruments [TXN], ASML [ASML] and NXP Semiconductors [NXPI].\n\nThree Plays on the Chip Industry\n\nTexas Instruments Has Chips Act Funding Confirmed\n\nJust before leaving office, former President Joe Biden signed off on $1.61bn in funding for Texas Instruments, previously announced in August, to expand its manufacturing capacity of semiconductors deemed crucial for US economic and national security.\n\n\u201cThe increasing number of electronic devices in our lives depend on our foundational chips, and we appreciate the support from the US government to make the semiconductor ecosystem stronger and more resilient,\u201d said Texas Instruments CEO Haviv Ilan.\n\nNetherlands Expects ASML Export Restrictions to Remain\n\nTrump\u2019s return to office is expected to see him continue to push for curbs on exports of ASML\u2019s chipmaking equipment to China.\n\nThe Netherlands had been pressured into introducing export restrictions by the Biden administration, as the US believed that China getting its hands on ASML\u2019s cutting-edge lithography machines could be a national security risk.\n\nDutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof told Reuters last week that China remained an important trade partner for the Netherlands and that he had had positive conversations on ASML with China\u2019s Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang.\n\n\u201cWe have to wait for what the American government comes forward with,\u201d said Schoof.\n\nNXP CEO Warns Against Nationalist Policies\n\nFellow Dutch chip stock NXP Semiconductors has not been directly impacted by US tariffs, but the company\u2019s CEO Kurt Sievers recently addressed the issue.\n\nAt an electronics conference in November, Sievers was one of a handful of industry executives to speak out against countries drawing up policies to protect their own interests, asserting that no single, national semiconductor industry can operate independently.\n\n\u201cIf it was possible, it would become so expensive that no consumer could afford any device which uses chips. And I\u2019m sure every government over time will understand it,\u201d said Sievers.\n\nChip Market Recovery Drags On\n\nTrump notwithstanding, the recovery for the global chip industry has been slow, and likely will be for some time, as the revenue projections for Texas Instruments, ASML and NXP indicate.\n\nTXN ASML NXPI Market Cap $170.38bn $269.50bn $54.66bn P/S Ratio 10.91 11.34 4.26 P/E Ratio 36.00 34.85 20.54 PEG Ratio (5 Year Expected 3.34 1.92 2.64 Estimated Sales Growth (Current Fiscal Year) 10.69% 14.42% 0.23% Estimated Sales Growth (Next Fiscal Year) 14.35% 13.51% 10.28%\n\nSource: Stockanalysis.com\n\nSemiconductors: The Investment Case\n\nThe Investment Case for Texas Instruments\n\nThe Bull Case\n\nThe $1.61bn in funding received through the CHIPS and Science Act will help Texas Instruments to upgrade its manufacturing facilities.\n\nWhile this may eat into its profit in the near term, the company is expecting it to reduce manufacturing costs in the long term and enable it to keep pace with Chinese competitors.\n\nAs the company does not produce state-of-the-art chips, its exports to China are not restricted.\n\nThe Bear Case\n\nDespite beating Q4 expectations last week, Q1 2025 guidance disappointed investors.\n\nThe company is dealing with an inventory backlog amid a slump in the automotive and industrial markets. The problem is that these cyclical markets account for approximately 70% of its revenue.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer criticized the company following the earnings report: \u201cI\u2019m absolutely convinced that if Texas Instruments wanted to, it could go beyond its cyclical nature. But it won\u2019t \u2026 It\u2019s content to remain as it is. It\u2019s just not content with the critics.'\n\nThe Investment Case for ASML\n\nThe Bull Case\n\nASML is \u201cvery, very bullish\u201d about its long-term outlook as demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nCEO Christophe Fouquet said at the company\u2019s investor day in November that the global chip market should be worth at least $1trn by 2030, with AI chips accounting for 40% of sales.\n\nThe company is targeting annual revenue of \u20ac44bn\u201360bn by the start of the next decade.\n\nThe Bear Case\n\nThe flip side is that ASML is not as confident about the near-term outlook.\n\nFouquet said on the call for its downbeat Q3 earnings in October that he expects the chip industry\u2019s recovery to continue \u201cwell into 2025\u201d as a result of \u201ccustomer cautiousness and some push-outs in their investments\u201d.\n\nASML expects revenue for 2025 to be in a range of \u20ac30bn\u201335bn, up from an expected \u20ac28bn in 2024.

            "content": "Dutch semiconductor chip firm ASML is a very underrated stock in 2025, thanks to one key metric that could drive shares upward. The company recently reported its Q4 2024 earnings, blasting expectations out of the water. Its strong results and robust bookings corresponded with solid guidance for the next five years according to ASML.\n\nASML has a virtual monopoly on EUV machines that are used to make advanced chips. The company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings report revealed a surge in orders, showing that demand is high. This boom in demand and positive results helped the stock rise a bit, as it is up 7% in the last five days. Along with the positive results, its ability to withstand the recent arrival of DeepSeek AI helps make it an underrated option according to analysts.\n\nAdditionally, ASML has introduced a new technology called a high numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet lithography system, or High NA EUV, that it is trying to sell to its largest customers. With orders on the rise and continued innovation, ASML may be a tough choice to avoid if you want an underrated stock in your portfolio. For 2025, the company expects to generate revenue of 30 billion to 35 billion euros ($31.1 billion to $36.3 billion), with a Q1 revenue of 7.5 billion to 8 billion euros ($7.8 billion to $8.3 billion). Gross margins are expected to be between 51% to 53% for the year and between 52% to 53% for the first quarter.\n\nASML To Exceed Expectations in 2025 Quarterly Results?\n\nThe company said that if AI chip demand remains strong and more manufacturing capacity is built to help meet that demand, revenue could be toward the upper end of that range. Meeting this demand and posting positive numbers throughout the year could give investors in ASML stock consistent profits. Further, ASML continues to see the opportunity for 2030 revenue of between 44 billion to 60 billion euros ($45.7 billion to $62.3 billion), with gross margins improving to between 56% to 60%. It sees this being driven by strong overall chip demand as well as strong AI demand creating a shift more toward advanced chips that need EUV technology.\n\nAlso Read: META Stock Eyes 12th Straight Gain, Adds $235B in Record Streak\n\nASML is trading at $731.41 per share, nearly 20% below its estimated fair value of 902.06 based on discounted cash flow analysis. The company\u2019s forecasted earnings growth outpaces the Dutch market but remains below significant thresholds, highlighting moderate undervaluation potential.",

            "content": "Shares of ASML Holding (ASML 1.91%) rallied after the company's fourth-quarter earnings report showed soaring orders for the company's devices that make semiconductors. The stock has been up and down over the past year, as it has been pressured over Chinese trade restrictions and, more recently, over what impact DeepSeek could have on chip demand.\n\nMeanwhile, ASML has introduced a new technology called a high numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet lithography system, or High NA EUV, that it is trying to sell to its largest customers. All in all, the the stock is down about 15% during the past 12 months. With orders on the rise, let's dig into ASML's earnings to see if this is a good time to buy the stock.\n\nOrders surge\n\nASML had long discussed 2024 being a transition year ahead of what would be a better 2025, and signs of that playing out were on display when the company reported a huge jump in orders, as reflected in its booking number. It recorded bookings of 7.1 billion euros ($7.4 billion), which was a 169% increase compared to Q3 and well ahead of the 4 billion euros ($4.2 billion) that analysts had expected, as compiled by Visible Alpha. It noted that 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) of its backlog was for EUV (extreme ultraviolet lithography) equipment.\n\nFor 2025, the company expects to generate revenue of 30 billion to 35 billion euros ($31.1 billion to $36.3 billion), with a Q1 revenue of 7.5 billion to 8 billion euros ($7.8 billion to $8.3 billion). Gross margins are expected to be between 51% to 53% for the year and between 52% to 53% for the first quarter.\n\nThe company said that if AI chip demand remains strong and more manufacturing capacity is built to help meet that demand, revenue could be toward the upper end of that range. However, there are certainly geopolitical concerns that could take 2025 revenue to the lower end of the range.\n\nAfter two years of outsized contributions from China, the company expects its Chinese business to return to more normal levels in 2025. China accounted for 41% of its revenue in 2024 and 29% in 2023, respectively, as Chinese companies rushed to get orders out of fear there would be additional trade restrictions. These are not sales of its EUV equipment, which it has been barred from selling into China. China represented 14% of its sales in 2022 and 16% in 2021.\n\nFurther out, ASML continues to see the opportunity for 2030 revenue of between 44 billion to 60 billion euros ($45.7 billion to $62.3 billion), with gross margins improving to between 56% to 60%. It sees this being driven by strong overall chip demand as well as strong AI demand creating a shift more toward advanced chips that need EUV technology.\n\nAs for the quarter itself, ASML's revenue jumped 29% year over year to 9.3 billion euros ($9.7 billion) and came above the company's guidance range of 8.8 billion to 9.2 billion euros ($9.1 billion to $9.6 billion). Its equipment sales rose nearly 25% year over year to 7.1 billion euros ($7.4 billion), while its service revenue surged 39% to 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion).\n\nASML sold 119 new lithography systems and 13 used systems in Q4 compared to 113 new and 11 used systems a year ago. In Q3, it sold 106 new lithography systems and 10 used systems. It recognized revenue from two of its new high NA EUV machines in the quarter, as customer accepted the orders and it finished installing one system.\n\nIs ASML stock a buy?\n\nWhile its results can be a bit lumpy as a semiconductor equipment manufacturer selling very expensive machines, ASML is well-positioned over the long term with a virtual monopoly in the EUV technology needed to make advanced chips used for AI and other applications. As long as AI chip demand continues to expand, the company should continue to sell more of its EUV machines.\n\nMeanwhile, its new high NA EUV technology has the opportunity to be a big growth driver in the coming years. While leading chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has balked at the price, it has also been an early adopter of ASML's EUV technology, which has helped get it to where it is today . I don't think the company will want to risk potentially falling behind technologically, especially with Intel looking to embrace the technology. As such, I think this could be more a negotiating ploy at this point.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, ASML trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of about 30 based on 2025 estimates. Given its monopoly on the EUV machines needed to make high-end semiconductors, I think that is a fair valuation.\n\nWhile I would expect the stock to be volatile given the lumpy nature of its business, I think ASML should be a solid long-term winner given its integral part in the semiconductor value chain.",

The company was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between Advanced Semiconductor Materials International and Phillips in order to develop lithography systems for the semiconductor industry. The company\u2019s vision and mission is helping chipmakers advance global technology for the better of mankind, the company\u2019s IPO was in 1995.\n\nThese systems are used to embed layer upon layer of information onto microchips using a variety of methodologies. The three main segments of ASML Holdings operations are lithography, metrology, and inspection-related systems for the memory and logic semiconductor industry. The company\u2019s claim to fame is its ability to empower chipmakers to mass produce patterns in silicon. Two of the key areas of advancement are the resolution of projection the company is able to achieve and the size (very small) of the chips its products can make.\n\nASML Holding was formerly known as ASML Lithography Holding N.V. but changed its name in 2001. The company is headquartered in Veldhoven, the Netherlands and has operations in Europe, North America, Japan, China, and Taiwan among others. ASML Holdings employs more than 32,000 people including 122 nationalities working in more than 60 locations globally but the road to succes was not without difficulty. ASML Holdings nearly went out of business in the late \u201880s but an investment from Phillips board member Henk Bodt and the development of the PAS 5500 lithography system sealed the company\u2019s fate. The PAS 5500s turned out to be such an advancement in microchip lithography there are many still in use today.\n\nASML is the only company currently offering Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography systems to the chipmaking industry and the technology is widely used. The lithography systems project and imprint a pattern onto the chip and then repeat the pattern over and over again building layers of patterns that drive its functionality. Because ASML Holdings technology is so widely used, it is highly likely the device you are using to read this company profile is powered by chips made with ASML devices.\n\nThe company not only provides extreme ultraviolet lithography systems but it also manufactures deep ultraviolet lithography systems comprising immersion technology and dry lithography solutions to manufacture various ranges of semiconductor nodes and technologies. This is important because each layer of semiconductor patterns may require a different methodology to imprint.\n\nIn addition to lithography technology, ASML Holding also offers metrology and inspection systems to gauge and maintain the quality of production. ASML metrology tools include YieldStar optical metrology solutions which measure the quality of patterns embedded on the semiconductor wafers. ASML also offers HMI e-beam solutions that can locate and analyze production defects on individual chips.\n\nAnother of the cutting-edge services provided by the company is computational lithography and the software solutions to go along with it. Computational lithography is a science of advancing semiconductor technology and the processes behind semiconductor manufacturing and is in high demand on a global scale. Along with this, ASML has a suite of products and services for maintaining and rebuilding used semiconductor lithography equipment.",

That's a big disposal, and it decreased their holding size by 19%, which is notable but not too bad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nASML Holding Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP, Roger J. Dassen, for \u20ac3.5m worth of shares, at about \u20ac804 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is \u20ac710. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.\n\nInsiders in ASML Holding didn't buy any shares in the last year.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Insiders own 0.03% of ASML Holding shares, worth about \u20ac80m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About ASML Holding Insiders?\n\nInsiders sold ASML Holding shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. Insiders own shares, but we're still pretty cautious, given the history of sales. We'd practice some caution before buying! So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

            "content": "Business News\n\nASML bounces back on strong bookings\n\n03 Feb 2025\n\nConfidence in AI boom remains solid as company delivers record revenues in latest quarter, and for 2024 overall.\n\nThe stock price of semiconductor lithography giant ASML has recovered from the impact of last week\u2019s DeepSeek AI revelations, after the firm posted record-breaking sales revenues and CEO Christophe Fouquet gave an upbeat outlook for 2025.\n\nAt \u20ac28.3 billion, full-year sales for 2024 were up on the prior year\u2019s record total of \u20ac27.6 billion. For the closing quarter of the year, sales of \u20ac9.3 billion rose strongly from the figure of \u20ac7.2 billion posted a year ago.\n\nThat momentum is set to continue this year, thanks in part to strong bookings in the latest quarter. Fouquet and his colleagues expect that will translate to annual sales ending up somewhere between \u20ac30 billion and \u20ac35 billion.\n\n\u201cIf AI demand continues to be strong and customers are successful in bringing on additional capacity online to support that demand, there is potential opportunity towards the upper end of our range,\u201d the CEO told an investor conference call.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, there are also risks related to customers and geopolitics that could drive results towards the lower end of the range.\u201d\n\nEUV evolution\n\nThis year will see further development in the evolution of the company\u2019s extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography equipment, as chipmakers get to upgrade throughput with their current equipment, and the latest high numerical aperture (high-NA) generation of the technology moves towards mass production.\n\n\u201cWe are very, very happy with our achievement on high NA,\u201d said Fouquet. \u201cLast year, we got the first two customer acceptances, which after so many years of development has been a major milestone.\n\n\u201cFeedback on the imaging performance from our DRAM customers and logic customers continues to be very, very positive. They like what they see. The key discussion now is really when, how, and in which volume, to insert this tool into volume manufacturing. That's a discussion we're going to have with our customers.\u201d\n\nRegarding low-NA EUV tools, the CEO added: \u201cWe have achieved a very important milestone [in the] last quarter. Which is to demonstrate the full capability of the tool\u2019s final specification here at ASML.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing to mature the platform with our customers, so that the tool can be ready this year to really support high volume manufacturing.\u201d\n\nThat low-NA milestone relates to achieving full system specification in ASML\u2019s own factory at a throughput of 220 wafers per hour, alongside record overlay.\n\n\u201cWe are on track to deliver new systems at full specification and start upgrades for the systems already at our customers during the first half of 2025,\u201d Fouquet said, adding his view that demand from AI will remain solid.\n\n\"Consistent with our view from the last quarter, the growth in AI is the key driver for growth in our industry,\u201d he told investors, suggesting that the proliferation of generative AI would open up \u201cendless\u201d opportunities and boost global GDP by trillions of dollars across all manner of applications.\n\nAI competition welcomed\n\nReferencing the sudden emergence of a new competitor in the form of DeepSeek, which knocked trillions of dollars off of the stock value of AI-related technology companies just before ASML's latest update, Fouquet said:\n\n\u201cI think we have to get used to that, because this is such an opportunity that there will be more and more players [trying] to grab it. And for AI to succeed, cost has to go down and energy efficiency has to [improve].\n\n\u201cThis will only come with innovation. And I can promise you that in our industry any innovation that has ever reduced cost has always created more volume, and more opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe CEO said he continued to expect that global sales of semiconductors would rise to the trillion-dollar level by 2030, thanks in large part to AI - even if it was not yet clear exactly how that would play out in terms of the specific sectors and applications driving the more widespread adoption of AI chips beyond the current consumption of high-end devices effectively being deployed in hyperscale data centers for AI research activity.\n\n\u201cAI success has two main challenges going forward: cost; and power consumption. In order for AI to be everywhere, we need to see major progress [on those],\u201d Fouquet added in a press conference where he was asked about the impact of DeepSeek.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what DeepSeek can or cannot do, but anything that will drive costs down is good news for ASML in the long term.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Following the firm\u2019s January 29 update, ASML\u2019s stock price regained most of the value lost in the immediate aftermath of the DeepSeek news. It is now trading at around $740 on the Nasdaq market, down from the all-time high of just over $1000 it reached last summer.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 9 Semiconductor Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) stands against other semiconductor stocks that Jim Cramer has made bold predictions about.\n\nSemiconductor stocks were once again at the forefront of media and investor attention this week during the stock market selloff triggered by investor apprehensions about lower AI development costs courtesy of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI models. Because AI has dominated headlines for more than a year now, most of Cramer\u2019s attention during his morning appearances focused on the technology whether it was before or after the selloff.\n\nBefore the selloff, on Friday, the CNBC TV show host started out by discussing the applications of AI. While most of the public\u2019s attention is focused on chatbots, AI\u2019s business use cases are quite diverse. One such use case is in the healthcare industry and another comes through the financial services sector. Cramer commented on both of these:\n\n\u201cI think that what we\u2019re not thinking about, like when I went to Jensen Huang\u2019s panel on healthcare. It\u2019s so much bigger than anything involving AI PC. I mean they\u2019re really just talking about having the data to really attack every single disease and changing it from fatal to maintenance. You have tremendous number of people involved in trying to do that. Then you have Stripe there working with [the GPU company] to be able to do something revolutionary in finance. And then you have the banks working doing some revolutionary things trying to get people who\u2019re doing S1s. . . .\u201d\n\nThe DeepSeek AI selloff was notable particularly because of the impact on the shares of Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI GPU company. The firm, which was the world\u2019s most valuable company ahead of the selloff, bled close to $600 billion in market value and lost its top spot to the company behind the iPhone. For Cramer, while the lower AI development costs were commendable, the use cases for the AI GPU firm\u2019s products were beyond large language models:\n\n\u201cWell, look, there\u2019s no doubt about the cost is great for this. But if you\u2019re gonna go forward and you\u2019re gonna do what Jensen was talking about, which is anything physical, anything physical with Blackwell. It\u2019s going to be better than what we do. I\u2019m just saying that Jensen\u2019s on a plane of his own. And that, if you have low commodity, Jensen\u2019s got the three thousand dollar chip that can handle that. Was I shocked by this? No it was nice that they came up with such a low price.\u201d\n\nFor semiconductor stocks, one AI-generate catalyst that did not materialize is the AI PC. These PCs use a special chip called a neural processing unit (NPU) along with CPUs and GPUs to run AI tasks. In an appearance before the DeepSeek selloff, Cramer mentioned a Morgan Stanley report that shared that 60% of people surveyed had accidentally bought an AI PC and more than 60% were uncomfortable paying extra for AI products. The report, which added that just 15% of the respondents had bought a new product because of AI was \u201cperhaps the most damming piece\u201d that Cramer had read.\n\nHe shared that \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no evidence of a super cycle whatsoever,\u201d and cycled back to enterprise AI use cases by stating \u201cI mean I think AI is very good when you listen to what Jamie Dimon [inaudible] to say, that AI is very good when you listen to what Marc Benioff has to say.\u201d\n\nCramer added that not only was he wrong about the AI PC cycle as the PC he \u201cthought we were all gonna upgrade. And now we\u2019re all in wait-and-see mode,\u201d but those who he knew had bought such a PC \u201chaven\u2019t used it or there\u2019s a button there and it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bold predictions about stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street after September 2024. Then, we picked out semiconductor stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nLam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 58\n\nDate of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 10-18-24\n\nPerformance Since Then: 15.4%\n\nLam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) is an American firm that makes machines used in chip fabrication. The shares have gained 15.4% since Cramer\u2019s remarks on the back of TSMC raising capital spending, analyst coverage, and a strong earnings report. The gains are despite the fact that Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)\u2019s shares dipped by 5.8% during the DeepSeek selloff. After its fiscal third quarter revenue forecast of $4.65 billion beat analyst estimates of $4.34 billion, the shares jumped by 7.4%. Here\u2019s what Cramer had said about Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) in October:\n\n\u201c\u2026 Now, Lam Research is a much better company than ASML. I think it\u2019ll tell a good story. I think it\u2019s got a healthy buyback. Very risky, though. If it\u2019s just only because expectations have been lowered here, it might work. But the problem with Lam is, is that what happens if ASML is at all right, then Lam won\u2019t pop. But that\u2019s not that big a risk.\u201d\n\nOverall, LRCX ranks 7th on our list of semiconductor stocks that Jim Cramer has made bold predictions about. While we acknowledge the potential of LRCX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LRCX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

According to a report in Reuters, unlike technology giants in the US who saw their stock market wealth get wiped out by billions this week, ASML sees the emergence of China's DeepSeek as a positive. The CEO Christophe Fouquet expressed a positive outlook on the impact of efficient AI models, like the one recently launched by China's DeepSeek, on the chip market. He believes that these advancements will ultimately benefit the industry, despite the initial market tremors triggered by DeepSeek's release.Fouquet clarified that the perception of AI-related chip demand is often distorted by the massive investments made by hyperscalers \u2013 companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft. These US-based technology giants are pouring billions into building massive data centers equipped with cutting-edge chips specifically for training large AI models. He argued that while these investments are substantial, the number of chips used for this purpose is relatively small compared to the broader potential of AI.Speaking after ASML announced strong earnings, driven largely by robust demand for chip-making equipment related to AI, Fouquet addressed concerns about DeepSeek's impact, which had previously caused a significant drop in tech stock prices. He emphasized that the real driver of growth for ASML will be the widespread use of AI in various applications, rather than just the training of large models.Fouquet pointed to a wide range of applications, from smartphones and cars to robotics and industrial systems, as potential growth areas for AI-related chip demand. He stressed the importance of cost-effectiveness. \"If you want to have an AI chip on your phone, the cost of those chips has to be a fraction of what maybe the hyperscaler can pay for it,\" he reportedly said. The ASML CEO further argued that if chip costs don't decrease, the market will remain limited, benefiting only a few and hindering mass adoption. \"If the cost doesn't go down, you may continue to sell a few very expensive chips and make a few people very happy, but you will not basically bring this technology to the masses and the volume will remain small.\"Regarding DeepSeek specifically, Fouquet stated, as per the report, \"I don't know exactly what DeepSeek can or cannot do, but I say again, anything that will drive costs down is good news for ASML on the long term.\" He sees the potential for such advancements to broaden the market and increase overall chip demand.",

(NASDAQ:ASML) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer looked closely at.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s first few weeks in office on the financial markets. Cramer pointed out that while some investors had expected severe tariffs under Trump\u2019s administration, many have begun to believe that these expectations may be exaggerated.\n\nAccording to Cramer, Wall Street initially became excited about a potentially more flexible approach under Trump. Investors were concerned that Trump might take a hard stance against Mexico and Canada, but as the situation developed, it became clear that his actions would not be as extreme as initially feared. He added:\n\n\u201cBefore taking the White House, he talked about putting 25% tariffs on our two longstanding trading partners immediately but then when the America First Trade policy memo came out, we saw that the administration wants to study the situation.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer\u2019s Thoughts on These 7 Stocks and Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently\n\nCramer remarked that although Trump had made bold statements about renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America,\" his actual policies have been more tempered. Cramer noted that if Trump can find someone in Canada willing to negotiate, he would pursue that, and he\u2019s already receiving business-like responses from Mexico\u2019s president, Claudia Sheinbaum. He added:\n\n\u201cAgain, the rhetoric was hot, but the reality was cool. Sure there are some real harsh words for a lot of the environmental rules and regulations and grants that President Biden jammed through the last four years. Trump has no time for these.\u201d\n\nIn addition to trade policies, Cramer also commented on Trump\u2019s stance regarding environmental regulations. Trump has made it clear that he has no patience for many of the environmental rules and grants implemented during the previous administration. Cramer pointed out that Trump views oil and gas as essential to America\u2019s economic strength, believing that increased drilling and production would lead to lower oil prices and enhance U.S. power abroad.\n\nHowever, Cramer acknowledged that it\u2019s unclear how much influence Trump can exert over the oil and gas industry. He emphasized the need for more infrastructure, particularly pipelines, to facilitate both domestic and international distribution of natural gas. While oil executives are aware of the political pressure to increase production, they also know that any loss of discipline in response to presidential demands could lead to plummeting prices and financial losses.",

Kantrowitz highlighted that AI development is becoming more affordable as it is shifting the focus from infrastructure to practical applications. Companies integrating AI into their products stand to gain the most, while infrastructure-based businesses face uncertainty as models become more accessible. He emphasized the need for real-world applications to sustain AI\u2019s momentum.\n\nChung shared an optimistic view and noted that lower costs could drive wider AI adoption. He acknowledged the need for further validation of DeepSeek\u2019s claims but recognized its potential to reshape AI development. The conversation also explored the rise of open-source AI, which is challenging proprietary models by promoting collective advancements. While there is some skepticism remaining over DeepSeek\u2019s reported costs, its results suggest a significant shift in AI\u2019s evolution.\n\nAI is evolving quickly, with advancements making it cheaper to develop and more accessible through open-source models. While early discussions centered on infrastructure and cloud computing, the focus is now shifting to real-world applications. Investors and tech leaders are watching closely to see if these breakthroughs will lead to meaningful innovation or if the excitement is outpacing reality.

But even here, the company beat expectations, winning new orders worth EUR 7,1 billion, while expectations were about half that.\n\nIn addition, the company also issued a nice outlook for the current quarter.\n\n\u2192 If you are interested in this or other analyses of the results of large companies, you can find all the videos in the playlist titled on the XTB channel Results season with XTB.\n\nThe second European company was LVMH, which brings together dozens of luxury brands. In this case, the numbers were worse than ASML's, but it's definitely not a disaster.\n\nLVMH grew slightly year-on-year in organic sales (after removing the impact of exchange rates).\n\nAlthough profit has decreased, management largely attributes this to changes in exchange rates and high employee expenses at the Paris Olympics.\n\nVirtually all regions and segments performed well, with the exception of China and alcohol. China has been experiencing economic difficulties for some time, which has led to lower demand for luxury goods.\n\nDespite the stagnation last year, LVMH sees its future positively and expects 2025 to be definitely better.\n\nThree large American companies also provided us with numbers. The first of them was an electric car manufacturer TeslaIn short, we can say that the company delivered a very weak earnings report.\n\nTesla failed to meet expectations in terms of sales, profits, and even margins.\n\nTotal sales grew by only 2% and car sales even fell by 8%.\n\nHowever, the results as such were saved by Elon Musk on a call with investors, who again promised many things by the end of this year in the area of \u200b\u200bautonomy, robo-taxis and Optimus robots, which pulled the shares up.onec slightly upwards.\n\nHowever, it brought very good numbers Meta, parent company Facebookon, Instagram, Whatsappu, Messengeror Threads.\n\nIn this case, all the important numbers were exceeded.

That's why he wants to invest $60 billion to $65 billion in servers and other physical infrastructure this year.\n\nActions Targetsonec grew slightly.\n\nThe last interesting company to publish its results was Microsoft.\n\nIn recent years, investors have been looking mainly at the segment cloudon which artificial intelligence is operated. Although this segment achieved a growth of a nice 31%, expectations were even a little higher.\n\nEqually Microsoft also issued a slightly worse outlook, as problems with some suppliers in the area persist cloudu.\n\nThe remaining segments, which include, for example, office products, licenses for Windows, games, security or advertising, however, most of them exceeded expectations, so we can also evaluate the results as solid in this case.\n\nMicrosoft, like Meta, is planning huge capital expenditures this year, expected to total approximately $80 billion.\n\nHowever, shares fell slightly after the results were released, as investors were disappointed by the weaker outlook in the area of cloudof the segment.\n\nIf you are interested in the results of large companies, XTB publishes a summary of the results of around 30 companies on its website four times a year.

However, is it possible to maintain this pace of advancement? In order to do so, we must continually build upon our ability to design systems smaller and smaller. In 2023, this means operating on a scale dealing in nanometres.\n\nWith that in mind, the following publicly traded companies are examples of those leading the way, leveraging nanotechnology that spans from circuitry to displays, healthcare, and more.\n\nIBM has played a pivotal role in nanotechnology since its researchers invented the scanning tunneling microscope \u2013 a tool enabling the visualization of atomic structures. More recently, IBM developed a 2-nanometer semiconductor chip using nanosheet technology, which is set to enhance various widespread technologies from autonomous vehicles to IoT. The company believes that,\n\n\u201cAs the world becomes more instrumented, with billions of transistors embedded in everything from cars to appliances to livestock, nanotechnology will play an increasingly important role in the design of future computer chips that are smaller, smarter and more energy efficient. To achieve these performance goals, sophisticated nanotechnology processes are needed to fabricate these increasingly small transistors. Just as cells are the basic building blocks for the human body, IBM envisions a world in which nanotechnology processes are the basic building blocks for transistors and microprocessors.\u201d\n\nThis ability to scale and approach toward nanotechnology has allowed IBM to position itself as a leader in the field.\n\nA tour of the IBM Nanobiotechnology Lab\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $116.85B\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 65.7\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $1.97\n\nAt the time of writing, IBM boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nApplied Materials leverages its decades-long expertise in nanotechnology to provide equipment and software for semiconductor manufacturing. This includes products such as high-resolution displays, solar power, and more.\n\nThe company is particularly proficient in molecular nanotechnology, which involves the manipulation of atoms to engineer precise materials for clients around the globe. This proficiency has allowed Applied Materials to satisfy skyrocketing demand for its nanotech products, even during global chip shortages.\n\nMarket Cap: $120.44B\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 19.33\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $7.58\n\nAt the time of writing, Applied Materials boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Strong Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific, a Fortune 500 company, uses nanotechnology to produce a variety of scientific instruments, reagents, and consumables. This has allowed the company to capitalize on the growing healthcare and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nVenturing into nanotech has also positioned the company as a leader in the growing biophotonics market \u2013 a segment that could be worth in excess of $100 billion by 2027.\n\nThe Fisher Scientific Story\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $196.00B\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 33.22\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $15.34\n\nAt the time of writing, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Strong Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is a key player in the nanotech industry. It was the first to develop 22nm magnetoresistive RAM (MRAM) technology, which stores data through the use of magnetic orientation, and outpaced Intel in producing the first 7nm chip.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Morgan Stanley's 15 Best European AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) stands against Morgan Stanley's other European AI stocks.\n\nIn August last year, investment bank Morgan Stanley released an investor note highlighting that even though the chaos around prominent AI firms had somewhat subsided, an AI rumbling in Europe was just about to begin. Analysts at the investment firm compared the AI buzz to historical similarities in the mid-1990s, just before the internet craze. According to Morgan Stanley analysts, European semi stocks were experiencing a tactical correction and would hit new highs in the coming months. The note further detailed that a basket of these equities, handpicked by these experts, and nicknamed AI winners, had returned close to 45% on average since January 2023, the beginning of the AI revolution. These firms had outperformed the 14% jump recorded by the MSCI Europe benchmark, per the research.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn the months since, European AI stocks have experienced significant volatility, most recently influenced by global developments and investor sentiment. A notable event was the introduction of a low-cost AI model by Chinese startup DeepSeek, which raised concerns about the profitability of existing AI companies that rely on expensive chips and infrastructure. This led to a sharp decline in European tech stocks, with the European tech index dropping 5.8%, marking the worst decline since October 2024. However, the market showed resilience shortly after. European shares reached a record high, driven by gains in retail and utilities stocks as tensions in the tech sector subsided. European stock pickers are exploring established sectors such as utilities, professional data providers, and even copper miners to tap into the next wave of AI advancements. This approach reflects a strategic shift towards industries that can support and benefit from AI infrastructure and applications.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected companies based in Europe that have been benefiting from the AI boom. An important investor note by investment bank Morgan Stanley on European AI stocks formed the basis for this list. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

As the year progresses, they will have more visibility and will adjust their production plans accordingly.\n\nQ: Can you provide insights into the cost dynamics of High NA installations and their impact on gross margins?\n\nA: Roger Dassen noted that the costs were lower than expected in the last quarter, which was a one-off benefit. The learnings from this are embedded in the 2025 projections, but the gross margin is expected to be slightly lower in the second half due to revenue recognition timing for High NA systems.\n\nQ: What is ASML's perspective on the potential for High NA EUV systems to be used more quickly by customers?\n\nA: Christophe Fouquet, CEO, stated that while performance is promising, the maturity of the platform is crucial. The process typically takes 12 to 18 months, and discussions with customers are ongoing to determine the exact timeline for high-volume manufacturing.\n\nQ: Why has ASML decided to phase out quarterly bookings information and only provide annual backlog updates?\n\nA: Roger Dassen explained that quarterly order intake can be lumpy and does not accurately reflect business momentum. The decision aims to provide a more meaningful and stable view of business performance, based on robust annual guidance and customer dialogues.\n\nQ: How does ASML view the impact of AI demand on its business, particularly in relation to potential offsets from other market segments like smartphones?\n\nA: Christophe Fouquet indicated that AI demand is strong and is expected to drive utilization of advanced Logic capacity. While other markets like mobile are not spectacular, there are signs of recovery, and ASML sees more upside than risk in the current demand dynamics.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.",

(at present) we can monitor how average bookings are moving and whether we are getting confidence in the backlog for the next 12+ months,\" said Sara Russo of Bernstein.\"I do agree with ASML that in the context of a single quarter of bookings, it's not a very useful measure of the longer-term health and stability of the business.\"Fourth-quarter bookings of 7.1 billion euros ($7.4 billion) compared to the third quarter's 2.6 billion euros. The big difference was likely timing of orders from top chipmaker TSMC of Taiwan, which this month announced plans for $38 billion in capital spending in 2025.\"Capex for large spenders TSMC, Intel, and Samsung already tells you enough,\" said Degroof Petercam analyst Michael Roeg, who said he was okay with ASML's decision despite initially viewing it as a step backward in transparency.In 2024, ASML shares surged more than 30% and then handed back all of those gains, but Dassen noted the company's full-year sales and margins wound up in line with forecasts the company had issued last January.\"If you put all those quarters together, you see it wasn't too shabby, was it?\" he told reporters.",

This slightly specifies the previously communicated delivery of 2025.\n\nASML CEO Christophe Fouquet confirmed that ASML will deliver the first modules of the TwinScan EXE:5200 to a customer in the coming months. It has been known for some time that Intel is the first customer.\n\nThe top executive said the first EXE:5200 modules have been \u201cfinalized,\u201d although the company will continue to work to increase high-NA productivity in the future, including by increasing light source power and wafer staging speed.\n\nOn Jan. 19, ASML announced that Intel placed an initial order for delivery of the industry\u2019s first-ever TwinScan EXE:5200 system. This is an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) production device with a high numerical aperture and a productivity of more than 200 wafers per hour. According to a press release, this initial order is part of the long-term partnership between the two companies in the high-NA (High Numerical Aperture) field. Current equipment would potentially run with it as well with some minor modifications.\n\nIntel already pioneered introduction of TwinScan EXE:5000\n\nAt its Accelerated event in July, Intel announced it will be the first to deploy High-NA technology to enable next-generation transistor innovations. The chipmaker was the first customer to purchase the TwinScan EXE:5000 system in 2018. The new purchase continues the collaboration between Intel and ASML to bring High-NA EUV into production this year.\n\nIntel is also the first company to have a manufacturing process based on high-NA on its roadmap, 14A, to be introduced in 2026. The machine will be delivered to Intel\u2019s Oregon plant, where the company does the bulk of its R&D work.\n\nEvolutionary step\n\nThe EXE platform is an evolutionary step in EUV technology and includes an innovative optical design and significantly faster reticle and wafer stages. The TwinScan EXE:5000 and EXE:5200 systems feature a numerical aperture of 0.55 \u2013 a significant precision improvement over previous EUV machines with a 0.33 NA lens. This allows even smaller transistor structures to be etched. Combining the numerical aperture and the wavelength used determines the smallest printable structures.\n\nAlso read: ASML CEO: DeepSeek AI positive for chip demand",

A: Roger Dassen, CFO, explained that ASML is preparing for potential upside by incorporating some of the expected demand into their supply plan. As the year progresses, they will have more visibility and will adjust their production plans accordingly.\n\nQ: Can you provide insights into the cost dynamics of High NA installations and their impact on gross margins? A: Roger Dassen noted that the costs were lower than expected in the last quarter, which was a one-off benefit. The learnings from this are embedded in the 2025 projections, but the gross margin is expected to be slightly lower in the second half due to revenue recognition timing for High NA systems.\n\nQ: What is ASML's perspective on the potential for High NA EUV systems to be used more quickly by customers? A: Christophe Fouquet, CEO, stated that while performance is promising, the maturity of the platform is crucial. The process typically takes 12 to 18 months, and discussions with customers are ongoing to determine the exact timeline for high-volume manufacturing.\n\nQ: Why has ASML decided to phase out quarterly bookings information and only provide annual backlog updates? A: Roger Dassen explained that quarterly order intake can be lumpy and does not accurately reflect business momentum. The decision aims to provide a more meaningful and stable view of business performance, based on robust annual guidance and customer dialogues.\n\nQ: How does ASML view the impact of AI demand on its business, particularly in relation to potential offsets from other market segments like smartphones? A: Christophe Fouquet indicated that AI demand is strong and is expected to drive utilization of advanced Logic capacity. While other markets like mobile are not spectacular, there are signs of recovery, and ASML sees more upside than risk in the current demand dynamics.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "Key Morningstar Metrics for ASML Holding\n\nASML Holding ASML exceeded all expectations in its fourth-quarter results, with shares surging 11% intraday. New orders came in strongly at EUR 7.1 billion\u2014in a context where EUR 4 billion would have been a success. Despite this strength, management remained cautious and maintained its EUR 30 billion-EUR 35 billion revenue guidance for 2025. Although this can look conservative at first glance, it\u2019s based on the weakness shown by Intel INTC and Samsung, which have likely pushed some orders to 2026, as they still have challenges in ramping up production of leading-edge nodes. We\u2019ve raised our 2025 revenue estimate to EUR 34.2 billion from EUR 32.5 billion, but maintain our fair value estimate, as our long-term forecasts remain largely unchanged. Shares still offer 20% upside.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s contribution to 2024 total system sales has been low at only 11% compared with a 31% average from 2015-24. We see room for incremental Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM orders to show up in ASML\u2019s books during 2025. This is supported by Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s strong capital expenditure guidance of EUR 36.5 billion-EUR 40.5 billion, a 34% year-on-year increase at the midpoint. The firm keeps ramping up production of its 2nm process node at the Hsinchu and Kaohsiung fabs, which will require more tooling. Additional orders in the coming quarters should increase visibility into 2026, but the outlook still faces uncertainty.\n\nThese tailwinds could be offset by weaker capex trends from Intel and Samsung. Any updates on their spending plans will provide further clarity on fab equipment demand over the next 12-18 months. According to the South Korean newspaper Software Engineering Daily, Samsung is slashing its 2025 foundry capex by 50% to EUR 3.37 billion. Intel and Samsung report earnings on Jan. 30 and 31, respectively. On the memory front, Micron Technology MU will increase capex to EUR 13.6 billion in 2025 from EUR 7.8 billion in 2024, while SK Hynix 000660 signaled flat spending.\n\nASML Holding Stock vs. Morningstar Fair Value Estimate\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct.

That company is ASML NASDAQ: ASML, a Dutch equipment manufacturer vital to the semiconductor industry. Shares of ASML dropped nearly 6% on Jan. 27 after news surrounding the Chinese company DeepSeek became widely publicized. A report that the firm built an open-source AI model, rivaling ChatGPT, for just $6 million sent many chip stocks plummeting. By the Jan. 29 close, ASML had recovered around half of that loss.\n\nBelow, I\u2019ll detail the important news from ASML\u2019s earnings. I\u2019ll provide an updated outlook on the stock and break down how ASML\u2019s results affect the broader semiconductor industry. I\u2019ll also share why ASML executives see DeepSeek\u2019s accomplishment as an opportunity rather than a risk.\n\nGet ASML alerts: Sign Up\n\nASML: AI Drives Strong Demand for Lithography Equipment\n\nASML has achieved over $275 billion in market capitalization through its stranglehold on advanced lithography equipment. This equipment is essential to chip makers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE: TSM. It enables them to produce the world's most advanced chips. When it comes to the most advanced lithography equipment, ASML has a near monopoly. As such, demand for ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines is a leading indicator of demand for AI chips.\n\nASML delivered both strong backward-looking and forward-looking results. In the fourth quarter, the company beat estimates on both sales and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by nearly 3%. For the full 2024 year, sales notched up slightly from 2023. However, among the most important revelations from the report came in the company\u2019s net bookings. Net bookings represent orders the company has received, an indicator of future revenue. Companies like ASML can\u2019t actually recognize these orders as revenue until they deliver the equipment. Net bookings increased by a staggering 169% from Q3 to nearly 7.1 billion euros. This was around double the figure analysts expected.\n\nEven more interesting was the company\u2019s net bookings for EUV machines, the most advanced equipment it makes. EUV bookings came in at 3 billion euros, which is more than many expected. The company said that AI continues to drive demand for its equipment. ASML still maintains a massive 36 billion in bookings. One analyst estimated on the earnings call that this means 2025 is fully booked and 2026 is 30% to 40% booked.\n\nKey Takeaways for ASML and AI-Chip Industry\n\nThere are some important takeaways from ASML's results. They show that, at least for now, investment in AI chipmaking remains strong. This rings particularly true when looking at the company\u2019s much higher-than-expected EUV bookings. Fabricators need these specific machines to make the most advanced AI chips. Overall, the strong bookings of these machines are a positive indicator for AI-driven parts of the semiconductor industry. However, the net bookings likely don't reflect changes in ASML customers' long-term capital spending due to DeepSeek.\n\nASML Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$937.00\n\n33.22% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 11 Analyst Ratings High Forecast $1,100.00 Average Forecast $937.00 Low Forecast $767.00 ASML Stock Forecast Details\n\nASML\u2019s Chief Executive Officer indirectly addressed the implications of DeepSeek in an interview with CNBC. He said, \u201cA lower cost of AI could mean more applications. More applications mean more demand over time. We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand.\" Overall, the CEO spun the potential democratization of AI through lower cost as driving higher volumes for its equipment. This feels like a fair take from the executive.\n\nHowever, if the industry sees it can make capable AI apps without the most advanced chips, demand for lower-cost ASML competitors could rise. ASML still completely dominates its market, but it isn\u2019t the only player in lithography. Canon recently shipped its first nanoimprint lithography machine, which it hopes can rival ASML\u2019s EUV machines. Manufacturers can use Canon\u2019s machines to make chips using the 5-nanometer process. However, that\u2019s still less advanced than the 4-nanometer NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA H800 chips DeepSeek apparently used to build its model. Overall, Canon has yet to pose a legitimate threat to ASML.\n\nASML: Still a Dominant Chip Name With Upside\n\nASML still looks like it is on firm footing. To me, the implications of DeepSeek are currently neutral for the stock. Given the strong results and outlook, there could be significant upside in ASML shares as the AI revolution pushes forward and continues to evolve. Wall Street analysts' price targets tracked by MarketBeat see implied upside in ASML shares of over 30% as of the Jan. 29 market close.\n\nBefore you consider ASML, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

These include customer dynamics and geopolitical factors, which ASML is monitoring closely to mitigate any adverse impacts.\n\nForward-Looking Guidance\n\nDuring the call, ASML provided guidance for Q1 2025, projecting net sales between \u20ac7.5 billion and \u20ac8 billion. The gross margin is expected to range from 52% to 53%, with key drivers being the absence of High NA revenue recognition and lower immersion volume. R&D expenses are forecasted at around \u20ac1.14 billion, and SG&A at approximately \u20ac290 million. For the full year 2025, revenue is anticipated to be between \u20ac30 billion and \u20ac35 billion, with a gross margin between 51% and 53%. The company emphasized AI as a critical growth driver while acknowledging potential geopolitical risks.\n\nIn summary, ASML\u2019s Q4 2024 earnings call illustrated a strong financial performance with a positive sentiment driven by exceeded revenue and gross margin expectations. Key highlights included record free cash flow, advancements in High NA EUV systems, and an optimistic 2025 outlook. While challenges such as declines in Logic and EUV sales and geopolitical risks were noted, ASML\u2019s strategic initiatives and forward-looking guidance indicate a proactive approach to sustaining growth and shareholder value.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "In this article ASML-NL Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nA logo on the exterior of the ASML Holding NV headquarters in Veldhoven, Netherlands, on Wednesday, Jan. 24, 2024. Peter Boer | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nDutch semiconductor giant ASML on Wednesday reported a big jump in fourth-quarter net bookings, suggesting strong demand for its advanced chipmaking tools even as DeepSeek's low-cost model raises concerns over AI spending. ASML shares surged as much as 11% during morning deals, but later pared gains later in the day to close 5.6% higher. Here's how ASML did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the fourth quarter: Net sales: 9.26 billion euros ($9.64 billion) versus 9.07 billion euros expected.\n\nNet profit: 2.69 billion euros versus 2.64 billion euros expected. ASML said that net bookings, a key indicator of order demand, came in at 7.09 billion euros. That was up 169% from the 2.63 billion euros ASML reported in the third quarter, and exceeded the 3.99 billion euros expected by analysts polled by Visible Alpha, according to Reuters. The semiconductor equipment maker also said that its 2025 full-year sales outlook remains unchanged from its previous guidance of between 30 billion and 35 billion euros of total revenue. ASML had an order backlog of approximately 36 billion euros at the end of 2024, CFO Roger Dassen said in a transcript of a video interview.\n\nDefying DeepSeek concerns\n\nASML suffered losses during a global tech sell-off earlier in the week after the rollout of Chinese startup DeepSeek's R1 reasoning model, which claims to undercut OpenAI on both cost and performance.\n\nThe move triggered questions over eyewatering spending from the likes of leading AI players OpenAI and Microsoft on Nvidia graphics processing units, which are needed to train and run the most advanced AI models. This could hit demand for ASML's high-precision extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines, which are used to print the most advanced microchips. EUV tools accounted for 3 billion euros of ASML's fourth-quarter net bookings. ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet struck a positive note on the arrival of low-cost AI models such as DeepSeek, telling CNBC's Arjun Kharpal that he expects this development to drive more demand for semiconductors \u2014 not less. While he declined to comment on specifics with DeepSeek's R1, Fouquet said that he sees no sign of a slowdown in demand for AI-focused chips. \"A lower cost of AI could mean more applications. More applications means more demand over time. We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand,\" Fouquet said in an interview Wednesday.\n\nwatch now\n\nThere is \"a lot of discussion\" in the industry surrounding DeepSeek, but Fouquet said ASML hasn't heard from customers asking about the impact of the Chinese firm's model on chip demand. Ben Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said that the earnings report offered \"reassurance to the market following the turmoil due to concerns around DeepSeek.\" Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" that ASML's fourth-quarter results vindicate the view that the chip firm isn't \"overvalued\" or \"full of puff.\" ASML is Morningstar's top AI pick in Europe, he added. \"Genuinely, we think the numbers support the [investment] case and, actually, we think the shares are worth more like 850 (euros) \u2014 which, given the pullback you've seen in the last few weeks, offers a pretty good opportunity for investors,\" Field said Wednesday. ASML shares closed at 646.60 euros per share Tuesday.\n\nSlowdown in China demand\n\nFouquet added that ASML's expecting a rebalancing of demand in China in 2025. Over the past two years, ASML saw heightened demand for its chipmaking tools in the country as Chinese firms stocked up to get ahead of U.S. restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductor machines.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"We had a huge backlog in China, at the end of 2022, because 2022 was a year we couldn't feed the market with all the tools the market needed. This has kind of been absorbed last year,\" Fouquet told CNBC. He added that ASML expects to return to a more \"normal\" demand ratio in China, compared with other markets this year. \"We expect the ratio of our business in China to be lower than what it has been for sure in 23, 24,\" Fouquet added.",

ASML stock rose on the news.\n\nThe Veldhoven, Netherlands, company earned the equivalent of $7.14 a share on sales of $9.66 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of $7.04 a share on sales of $9.54 billion. In the year-earlier period, ASML earned $5.68 a share on sales of $7.89 billion, FactSet said. ASML reports financial results in euros.\n\nQuarterly net bookings were 7.1 billion euros vs. the consensus of 3.5 billion. ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography equipment accounted for 42% of its Q4 bookings.\n\nFor the first quarter, ASML predicted sales of 7.75 billion euros ($8.07 billion), based on the midpoint of its guidance. Analysts were modeling $7.59 billion.\n\nThe company reiterated its 2025 revenue outlook of 30 billion to 35 billion euros, vs. 28.3 billion in 2024.\n\n\"Consistent with our view from the last quarter, the growth in artificial intelligence is the key driver for growth in our industry,\" Chief Executive Christophe Fouquet said in a news release. \"It has created a shift in the market dynamics that is not benefiting all of our customers equally, which creates both opportunities and risks as reflected in our 2025 revenue range.\"\n\nASML Stock Advances On Q4 Report\n\nOn the stock market today, ASML stock popped 4.3% to close at 712.65. That pushed shares back to their 50-day moving average line, but the chip giant is still in a downtrend after peaking in July.\n\nBernstein analyst Sara Russo reiterated her outperform rating on ASML stock with a price target of 887.\n\n\"While overall a solid set of results, and that strong bookings number should give investors some reassurance on 2025, we believe there is still a lot to play out in AI demand as DeepSeek impact is better understood,\" Russo said in a client note. \"Longer term we remain bullish on the opportunity for ASML, but caution may prevail until we understand the more near-term implications.\"\n\nDeepSeek's AI model, built with inferior processors vs. U.S. systems, is making cloud computing service providers rethink their AI infrastructure buildout plans.\n\nFollow Patrick Seitz on X, formerly Twitter, at @IBD_PSeitz for more stories on consumer technology, software and semiconductor stocks.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nSynopsys Purchase Of Ansys Will Fulfill Company's Goal\n\nWhat's Next For Nvidia, AI Chip Stocks After DeepSeek 'Wake-Up Call'?\n\nSee Stocks On The List Of Leaders Near A Buy Point\n\nFind Winning Stocks With MarketSurge Pattern Recognition & Custom Screens\n\nJoin IBD Live For Stock Ideas Each Morning Before The Open",

The latest version of those EUV machines costs nearly $400 million.\n\nASML sells its machines to chip manufacturers such as TSMC (TSM), which uses those machines to produce chips for Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and other tech heavyweights.\n\nThe Dutch firm on Wednesday reported earnings per share of 6.85 euros, ahead of the 6.68 euros expected, and its quarterly revenue of 9.2 billion euros topped the 9 billion euros forecast, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. The company reported taking orders of more than 7 billion euros worth of its tools in the fourth quarter, double the 3.5 billion euros expected. Half of that value came from orders of its EUV machines for AI chips, the company said in a call with analysts Wednesday.\n\nASML\u2019s 2025 first quarter sales forecast also surpassed expectations, with its guidance range of 7.5 billion euros to 8 billion euros ahead of the 7.2 billion euros consensus estimate, per Bloomberg.\n\n\"Consistent with our view from the last quarter, the growth in artificial intelligence is the key driver for growth in our industry,\u201d CEO Christophe Fouquet said in a statement.\n\n\"It has created a shift in the market dynamics that is not benefiting all of our customers equally, which creates both opportunities and risks as reflected in our 2025 revenue range.\u201d\n\nASML\u2019s results were under more scrutiny than usual after its prior quarterly earnings came in far below expectations and sent its stocks \u2014 and those of other chipmakers \u2014 tumbling.\n\nShares have been under pressure in recent weeks amid announcements of more restrictive export controls from the Netherlands and the US, which seek to disrupt China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors.\n\nWhile ASML has never been permitted to export EUV lithography machines to China, its sales of other equipment to the region have surged in recent years. ASML\u2019s revenue from China rose to roughly 9 billion euros in 2024 from 6.4 billion euros the previous year, per Bloomberg data.\n\nFouquet said in the call with analysts that ASML's expectations for its China business haven't changed. The company already expected China sales to moderate in 2025 and beyond to represent around 20% of its total revenue. Still, the executive contended that geopolitics present risks that could push sales toward the lower end of its 2025 guidance.",

            "content": "Key points:\n\nEarnings Call Focus : ASML\u2019s Q4 2024 earnings call will be crucial for understanding its response to emerging challenges, including DeepSeek\u2019s disruptive AI model and shifting demand for high-end chips.\n\nResilience Amid Challenges : While ASML faces headwinds from geopolitical tensions and customer concentration, its monopoly on EUV lithography and strong recurring revenue streams provide a solid foundation.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s Disruption : The rise of DeepSeek highlights China\u2019s growing ability to innovate under constraints, potentially challenging ASML\u2019s market dominance and raising questions about the effectiveness of U.S. export controls\n\nASML, the Dutch leader in advanced semiconductor equipment, is preparing to release its Q4 2024 earnings on 29 January 2025. With market dynamics shifting due to the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, and the broader implications of geopolitical tensions, this earnings report comes at a critical point in time. Investors will closely scrutinise both the results and the earnings call, as ASML\u2019s management provides insight into how the company plans to navigate these emerging challenges.\n\n\n\nWhy This Earnings Call Matters\n\nThe financial results are important, but the earnings call will likely be the main event, offering investors a clearer understanding of ASML\u2019s response to recent disruptions. Key areas of focus include:\n\nEUV Demand : Will ASML provide reassurance about the long-term adoption rates of its cutting-edge lithography systems?\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s Impact : Investors will look for comments on how the emergence of DeepSeek\u2019s cost-effective AI models might alter demand for high-performance chips and, by extension, ASML\u2019s equipment.\n\nFuture Strategy : How will ASML adapt to geopolitical challenges and shifting market dynamics to maintain its leadership in the semiconductor supply chain?\n\nWhat\u2019s said during this call could have significant implications for ASML\u2019s stock price and the broader technology sector.\n\n\n\nQ4 2024 Expectations\n\nDespite the uncertainty, analysts expect ASML to report strong results:\n\nRevenue : Forecasted at EUR 9.0 billion , reflecting a robust year-on-year growth of 26.6%.\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS) : Estimated at EUR 6.68 , supported by steady demand for ASML\u2019s EUV machines.\n\nGross Margins : Expected at 49%\u201350% , slightly constrained due to the high costs associated with High-NA EUV systems.\n\nFor 2025, ASML has guided total net sales of EUR 30\u201335 billion, at the lower end of prior estimates, reflecting cautious optimism amid challenges such as export restrictions and market shifts.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s Disruption: A Game Changer?\n\nDeepSeek has emerged as a disruptive force with an AI model that achieves high performance using less advanced and cheaper hardware, challenging the assumption that AI advancements require increasingly sophisticated chips reliant on ASML\u2019s lithography systems. As a result, ASML shares, like those of other AI-focused companies, have dropped sharply as investors reassess growth prospects for high-end chips.\n\n\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s success underscores China\u2019s ability to innovate under constraints, raising concerns about the sustainability of Western dominance in chipmaking technology. Its rise also highlights China\u2019s strategic advantages in IT talent, government support, and a vast domestic market, which could drive further breakthroughs in advanced chipmaking.\n\n\n\nThe development also casts doubt on the effectiveness of U.S. export controls intended to slow China\u2019s technological progress. If these measures fail, ASML and its peers may face intensified competition and shifting market dynamics.\n\n\n\nPositives: ASML\u2019s Resilience and Opportunities\n\nDespite recent disruptions, ASML has several strengths that underpin its long-term potential:\n\nMonopoly on EUV Technology : ASML remains the sole supplier of EUV lithography machines, which are critical for producing next-generation chips used in AI, 5G, and high-performance computing. Recurring Revenue Streams : The Installed Base Management business, including upgrades and maintenance, provides steady income, offering resilience against market volatility. Geographic Expansion : While China\u2019s share of revenue faces pressure from export restrictions, ASML is well-positioned to benefit from semiconductor investments in Europe and the U.S.\n\nChallenges: DeepSeek and Geopolitics\n\nHowever, the company faces significant hurdles:\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s Disruption : If AI models increasingly rely on cost-efficient chips, demand for the advanced semiconductors that drive ASML\u2019s EUV sales may slow. Investors will want to hear management\u2019s perspective on this shift. Geopolitical Risks : U.S.-led export controls continue to limit ASML\u2019s sales to China, one of its largest markets. China\u2019s efforts to develop domestic lithography capabilities add further complexity. Customer Dependency : ASML\u2019s reliance on a few key customers, including TSMC, Samsung, and Intel, leaves it vulnerable to spending delays or cutbacks.\n\nWhat to Watch During the Earnings Call\n\nThe earnings call will be pivotal for understanding ASML\u2019s outlook. Key areas to monitor include:\n\nManagement\u2019s Strategy : How does ASML plan to address the risks posed by DeepSeek and shifting demand for advanced chips?\n\nGuidance for 2025 : Investors will look for clarity on EUV bookings and whether deferred orders from major clients like Samsung are likely to materialise.\n\nGeopolitical Insights : Comments on export restrictions and their impact on ASML\u2019s China operations will be critical for assessing long-term growth prospects.\n\nBalanced Outlook: Navigating Risks and Opportunities\n\nASML\u2019s position as a market leader in lithography technology remains a core strength, providing a competitive moat in an evolving semiconductor landscape. However, challenges such as DeepSeek\u2019s disruption, geopolitical tensions, and a concentrated customer base highlight the importance of adaptability.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor investors, the Q4 2024 earnings call offers a crucial opportunity to gauge ASML\u2019s ability to balance near-term risks with its long-term vision. While the company faces undeniable headwinds, its technological leadership and strategic importance to the global chip supply chain provide a solid foundation for navigating the road ahead.\n\n\n\n",

Sign up for NBC LA's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nNet sales: 9.26 billion euros ($9.64 billion) versus 9.07 billion euros expected.\n\nNet profit: 2.69 billion euros versus 2.64 billion euros expected.\n\nASML said that net bookings, a key indicator of order demand, came in at 7.09 billion euros. That was up 169% from the 2.63 billion euros ASML reported in the third quarter, and exceeded the 3.99 billion euros expected by analysts polled by Visible Alpha, according to Reuters.\n\nThe semiconductor equipment maker also said that its 2025 full-year sales outlook remains unchanged from its previous guidance of between 30 billion and 35 billion euros of total revenue.\n\nASML had an order backlog of approximately 36 billion euros at the end of 2024, CFO Roger Dassen said in a transcript of a video interview.\n\nDefying DeepSeek concerns\n\nASML suffered losses during a global tech sell-off earlier in the week after the rollout of Chinese startup DeepSeek's R1 reasoning model, which claims to undercut OpenAI on both cost and performance.\n\nThe move triggered questions over eyewatering spending from the likes of leading AI players OpenAI and Microsoft on Nvidia graphics processing units, which are needed to train and run the most advanced AI models.\n\nThis could hit demand for ASML's high-precision extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines, which are used to print the most advanced microchips. EUV tools accounted for 3 billion euros of ASML's fourth-quarter net bookings.\n\nASML CEO Christophe Fouquet struck a positive note on the arrival of low-cost AI models such as DeepSeek, telling CNBC's Arjun Kharpal that he expects this development to drive more demand for semiconductors \u2014 not less.\n\nWhile he declined to comment on specifics with DeepSeek's R1, Fouquet said that he sees no sign of a slowdown in demand for AI-focused chips.\n\n\"A lower cost of AI could mean more applications. More applications means more demand over time. We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand,\" Fouquet said in an interview Wednesday.\n\nThere is \"a lot of discussion\" in the industry surrounding DeepSeek, but Fouquet said ASML hasn't heard from customers asking about the impact of the Chinese firm's model on chip demand.\n\nBen Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said that the earnings report offered \"reassurance to the market following the turmoil due to concerns around DeepSeek.\"\n\nMichael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" that ASML's fourth-quarter results vindicate the view that the chip firm isn't \"overvalued\" or \"full of puff.\" ASML is Morningstar's top AI pick in Europe, he added.\n\n\"Genuinely, we think the numbers support the [investment] case and, actually, we think the shares are worth more like 850 (euros) \u2014 which, given the pullback you've seen in the last few weeks, offers a pretty good opportunity for investors,\" Field said Wednesday.\n\nASML shares closed at 646.60 euros per share Tuesday.\n\nSlowdown in China demand\n\nFouquet added that ASML's expecting a rebalancing of demand in China in 2025. Over the past two years, ASML saw heightened demand for its chipmaking tools in the country as Chinese firms stocked up to get ahead of U.S. restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductor machines.\n\n\"We had a huge backlog in China, at the end of 2022, because 2022 was a year we couldn't feed the market with all the tools the market needed. This has kind of been absorbed last year,\" Fouquet told CNBC.\n\nHe added that ASML expects to return to a more \"normal\" demand ratio in China, compared with other markets this year.\n\n\"We expect the ratio of our business in China to be lower than what it has been for sure in 23, 24,\" Fouquet added.",

            "content": "A Chinese artificial intelligence company called DeepSeek is grabbing America's attention \u2014 and sending a shock wave through Wall Street \u2014 due to its new tech, which some experts say rivals that of OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nDeepSeek is also catching investors off guard because of the low development costs for its AI app, which Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives pegged at only $6 million. By comparison, OpenAI, Google and other major U.S. companies are on track to invest a total of roughly $1 trillion in AI over the coming years, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nOn Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.\n\n\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"\n\nDeepSeek's latest app comes just days after President Trump announced a new $500 billion venture with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S.\n\nAI-related stocks took a hit on Monday, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17%, shedding $600 billion in value and marking the single-biggest one-day loss for a company in stock market history, according to CNBC. ASML sank 6%, while Broadcom, another semiconductor stock, also slumped 17%.\n\nSome energy-related stocks also plunged on Monday on investor worries that the new tech could require less energy to run, translating into lower demand from the tech sector. GE Vernova, which makes wind and gas turbines, plunged 21%, while electricity generator Vistra slumped 28%.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3%, or 612 points, while the S&P 500 declined 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%.\n\nDespite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.\n\nWhat is DeepSeek?\n\nDeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund, according to the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.\n\nLiang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.\n\nBen Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"\n\nIs DeepSeek available in the U.S.?\n\nThe company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.\n\nOn its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.\n\nThe company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.\n\n\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"\n\nHow is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?\n\nDeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"\n\nSome experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"\n\nDavid Sacks, a venture capitalist named by Mr. Trump to help oversee AI and cryptocurrency policy, said on social media Monday that DeepSee's app \"shows that the AI race will be very competitive.\"\n\nHowever, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses.\n\n\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"\n\nAre there privacy issues with DeepSeek?\n\nSome experts are raising concerns about the personal data that DeepSeek is collecting, given that the company stores data from users \u2014 including their date of birth, keystrokes, text or audio inputs, uploaded files, chat history and other data \u2014 on servers located in China, according to its privacy policy.\n\nThat echoes some of the issues raised with TikTok, another company with Chinese ownership that sparked worries about the supposed risks its ties to China posed to national security. Last year, Congress passed a law banning TikTok in the U.S. as long as it is under Chinese ownership, although that is now in flux after President Trump signed an executive order directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days.\n\nWhat does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?\n\nWall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.\n\n\"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said.\n\nIt's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Department not to enforce a looming ban.\n\nSome Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector.\n\n\"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report.\n\nAnalysts at Bernstein Research also noted that while DeepSeek's technology looks promising, it likely isn't revolutionary, suggesting that Monday's investment rout is overblown.\n\nWhat is Nvidia saying about DeepSeek?\n\nIn a statement to CBS News, Nvidia offered praise for DeepSeek.\n\n\"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of test-time scaling,\" the company said in an email. \"DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export-control compliant.\"\n\nBut, Nvidia added, AI inference, or using AI models to make decisions or predictions, \"requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\"",

            "content": "News from China's DeepSeek just deep-sixed a lot of semiconductor manufacturing equipment stocks.\n\nOver the weekend, Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up DeepSeek announced that, since December, it has been operating a new open-source, free-to-use large language model (LLM), and the news is shaking up the AI ecosystem.\n\nAccording to news reports, DeepSeek's new LLM cost only $6 million to develop and was put together in just two months' time. The cut-rate LLM, however, is reported to perform basically as well as OpenAI's ChatGPT, raising questions about just how much of a lead Western tech companies really have over China -- and whether demand for advanced, high-speed semiconductor chips for AI will really be as big as everyone has been saying it will.\n\nWorries that chips demand may not in fact grow as expected frightened investors in the companies that build equipment for manufacturing these chips. As of 11:55 a.m. ET, shares of semiconductor manufacturing equipment company Lam Research (LRCX 4.40%) are down 5.6%, KLA (KLAC 2.43%) stock is off 6.3%, and ASML Holding (ASML 1.91%) has slid 6.5%.\n\nChina and the chip manufacturing industry\n\nU.S. sanctions against China aimed at stymieing the development of Chinese AI capabilities that can be used for the Chinese military and initially formulated under the first Trump administration, expanded under the Biden administration, and now expected to continue under the second Trump administration, sparked a flurry of purchases of semiconductor manufacturing equipment imports by China, so that the country could build its own chips and AIs. Between the fast chips it was still able to buy abroad and the chips it's been able to produce at home, these efforts appear to have borne fruit.\n\nSales at all three of these semiconductor equipment manufacturers -- Lam, KLA, and ASML -- slumped in 2024 as a combination of China having already bought much of the equipment it needed, plus sanctions pinching sales of further equipment, weighed on exports to China. The worry today is that China might not need to expand its production capacity much more if it's figured out a way to build LLMs with fewer chips, as well as with cheaper, less advanced chips.\n\nThe other worry is that, if China has figured out how to do this, then Western tech companies may figure it out as well. That could translate into slower sales of semiconductor manufacturing equipment overall, worldwide.\n\nWhat this means for semiconductor manufacturing equipment stocks\n\nBut how much of this risk is priced into these stocks already? And does their sell-off today perhaps create a buying opportunity in shares of Lam Research, KLA, and/or ASML?\n\nPerhaps.\n\nValued on earnings, shares of Lam Research look the cheapest today, valued just a little over 25 times trailing earnings. KLA stock is more expensive at 34 times earnings, while ASML looks most expensive at a P/E ratio of 40. I hesitate to call any of the three stocks a \"bargain,\" however.\n\nAccording to long-term earnings growth estimates prepared by analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence, both Lam and KLA stocks are expected to grow earnings at about 15% annually over the next five years, and ASML is supposed to grow only a little faster than that -- 17%. If you assume that it takes a percentage growth rate roughly equal to P/E to make a stock a \"buy\" (which is to say, if you're a value investor looking for a PEG ratio of 1.0 or less), none of these three stocks currently qualify.\n\nWorse, investors need to realize that the long-term growth rates projected for these stocks are based on assumptions before the DeepSeek news broke. If DeepSeek is as big of a deal as many investors think it is today, with as-big implications for future demand growth in AI chips, actual future growth rates could be even lower than the projections -- and the PEG ratios could end up being even higher.\n\nLong story short, I think it's still too soon to buy. Let's wait and see if this sell-off gets any deeper, and produces some bargains too obvious and too big to ignore, before calling this a buying opportunity. As today's sell-off is demonstrating, there's a lot to be said for demanding a margin of safety before buying.",

(NASDAQ:ASML) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nInvestors have become increasingly concerned about the rising capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, with many wondering whether the expectations embedded in financial markets today project a realistic path ahead. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega-cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025.\n\nThe Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now makes up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and has driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on a 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nAnalysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. Hardware firms were defined as the companies that drive the design and manufacture of the semiconductors that are key to generating computing power. Hyperscalers were picked out as the companies that provide physical AI infrastructure such as cloud services and data centers, create custom silicon chips, and build large language models that can be used by other companies. AI developers were recognized as software companies that leverage hyperscaler technologies to provide solutions for end users.",

            "content": "ASML Struggles Amid Stock Declines And Market Scrutiny Investor focus on upcoming earnings report drives mixed analyst outlook for ASML's future.\n\nASML Holding NV, the leading manufacturer of advanced lithography machines used for semiconductor production, is currently facing significant scrutiny as its stock price has recently taken a hit. After reaching an all-time high last July, the stock has dropped about 33% to around $680 per share. This decline has raised concerns among investors, particularly as the company prepares to release its fourth-quarter earnings report shortly.\n\nThe stakes are high for ASML as analysts eagerly await the upcoming performance update. Many believe it could signal whether the company is poised to recover from its cyclical downturn and capitalize on renewed demand for semiconductor manufacturing. Analysts expect the company to announce earnings of approximately $7.04 per share on revenues of $9.5 billion, reflecting growing anticipation of improved metrics. ASML's innovation, particularly its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology, maintains its relevance and stronghold on the market.\n\nDespite current challenges, including international export restrictions impacting sales to China, ASML remains optimistic. Philippe Laffont, founder of Coatue Management, highlights the company's pivotal role within the semiconductor industry. Although Coatue recently sold its entire stake, ASML continues to be recognized as resilient, primarily due to its existing technology and customer base, which includes industry giants like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung.\n\nRecent commentary from analysts provides mixed perspectives on ASML's future. Analysts from Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed their neutral stance, maintaining a price target of $900 for the stock, which indicates potential upside from current pricing. Others, such as Goldman Sachs strategist Lilia Peytavin, express optimism, stating, \"economic momentum is no longer worsening,\" lending credence to the belief the demand may bolster ASML's recovery.\n\nOn one hand, the commentary highlights potential weaknesses as certain orders from Samsung have reportedly been deferred. Analysts suggest this could impact ASML's financial projections moderately but note the company's strong operating margins and solid return on equity, which lend it the flexibility to navigate temporary setbacks.\n\nMeanwhile, TSMC recently expressed plans to allocate between $38 billion to $42 billion for capital expenditures set to strengthen the semiconductor supply chain, of which 70% will focus on advanced process technologies. These developments appear promising for ASML as the company is expected to play a significant role in this technological upgrade.\n\nASML's recent performance, which saw its stock lag behind broader tech benchmarks, may be worrying, but many hold out hope for its future. Analysts assert ASML's position is pivotal due to the inherent value of its proprietary technologies required for next-generation chip manufacturing. For the semiconductor sector, the pressure to innovate remains relentless, and ASML\u2019s technology has proven difficult to replicate. Essential advancements like EUV lithography, for which ASML remains the sole supplier, establish this company as almost irreplaceable within the industry, with its machines expected to become ever more pivotal as consumer demand rises globally.\n\nLooking forward, ASML\u2019s potential to rebound relies not just on immediate earnings results, but also broader market factors driving semiconductor consumption. The expected consumer electronics replacement cycles and the gradual easing of interest rates could prompt improved dynamics within the sector.\n\nAnalysts have set mixed expectations for ASML's performance; some predict recovery potential, citing the company's capacity to leverage improvements from its key clients, whilst others urge caution due to existing competitive pressures. Investment watchers remain vigilant, as firm valuations and anticipated earnings could lead to substantial share price movements.\n\nOverall, the outlook for ASML remains guarded yet optimistic. With solid support from major clients and significant potential for revenue growth within the semiconductor market, ASML stands ready to emerge from its current challenges stronger than before. The financial community will be paying attention to the upcoming earnings report, providing hints on whether ASML can regain its footing and how rapidly it can adapt to shifting market demands.",

The company was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between Advanced Semiconductor Materials International and Phillips in order to develop lithography systems for the semiconductor industry. The company\u2019s vision and mission is helping chipmakers advance global technology for the better of mankind, the company\u2019s IPO was in 1995.\n\nThese systems are used to embed layer upon layer of information onto microchips using a variety of methodologies. The three main segments of ASML Holdings operations are lithography, metrology, and inspection-related systems for the memory and logic semiconductor industry. The company\u2019s claim to fame is its ability to empower chipmakers to mass produce patterns in silicon. Two of the key areas of advancement are the resolution of projection the company is able to achieve and the size (very small) of the chips its products can make.\n\nASML Holding was formerly known as ASML Lithography Holding N.V. but changed its name in 2001. The company is headquartered in Veldhoven, the Netherlands and has operations in Europe, North America, Japan, China, and Taiwan among others. ASML Holdings employs more than 32,000 people including 122 nationalities working in more than 60 locations globally but the road to succes was not without difficulty. ASML Holdings nearly went out of business in the late \u201880s but an investment from Phillips board member Henk Bodt and the development of the PAS 5500 lithography system sealed the company\u2019s fate. The PAS 5500s turned out to be such an advancement in microchip lithography there are many still in use today.\n\nASML is the only company currently offering Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography systems to the chipmaking industry and the technology is widely used. The lithography systems project and imprint a pattern onto the chip and then repeat the pattern over and over again building layers of patterns that drive its functionality. Because ASML Holdings technology is so widely used, it is highly likely the device you are using to read this company profile is powered by chips made with ASML devices.\n\nThe company not only provides extreme ultraviolet lithography systems but it also manufactures deep ultraviolet lithography systems comprising immersion technology and dry lithography solutions to manufacture various ranges of semiconductor nodes and technologies. This is important because each layer of semiconductor patterns may require a different methodology to imprint.\n\nIn addition to lithography technology, ASML Holding also offers metrology and inspection systems to gauge and maintain the quality of production. ASML metrology tools include YieldStar optical metrology solutions which measure the quality of patterns embedded on the semiconductor wafers. ASML also offers HMI e-beam solutions that can locate and analyze production defects on individual chips.\n\nAnother of the cutting-edge services provided by the company is computational lithography and the software solutions to go along with it. Computational lithography is a science of advancing semiconductor technology and the processes behind semiconductor manufacturing and is in high demand on a global scale. Along with this, ASML has a suite of products and services for maintaining and rebuilding used semiconductor lithography equipment.",

We have so many semis in the Charitable Trust but that stock is the cheapest I\u2019ve seen it in a long time,\u201d he said this week on Mad Money.\n\nLam Research is scheduled to report its second-quarter financial results on January 20th.\n\nThe consensus is for it to earn 87 cents a share (up 16% year-on-year) on $4.31 billion in revenue (up 14.6% year-on-year).\n\nThe Nasdaq-listed firm stands to benefit from increased spending on dynamic random access memory amidst continued focus on AI applications. A 1.15% dividend yield makes LRCX all the more attractive to own in 2025.\n\nPlus, Lam Research stock is trading at a deep discount considering its forward price-to-earnings multiple of 22 times versus the industry\u2019s 35.\n\nWall Street currently sees an upside in the semiconductor company to $92 on average indicating potential for a more than 15% gain from current levels.",

Igniting a sharp selloff that left its stock down nearly 30% from its July peak, the Dutch company slashed its revenue forecast for 2025. ASML's position has become ever more precarious as significant sector challenges and uncertainty remain over the tightening of the export controls to China.\n\nASML Stock Tumbles as Clients Cut Back on Spending and Investment\n\nThe key customer for ASML's cutting-edge lithography tools Intel Corp (INTC, Financial) is in the midst of leadership transitions, as is Samsung Electronics Co (SSNLF, Financial), which is fighting production setbacks, notably high bandwidth memory critical to Nvidia Corp (NVDA, Financial). Compounding that, SK Hynix Inc. limited investment growth for the year has alarmed about potential equipment spending cutbacks. That dragged ASML's stock further and reflects the chip equipment sector more broadly struggling.\n\nASML is expected to make $33.8 billion in sales this year, well below the middle of the company's own guidance. That puts confidence in ASML's long-term growth shakier than usual, with its clients facing uncertain spending plans for the future. The markets to watch for investors will be for stabilization here and in the chipmaking landscape more broadly.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

Despite its leading position in semiconductor processing equipment, ASML faces challenges such as uncertain spending plans from key clients, weakened global demand, and geopolitical risks. The company is set to release its fourth-quarter and full-year financial results for 2024 soon.\n\nWall Street analysts estimate ASML\u2019s total revenue for the 2024 fiscal year to be around 32.2 billion euros (33.8 billion USD), slightly below the company's previous guidance midpoint. ASML had revised its 2025 revenue outlook downward last year, causing its stock to drop approximately 30% from its peak in July of the prior year.\n\nKey clients like Intel (INTC) and Samsung face difficulties, further heightening ASML\u2019s forecast uncertainties. Intel is in a transitional phase seeking a new CEO, affecting its expenditure plans for ASML's equipment. Samsung Electronics struggles with production challenges, particularly in high-bandwidth memory, lagging behind rivals.\n\nMoreover, ASML is affected by a slowdown in demand from China, previously contributing nearly half of its revenue, now estimated to drop to 20% by 2025. The company also contends with pressure from potential U.S. export restrictions to China, raising geopolitical risks.\n\nDespite these challenges, ASML could gain support from TSMC's (TSM) capital expenditure plans, including 2nm chip production, which might offset weaker demand from Intel and Samsung.",

The company was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between Advanced Semiconductor Materials International and Phillips in order to develop lithography systems for the semiconductor industry. The company\u2019s vision and mission is helping chipmakers advance global technology for the better of mankind, the company\u2019s IPO was in 1995.\n\nThese systems are used to embed layer upon layer of information onto microchips using a variety of methodologies. The three main segments of ASML Holdings operations are lithography, metrology, and inspection-related systems for the memory and logic semiconductor industry. The company\u2019s claim to fame is its ability to empower chipmakers to mass produce patterns in silicon. Two of the key areas of advancement are the resolution of projection the company is able to achieve and the size (very small) of the chips its products can make.\n\nASML Holding was formerly known as ASML Lithography Holding N.V. but changed its name in 2001. The company is headquartered in Veldhoven, the Netherlands and has operations in Europe, North America, Japan, China, and Taiwan among others. ASML Holdings employs more than 32,000 people including 122 nationalities working in more than 60 locations globally but the road to succes was not without difficulty. ASML Holdings nearly went out of business in the late \u201880s but an investment from Phillips board member Henk Bodt and the development of the PAS 5500 lithography system sealed the company\u2019s fate. The PAS 5500s turned out to be such an advancement in microchip lithography there are many still in use today.\n\nASML is the only company currently offering Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography systems to the chipmaking industry and the technology is widely used. The lithography systems project and imprint a pattern onto the chip and then repeat the pattern over and over again building layers of patterns that drive its functionality. Because ASML Holdings technology is so widely used, it is highly likely the device you are using to read this company profile is powered by chips made with ASML devices.\n\nThe company not only provides extreme ultraviolet lithography systems but it also manufactures deep ultraviolet lithography systems comprising immersion technology and dry lithography solutions to manufacture various ranges of semiconductor nodes and technologies. This is important because each layer of semiconductor patterns may require a different methodology to imprint.\n\nIn addition to lithography technology, ASML Holding also offers metrology and inspection systems to gauge and maintain the quality of production. ASML metrology tools include YieldStar optical metrology solutions which measure the quality of patterns embedded on the semiconductor wafers. ASML also offers HMI e-beam solutions that can locate and analyze production defects on individual chips.\n\nAnother of the cutting-edge services provided by the company is computational lithography and the software solutions to go along with it. Computational lithography is a science of advancing semiconductor technology and the processes behind semiconductor manufacturing and is in high demand on a global scale. Along with this, ASML has a suite of products and services for maintaining and rebuilding used semiconductor lithography equipment.",

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about ASML (ASML).\n\nASML currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.52, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 23 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.52 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 23 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy, representing 73.9% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ASML\n\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for ASML\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ASML here>>>\n\n\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying ASML, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",

It is owned by British firm Capreon, which is expected to remain the site's manager after the sale, the city said.The site includes a hundred thousand square metres of buildings and surrounding land in northwest Eindhoven and houses 2,500 workers and students.Eindhoven, a growing tech hub, is planning additional Brainport campuses on adjacent land it owns, in part to house ASML as it grows. The first, BIC-2, is expected to begin construction next year.The national government last year said it planned to invest $2.7 billion to improve infrastructure around Eindhoven to prevent ASML, headquartered in neighbouring Veldhoven, from basing major new operations outside the Netherlands.",

ASML is the only producer of lithography machines in the world needed to produce certain chips that are used in a wide variety of different products.\n\nASML is also limited from selling some of its more advanced lithography machines to China for the same reasons.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) stands against other high growth semiconductor stocks that are profitable heading into 2025.\n\nSemiconductors have led industrial advancements and aided key applications such as personal computing, data centers, and cloud computing. As per PwC, Memory ICs were the fastest-growing semiconductor category over the previous 2 decades, with DRAM and HBM standing out. The broader DRAM market is supported by cost and scale, while HBM, because of its advanced technological requirements, reflects a high-barrier, closed-loop ecosystem.\n\nGlobal Semiconductor Sales Rose 20.7% YoY in November 2024\n\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) announced that global semiconductor sales touched $57.8 billion during November 2024 month, demonstrating 20.7% growth as compared to November 2023 total of $47.9 billion and 1.6% growth as compared to the October 2024 total of $56.9 billion. As per the report published by SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International), the semiconductor industry is expected to begin 18 new fab construction projects in 2025. These new projects will include three 200mm and fifteen 300mm facilities. Notably, the majority will begin operations from 2026 \u2013 2027.\n\nIn 2025, the Americas and Japan will be the leading regions with 4 projects each. Next, China and Europe & Middle East regions have 3 planned construction projects. Finally, Taiwan has 2 planned projects, with Korea and Southeast Asia having 1 project each for this year. As per SEMI\u2019s President and CEO, investments have been fueling leading-edge and mainstream technologies to cater to dynamic global demands. Gen-AI and high-performance computing continue to fuel advancements in the leading-edge logic and memory segments.

As readers may recall, we trimmed the position in 4Q 2023 as we expected stagnating business trends to set in during 2024. Stagnation did occur, as did Al hysteria. We now foresee robust growth and believe ASML will see a significant ramp in business trends in 2025 and beyond. ASML\u2019s business backlog and its customers\u2019 persistent development of leading-edge chip sizes drive our expectation of rapid growth for the company in the coming years. In our view, shares trade at a very reasonable valuation for one of the world\u2019s most competitively advantaged growth companies, particularly considering the accelerated growth we expect.\u201d\n\nOverall, ASML ranks 6th on our list of high growth semiconductor stocks that are profitable heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of ASML as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than ASML but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Two of the key areas of advancement are the resolution of projection the company is able to achieve and the size (very small) of the chips its products can make.\n\nASML Holding was formerly known as ASML Lithography Holding N.V. but changed its name in 2001. The company is headquartered in Veldhoven, the Netherlands and has operations in Europe, North America, Japan, China, and Taiwan among others. ASML Holdings employs more than 32,000 people including 122 nationalities working in more than 60 locations globally but the road to succes was not without difficulty. ASML Holdings nearly went out of business in the late \u201880s but an investment from Phillips board member Henk Bodt and the development of the PAS 5500 lithography system sealed the company\u2019s fate. The PAS 5500s turned out to be such an advancement in microchip lithography there are many still in use today.\n\nASML is the only company currently offering Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography systems to the chipmaking industry and the technology is widely used. The lithography systems project and imprint a pattern onto the chip and then repeat the pattern over and over again building layers of patterns that drive its functionality. Because ASML Holdings technology is so widely used, it is highly likely the device you are using to read this company profile is powered by chips made with ASML devices.\n\nThe company not only provides extreme ultraviolet lithography systems but it also manufactures deep ultraviolet lithography systems comprising immersion technology and dry lithography solutions to manufacture various ranges of semiconductor nodes and technologies. This is important because each layer of semiconductor patterns may require a different methodology to imprint.\n\nIn addition to lithography technology, ASML Holding also offers metrology and inspection systems to gauge and maintain the quality of production. ASML metrology tools include YieldStar optical metrology solutions which measure the quality of patterns embedded on the semiconductor wafers. ASML also offers HMI e-beam solutions that can locate and analyze production defects on individual chips.\n\nAnother of the cutting-edge services provided by the company is computational lithography and the software solutions to go along with it. Computational lithography is a science of advancing semiconductor technology and the processes behind semiconductor manufacturing and is in high demand on a global scale. Along with this, ASML has a suite of products and services for maintaining and rebuilding used semiconductor lithography equipment.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 12 Stocks That Could Split in the Near Future. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML) stands against other stocks that could split in the near future.\n\nStock splits don\u2019t change how much a company is worth, but they make each share cheaper and easier for people to buy, considering it\u2019s a forward split. Stock splits can vary from a simple 2-for-1 split to a larger 100-for-1 split or more. In a 2-for-1 split, each share is turned into two new shares. This makes each share half the price, but the total value of the company remains the same. For example, if a share costs $100, after a 2-for-1 split, you\u2019ll have two shares that cost $50 each. This can make it easier to buy shares and attract more people to invest. Even though the share price goes down, the total amount of money paid out to shareholders stays the same. Hence, splitting shares doesn\u2019t change how much control existing shareholders have in the company. The main goal is to make the company\u2019s stock more appealing to investors. There\u2019s no proof that stock splits make a company better, but they can make investors feel more positive about the company. But with these benefits come the costs and risks. The process requires legal work and can be expensive.\n\nSplitting a stock doesn\u2019t change a good company into a bad one or vice versa. The price might go up a bit after the split, but it won\u2019t change the company\u2019s long-term fundamentals. Sometimes, a low stock price can actually look bad for a big company. Still, many companies practice splitting stocks if their share prices are growing too high.\n\n2025 Outlook\n\nOn January 16, Mark Newton, Fundstrat Global head of technical strategy, joined \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on CNBC to discuss that the long-term market trends look positive. The market initially experienced a cooler-than-expected jump, but concerns were raised about the breadth of the market and the potential impact of interest rates on small-cap stocks. Mark Newton expressed a constructive view but noted that the market\u2019s breadth had deteriorated significantly, with only about 25% of stocks currently above their 50-day moving average. This decline was particularly evident in sectors like healthcare, where seven sectors lost more than 4% in the last month.\n\nDespite these challenges, Newton highlighted that technology stocks had rebounded, helping to keep indices afloat and maintaining long-term trends. However, he noted that near-term sentiment had become pessimistic regarding the potential policies of the president-elect, which added to market uncertainty. He maintained his target for the S&P 500 at 6650, suggesting that interest rates might begin to roll over in the coming months, which could be bullish for equities given their recent correlation with treasury yields.",

It offers systems for lithography, metrology and inspection.\n\nIt is set to report its Q4 2024 earnings on January 29. Wall Street analysts expect the company to post an EPS of $6.71, up from $5.61 in the year-ago period. According to Benzinga Pro, quarterly revenue is expected to reach $9.02 billion, up from $7.79 billion in the previous year.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIf You Bought ASML Stock 10 Years Ago\n\nThe company's stock traded at approximately $101.96 per share 10 years ago. If you had invested $10,000, you could have bought roughly 98 shares. Currently, shares trade at $736.29, meaning your investment's value could have grown to $72,214 from stock price appreciation alone. However, ASML also paid dividends during these 10 years.\n\nASML's dividend yield is currently 0.92%. Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $35.41 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $3,473 from dividends alone.\n\nSumming up $72,214 and $3,473, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $75,687. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $10,000 in ASML stock 10 years ago. This means a total return of 656.87%.

The price target implies a nearly 20% potential upside from the current stock price.\n\nOn Oct. 15, the company announced its Q3 2024 earnings, revealing a significant revision to its 2025 net sales guidance. Now projected between 30 billion euros and 35 billion euros ($32.7 billion to $38.2 billion) \u2013 a reduction from the previously stated range of 30 billion euros to 40 billion euros, as reported by Benzinga.\n\nThis outlook downgrade was driven by a slower-than-expected recovery in key market segments despite strong growth from artificial intelligence investments.",

Mohanram turned that research on its head by developing a growth model that produced significant market outperformance. His research paper \"Separating Winners from Losers among Low Book-to-Market Stocks using Financial Statement Analysis\" looked at the criteria that can be used to separate growth stocks that continue their upward trajectory from those that don't.

            "content": "Sun 19 Jan 2025 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nSemi-conductors have become an essential pillar of the global economy and technological security. In this context, China has announced an unprecedented investment of 37 billion euros to accelerate its technological autonomy, which has so far been hindered by the dominance of Europe and the United States. This strategic sector, embodied by players like ASML, the world leader in photolithography equipment, is now at the heart of fierce competition. Beijing is not only looking to catch up but also to redefine the balance of power with a view to achieving complete independence. This initiative could reshape the contours of global innovation and intensify tensions in an already high-pressure market.\n\nAn unprecedented technological offensive\n\nChina has unveiled an ambitious plan to counter growing technological and economic pressures exerted by the United States and Europe. This project is based on a colossal investment of 37 billion euros, aimed at developing domestic lithography machines, a technology essential for advanced semiconductor production. Today, this field remains largely dominated by ASML, a Dutch equipment manufacturer that holds almost a monopoly on cutting-edge photolithography. Furthermore, with this program, Beijing aims to reduce its dependence on foreign suppliers in order to bypass restrictions imposed by Washington.\n\nThis strategic movement fits into a broader industrial vision, accelerated by achievements such as the launch of the Huawei Mate 60 Pro. Indeed, this smartphone, equipped with locally made chips, illustrates China\u2019s ability to overcome technological barriers despite strict international sanctions. This example has strengthened the idea that Beijing can withstand external pressure but also innovate under unfavorable conditions. For many experts, this initiative marks a decisive turning point. It reflects China\u2019s firm will to achieve technological self-sufficiency in sectors deemed vital for its economic and strategic development.\n\nTowards a geopolitical redefinition of the semiconductor market\n\nChina\u2019s technological ambitions are part of a dynamic that goes beyond the simple industrial challenge. This growing rivalry between Beijing and Western powers over semiconductors reflects major geopolitical stakes. Thus, controlling this key technology, essential for both civilian and military domains, amounts to ensuring decisive influence over global innovation and strategic supply chains. This quest for mastery of semiconductors has become a central pillar of national security policies worldwide.\n\nFor their part, European leaders like ASML continue to play a dominant role. The Dutch company constantly innovates, through the development of next-generation EUV machines capable of producing chips smaller than 2 nanometers. These technological advances reinforce Europe\u2019s position as an industry leader, but they also heighten the challenges that China must face to catch up on this technological gap. However, Beijing is not content with merely closing the gaps. With massive funding, it seeks to transform these challenges into a springboard to enhance its autonomy and redefine the power balances in this strategic industry.\n\nThis evolution raises critical questions for the future of the semiconductor industry. Will China succeed in questioning the technological dominance of Western powers? Or will this new momentum amplify the fragmentation of global supply chains, already under pressure from growing geopolitical tensions? What is clear is that this massive investment heralds an era of intense rivalries where innovation becomes both a strategic and economic tool. In this race, the outcome could reshape the contours of the global economy and redefine geopolitical balances in the long term.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

            "content": "The BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock ). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks . In this article, we are going to take a look at where ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

(NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 64\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) makes and sells advanced semiconductor equipment systems. Wall Street is closely monitoring the financial progress of the company. As per the report of the third quarter of 2024, total net sales were \u20ac7.5 billion, gross margin was 50.8%, net income was \u20ac2.1 billion, and quarterly net bookings were \u20ac2.6 billion, of which \u20ac1.4 billion of EUV. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for artificial intelligence technologies. With an expected average sales growth rate of 8%-14% over the next five years, ASML is set to benefit from the increasing adoption of AI in various industries. Moreover, ASML\u2019s leading position in EUV lithography technology gives a significant competitive advantage. The company's ability to innovate and maintain its technological lead is crucial for its customers, who rely on ASML's products to manufacture advanced microchips. These developments are expected to help fuel global semiconductor sales to over $1 trillion by 2030, which translates into an annual semiconductor market growth rate of approximately 9% in the period 2025-2030.\n\nOverall ASML ranks 17th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of ASML as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The Dutch government is deciding on the export of ASML machines to China at a time when tensions are rising over chips. Starting in 2025, most of ASML\u2019s sales to China will no longer be included in export data for dual-use goods.\n\nExports of dual-use goods outside the EU are often subject to licensing requirements. This is because the goods can be used for military purposes, giving the government additional visibility into trade with foreign countries.\n\nASML previously faced restrictive measures on trade with China but still managed to generate more than 7 billion euros in sales from the country in 2024. However, it does not specify by region what equipment is sold.\n\nImpact on transparency\n\nThe new regulation impacts the transparency of trade in advanced chip machines. The change makes it more difficult to understand the volume of ASML equipment exports to China, which could lead to discussions about the balance between national security and economic interests. Earlier this week, the foreign trade minister decided to tighten export restrictions.",

            "content": "ASML Holding NV (ASML) isn\u2019t a company; it\u2019s the linchpin in the supply chain that global semiconductors need. Due to the uniqueness of supplying extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, lithography systems, the company enjoys a monopolistic position in its market. Advanced semiconductor chips manufactured on those machines are needed for everything from AI applications to 5G and high-performance computing.\n\nASML projects revenues between \u20ac30 and \u20ac35 billion for its 2025 lot. Saying the longer-term opportunity exceeds \u20ac60 billion through 2030, ASML seems unstoppable in about every metric available. It is true that success brings risks, and it would raise the possibility of potential or eventual disruption to ASML\u2019s dominance because of hostility between blocs or by large economies such as China rising in self-sufficiency.\n\nASML has emerged successfully due to its unparalleled technological edge. EUV lithography is the jewel of its portfolio and will play an important role in making next-generation chips with smaller geometries and big processing power. Given this increasing demand for the systems in AI, cloud computing, and telecommunications, ASML is strategically positioned to lead the globe in technological innovation. Finally, adding services and managing upgrades to ASML\u2019s currently installed bases formed a core part of its growth, with IBM. Further expansion of this install base promises income security at present or in the even cyclic semiconductor industry by continuing revenue streams until FY30 on higher revenues. At the same point, IBM thus contributes to about one-third in recurring advanced costs, underlines the capability for monetizing more effectively an increase in the scale with customers.\n\nWith such monopolistic power, however, ASML became a target for its rivals, particularly the People\u2019s Republic of China. The company presently receives a substantial portion of its revenues from China, but the export restrictions made things more complex. The US has placed tight controls on the export of high-tech equipment, including ASML\u2019s EUV systems, and that forces China to invest aggressively in developing its semiconductor capabilities. It reportedly spends an astonishing $50 billion a year developing chips.\n\nAccording to the finance expert, Sami Andreani while this push for self-reliance could eventually reduce China\u2019s dependency on ASML, its technological capabilities remain far behind. Furthermore, the potential 30% decline in China sales for FY25, while significant, is expected to be offset by robust demand in other regions. The U.S. and Europe, driven by increased semiconductor production capacity and government-backed initiatives to strengthen domestic chip manufacturing, are poised to fill the gap. This regional diversification ensures ASML\u2019s continued growth and shields it from over-reliance on a single market, mitigating the risks posed by China\u2019s evolving strategy.\n\nNotwithstanding all these challenges, ASML is well-positioned to realize further growth and protect the leadership in its market segment. Aggressive investment in research and development by the company is projected to reach \u20ac6-6.6 billion annually by 2030, underlining its commitment to staying ahead of the curve. Its leading position in the US and European markets shields it from some of the risks related to China\u2019s ambitions.\n\nValuation metrics also underpin the strength of ASML: with a forecast FY25 EPS of \u20ac22.20 and a forward P/E of 39 (5-year average), the intrinsic value for the company is more than \u20ac865, representing substantial upside for long-term investors. Notwithstanding geopolitical risks, ASML has monopolistic power and technological advantages that place it at the heart of the semiconductor industry, making it impossible for any investor to resist the company.",

Although the attack took place as early as Saturday, Jan. 11, the effects will be felt for a long time by the university with significant ties to ASML.\n\nAll exams have been postponed to Jan. 27. Originally, they were supposed to take place this coming Monday (Jan. 20). Last Sunday, parking systems, cash registers and internal telephones, among others, stopped working because the network was taken offline by TU/e\u2019s IT department.\n\nForced offline\n\nFor now, TU/e can only share results from the preliminary phase of the internal investigation into the cyberattack. In it, the university found no evidence of a successful attempt to install ransomware, encrypt documents or steal data. \u201cFrom the investigation, the picture emerges that the hackers were caught red-handed last weekend, and that worse was prevented by the resolute intervention of our IT experts,\u201d adds Vice President of the Board of Trustees Patrick Groothuis.\n\nThe incident was first discovered at 9 p.m. on Saturday evening. Despite the fact that the hackers were said to have been caught immediately, TU/e is adding an extra 24/7 monitoring layer to its own IT systems. This should prevent another such hack, although that can never be guaranteed. Incidentally, the university was initially somewhat uncertain about the IT outage in its initial communications; it only went so far as to report that the incident had \u201call the hallmarks of a cyber attack.\u201d For now, no lasting damage seems to have occurred. Still, the investigation is ongoing.\n\nUnfortunate consequences\n\nGroothuis initially announced in the press release on Sunday, \u201cWe realize that turning off the network has unfortunate consequences, for all our students, staff, but also for others on campus.\u201d The \u201cnecessary\u201d intervention was done to prevent a worse scenario, Groothuis explained. The first move was to cancel all teaching activities for Monday, which rolled over into Tuesday and then the entire week.\n\nThe cyber attack on TU Eindhoven is not unique. There have been more incidents in the past, including an incident in 2022 in which TU Eindhoven students and employees were affected by a data breach. It underlines the importance of robust IT infrastructure and good preparation for possible cyber attacks in the education sector.\n\nOn top of that, TU Eindhoven is a relatively straightforward target. It works closely with chip company ASML, multiple chip industry parties and other advanced technology players, which means a country like China or Russia may have an interest in the internal data. Ultimately, the identity may yet be uncovered by TU/e, and we hope they\u2019ll share the details if they do find the perpetrators.\n\nRead more: ASML and TU Eindhoven give cooperation a \u201cmajor\u201d 10-year boost",

            "content": "Shares of ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) were up by 5% as of noon ET Thursday, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nASML is the leading provider of lithography solutions to the semiconductor industry, and its upward momentum appeared to be a reaction to the promising guidance provided by its largest customer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), which reported fourth-quarter earnings Thursday morning.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nASML's success is tied to TSMC\n\nControlling most of the market for deep-ultraviolet (DUV) lithography equipment and holding a virtual monopoly in the bleeding-edge technology of extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, ASML is essential to TSMC's chipmaking operations. Likewise, as the world's largest semiconductor foundry, TSMC's immense significance to its industry makes it ASML's most valuable customer.\n\nAs such, as one company goes, so goes the other (usually).\n\nSo, when TSMC reported earnings that surpassed analysts' expectations, it was an encouraging sign for ASML as well. However, the really noteworthy nugget for ASML investors came in TSMC'searnings call when the company projected that its capital expenditures would rise from $30 billion in 2024 to around $40 billion in 2025.\n\nThese capital expenditures include new equipment purchases that will keep TSMC's production capabilities best in class. The planned boost in capex signals ample opportunities ahead, whether they be in the form of 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), or high-performance computing, which the company identified as clear megatrends.\n\nThough ASML won't receive all of TSMC's capex spending, it will get a decent chunk of it. More importantly, however, TSMC's bullish outlook reaffirms that ASML's state-of-the-art EUV equipment should only become more critical to the chipmaker over the coming years.\n\nWith TSMC projecting sales of AI accelerators (which are used to power machine learning and deep learning systems) to double in 2025 -- after tripling in 2024 -- ASML could be poised to rebound after an up-and-down year.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nConsumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025 revolved around AI. If not, it\u2019s all that exhibitors could show. Talking about the highlight of the show, it was undoubtedly the keynote from Jensen Huang. The keynote included new products to advance gaming, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and agentic AI. Huang kicked off his talk by reflecting on the company\u2019s 3-decade journey. Later on, he highlighted several significant advancements.\n\nTakeaways From CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s Keynote at CES 2025\n\nAs per Huang, AI has been advancing at an \u2018incredible pace.\u2019 It started with perception AI, meaning understanding images, words, and sounds. Then it came to generative AI, meaning creating text, images, and sound. And now, it\u2019s the era of physical AI, meaning AI that can proceed, reason, plan, and act. The AI giant introduced GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, which are powered by Blackwell architecture. These GPUs provide significant improvements in AI-driven rendering, enhancing gaming and creative workflows. Furthermore, Huang unveiled \u201cCosmos,\u201d which is a suite of foundational AI models capable of generating photorealistic video. The models have been designed in such a way that train robots and automated systems more efficiently, further advancing robotics and autonomous technologies.\n\nThe company and its partners have rolled out AI Blueprints for agentic AI, which includes PDF-to-podcast for efficient research and video search and summarization for assessing significant quantities of video and images \u2014 allowing developers to build, test, and run AI agents anywhere.\n\nAgentic AI- Road Ahead in 2025\n\nTechInformed interviewed experts from leading technology companies to explore predictions about Agentic AI. As per Steven Webb, UK chief technology and innovation officer, Capgemini, 2025 will see wider adoption of small language models (SLMs) and AI agents as an era of Agentic AI is fast approaching. Using multiple SLMs throughout a toolchain is expected to play a critical role in the AI evolution. This will include going beyond the already familiar LLMs such as GPT.\n\nFurthermore, Alan Jacobson (chief data and analytics officer at Alteryx) believes that 2025 will see the rise of Gen AI agents used to solve problems. This is an approach that is made possible by reducing costs and improving the performance and speed of LLMs. Frameworks for orchestrating Agentic AI work are expected to emerge. Notably, a large percentage of use cases are expected to start to employ this approach.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 20 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we conducted extensive research and sifted through numerous online rankings. After getting an initial list of 25-30 stocks, we chose the ones that were popular among hedge funds and that analysts saw upside to. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of 14th January. We also mentioned hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 64\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 30.4%\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) provides lithography technology that enables the production of high-performance CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, and AI accelerators. The company remains well-positioned to capitalize on the burgeoning demand for AI chips that need the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)\u2019s EUV lithography systems are critical for producing high-performance chips powering AI applications, from data centers to edge devices. With AI spreading across industries, the demand for such sophisticated chips can grow substantially, leading to increased orders for the company\u2019s advanced lithography tools.\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)\u2019s technology remains critical for manufacturing High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), which is a critical component in AI accelerators and high-performance computing systems. Amidst the current optimism about HBM demand, the company is expected to see a steady stream of business. Furthermore, with AI capabilities spanning across consumer devices like smartphones and PCs, there appears to be strong potential for improved demand for ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)\u2019s equipment from several chip manufacturers.\n\nSandeep Deshpande, an analyst at JPMorgan, gave an \u201cOutperform\u201d rating on the shares of the company, with a price objective of $1,148. Polen Capital, an investment management company, released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cDuring the period, we added to our ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) position in the face of recent volatility across the semiconductor sector broadly. As readers may recall, we trimmed the position in 4Q 2023 as we expected stagnating business trends to set in during 2024. Stagnation did occur, as did Al hysteria. We now foresee robust growth and believe ASML will see a significant ramp in business trends in 2025 and beyond. ASML\u2019s business backlog and its customers\u2019 persistent development of leading-edge chip sizes drive our expectation of rapid growth for the company in the coming years. In our view, shares trade at a very reasonable valuation for one of the world\u2019s most competitively advantaged growth companies, particularly considering the accelerated growth we expect.\u201d\n\nOverall ASML ranks 13th on our list of the best AI stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of ASML as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than AI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "The semiconductor industry is a great sector to invest in because numerous secular trends are driving demand. Those trends include the growing markets of artificial intelligence, electric vehicles (EVs), and renewable energy such as solar. All of these sectors rely on semiconductor products.\n\nAmong the semiconductor companies to invest in, two have seen share price declines over the past year, creating buy opportunities. They are Wolfspeed (WOLF -3.50%) and ASML (ASML 1.91%).\n\nWolfspeed's stock is down more than 80% over the past year. Meanwhile, ASML fell more than 40% from a 52-week high of $1,110 last July to a low of $645 in November, and shares remain well off their high.\n\nBetween these two semiconductor giants, is one a better choice to invest in for the long haul? Yes, and to unpack which one, let's look at both in more detail.\n\nWolfspeed's pros and cons\n\nWolfspeed specializes in silicon carbide (SiC). These products enable smaller, more efficient power components, such as for use in EVs.\n\nDue to the secular trends mentioned above, Wolfspeed management believes SiC demand eventually can increase annual sales from the $807 million generated in its 2024 fiscal year, ended June 30, to $3 billion. While that kind of growth sounds appealing, the reality today is that the company's revenue is in decline.\n\nSales in its 2025 fiscal first quarter, ended this past Sept. 29, were $194.7 million, down from $197.4 million in the prior year. The company expects that decline to extend into its fiscal Q2 with revenue in the range of $160 million to $200 million compared to the previous year's $208.4 million.\n\nWolfspeed operates in a cyclical industry, which is experiencing softness in the industrial and energy sectors. This caused sales to decrease, hurting the company's profitability.\n\nIn the span of one quarter, its gross profit went from $2.4 million in Q4 to a loss of $36.2 million in Q1 as its cost of revenue increased more than 30% year over year. Wolfspeed is responding by cutting costs. It is striving to achieve $200 million in annual cash savings.\n\nThe company also faces other challenges. Its CEO resigned in November, and its balance sheet is saddled with over $3 billion in long-term debt. It exited Q1 with total assets of $7.9 billion versus total liabilities of $7.2 billion.\n\nDespite the challenges, bright spots exist. The company is looking to improve its balance sheet with the help of tax credits. Moreover, in Q1, Wolfspeed's EV business grew year over year by more than twofold, and the company expects EV revenue to continue growing throughout 2025.\n\nA look at ASML\n\nASML makes lithography equipment employed in the construction of semiconductor chips. It is the sole supplier of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, granting the company a monopoly on the tech. EUV lithography is used to produce the most advanced chips, such as those utilized in AI.\n\nGiven its market strength in EUV lithography, why did ASML's stock fall? Like Wolfspeed, ASML is experiencing a cyclical downturn. Macroeconomic conditions are expected to cause its full-year 2024 revenue to come in around 28 billion euros, a slight increase over the prior year's 27.6 billion euros.\n\nMoreover, geopolitical tensions resulted in government restrictions on semiconductor-related sales to China. In its fiscal Q3, ended Sept. 29, ASML's sales to China represented nearly half its income in the quarter. The company expects that percentage to drop to around 20% in 2025.\n\nBut these are short-term headwinds. The drop in China sales seems dramatic, yet it represents the historical norm for the company. In addition, ASML is on strong financial footing. It notched 3.8 billion euros in gross profit in Q3, an improvement from 3.5 billion euros in the prior year.\n\nASML's balance sheet is solid as well. The company exited fiscal Q3 with total assets of 41.8 billion euros compared to total liabilities of 25.6 billion euros.\n\nMaking a decision between Wolfspeed and ASML\n\nBoth Wolfspeed and ASML face headwinds at this time, but over the long run, which is likely to see its business rebound, making it the better semiconductor investment? I believe the answer is ASML.\n\nWolfspeed operates in a highly competitive market, while ASML's only competition is among manufacturers providing older lithography technology, not EUV. In addition, ASML is on strong financial footing, as illustrated by its balance sheet and gross profit growth.\n\nAnother factor to consider is stock valuation. Looking at each stock's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, which indicates how much investors are willing to pay for every dollar of a company's sales, both have seen a drop in recent months.\n\nWolfspeed's P/S ratio is lower between the two companies, suggesting it's a better value. However, ASML deserves a higher valuation because of its stronger financials and its monopoly in EUV lithography equipment. In addition, looking at earnings per share (EPS) shows ASML has steadily grown its EPS over time, while Wolfspeed has gone in the opposite direction.\n\nTaking these factors into consideration, ASML is the better semiconductor stock to invest in for the long term.",

            "content": "The Netherlands has once again tightened export controls to ensure that ASML will have to apply for export licenses with the Dutch government instead of the U.S. These new rules will come into effect on April 1st and is seemingly The Hague\u2019s response to the updated list of sanctioned equipment; Bloomberg reports that this includes specific measurement and inspection equipment made by Dutch semiconductor companies like ASML.\n\nWhile the Dutch authorities didn\u2019t specifically mention Washington, D.C.\u2019s latest export controls during its announcement, sources say that these latest measures closely align with the White House\u2019s policies. This isn\u2019t the first time that The Netherlands has updated its export controls to ensure that it has control of its flagship semiconductor companies \u2014 it did this for ASML\u2019s DUV tools back in September 2024, preventing China from acquiring these machines to produce 7nm and even more advanced chip nodes.\n\nEarlier last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that his country didn\u2019t need ASML for technological progress. However, given that ASML is the only company that makes the most advanced lithography machines that can make the most advanced chips, its CEO said last December that the East Asian country is at least 10 to 15 years behind in chipmaking capabilities. Nevertheless, China isn\u2019t taking this sitting down, and is taking steps to catch up in the global semiconductor race. These steps include poaching staff from these companies so that it could build its own chipmaking tools.\n\nThe U.S. is also expanding its AI chip restrictions. The restrictions would mean that most of the world would be severely limited from acquiring them without getting \u2018validated end-user\u2019 status. This move has got industry giant Nvidia and the Semiconductor Industry Association up in arms; the European Commission is also protesting against this development. However, the White House likely did this because it realized that its sanctions were not being strictly enforced due to the limitations of the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\nDespite all the bans and sanctions that the U.S. and The Netherlands has placed on China last year, it still accounted for about half of its sales in 3Q24, amounting to EU 2.79 billion or about $2.87 billion. But because of the expansion of these export controls, the company expects sales in this region to drop to 20% of total revenue this year. The company expects that it should have no impact on its long-term goals.",

Foreign Trade Minister Reinette Klever announced this tightening, which covers a limited number of advanced technologies and goods.\n\nThe new export control measure, which takes effect April 1, affects only a small number of Dutch companies, including ASML and ASMI. The move follows earlier restrictions introduced for certain chip machines. In September, the Dutch administration decided to harmonize restrictions with the U.S., meaning that the Netherlands will now regulate two mid-range companies in ASML\u2019s portfolio.\n\nThe tightening involves a national licensing requirement for measurement and inspection equipment. The Cabinet will then determine whether a license will be granted per application. The measure applies to exports from the Netherlands to all destinations outside the EU.\n\nSecurity risks and international context\n\nMinister Klever emphasizes that the tightening is necessary because of increasing safety risks in the event of uncontrolled export of this specific equipment. The measurement and inspection equipment and other technology could enable countries to produce advanced semiconductors relevant to military applications.\n\n\u201cThe semiconductor industry is international. The Netherlands plays a unique role in it. It is important that we do not unnecessarily disrupt the chip industry.

Two of these companies are ASML and ASMI. There have been new Dutch restrictions for the exportation of certain chip manufacturing machines from ASML from Veldhoven since September 2023. The new export control measure will come into effect on April 1.\n\n\u201cWe see more safety risks when it comes to uncontrolled exports of this specific equipment,\u201d said Minister Klever about the reasoning for this change. The equipment in question, combined with other technologies, can enable a country to produce advanced semiconductors that are important for military applications.\n\nPast measures were mainly aimed at China. They came after the United States government had put pressure on the Netherlands to do so. They were very concerned about the economic and military power of Beijing. The US implemented plans to restrict the exportation of chips used for artificial intelligence from last Monday.\n\n\u201cThe semiconductor industry is international. The Netherlands plays a unique role in this. It is important that we do not disturb the chip manufacturing industry unnecessarily. This is why we worked as precisely as possible with this export control measure,\u201d Klever said in a statement.\n\nChina has responded to the news by expressing its \"great concern\" to the Netherlands about the new restrictions, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce reported on its website. The Chinese government added that it believes that abuse of export controls threatens the global supply chain for semiconductors.\n\nChina said it hoped that the Netherlands, as a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), would respect market principles and protect the rights and interests of companies from all countries, including Chinese and Dutch companies. It also noted that it hoped that the Netherlands would maintain the stability of the supply chain in the global semiconductor industry.\n\nThe tightening of export rules for high-value equipment is in line with a change in the export policies for chip technology implemented by the United States on December 2.\n\nIn addition to restrictions on the export to China of chips that are important for AI applications, it also concerned software and equipment for making semiconductors.\n\nASML said in December that the American measures have had an effect on sales. They probably contributed to the fact that the turnover in China amounts to about a fifth of the annual turnover of 2025, where China still accounted for almost half of all turnover in the second and third quarters of last year.\n\nA spokeswoman now reported that the Dutch changes will probably not have an additional effect on ASML's sales figures.",

The measures follow the discovery of TSMC-made tech in a cutting-edge artificial intelligence chip developed by sanctioned Chinese tech giant Huawei in October. According to the BIS, the new rules improve reporting for transactions with new customers who could pose a risk of diverting semiconductor components to China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this week, the U.S. published new guidelines aimed at curbing AI chip sales from U.S. firms, including Nvidia (NVDA+6.43% ), to specific countries and companies. The new export controls include three tiers of chip restrictions, which give friendly nations full access to U.S.-made chips but add new limitations to others.\n\nMeanwhile, the Netherlands released new rules aimed at Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML (ASML+1.91% ). Under the new export controls, ASML must apply for licenses with the Dutch government rather than the U.S. government to export certain measuring and inspection tools. The rules will be effective starting on April 1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina-based Huawei and its chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC), depended on ASML\u2019s deep ultraviolet lithography machines to make advanced chips. However, the Dutch government restricted sales of this advanced tech to China last year, which has been unable to build a similar version of ASML\u2019s equipment. China also cannot buy ASML\u2019s extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, machines, which are used to make advanced chips designed by Nvidia and Apple (AAPL-1.75% ).",

Among other items, ASML disclosed that it recorded quarterly bookings of only \u20ac2.63 billion\u2014a 53% decline from \u20ac5.6 billion in the second quarter of 2024. ASML also announced that it expected full year 2025 net sales to be between \u20ac30 billion and \u20ac35 billion, in the lower half of the Company's initial range of between \u20ac30 billion and \u20ac40 billion. President and Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") Christophe Fouquet explained that, \"[w]hile there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in [artificial intelligence], other [semiconductor] market segments are taking longer to recover\" and admitted that \"[i]t now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected.\" ASML also materially reduced its gross margin target to between 51% and 53%, down from its prior guidance of between 54% and 56%.\n\nOn this news, ASML's stock price fell $141.84 per share, or 16.3%, to close at $730.43 per share on October 15, 2024.\n\nThen, on October 16, 2024, on a related earnings call, ASML's Chief Financial Officer Roger Dassen attributed the poor bookings results to \"a reflection of the slow recovery in the traditional [semiconductor] end markets as customers remain cautious in the current environment.\" CEO Fouquet also admitted that the semiconductor industry \"recovery will extend well into 2025,\" leading to \"a reduced growth curve in 2025 and an [] overall reduction of our lithography demand.\" The Company's officers also revealed that ASML's sales in China had declined to \"a more normalized\" level and that the decline in ASML's sales to China would also negatively impact the Company's gross margins.\n\nOn this news, ASML's stock price fell $46.91 per share, or 6.4%, to close at $683.52 per share on October 16, 2024.\n\nPomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

            "content": "The Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), which ASML heavily invests in as a source of future talent, halted classes after a cyberattack forced it to shut down its network. TU/e said the attack was first discovered on January 11, 2025, at around 9 p.m. local time. Its staff shut down the network because of suspicious activity on its servers. The team is still working to resolve the issue and secure the network, so classes have been canceled for Monday and Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe realize that switching off the network has serious consequences, for our students, employees, but also for other parties on campus,\u201d says TU/e Vice President Patrick Groothuis. \u201cThis necessary intervention was done to prevent worse outcomes. We therefore hope for understanding, and we are doing our utmost to resolve this and have all systems accessible as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nFurther complicating this issue is that the university exam period is expected to start next week. Therefore, the so-far two-day class cancelation will likely have a huge impact on the student population, and school administration is already working out considerations on how to go about teaching and student-related issues, like assignment submission and presentations. Nevertheless, the announcement also said that non-network related research and PhD defenses could occur during the network outage and that all labs and facilities are considered functional and safe.\n\nAt the moment, TU/e said that data hasn\u2019t been stolen and that no one has claimed the cyberattack yet. It will release another statement today if classes can resume tomorrow, but employees and students looking for updates could reach out to the school via a WhatsApp helpdesk or visit the student desk at the university.\n\nASML has recently invested over $80 million at TU/e to upgrade its cleanroom and train PhD students. It also uses a few ASML lithography machines for research purposes, which even the wealthiest Chinese companies couldn\u2019t get due to Washington, D.C.\u2019s sanctions against the country. However, it\u2019s unlikely that ASML conducts in-depth work at the university, so its secrets are probably still secure.",

The stalled development of an industrial-grade source with sufficient power output was by far the main reason that EUV lithography wasn\u2019t introduced into production around 2010, as was the original intention, but almost a decade later. \u201cThe source is obviously not a great story, and it probably won\u2019t be for the time being,\u201d former ASML CTO Martin van den Brink let slip in 2011 (see Bits&Chips 11, 2011). At the time, his employees had to slog away another six years or so before ASML\u2019s customers started believing in EUV.\n\nThe first production source delivered about 250 watts of EUV light, enough to process about 125 wafers per hour (the more light hitting a wafer, the faster a single exposure and hence the more wafers per hour). With an availability of around 90 percent, EUV tools were still down for considerably longer than chipmakers were used to, but in 2018, both Samsung and TSMC found productivity to be satisfactory.

Investors who defied the conventional wisdom and doubled down on the mega-cap stocks last year have outperformed the benchmark index by a wide margin.\n\nWe used a stock screener and sorted public companies \u2014 those tagged by the screener as trading in the U.S. \u2014 with a market capitalization above $100 billion by their year-to-date (YTD) gains.\n\nWill lightning strike again this year and take these stocks even higher by the end of 2025? It\u2019s not rational to paint all these companies with the same brush, so let\u2019s dive into the nitty gritty of each mega-cap stock in this list.\n\nWhy ASML Holding (ASML) is Skyrocketing in 2025?\n\nA technician in a clean room working on a semiconductor device, illuminated by the machines.\n\nASML Holding (ASML)\n\nYTD Total Return: 7.27%\n\nIn plain terms, ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) builds the machines that chip manufacturers, like Intel or TSMC, need to \u201cprint\u201d tiny circuitry patterns onto silicon wafers. ASML is also on this list due to a recovery. The stock lost almost 40% of its value in its selloff from July to November and has slowly started to recover since then.\n\nThe company reported its third-quarter 2024 results with net sales of \u20ac7.5 billion and net income of \u20ac2.1 billion. ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) also revised its longer-term outlook for 2025, saying it expects total net sales that year to land between \u20ac30 billion and \u20ac35 billion, with a gross margin between 51% and 53%. That guidance is a bit on the cautious side compared to what some investors had in mind, and the stock price took a notable hit when the news broke, hence the selloff lasted well into November.\n\nHowever, you can see that ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) is still doing quite well overall, even if short-term external factors have nudged them to lower some forecasts. Management remains optimistic about the future thanks to strong demand for advanced chip-making tools like extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and even higher-end \u201cHigh NA\u201d EUV systems. Bookings did decline (to \u20ac2.6 billion from \u20ac5.6 billion the quarter before), which some executives attributed partly to customers delaying orders due to caution about the economic environment. That said, ASML\u2019s sales, profit margins, and cash flows have all trended upward over the years. It\u2019s the only manufacturer of the most advanced lithography machines that today\u2019s (and tomorrow\u2019s) chips need.",

            "content": "By Tina Teng\n\nASML shares had a robust start to 2025, outpacing its US semiconductor peers and signalling a shift by investors towards European stock markets. This development comes amid a broad selloff on Wall Street ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nASML's shares kicked off 2025 with a standout rally, rising over 7% since January trading began. In comparison, Nvidia - a leader in artificial intelligence - saw a modest gain of just 1.21% during the same period. Meanwhile, the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX), which includes major US chipmakers such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc, has been flat year-to-date, with most US semiconductor stocks recording negative performances.\n\nEuropean equities gain momentum\n\nEuropean stock markets have started 2025 strongly, in stark contrast to negative returns in US equities. All major European benchmarks are up year-to-date, with Germany's DAX leading the charge at 1.54%. Conversely, Wall Street's momentum stalled in late December following the Federal Reserve\u2019s hawkish rate cut. Trump's pledge to increase tariffs on global imports has fuelled fears of renewed inflation in the US, leading to a sharp rise in government bond yields. This surge has spooked US markets, with the S&P 500 declining 0.93%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 1.42%, and the Nasdaq Composite slipping 0.77% year-to-date.\n\nWhile the broad-based rally in European markets may have contributed to ASML's outperformance, the Dutch chip equipment maker's near-monopoly status in the semiconductor industry remains a critical factor. ASML produces extreme ultraviolet lithography systems (EUVs), the world's most advanced machines for manufacturing cutting-edge chips. With the ongoing demand for AI chips, analysts have positioned ASML as one of the top picks in the semiconductor sector.\n\nAnalysts project ASML's earnings per share to increase by 26% in 2025, following an estimated decline of 4% in 2024. The company maintains a positive long-term outlook, expecting robust demand for its EUVs over the next five years. ASML forecasts revenues between \u20ac44bn and \u20ac60bn, with gross margins ranging from 56% to 60% by 2030.\n\nTrade tensions and risks\n\nThe outgoing Biden administration is preparing one final round of export restrictions on artificial intelligence (AI) chips targeting China, according to a letter by the US government.\n\n\"It is our understanding that the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is close to publishing a new 'Export Control Framework for AI Diffusion' that would create a global licensing regime for the export of advanced GPUs and the model weights of closed-weight dual use AI models\", the government document states, released on 2 January.\n\nThe new rule is likely to list the number and models of AI chips that can be exported to China, potentially impacting ASML's sales to its largest market.\n\nThe company has cancelled shipments of chip-making machines to China that had been already scheduled previously.\n\n\"A license for the shipment of NXT:2050i and NXT:2100i lithography systems in 2023 has recently been partially revoked by the Dutch government, impacting a small number of customers in China\", the company stated in a press release on 1 January, going on to state: \"In recent discussions with the US government, ASML has obtained further clarification of the scope and impact of the US export control regulations.\"\n\nIn December, the US imposed additional China export restrictions, with ASML being exempted from these measures. The Dutch firm maintained its outlook for 2025, despite a reduction in the outlook of China's contribution to its business to around 20%, down from nearly half.\n\n\"We do not expect any direct material impact on our business\", ASML said in response to the new US rules, maintaining its overall outlook for 2025.",

That's the world's sole manufacturer of advanced lithography machines \u2013 these machines are essential for producing high-end chips used in our beloved smartphones, for example.So, the Eindhoven University of Technology announced that lectures and educational activities are suspended until at least Tuesday. The decision to disable the network was a \"necessary intervention to prevent worse outcomes\", according to Patrick Groothuis, the university\u2019s vice president, in a statement online.As a result, network-dependent systems like email, Wi-Fi, Canvas, and Teams are inaccessible. Despite the shutdown, the campus and buildings remain accessible, and staff and students can enter using card readers, which are still operational.The university reported detecting unusual activity on its servers late Saturday. Investigators are currently assessing the scope and impact of the attack, though the identity of the hackers remains unknown. Ivo Jongsma, a university spokesman, told Bloomberg that officials have not yet determined whether any data was stolen but plan to provide an update.ASML has made substantial investments in the university, including a \u20ac80 million ($82 million) pledge in May to support doctoral programs and improve the school\u2019s facilities, critical for chip research. The university also houses ASML lithography machines in its lab building for research purposes.So, is that just another episode from the US-China chip war ? As you've probably heard (if you're interested in chips, that is), the US pressures the Netherlands to limit China's access to advanced semiconductor technology. Bloomberg reported last Summer that Eindhoven's University of Technology has faced scrutiny over its significant number of Chinese students. The University's President Robert-Jan Smits said US officials have raised concerns, despite the US issuing many visas to Chinese students for its own universities.",

Photolithography is the process in which a light source is used to expose circuit patterns from a photo mask onto a semiconductor wafer. The latest technological advances in this segment allow chipmakers to continually increase the number of transistors on the same area of silicon, with lithography historically representing a high portion of the cost of making cutting-edge chips. ASML outsources the manufacturing of most of its parts, acting like an assembler. ASML's main clients are TSMC, Samsung, and Intel.\n\nASML Holding: A Financial Overview\n\nMarket Capitalization Highlights: Above the industry average, the company's market capitalization signifies a significant scale, indicating strong confidence and market prominence.\n\nRevenue Growth: ASML Holding's revenue growth over a period of 3 months has been noteworthy. As of 30 September, 2024, the company achieved a revenue growth rate of approximately 11.9%. This indicates a substantial increase in the company's top-line earnings. In comparison to its industry peers, the company stands out with a growth rate higher than the average among peers in the Information Technology sector.\n\nNet Margin: ASML Holding's net margin is impressive, surpassing industry averages. With a net margin of 27.81%, the company demonstrates strong profitability and effective cost management.\n\nReturn on Equity (ROE): ASML Holding's ROE surpasses industry standards, highlighting the company's exceptional financial performance. With an impressive 13.46% ROE, the company effectively utilizes shareholder equity capital.\n\nReturn on Assets (ROA): The company's ROA is a standout performer, exceeding industry averages. With an impressive ROA of 5.03%, the company showcases effective utilization of assets.\n\nDebt Management: ASML Holding's debt-to-equity ratio is below the industry average at 0.29, reflecting a lower dependency on debt financing and a more conservative financial approach.\n\nWhat Are Analyst Ratings?\n\nExperts in banking and financial systems, analysts specialize in reporting for specific stocks or defined sectors. Their comprehensive research involves attending company conference calls and meetings, analyzing financial statements, and engaging with insiders to generate what are known as analyst ratings for stocks. Typically, analysts assess and rate each stock once per quarter.\n\nSome analysts also offer predictions for helpful metrics such as earnings, revenue, and growth estimates to provide further guidance as to what to do with certain tickers. It is important to keep in mind that while stock and sector analysts are specialists, they are also human and can only forecast their beliefs to traders.\n\nBreaking: Wall Street's Next Big Mover\n\nBenzinga's #1 analyst just identified a stock poised for explosive growth.

            "content": "The run-up in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks has attracted numerous investors into the sector. Given the anticipated potential for returns and the recent run-up in some AI-related names, determining return potential can become challenging.\n\nAmid that focus, investors may often forget the two stocks most responsible for manufacturing the hardware that makes AI possible: ASML (ASML 1.91%) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) (TSM 3.63%). Both play different but essential roles in the manufacturing process, and while one could not exist without the other in their current forms, only one is more likely to deliver higher returns.\n\nThe state of two businesses\n\nOf the two companies, ASML appears to have the edge on which is the more foundational technology. ASML has had (at least until recently) a monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. This technology makes it possible to manufacture the world's most advanced chips.\n\nIndeed, researchers from Japan have developed technology that makes EUV lithography simpler and more cost-effective. That could bring companies such as Nikon and Canon, which serve the more competitive deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography segments, into ASML's market. However, until alternate products emerge, investors should assume ASML remains dominant.\n\nIt is that dominance that makes TSMC dependent on ASML to provide the equipment that allows it to make the world's most advanced chips. TSMC takes chip designs from Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, and others, producing the chips for such clients.\n\nIndeed, it has competitors such as Samsung and Intel. Also, a heavy concentration of facilities in Taiwan prompted Western governments to try to move more chip production to North America and Europe.\n\nNonetheless, TSMC has established a technical lead in chip production, allowing it to claim 62% of the foundry market, according to TrendForce. That factor alone probably makes it indispensable, despite political pressures.\n\nComparing the financials\n\nThanks to the dominance of a part of the market involved with making semiconductors for AI, both stocks can beat the market over time. Still, the question as to which can more likely outperform the market may lie in the financials.\n\nIn the first three quarters of 2024, ASML reported 19 billion euros ($19.6 billion), a 6% yearly decline. Analysts blame slowing demand in China. That pullback trickled down to the company's net income, which dropped to 4.9 billion euros ($5.0 billion) in the first nine months of the year, down from 5.8 billion euros in the same year-ago period.\n\nIn contrast, TSMC remains in growth mode, with its $63 billion in revenue for the first nine months of the year up 32% yearly.

            "content": "The run-up in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks has attracted numerous investors into the sector. Given the anticipated potential for returns and the recent run-up in some AI-related names, determining return potential can become challenging.\n\nAmid that focus, investors may often forget the two stocks most responsible for manufacturing the hardware that makes AI possible: ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) (NYSE: TSM). Both play different but essential roles in the manufacturing process, and while one could not exist without the other in their current forms, only one is more likely to deliver higher returns.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nThe state of two businesses\n\nOf the two companies, ASML appears to have the edge on which is the more foundational technology. ASML has had (at least until recently) a monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. This technology makes it possible to manufacture the world's most advanced chips.\n\nIndeed, researchers from Japan have developed technology that makes EUV lithography simpler and more cost-effective. That could bring companies such as Nikon and Canon, which serve the more competitive deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography segments, into ASML's market. However, until alternate products emerge, investors should assume ASML remains dominant.\n\nIt is that dominance that makes TSMC dependent on ASML to provide the equipment that allows it to make the world's most advanced chips. TSMC takes chip designs from Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, and others, producing the chips for such clients.\n\nIndeed, it has competitors such as Samsung and Intel. Also, a heavy concentration of facilities in Taiwan prompted Western governments to try to move more chip production to North America and Europe.\n\nNonetheless, TSMC has established a technical lead in chip production, allowing it to claim 62% of the foundry market, according to TrendForce. That factor alone probably makes it indispensable, despite political pressures.\n\nComparing the financials\n\nThanks to the dominance of a part of the market involved with making semiconductors for AI, both stocks can beat the market over time. Still, the question as to which can more likely outperform the market may lie in the financials.\n\nIn the first three quarters of 2024, ASML reported 19 billion euros ($19.6 billion), a 6% yearly decline. Analysts blame slowing demand in China. That pullback trickled down to the company's net income, which dropped to 4.9 billion euros ($5.0 billion) in the first nine months of the year, down from 5.8 billion euros in the same year-ago period.\n\nIn contrast, TSMC remains in growth mode, with its $63 billion in revenue for the first nine months of the year up 32% yearly. Expense growth roughly stayed in line with revenue, so its comprehensive income of $26 billion for the first three quarters of 2024 surged 33% higher over the previous 12 months.\n\nNot surprisingly, the divergent financials meant that TSMC dramatically outperformed ASML over the last year.\n\nDespite those returns, ASML has a higher P/E ratio of 39, compared to 33 for TSMC. Nonetheless, investors should take the valuation history of both stocks into consideration.\n\nASML has had an average P/E ratio of 43 for the last five years, so it is comparatively cheap at the moment. Conversely, TSMC has averaged a 24 earnings multiple over the same timeframe, signaling it could pull back if business conditions worsen.\n\nASML or TSMC?\n\nAdmittedly, the valuation averages make choosing between these AI stocks a more difficult call, but I still think investors are more likely to earn higher returns from TSMC.\n\nIndeed, the fact that TSMC needs ASML more than the other way around should bode well for ASML. Still, with the shrinking revenue, it is likely cheaper for a reason.\n\nIndeed, paying a higher-than-average earnings multiple on TSMC makes it riskier. However, a 33 times earnings multiple is relatively inexpensive for an AI stock. Moreover, the AI boom means TSMC benefits from rapid revenue and earnings growth.

            "content": "Stock splits have been in fashion in recent years in the technology sector as high-flying tech stocks have opted to go down this route in a bid to lower their share prices. Nvidia, Alphabet, Tesla, and Broadcom are some of the prominent names that have executed stock splits in recent years, believing that such a move would make their shares accessible to a wider pool of investors.\n\nTo be clear, a forward stock split (the most common type of split) doesn't alter the fundamentals and prospects of a company. This move simply increases the number of outstanding shares while reducing the price of each share. However, there is a theory that splits can lead to an increase in demand for a company's shares, which will lead to a share price increase.\n\nThis is one reason ASML (ASML 1.91%) may consider a split in 2025. Shares of the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker have underperformed the market over the past couple of years. They have gained just 22% in that span, while the broader PHLX Semiconductor Sector index has recorded tremendous gains of 94% during the same period.\n\nThe company is set to release its fourth-quarter 2024 results on Jan. 29. Will management announce a stock split on that date, and will it be a good idea to buy shares of ASML before that happens?\n\nASML's stock-split history\n\nASML has split its stock four times since going public in 1995. Three of them have been forward splits (the most common type of split). The company's last stock split came in 2007 when it executed an 8-for-9 reverse split to optimize its capital structure. A reverse split is the opposite of a forward split: It increases the share price while reducing the outstanding share count.\n\nASML's stock price has jumped more than 1,900% since its last split was announced on May 31, 2007. Each share now trades at around $764, suggesting that the time may be ripe for another stock split, which is why it won't be surprising to see management make that move when it announces its results later this month.\n\nHowever, with many brokerages now allowing investors to buy fractional shares, it may be a good idea to initiate a long position in ASML irrespective of a split. Let's look at the reasons why.\n\nThe semiconductor giant's long-term prospects are strong\n\nThe stock lost steam in the second half of 2024 following a solid start last year. Worries about restrictions on sales of the company's chipmaking equipment to China, along with a slower-than-expected recovery in semiconductor markets -- other than artificial intelligence (AI) -- that led to weaker-than-expected orders for its equipment in the third quarter of 2024 have weighed on the share price.\n\nMoreover, ASML's 2025 revenue guidance of 30 billion euros to 35 billion euros ($31.1 billion to $36.3 billion) is in the lower half of the 2025 guidance of 30 billion to 40 billion euros that the company issued at its 2022 investor day. But then, investors shouldn't forget that management believes that its long-term growth prospects remain intact thanks to catalysts such as AI.\n\nAt its 2024 investor day, held last November, management reaffirmed its 2030 revenue guidance of 44 billion euros to 60 billion euros, along with a forecast of a gross margin range of 56% to 60%. Assuming ASML manages to hit the midpoint of its 2025 guidance and achieves 32.5 billion euros in revenue this year, the company's top line could have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of almost 10% over the next five years based on the midpoint of its 2030 guidance.\n\nAnd its 2030 gross margin guidance points toward a nice jump from its 2025 guidance range of 51% to 53%, suggesting that the company's bottom line could increase at a healthier pace. Management added that AI is going to play a central role in helping it achieve its long-term targets.\n\nMore specifically, ASML believes that the demand for its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems -- which manufacture advanced chips -- should remain robust between 2025 and 2030, with chipmakers expected to increase their spending on this equipment at a double-digit CAGR during this period. That would come as no surprise considering that its lithography systems are used for manufacturing advanced chips that are deployed for tackling AI workloads.\n\nAccording to an estimate by forecasting firm Research and Markets, the EUV lithography market could generate annual revenue of $22.7 billion in 2029 as compared to an estimated $12.2 billion last year. ASML holds a near-monopoly in this market, suggesting that the incremental revenue opportunity in EUV lithography could help drive robust double-digit revenue growth, which could translate into higher bottom-line increases.\n\nAnalysts predict a significant jump of 26% in earnings per share (EPS) in 2025 following an estimated drop of 4% in 2024.\n\nAs the chart above shows, ASML is forecast to maintain 25% or more earnings growth in 2026 as well. Given that the stock trades at 31 times forward earnings, it may be a good time to buy it right now irrespective of a stock split since that is a small discount to the Nasdaq-100 index's earnings multiple of 32 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks).",

            "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked a rally in numerous tech stocks. Thanks to this cutting-edge technology, stocks such as Nvidia and Palantir have experienced exponential increases in their stock prices.\n\nStill, not all AI stocks have responded in equal measure or simultaneously. Nvidia's stock price began accelerating in 2023 amid its support of a much-improved version of ChatGPT, while most of Palantir's gains occurred in 2024 as more investors became aware of the productivity gains from its new generative AI platform.\n\nThe question now is which AI stocks will spark a similar rally this year. While it is too early to answer that question, these companies hold considerable potential to finally take off in 2025.\n\nLong-term EUV tailwinds make ASML Holding a buy after a disappointing 2024\n\nJustin Pope (ASML Holding): 2024 wasn't pretty for ASML Holding (ASML 1.91%). Not only did the stock grossly underperform, declining by 8% to the S&P 500's 23% gain, but it has crumbled since the summer and at this writing is 32% off its highs. It's a bit puzzling, considering the AI boom sweeping the market.\n\nASML designs and sells advanced machinery that produces tiny patterns on silicon wafers. The equipment is crucial to manufacturing chips, including the AI accelerator chips that Nvidia sells hand over fist. The most advanced chips require extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV), a technology unique to ASML. So, why exactly is the stock struggling?\n\nThe waters have become a bit choppy for ASML. The company noted strong AI momentum during its third-quarter earnings but noted that non-AI business is soft and recovering slowly. In addition, China had been over-ordering ahead of potential pressure by the U.S. on ASML to restrict its shipments to the country. It accounted for almost half of ASML's sales through three quarters of 2024, but management expects that to fall back to 20% (its historical norm) in 2025. ASML disappointed the market with its short-term outlook in Q3, fueling the stock's sell-off.\n\nRemember that the semiconductor industry can be cyclical, and ASML has not backed off its projection that global chip sales will surge to more than $1 trillion by 2030. AI remains a tremendous long-term opportunity that should fuel ASML's growth, even if it's a bit lumpy from year to year. Meanwhile, the stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 31, the lower end of its range since the AI boom began in early 2023.\n\nThis company dominates a mission-critical segment of the chip industry, which is the key to powering AI's growth over the next decade and beyond. The stock offers compelling value, with years of potential growth ahead as AI innovation drives demand for its specialty EUV machines. Yeah, it's time to buy ASML in 2025.\n\nIncreased data center spending is excellent news for Vertiv\n\nJake Lerch (Vertiv Holdings): Vertiv Holdings (VRT 2.72%) builds, sells, and maintains digital infrastructure assets. Most notably, the company offers power management, thermal management, and rack solutions for AI data centers.\n\nIn other words, Vertiv sits at the heart of the AI boom, helping companies build the infrastructure needed to support the latest and greatest AI-powered applications. And that's big business, because tech companies are spending tens of billions to upgrade their AI infrastructure.\n\nMicrosoft, for example, will invest $80 billion over the next 18 months, expanding its data center footprint. Much of that money will be spent on AI chips -- the \"brains\" that power AI data centers. However, Microsoft (and other hyperscalers) will also have to splurge on additional equipment to power, cool, and store those expensive AI chips. And that's fantastic news for Vertiv, which sells a lot of that equipment.\n\nIndeed, Vertiv is already profiting from the AI boom. In its most recent quarter (ended Oct. 31, 2024), Vertiv reported the following highlights:\n\nRevenue grew 19% year over year to $2.1 billion.\n\nOperating profit jumped 48% to $372 million.\n\nOperating margin increased to a record high of 18.5%.\n\nIn addition, the company's CEO, Giordano Albertazzi, provided an upbeat assessment and outlook: \"Vertiv's strong performance in the third quarter was driven by ... [our] unique market position in enabling artificial intelligence and other critical applications for the data center. ... There are clear indications of an acceleration in AI development that is truly encouraging, and which is driving demand across our entire AI-enabling portfolio of power, thermal, IT systems, infrastructure solutions and services.\"\n\nIn short, Vertiv is an under-the-radar stock that will continue to benefit as AI spending ratchets up. Investors looking for an AI stock as 2025 gets underway should keep an eye on Vertiv.\n\nThis chip stock could finally benefit from industry growth in 2025\n\nWill Healy (Advanced Micro Devices): AMD (AMD 4.17%) stock suffered in 2024. Its gaming and embedded segments fell into a slump. Also, despite triple-digit revenue gains for its data center segment (which designs AI accelerators), it technically lags market leader Nvidia in AI chips. That appeared to sour investors on the stock through most of 2024.\n\nHowever, signs of improvement are on the horizon. AMD just announced new graphics and gaming products at CES. Since gaming revenue fell 58% yearly in the first nine months of 2024, these products could help turn the sector around.\n\nMoreover, the data center segment was 48% of company revenue in the first three quarters of 2024, up from 25% in the same period of 2023. Despite not holding a technical lead in this market, Grand View Research forecasts a 29% compound annual growth rate for the segment through 2030. That rate of increase alone should solidify AI accelerators as AMD's new primary revenue source.\n\nEven if the data center segment cannot quite sustain the 107% rate of increase from the first nine months of 2024, the elevated demand for AI accelerators should keep this part of the company growing rapidly. Consequently, analysts forecast 26% revenue growth in 2025 for the company overall, well above the 13% predicted in 2024.\n\nAlso, amid that improvement, its P/E ratio remains in the triple digits, though its forward P/E ratio has fallen to just 24, indicating the stock sells at a discounted valuation. That lower price, along with its accelerating revenue growth, could spark a recovery in AMD stock this year.",

            "content": "With Microsoft recently announcing its intentions to spend $80 billion on building data centers across the globe this year, there appears to be no let-up in spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Meanwhile, as companies advance their AI models, they need exponentially more chips for these models to be trained on. Both Nvidia and Broadcom have talked about customers deploying AI chip clusters of 1 million or more in the near future, which is a huge jump from what recent AI models have been trained on.\n\nLet's look at two semiconductor stocks that should nicely benefit from the continued proliferation of AI chips.\n\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nToday, most chipmakers, such as Nvidia and Broadcom, just design chips while leaving the manufacturing to a third party. Manufacturing semiconductors is a complex task that requires a lot of technological know-how, and there is always a push for manufacturers to shrink chip size in order to increase processing power and reduce power consumption. At the same time, building foundries (chip manufacturing facilities) is a capital-intensive business (in other words, they cost a lot of money to build), and the foundries need to run near full capacity to be profitable.\n\nHow difficult it is to run a third-party foundry business can be seen with Intel, which has poured a ton of money into building foundries only for this segment to be a big money loser. Samsung's foundry business has also greatly struggled, with the unit reporting a big loss last quarter and the company announcing plans to lay off 30% of the unit's workforce and to shut down half its production lines.\n\nHowever, there is one semiconductor contract manufacturer that has emerged as the clear winner in the space: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 3.63%), or TSMC for short. The company has seen revenue and profits booming, spurred by the AI chip boom. Last quarter, it saw its revenue climb 36% to $23.5 billion, while its earnings per ADR soared 50% to $1.94 from $1.29 a year ago.\n\nThe company has been the go-to contract manufacturer for advanced chips, given its scale and technology advantages. As its rivals have struggled, this has also given the company tremendous pricing power, which helped push up its gross margin to 57.8% last quarter from 54.3% a year ago. There have been reports that the company has raised its prices for 2025 as well. Meanwhile, it has also been expanding its capacity by building new foundries.\n\nTSMC is one of the companies best positioned to benefit from the continued chip boom, and its stock is attractively valued, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.5 and a price/earnings-to-growth ( PEG ) ratio of 0.65. A PEG ratio below 1 is generally viewed as undervalued, but growth stocks will often have PEG ratios well above 1.\n\n2. ASML\n\nWhile TSMC manufactures semiconductor chips, ASML Holdings (ASML 1.91%) is the company that makes the equipment that it and other foundries use to manufacture those chips. ASML is the clear-cut leader in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which is the technology used to create these advanced chips. Its EUV machines can cost upwards of $200 million.\n\nMeanwhile, it has recently introduced its next-generation high-NA EUV technology, with these machines costing around a whopping $380 million a piece. Despite its struggles, Intel has been the first company to invest in these next-generation machines, while TSMC received its first machine for trial use toward the end of 2024. However, wider adoption of these machines is likely years away. TSMC has indicated it doesn't currently need high-NA EUV technology to manufacture current-generation high-end chips.\n\nASML executives are reportedly set to meet TSMC execs very soon to discuss TSMC's road map over the next few years. However, according to reports, TSMC may not need these high-NA EUV machines for mass production until at least 2030.\n\nNonetheless, with TSMC still needing to increase production and build more foundries, it will still need more EUV machines. ASML basically has a monopoly in the EUV space and should continue to benefit even if its newest technology does not start to bear fruit for several years down the line.\n\nMeanwhile, Intel is looking to use high-NA EUV technology in production in 2027. It will be interesting to see if TSMC is willing to give Intel such a big head start in using high-NA EUV technology, even with its struggles. Intel still plans to invest $100 billion in adding chip manufacturing capacity in the U.S. over the next several years and has received nearly $8 billion in direct funding from the government, along with a 25% tax credit.\n\nInterestingly, Intel being late to EUV technology in order to maximize profits while TSMC embraced the technology is part of the reason why the two companies are where they are today. That's why there is still a pretty good chance that TSMC will adopt high-NA EUV tech sooner than 2030 unless it wants to risk the script being flipped.\n\nASML has been going through a bit of a transition with the new technology as well as dealing with Chinese companies pushing through orders of older technology on fears of even harsher export bans around semiconductor technology. Nonetheless, as the only maker of EUV and high-NA EUV machines, it should ultimately be a long-term winner. Trading at 24 times forward earnings, the stock is reasonably priced.",

            "content": "ASML, a leader in semiconductor manufacturing technology, is under the radar as investors and analysts speculate about a potential stock split. This Dutch company has seen modest stock growth of 22% over the past few years, lagging behind the broader semiconductor sector, which surged by 94%. With its past four stock splits since going public in 1995, the last being a reverse split in 2007, there\u2019s a buzz around the possibility of ASML announcing another stock split soon.\n\nA potential split wouldn\u2019t change ASML\u2019s business fundamentals but would affect its share distribution, making shares more appealing to a diverse array of investors. Meanwhile, the company remains focused on its growth strategy, leveraging its dominance in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography market. This niche is expected to see substantial expansion, with projected revenues reaching $22.7 billion by 2029, up from $12.2 billion last year.\n\nWith ASML\u2019s major revenue drivers in place, including the growing demand for AI-facilitating chips, the company forecasts a consistent rise. ASML has maintained its 2030 revenue projections of 44 billion to 60 billion euros, while predicting a considerable EPS increase of 26% in 2025. As ASML pivots towards the future with AI and chipmaking advancements, investors have reasons to stay optimistic.\n\nWith current stock prices offering a potential bargain compared to the Nasdaq-100 index, some argue that now might be a strategic time for investment. Whether or not a split is announced, ASML\u2019s growth narrative looks promising, positioning the company for long-term success.\n\nASML\u2019s Strategic Moves: The Future of Semiconductor Innovation\n\nASML, widely recognized as a pivotal player in semiconductor manufacturing technology, has found itself at the center of industry speculation, particularly concerning a potential stock split. Yet, the buzz surrounding a possible split is only part of the narrative for this Dutch powerhouse. Here\u2019s a deeper dive into ASML\u2019s strategies, innovations, and market dynamics that investors should closely monitor.\n\nInnovations and Technology Leadership\n\nASML\u2019s leadership in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography puts it at the forefront of technological innovation, particularly in facilitating advancements in AI chip manufacturing. The company\u2019s strides in EUV technology not only strengthen its market position but also indicate its role in shaping the future of semiconductor design and production. This technology is critical for producing smaller and more efficient chips, catering to the ever-increasing demand for AI applications.\n\nMarket Trends and Growth Prospects\n\nThe semiconductor sector is projected to experience unprecedented growth, partly driven by the surge in demand for AI and machine learning applications. ASML\u2019s positioning in this niche market underscores its potential for driving significant revenue streams. Current forecasts highlight a substantial leap in revenues, with the market for EUV lithography expected to reach $22.7 billion by 2029, marking a notable increase from $12.2 billion just last year.\n\nFinancial Projections and Potential\n\nFinancial analysts maintain a robust outlook on ASML\u2019s growth trajectory. The company\u2019s revenue forecasts for 2030 range between 44 billion to 60 billion euros, with a predicted earnings per share (EPS) boost of 26% by 2025. For investors, these projections indicate strong potential returns, aligning with broader semiconductor market momentum.\n\nSustainability and Future Challenges\n\nIndustry players are increasingly cognizant of sustainability, and ASML is no exception. The company is exploring eco-friendlier production methods and resource-efficient technologies. As environmental regulations tighten globally, ASML\u2019s commitment to sustainability could enhance its appeal to environmentally-conscious investors and customers.\n\nInvestment Insights and Considerations\n\nGiven the current stock prices, parallels have been drawn comparing ASML\u2019s opportunities to those available in the broader Nasdaq-100 index. Some analysts suggest that the stock\u2019s present valuation may offer an attractive entry point for investors focusing on long-term growth. The potential announcement of a stock split, while not altering fundamental business prospects, could enhance share accessibility and attract a wider investor base.\n\nIn summary, ASML\u2019s comprehensive growth strategy, coupled with its technological and market leadership, positions it as a formidable entity in the semiconductor industry. Investors keen on capitalizing on technological advancements and market trends may find ASML\u2019s trajectory appealing for long-term portfolio growth.

            "content": "In the whirlwind world of tech investments, stock splits have become a popular strategy among technology giants eager to make their shares more accessible. Companies like Nvidia, Alphabet, and Tesla have successfully lowered share prices to woo retail investors. Amidst this trend, ASML, a major player in semiconductor equipment, might be contemplating a stock split as a way to enhance its market presence.\n\nA stock split doesn\u2019t inherently change a company\u2019s valuation or future possibilities. Instead, it increases the number of shares available while lowering the price per share, potentially making them more attractive to a broader audience. ASML, which has seen modest returns compared to the remarkable growth of the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index, may explore this tactic to boost its stock appeal.\n\nHistorically, ASML has undertaken stock splits four times since its debut in 1995. The last split, however, was a reverse one back in 2007, aimed at adjusting its financial structure. Despite impressive gains of over 1,900% since then, the company could be ready for another forward split given its current high share price.\n\nThough restrictions on chipmaking equipment sales to China and a sluggish semiconductor market have softened its performance recently, ASML\u2019s prospects remain promising. With expected growth driven by AI demand and cutting-edge EUV lithography systems, the company anticipates significant revenue increases through 2030. Analysts foresee a substantial rebound in earnings per share by 2025, painting a bright future for potential investors.\n\nASML\u2019s Future Moves: Why a Potential Stock Split Sparks Investor Interest\n\nASML, a pivotal force in the semiconductor equipment landscape, is reportedly considering a stock split as part of its strategic arsenal. This move comes at a time when tech giants such as Nvidia, Alphabet, and Tesla have already embraced stock splits to make their shares more appealing to retail investors. As the financial world takes note, here\u2019s what an ASML stock split might entail and why it could be advantageous.\n\nUnderstanding the Implications of a Stock Split\n\nA stock split involves increasing the number of a company\u2019s shares while reducing the price per share, all without altering the company\u2019s inherent market valuation. This method is frequently leveraged to enhance share affordability, attracting a broader range of investors. For ASML, which has experienced understated returns compared to the explosive growth of the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index, this could be an opportune strategy.\n\nASML\u2019s Historical Context with Stock Splits\n\nHistorically, ASML has executed four stock splits since its inception in 1995. The most recent split, a reverse one in 2007, was instrumental in restructuring the company\u2019s finances. However, given ASML\u2019s impressive stock gain of over 1,900% since 2007, another forward split might be on the horizon to augment its current high share price and market accessibility.\n\nApproaching Challenges and Growth Opportunities\n\nDespite facing challenges such as restricted sales of chipmaking equipment to China and a sluggish market, ASML retains a strong growth trajectory. The demand for advanced semiconductor equipment, especially from AI-driven industries and cutting-edge EUV lithography, positions ASML for anticipated revenue boosts through 2030. Analysts project a rebound in ASML\u2019s earnings per share by 2025, highlighting a promising investment opportunity.\n\nStrategic Market Insights and Predictions\n\nWhile a potential stock split could make ASML shares more affordable and liquid, investors should consider the broader market context. The semiconductor industry is on the cusp of evolution, with increased integration of AI technologies and innovations in manufacturing precision that are expected to drive future growth.\n\nSummary\n\nIn conclusion, as ASML contemplates a stock split, investors should weigh the potential benefits of increased share accessibility against industry trends and growth prospects. With a firm foundation in semiconductor advancement and a favorable market outlook, ASML remains a significant contender for investors seeking long-term gains.\n\nFor more information on the company\u2019s developments and strategies, visit the official ASML website.",

(NASDAQ:ASML) between January 24, 2024 and October 15, 2024, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), of the important January 13, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased ASML ordinary shares and/or purchased call options and/or sold put options during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the ASML class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=31159 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than January 13, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW:We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the issuers being faced by suppliers, like ASML, in the semiconductor industry were much more severe than defendants had indicated to investors; (2) the pace of recovery of sales in the semiconductor industry was much slower than defendants had publicly acknowledged; (3) defendants had created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to customer demand and anticipated growth, while also downplaying risk from macroeconomic and industry fluctuations, as well as stronger regulations restricting the export of semiconductor technology, including the products that ASML sells; and (4) as a result, defendants' statements about ASML's business, operations, and prospects lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the ASML class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=31159or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm, on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

(NASDAQ: ASML) between January 24, 2024 and October 15, 2024, both dates inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), of the important January 13, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased ASML ordinary shares and/or purchased call options and/or sold put options during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the ASML class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=31159 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than January 13, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the issuers being faced by suppliers, like ASML, in the semiconductor industry were much more severe than defendants had indicated to investors; (2) the pace of recovery of sales in the semiconductor industry was much slower than defendants had publicly acknowledged; (3) defendants had created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to customer demand and anticipated growth, while also downplaying risk from macroeconomic and industry fluctuations, as well as stronger regulations restricting the export of semiconductor technology, including the products that ASML sells; and (4) as a result, defendants\u2019 statements about ASML\u2019s business, operations, and prospects lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the ASML class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=31159 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm, on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

Two important consumers connected to this expected increase are Samsung (SSNLF) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM).\n\nShould Samsung be able to provide high-bandwidth memory chips to Nvidia (NVDA), Jefferies analysts are of the opinion that Samsung's orders might rise dramatically, directly benefiting ASML's revenue base. As demand for advanced chipmaking equipment drives recovery from recent slowdowns, the forecasted order shows that there's plenty in the tank for ASML.\n\nStill a major supplier to the worldwide chip market, ASML is positioned to profit from the rising investment in innovative technologies ahead.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "Jefferies analysts expect semiconductor equipment company ASML Holding (ASML) to start receiving higher orders in the coming quarters. According to the analysts, the company\u2019s orders should increase to 3.6 billion euros during the fourth quarter of 2024. Following that, the firm expects orders to jump to between 5 billion euros and 6 billion euros in Q1 2025.\n\nJefferies believes these increased orders will come from two major ASML Holding customers: Samsung (SSNLF) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM). The analysts say Samsung may increase its orders if it secures the ability to provide Nvidia (NVDA) with high bandwidth memory chips. If that happens, it would boost ASML Holding\u2019s sales.\n\nAdditionally, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is expected to increase orders. This comes alongside a boom in artificial intelligence (AI), which requires heavy use of processers. TSMC\u2019s position in this market sees it serve customers including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, and Intel (INTC). On that same note, Intel is also expected to increase its orders from ASML Holding.\n\nWhat This Means for ASML Stock\n\nIf the Jefferies analysts are right, ASML Holding is about to see an increase in business in 2025. That would bring with it higher revenue and hopefully boost its profits. This could make the next few earnings reports interesting for shareholders.\n\nFor now, ASML stock isn\u2019t seeing much movement today alongside the Jefferies note with shares down 0.6% as of this writing. This comes after a rough year for the stock after shares suffered an extreme drop in October. This leaves the stock up only 5.03% over the last year.\n\nIs ASML Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, the analysts\u2019 consensus rating for ASML Holdings is Strong Buy based on five Buy and one Hold ratings over the last three months. With that comes an average price target of $886.99, a high of $1,148, and a low forecast of $751.97. This represents a potential 19.92% upside for ASML shares.\n\nSee more ASML analyst ratings\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

As a result, ASML said it expected 2025 net sales to be between \u20ac30bn and \u20ac35bn, down from previous analyst expectations of \u20ac36bn.\n\nSeveral factors were behind the downgrade.

ASML Holding N.V., et al., No. 24-cv-9908.\n\nWhat is the Lawsuit About?\n\nASML is a leading supplier to the semiconductor industry, providing photolithography machines to chipmakers that are used in the semiconductor fabrication process.\n\nThe complaint alleges that ASML repeatedly represented to shareholders that new export controls on semiconductor technology announced by the Dutch government would not have a material effect on ASML\u2019s financial outlook, and that ASML was on a path to recovery in its sales.\n\nOn October 15, 2024, ASML announced earnings significantly lower than expectations. The Company attributed this to a market that was \u201ctaking longer to recover\u201d and admitted that \u201c[i]t now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected.\u201d On this news, the price of the Company\u2019s stock fell 16%, from a closing price of $872.27 per share on October 14, 2024, to $730.43 per share on October 15, 2024.\n\nThen, during the accompanying earnings call with investors on October 16, 2024, the Company attributed the poor earnings results to \u201ca reflection of the slow recovery in the traditional [semiconductor] end markets as customers remain cautious in the current environment.\u201d The Company also disclosed that the decline in ASML\u2019s sales to China would also negatively impact the Company\u2019s gross margins. On this news, the price of the Company\u2019s stock fell 6.4%, from a closing price of $730.43 per share on October 15, 2024, to $683.52 per share on October 16, 2024.\n\nClick here if you suffered losses: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/asml-holding-nv.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\nIf you invested in ASML you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.\n\nAll representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

They\u2019re problem solving.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a community center, it\u2019s a partnership, and it\u2019s an awesome space.\u201d Wakeman Boys & Girls Club\u2019s Sabrina Smeltz\n\nThe Wakeman Boys & Girls Club is no stranger to the area, first opening its doors in Southport in 1913.\n\nThe organization opened its first location in Bridgeport about 15 years ago, and opened the Madison Ave. clubhouse in 2023.\n\nThe facility offers programs for kids aged three up to 18, with an early learning preschool center and after school programs including sports, arts, technology, and STEM.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a community center, it\u2019s a partnership, and it\u2019s an awesome space,\u201d said Smeltz.\n\n\u2018Transformational\u2019 Partnership\n\nWakeman\u2019s relationship with ASML began a few years ago.\n\nThe Netherlands-based company, which employs 3,300 people at its Wilton location, is an advanced lithography company that makes machines used to produce microchips.\n\nAmero, who started with the company in 2022, was looking to build new community partnerships.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough for us to write a check, slap our logo on something and walk away from it.\u201d ASML\u2019s Brian Amero\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough for us to write a check, slap our logo on something, and walk away from it,\u201d Amero said.\n\n\u201cWe wanted a seat at the table. This entire process has been incredibly hands-on for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe both went into this being transformational,\u201d Smeltz said. \u201cHow are we going to move that needle? How are we going to measure some outcomes?\u201d\n\n\u2018Intentionality\u2019\n\nThat partnership led to the creation of the STEM lab.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of intentionality around this,\u201d Smeltz said.\n\n\u201cWe built in staff time and training time to be able to be successful, because ultimately, we don\u2019t want a whole bunch of stuff just sitting in a room.\n\n\u201dWe want it to be used all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re challenging our kids to learn.\u201d Smeltz\n\nSmelz said the partnership with ASML helped them train their staff to run the lab, which offers everything from robotics to hydroponics, mechanics, engineering, and STEM art learning opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re challenging our kids to learn,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt could be an experiment, it could be a problem to solve, it could be a challenge.\n\n\u201cAnd working in groups, working separately, all of that happens in our after school program.\u201d\n\nEngaging Students\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Wakeman staff that are getting hands on with the kids. ASML employees also spend a lot of time volunteering at the club.\n\n\u201cWhen the students here have the opportunity to engage with ASML employees, they see themselves reflected in our workforce,\u201d Amero said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re seeing somebody who comes from a similar background.\n\n\u201cWe do have aspirations to increase the amount of time that our staff are spending here.\u201d Amero\n\n\u201cAnd if they can do it, so can you. And I love that secondary benefit to giving back to our community.\u201d\n\nThe company provides eight hours of PTO time for full-time employees to volunteer.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re thirsty for these opportunities,\u201d Amero said.\n\n\u201cWe do have aspirations to increase the amount of time that our staff are spending here, and to really help shape and influence and guide the youth here.\n\nLife Skills\n\nSmeltz said the skills the students are gaining in the lab go beyond learning technical skills.\n\n\u201cSometimes these projects don\u2019t go the way they planned,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely magic.\u201d Amero\n\n\u201cAnd I think that sometimes is even the more exciting part of it, because our kids are learning in a day-to-day environment that isn\u2019t scripted, but is helping them learn how to solve the problem, deal with conflict.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe skills that they\u2019re learning in this lab are the skills that will help elevate them to jobs and career success,\u201d Amero added\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely magic. It\u2019s just great to see.\u201d\n\nThe CBIA BizCast is made possible through the generous support of Google.

(NASDAQ: ASML) ordinary shares between January 24, 2024 and October 15, 2024, inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), have until this Monday, January 13, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the ASML class action lawsuit. Captioned City of Hollywood Firefighters\u2019 Pension Fund v. ASML Holding N.V., No. 24-cv-08664 (S.D.N.Y.), the ASML class action lawsuit charges ASML as well as certain of ASML\u2019s current and former executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nIf you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the ASML class action lawsuit, please provide your information here:\n\nhttps://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-asml-holding-n-v-class-action-lawsuit-asml.html\n\nYou can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com.\n\nCASE ALLEGATIONS: ASML develops, produces, markets, sells, and services advanced semiconductor equipment systems for chipmakers.\n\nThe ASML class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the issues being faced by suppliers, like ASML, in the semiconductor industry were much more severe than defendants had indicated to investors; (ii) the pace of recovery of sales in the semiconductor industry was much slower than defendants had publicly acknowledged; and (iii) defendants had created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to customer demand and anticipated growth, while also downplaying risk from macroeconomic and industry fluctuations, as well as stronger regulations restricting the export of semiconductor technology, including the products that ASML sells.\n\nThe ASML class action lawsuit further alleges that on October 15, 2024, ASML announced that it: (i) recorded quarterly booking of only \u20ac2.63 billion \u2013 a 53% decline from \u20ac5.6 billion in the second quarter of 2024; (ii) expected full year 2025 net sales to be between \u20ac30 billion and \u20ac35 billion, in the lower half of ASML\u2019s initial range of between \u20ac30 billion and \u20ac40 billion; and (iii) materially reduced its gross margin target to between 51% and 53%, down from its prior guidance of between 54% and 56%. On this news, the price of ASML stock fell more than 16%, according to the complaint.\n\nThen, on October 16, 2024, during the accompanying earnings call, the ASML class action lawsuit alleges that ASML\u2019s CFO, defendant Roger Dassen, attributed the poor bookings results to \u201ca reflection of the slow recovery in the traditional [semiconductor] end markets as customers remain cautious in the current environment.\u201d Additionally, ASML\u2019s CEO, defendant Christophe Fouquet, admitted that the semiconductor industry \u201crecovery will extend well into 2025,\u201d leading to \u201ca reduced growth curve in 2025 and an . . . overall reduction of our lithography demand,\u201d according to the complaint. The ASML class action lawsuit alleges that on this news, the price of ASML stock fell more than 6%.\n\nTHE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired ASML ordinary shares during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the ASML class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the ASML class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the ASML class action lawsuit. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the ASML class action lawsuit.\n\nABOUT ROBBINS GELLER: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP is one of the world\u2019s leading law firms representing investors in securities fraud cases.

We did that twenty years ago, but if you don\u2019t focus on other sectors, your knowledge will be diluted. Applications in the field of aviation, healthcare technology, AI applications. These are sectors that are now being snowed under.\u201d\n\nLoss of knowledge\n\nWhile these companies also have important knowledge, says trade unionist Reniers. \u201cOnce these companies leave or do not invest further here, you also lose that knowledge. At Philips, the entire development branch has been paralyzed, while everyone knows how much that research branch has yielded. If you do not invest in that anymore, you are calling the problems upon yourself. That you as a government are now going to cut back on something like education is completely incomprehensible,\u201d says Reniers.\n\nGovernment policy\n\nAccording to the union leader, it creates an uneven playing field. \u201cIf you look at Germany and Belgium, it is better regulated, companies there spend relatively less money on energy because of government subsidies. Here we are more concerned with climate goals than with those economic interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe balance is gone. Look at companies like Standard Aero, for example, which has already left Tilburg. A lot of knowledge and innovation has been lost as a result and is not easily returned.\u201d In addition, there is also a major problem for new companies or expansions due to the lack of connection to the electricity grid.\n\n\u201cThe government must remove barriers to growth,\u201d says Joost Eyck. \u201cEntrepreneurs should not have to make choices about which sector they focus on. But companies themselves can do much more. By automating and applying artificial intelligence, they can increase their productivity and for their growth and capacity expansion they can also go outside the Netherlands, for example to Eastern Europe.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at companies in Germany and Eastern Europe, they work much more efficiently. More is being automated so that you can use the capacity you have better,\u201d says Eyck.\n\nAutomation\n\nAccording to the experts, many suppliers of ASML could take steps in this area in a period with relatively little growth. These companies often still have a start-up culture, where many steps in the production process of the chip machines are not automated or structured.",

The Company also announced it expected full year 2025 total net sales to be between \u20ac30 billion and \u20ac35 billion, with a gross margin between 51% and 53%, explaining that \u201c[w]hile there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in [artificial intelligence], other [semiconductor] market segments are taking longer to recover\u201d and that \u201c[i]t now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected.\u201d\n\nOn this news, ASML\u2019s stock price fell $141.84, or 16.3%, to close at $730.43 per share on October 15, 2024, thereby injuring investors.\n\nThen, on October 16, 2024, ASML held its earnings call, during which, the Company further revealed that ASML\u2019s sales in China had declined, which would also negatively impact the Company\u2019s gross margins.\n\nOn this news, ASML\u2019s stock price fell $46.91, or 6.4%, to close at $683.52 per share on October 16, 2024, thereby injuring investors further.\n\nWhat Is The Lawsuit About?\n\nThe complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects.

In addition, Xiver supplies ASML and the French defense company Lynred, Van Soerland confirmed in De Telegraaf. ASML relies heavily on a network of suppliers in and around Eindhoven to build its machines, which now includes Xiver.\n\nNew positioning\n\nWith the sale of the business unit, Philips is further committed to divesting non-core activities. The Eindhoven-based company wants to concentrate on its core activities in health technology. For that reason, ASML and, at a later stage, NXP also started earlier. These spin-offs from Philips now have their own success stories.\n\nVan Soerland, who stepped down as CEO of VDL Nedcar last summer, had announced his retirement. Nevertheless, he decided to take on this new challenge. Financial details of the acquisition were not disclosed. However, the intention is to retain the current team of 110 employees.

            "content": "Without innovations in microchips, none of the technology we take for granted today would be possible. Smartphones, AI models, and vehicles depend heavily on this industry, making it a vital investment area.\n\nI see three promising chip stocks that look like buys right now. They are Nvidia (NVDA 6.43%), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.63%), and ASML (ASML 1.91%). Each has a different thesis for why it will be a successful investment in 2025.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia can be considered a chip company because it manufactures GPUs that use a considerable amount of proprietary chip technology to make them best in class. Nvidia's top-performing GPUs have allowed it to capture nearly all of the artificial intelligence (AI) computing market, which has provided the company with massive growth over the past two years.\n\nIn 2025, Nvidia is working to ramp up production of its next-generation Blackwell architecture, which provides incredible improvements over the previous Hopper architecture. With many of Nvidia's largest clients warning investors they will continue ramping up data center spending in 2025 to meet the growing AI demand, Nvidia is primed to benefit once again.\n\nAlthough 2025 won't bring the same explosive growth for Nvidia as the previous two years, Wall Street analysts still expect 51% growth for fiscal 2026 (ending January 2026). Considering Nvidia's $3.4 trillion market capitalization, that's incredible growth. Furthermore, Nvidia's stock isn't as expensive as it appears.\n\nWith the company growing revenue at a 50% clip, 54 times trailing earnings really isn't a bad price to pay. As a result, I think investors can confidently take a position in Nvidia right now.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n\nNvidia's GPUs contain chips manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor. Because TSMC is a chip foundry, companies like Nvidia send TSMC chip designs to fabricate. However, Taiwan Semi is a neutral party, as it also manufactures chips for competitor GPUs. This makes Taiwan Semiconductor an intriguing AI investment, as it is a true picks-and-shovel play on the AI boom.\n\nManagement hasn't been shy about letting investors know how much AI is benefiting the company. For 2024, management expects AI-related revenue to triple year over year and make up a mid-teens percentage of overall revenue. That's massive growth, and considering that Nvidia is still expected to grow in 2025, it bodes well for Taiwan Semiconductor.\n\nTSMC will also launch its latest product, 2-nanometer (nm) chips, at the end of the year. These chips are expected to be far more power efficient than previous generations and will greatly reduce operating costs for expensive AI computing equipment.\n\nWith Taiwan Semiconductor trading at just 23 times forward earnings, it looks like a great stock to scoop up right now.\n\nASML\n\nASML isn't doing as well as the previous two stocks. ASML provides extreme ultraviolet lithography machines that are vital in the chip manufacturing process. No other company in the world has this technology, giving ASML a monopoly.\n\nHowever, Western governments have used this monopoly as a tool in their quest to prevent China from overtaking them in technological prowess. As a result, the Netherlands (where ASML is headquartered) and the U.S. have placed export bans on some of its machines, only allowing the low-tech ones to be sold and serviced in China.\n\nThese bans have started to hurt ASML, as management had to cut 2025 revenue guidance from the original 30 billion to 40 billion euro range to between 30 billion and 35 billion euros. Still, the long-term growth picture is intact, as management's revenue guidance for 2030 of 44 billion to 60 billion euros hasn't changed from the original 2022 investor day guidance.\n\nASML's technology is nearly impossible to replicate, as it is the culmination of decades of innovation. With its machines vital in the chip manufacturing process, ASML is well positioned to be a long-term winner in the chip investing world. With the stock down around 36% from its highs after the China news, now seems like a great time to scoop up shares and capitalize while the rest of the market is fearful.",

            "content": "About six months ago China launched the third instalment of its Big Fund. An investment to make the country's semiconductor industry self-sufficient. The so-called Big Fund III is primarily meant to support developers and makers of chip production equipment as Chinese chipmakers have lost access to advanced wafer fabrication tools from market leaders like ASML and Applied Materials. Now, it is time to spend the massive capital of \u00a5344 billion ($47 billion), reports Nikkei.\n\nThe third phase of the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (or the Big Fund III) began operations on December 31, 2024. Just like the first two phases, it will be managed by Huaxin Investment Management, a firm founded in 2014 to oversee investments for all phases of the fund. Initially the fund will invest \u00a593 billion ($12.685 billion) in various companies that produce materials like ultra-pure chemistry (e.g., resists) or silicon wafers as well as in companies that develop and build wafer fabrication equipment. For now, it is unclear whether the fund will focus on boosting established players like AMEC or Naura, or will attempt to help new start-ups to emerge.\n\n$12.685 billion is a lot of money, but it is not enough to leapfrog market leading makers of fab tools. To put the number into context, ASML's annual research and development budget totaled $4.308 billion in 2023, whereas Applied Materials R&D budget in 2024 reached $3.233 billion.\n\nSince its launch in 2014, the Big Fund and its successor, Big Fund II, have collectively raised hundreds of billions of dollars, with investments of approximately $100 billion during the first phase (2014\u20132018) and $41 billion in the second (2019\u20132023). According to Bloomberg's estimates in mid-2024, the assets then managed by the fund were valued at around $45 billion as they were affected by U.S. sanctions targeting China's semiconductor sector. To date, the sanctions disrupted the most successful Chinese semiconductor companies, such as Huawei's chip design arm HiSilicon, contract chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), and 3D NAND leader Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. (YMTC).",

(\u201cASML\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NASDAQ: ASML) ordinary shares between January 24, 2024, and October 15, 2024, inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d).\n\nIF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ASML INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS.\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nOn October 15, 2024, ASML released its third quarter 2024 financial results, revealing quarterly bookings of \u20ac2.63 billion, a decline of 53% quarter-over-quarter. The Company also announced it expected full year 2025 total net sales to be between \u20ac30 billion and \u20ac35 billion, with a gross margin between 51% and 53%, explaining that \u201c[w]hile there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in [artificial intelligence], other [semiconductor] market segments are taking longer to recover\u201d and that \u201c[i]t now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected.\u201d\n\nOn this news, ASML\u2019s stock price fell $141.84, or 16.3%, to close at $730.43 per share on October 15, 2024, thereby injuring investors.\n\nThen, on October 16, 2024, ASML held its earnings call, during which, the Company further revealed that ASML\u2019s sales in China had declined, which would also negatively impact the Company\u2019s gross margins.\n\nOn this news, ASML\u2019s stock price fell $46.91, or 6.4%, to close at $683.52 per share on October 16, 2024, thereby injuring investors further.\n\nWhat Is The Lawsuit About?\n\nThe complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the issues being faced by suppliers, like ASML, in the semiconductor industry were much more severe than Defendants had indicated to investors; (2) the pace of recovery of sales in the semiconductor industry was much slower than Defendants had publicly acknowledged; (3) Defendants had created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to customer demand and anticipated growth, while also downplaying risk from macroeconomic and industry fluctuations, as well as stronger regulations restricting the export of semiconductor technology, including the products that ASML sells; and (4) as a result, Defendants\u2019 positive statements about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.\n\nIf you purchased or otherwise acquired ASML ordinary shares during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than January 13, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.\n\nContact Us To Participate or Learn More:\n\nIf you wish to learn more about this action, or if you have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact us:\n\nCharles Linehan, Esq.,\n\nGlancy Prongay & Murray LLP,\n\n1925 Century Park East, Suite 2100,\n\nLos Angeles California 90067\n\nEmail: shareholders@glancylaw.com\n\nTelephone: 310-201-9150,\n\nToll-Free: 888-773-9224\n\nVisit our website at www.glancylaw.com.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, Twitter, or Facebook.\n\nIf you inquire by email, please include your mailing address, telephone number and number of shares purchased.\n\nTo be a member of the class action you need not take any action at this time; you may retain counsel of your choice or take no action and remain an absent member of the class action.\n\nThis press release may be considered Attorney Advertising in some jurisdictions under the applicable law and ethical rules.\n\nContact Us:\n\nGlancy Prongay & Murray LLP,\n\n1925 Century Park East, Suite 2100\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90067\n\nCharles Linehan\n\nEmail: shareholders@glancylaw.com\n\nTelephone: 310-201-9150\n\nToll-Free: 888-773-9224\n\nVisit our website at: www.glancylaw.com.",

            "content": "The Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) has been a great performing index, as it beat the broader S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) in 2024 by rising 28.6% versus the S&P 500's 23.3%. It wouldn't surprise me to see those results again in 2025, but I think a few companies within the Nasdaq Composite can outperform the broader index in 2025.\n\nThese stocks are Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), ASML (NASDAQ: ASML), PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI). I think all five of these stocks are solid buys for 2025, and investors would be smart to take a position in them now.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nAI Plays: Meta, Alphabet, and ASML\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) was a huge investment theme in 2023 and 2024, and I expect it to be no different in 2025. Meta, Alphabet, and ASML are a few of my favorite AI investments, but for different reasons.\n\nMeta and Alphabet are probably better known by their flagship properties, Facebook and Google. These two giants make most of their money on advertising and have significant AI investments. Knowing what ads to put in front of a consumer is key, and developing leading AI models is one way to achieve that goal. Google Gemini and Meta's Llama are their two generative AI platforms, and each is near the top of the list of best-performing models.\n\nDespite their dominant market position in advertising and solid progress in the AI arms race, these two trade for attractive price tags.\n\nAt 23 times forward earnings for Meta and 21.2 times for Alphabet, both stocks are significantly cheaper than the Nasdaq 100 index, which has a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.1. This makes these two stocks steals at their current price tags, and investors should take advantage of them in 2025.\n\nASML is an entirely different AI investment, as it makes machines vital in microchip production. Its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines trace the microscopic etches on chips. ASML is the only company in the world with this technology, giving it a monopoly in the space. However, Western governments have stepped in and prevented ASML from selling certain machines to China and its allies, which has caused ASML to reduce its 2025 guidance.\n\nThis announcement caused the stock to plummet, but ASML's management was confident that the long-term investment growth picture was still intact. In fact, management didn't even change its 2030 revenue guidance from the previous ranges given in 2022.\n\nWith its monopoly and strong growth projection for multiple years, ASML seems like a no-brainer investment. However, it's down around 35% from its all-time high, which presents a massive investment opportunity.\n\nValue investments: PayPal and MercadoLibre\n\nWhile the previous three stocks are for more of a growth investment style, PayPal and MercadoLibre both provide significant value opportunities.\n\nPayPal's recovery under relatively new CEO Alex Chriss has been strong. The company is starting to see some of its changes pay off, and free cash flow has risen dramatically since he took over in September 2023.\n\nThis allows PayPal to repurchase shares, which they have done in a dramatic fashion. PayPal's share count has fallen 7% in the short time Chriss has been at the helm, and all signs point toward PayPal continuing to reduce share count. As a result, PayPal should see solid earnings growth, which should translate into a market-beating stock.\n\nMercadoLibre is the e-commerce giant in Latin America, but it also has a fintech division similar to PayPal for its client base. Because of some bad debt in its credit card division, MercadoLibre's profits took a hit, which the market didn't appreciate. This caused the stock to plummet, and recenty it was 20% down from its all-time highs.\n\nHowever, this weakness is only expected to last for a short amount of time, as Wall Street analysts project 38% earnings per share (EPS) growth in 2025. For a stock that's trading at 38 times forward earnings, that level of growth seems like a steal.\n\nThere's a ton of growth left in Latin America, and MercadoLibre is the best way to invest in it. MercadoLibre has been a long-term winning investment, and I expect it to be no different in 2025.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in ASML ordinary shares, call options, and/or put options. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Matar v. ASML Holding N.V., et al., No. 24-cv-9908.\n\nWhat is the Lawsuit About?\n\nASML is a leading supplier to the semiconductor industry, providing photolithography machines to chipmakers that are used in the semiconductor fabrication process.\n\nThe complaint alleges that ASML repeatedly represented to shareholders that new export controls on semiconductor technology announced by the Dutch government would not have a material effect on ASML\u2019s financial outlook, and that ASML was on a path to recovery in its sales.\n\nOn October 15, 2024, ASML announced earnings significantly lower than expectations. The Company attributed this to a market that was \u201ctaking longer to recover\u201d and admitted that \u201c[i]t now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected.\u201d On this news, the price of the Company\u2019s stock fell 16%, from a closing price of $872.27 per share on October 14, 2024, to $730.43 per share on October 15, 2024.\n\nThen, during the accompanying earnings call with investors on October 16, 2024, the Company attributed the poor earnings results to \u201ca reflection of the slow recovery in the traditional [semiconductor] end markets as customers remain cautious in the current environment.\u201d The Company also disclosed that the decline in ASML\u2019s sales to China would also negatively impact the Company\u2019s gross margins. On this news, the price of the Company\u2019s stock fell 6.4%, from a closing price of $730.43 per share on October 15, 2024, to $683.52 per share on October 16, 2024.\n\nClick here if you suffered losses: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/asml-holding-nv.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\nIf you invested in ASML you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.\n\nAll representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

            "content": "ASML CEO leads high-level delegation to TSMC next week\n\nAhead of TSMC's quarterly earnings release on January 16, 2025, the pure-play foundry is holding year-end meetings with key suppliers. ASML, a critical partner of TSMC, is showing exceptional commitment. CEO Christophe Fouquet will lead a delegation of senior executives to Taiwan next week to engage in discussions with TSMC chairman and CEO C.C. Wei, co-COO Y.P. Chyn, and other high-level executives in Taipei.\n\nIndustry sources indicate the discussions will focus on the potential political landscape following the inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump. ASML aims to gain a deeper understanding of TSMC's process technology roadmap and procurement strategy for the upcoming years.\n\nThe visit by Fouquet and other ASML officials also aims to encourage TSMC to accelerate and increase its orders for the costly extreme ultraviolet (High NA EUV) equipment, priced at about US$380 million, according to sources.\n\nStrategic outlook and market dynamics\n\nASML recently disclosed updated order data and revised its financial prediction for 2025, indicating that China's revenue contribution would fall to approximately 20%. Notably, ASML's revenue from the Chinese market did not exceed 20% between 2017 and 2022. The percentage only surpassed 30% in 2023 and 2024, driven by China's robust ordering and stockpiling efforts.\n\nASML projects that the flourishing AI sector will generate substantial demand for its advanced lithography machines and metrology tools, resulting in revenue growth of 8-14% over the next five years. Revenue is expected to reach EUR44 billion (US$46.4 billion) to EUR60 billion by 2030, with a gross margin of 56% to 60%.\n\nFouquet has previously stated that he expects to expand the company's diverse lithography product line and extend EUV technology into the next decade. This expansion would enable ASML to fully capitalize on AI opportunities, driving substantial revenue and profit growth.\n\nSupply chain dependencies\n\nSupply chain insights suggest ASML's dependence on TSMC will increase. Export sanctions affecting China, combined with downturns at Samsung Electronics and Intel, as well as a slowdown in process technology improvements, have negatively impacted ASML's EUV equipment shipments.\n\nDespite Japan's Rapidus initiating orders, its progress remains under scrutiny. ASML considers TSMC its most crucial and stable major client, both currently and in the future, necessitating greater efforts to maintain their relationship. The executives' visit to meet with Wei and other TSMC executives is likely aimed at negotiating rates for the High NA EUV equipment.\n\nTSMC deputy co-COO Kevin Zhang has previously confirmed that the A16 process will not use High NA EUV. According to TSMC's internal preliminary plans, implementation might begin as early as the enhanced A14P generation, with subsequent generations such as A10 and more advanced nodes fully integrating it, significantly improving cost and efficiency in advanced process technologies.\n\nMeanwhile, the US government continues to pressure ASML to cease providing maintenance and repair services for advanced DUV systems to Chinese customers. While the Dutch government has not yet agreed to this proposal, concerns persist about ASML's future operational growth pace.\n\nIn a recent media interview, Fouquet emphasized that due to the ban on selling EUV equipment to China, the country's chip manufacturing capabilities are likely to lag behind the West by 10-15 years, demonstrating the effectiveness of EUV export restrictions.",

(NASDAQ: ASML) and certain of the Company\u2019s senior executives.\n\nIf you invested in ASML, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/asml-holding-nv.\n\nInvestors have until January 13, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in ASML ordinary shares, call options, and/or put options. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Matar v. ASML Holding N.V., et al., No. 24-cv-9908.\n\nWhat is the Lawsuit About?\n\nASML is a leading supplier to the semiconductor industry, providing photolithography machines to chipmakers that are used in the semiconductor fabrication process.\n\nThe complaint alleges that ASML repeatedly represented to shareholders that new export controls on semiconductor technology announced by the Dutch government would not have a material effect on ASML\u2019s financial outlook, and that ASML was on a path to recovery in its sales.\n\nOn October 15, 2024, ASML announced earnings significantly lower than expectations. The Company attributed this to a market that was \u201ctaking longer to recover\u201d and admitted that \u201c[i]t now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected.\u201d On this news, the price of the Company\u2019s stock fell 16%, from a closing price of $872.27 per share on October 14, 2024, to $730.43 per share on October 15, 2024.\n\nThen, during the accompanying earnings call with investors on October 16, 2024, the Company attributed the poor earnings results to \u201ca reflection of the slow recovery in the traditional [semiconductor] end markets as customers remain cautious in the current environment.\u201d The Company also disclosed that the decline in ASML\u2019s sales to China would also negatively impact the Company\u2019s gross margins. On this news, the price of the Company\u2019s stock fell 6.4%, from a closing price of $730.43 per share on October 15, 2024, to $683.52 per share on October 16, 2024.\n\nClick here if you suffered losses: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/asml-holding-nv.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\nIf you invested in ASML you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.\n\nAll representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The business depends on her and about 10,000 similarly trained colleagues to maintain every one of the few hundred EUV\u2019s manufacturing the world\u2019s microchips.\n\nThe machines \u2014 which are roughly the size of a bus \u2014 border on science fiction, and create microchips by vaporizing drops of molten tin, then blasting the metal with ultraviolet lasers to leave an imprint of a chip-pattern on silicon wafers.\n\nThat process occurs 50,000 times a second, and creates chips with details 10,000 times finer than the width of a human hair.\n\nThey also use mirrors so perfectly rendered that if they were blown up to the size of Germany, the biggest imperfections would be smaller than a millimeter, according to the Journal. And their lasers are precise enough to shoot a ping pong ball on the moon\u2019s surface.\n\nOf the few hundred EUVs in existence, only six companies own their own. The rest of the world depends on ASML to create the chips for them.\n\nThat\u2019s where Hall \u2014 who works at ASML\u2019s Boise plant \u2014 comes in.\n\n3 Brienna Hall, 29, is one of just several thousand engineers trained to operate EUV machines Linkedin\n\nA Washington State University graduate who majored in engineering and materials science, Hall got the job after a professor passed her resume to ASML and the company reached out requesting she apply.\n\nHall had never heard of ASML or an EUV, but was sold when they told her the extensive training would take her across the world.\n\nShe first travelled to Taiwan where she spent a month learning about an EUV\u2019s 100,000 parts, then shipped off to Germany and San Francisco for months at a time before her entry-level training was done.\n\nThen it was another year of apprenticeship before she was allowed to work on an EUV alone.\n\nWhen she walks into the EUV\u2019s room \u2014 where the air is 100 times cleaner than a hospital operating room \u2014 the first thing Hall does is don a decontaminated full-body suit so as not to alter the precise conditions needed for the machine to operate accurately.\n\n\u201cEverything must be perfect,\u201d Hall told the Journal. \u201cThe conditions must be just so for her to function.\u201d\n\n3 ASML, a Dutch company, is the only producer of EUVs on the planet \u2014 and they make the world\u2019s most important chips NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nThe devices can be affected by the likes of earthquakes \u2014 and a malfunction in one was once even traced to methane flatulated from cows at an upwind dairy farm.\n\nHall is the kind of person whose job it is to dissect the machine\u2019s problems and figure out such causes, and monitor the machines daily to make sure others don\u2019t arise.\n\nShe works in 12 hours shifts, and tries to use the bathroom as little as possible to keep from contaminating the machine-room with comings and goings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll space out and limit my sips of water \u2014 and I won\u2019t drink coffee,\u201d she said.\n\nShe revels in the intensity of the job.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m on the tool and fixing a problem, it\u2019s like everything else goes quiet \u2014 and I\u2019m just focused on getting that one thing done,\u201d Hall said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than just zeroing in on that problem until it\u2019s solved.\u201d\n\nBut despite the EUV\u2019s enormous complexity, Hall thinks they\u2019re easier to work on than any given human.\n\n\u201cOur machine is complex enough that it has a personality, but it\u2019s still a machine.

(NASDAQ: ASML) ordinary shares between January 24, 2024 and October 15, 2024, all dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), have until Monday, January 13, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the ASML class action lawsuit. Captioned City of Hollywood Firefighters' Pension Fund v. ASML Holding N.V., No. 24-cv-08664 (S.D.N.Y.), the ASML class action lawsuit charges ASML as well as certain of ASML's current and former executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nIf you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the ASML class action lawsuit, please provide your information here:\n\nhttps://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-asml-holding-n-v-class-action-lawsuit-asml.html\n\nYou can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at [email protected].\n\nCASE ALLEGATIONS: ASML develops, produces, markets, sells, and services advanced semiconductor equipment systems for chipmakers.\n\nThe ASML class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the issues being faced by suppliers, like ASML, in the semiconductor industry were much more severe than defendants had indicated to investors; (ii) the pace of recovery of sales in the semiconductor industry was much slower than defendants had publicly acknowledged; and (iii) defendants had created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to customer demand and anticipated growth, while also downplaying risk from macroeconomic and industry fluctuations, as well as stronger regulations restricting the export of semiconductor technology, including the products that ASML sells.\n\nThe ASML class action lawsuit further alleges that on October 15, 2024, ASML announced that it: (i) recorded quarterly booking of only \u20ac2.63 billion \u2013 a 53% decline from \u20ac5.6 billion in the second quarter of 2024; (ii) expected full year 2025 net sales to be between \u20ac30 billion and \u20ac35 billion, in the lower half of ASML's initial range of between \u20ac30 billion and \u20ac40 billion; and (iii) materially reduced its gross margin target to between 51% and 53%, down from its prior guidance of between 54% and 56%. On this news, the price of ASML stock fell more than 16%, according to the complaint.\n\nThen, on October 16, 2024, during the accompanying earnings call, the ASML class action lawsuit alleges that ASML's CFO, defendant Roger Dassen, attributed the poor bookings results to \"a reflection of the slow recovery in the traditional [semiconductor] end markets as customers remain cautious in the current environment.\" Additionally, ASML's CEO, defendant Christophe Fouquet, admitted that the semiconductor industry \"recovery will extend well into 2025,\" leading to \"a reduced growth curve in 2025 and an . . . overall reduction of our lithography demand,\" according to the complaint. The ASML class action lawsuit alleges that on this news, the price of ASML stock fell more than 6%.\n\nTHE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired ASML ordinary shares during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the ASML class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the ASML class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the ASML class action lawsuit. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the ASML class action lawsuit.\n\nABOUT ROBBINS GELLER: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP is one of the world's leading law firms representing investors in securities fraud cases.

            "content": "The stock market is taking a breather after a relentless run, but opportunities still abound, according to some on Wall Street.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 1.22%) has climbed consistently higher over the past couple of years as technology investors have sought to profit from the economic recovery, the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), the slowing of inflation, and the ongoing campaign to lower interest rates. After notching gains of 43% in 2023, the index tacked on an additional 29% in 2024.\n\nInvesting offers no guarantees, but history suggests there could be more upside in store for investors in 2025. Looking back as far as 1972 -- the first full year of trading for the Nasdaq Stock Market -- in every year following gains of 28% or more, the tech-focused index gained another 19%, on average. This suggests the coming year could be a profitable one for investors.\n\nLet's look at two Nasdaq stocks that could soar in 2025, with potential upside of up to 153%, according to certain Wall Street analysts.\n\nASML: Implied upside of 66%\n\nThe first Nasdaq stock with the potential for significant upside is ASML (ASML 1.91%). The company manufactures the advanced lithography systems used to produce microchips. ASML is also the only company in the world that supplies extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology, which is used by chipmakers to create the world's most advanced semiconductors. This gives ASML a distinct advantage over its competitors.\n\nFor example, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing produces an estimated 92% of the world's most advanced chips and is ASML's largest customer. This illustrates that ASML continues to benefit for the accelerating demand for AI.\n\nIn the third quarter, ASML's revenue jumped 12% year over year to 6.67 billion euros (roughly $6.85 billion) while reporting earnings per share (EPS) of 5.28 euros (about $5.42), an increase of 10%.\n\nCEO Christophe Fouquet expects the company's accelerating growth to continue, forecasting net sales of 32.5 billion euros in 2025 at the midpoint of its guidance, an increase of 16% compared to its full-year 2024 sales forecast. The chief executive goes even further, saying ASML's sales growth should average between 8% and 14% over the coming five years.\n\nSome on Wall Street believe investors are missing the forest for the trees. Included among their ranks is JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande. He maintains an outperform (buy) rating on ASML, with a price target of $1,148. That represents upside potential of 66% compared to Tuesday's closing price.\n\nThe stock price is down 36% from its July peak, as some system sales have been pushed out until next year. The analyst believes this is a mere speed bump and will set the stage for a rebound as sales ramp up -- representing a compelling opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nGiven the accelerating demand for AI and the company's strategic place in the semiconductor industry, I think now is the time to buy ASML as the secular tailwinds of AI continue to ramp up. And at just 28 times forward earnings, the stock is attractively priced in the context of its growing opportunity.\n\nSymbotic: Implied upside 153%\n\nThe proliferation of e-commerce and the race to deliver ever-faster shipping has created the need for more efficient fulfillment operations and advances in warehouse automation -- and Symbotic (SYM 0.95%) is leading the charge.\n\nThe company offers a comprehensive suite of customizable AI solutions to automate the processing of full pallets and the peeling off of individual cases to maximize available warehouse space. Symbotic employs sophisticated algorithms and an army of robots equipped with computer vision that work in tandem to move pallets, load and unload delivery vehicles, and separate individual containers. This helps increase efficiency and uses every available inch of warehouse space, ultimately saving users money.\n\nSymbotic notes that its systems increase efficiency, reduce labor costs, and dramatically lower operating and delivery expenses, while achieving a 30% to 60% reduction in space requirements. As a result, the return on invested capital (ROIC) is equally dramatic, and the system can generally pay for itself in a very short time. In fact, Symbotic estimates the purchase of each module can pay for itself numerous times over, saving customers tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars, depending on the overall size of the system.\n\nThe results are compelling. In its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Sept. 28), Symbotic generated revenue of $577 million, an increase of 47% year over year, resulting in EPS of $0.05, swinging from a considerable loss in the prior-year quarter.\n\nSymbotic restated some of its quarterly reports in 2024, which sent some investors running for the exits. However, management noted these resulted in timing differences with \"no impact to full-year fiscal year 2024 results.\" Early last month, Symbotic filed its completed annual report with no additional changes, removing the final shadow the hung over the stock.\n\nOn the heels of these developments, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Derek Soderberg reiterated an overweight (buy) rating and $60 price target on the stock, which represents potential upside of 153% compared to Tuesday's closing price. The analyst's optimism was confirmed after a recent meeting with management regarding its ongoing global expansion and progress with its warehouse-as-a-service joint venture.\n\nEven more intriguing is the price tag, as Symbotic's is selling for less than 1.3 times sales. I view that as an attractive price to pay for a key player in an emerging industry.",

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Matar v.

On this news, the price of the Company\u2019s stock fell 6.4%, from a closing price of $730.43 per share on October 15, 2024, to $683.52 per share on October 16, 2024.\n\nClick here if you suffered losses: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/asml-holding-nv.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\nIf you invested in ASML you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.\n\nAll representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

Facing the heat of a class action lawsuit, ASML Holding is embroiled in controversy over its response to new Dutch export protocols. ASML, a pivotal player in the semiconductor industry, is scrutinized for allegedly downplaying the ramifications of these controls on its financial results. These accusations surfaced after the company reported earnings that fell short of expectations, triggering a notable drop in its stock value.\n\nThe unfolding situation at ASML underscores the dynamic challenges that semiconductor companies face, risking investor trust and market stability. Meanwhile, the firm\u2019s strategic shift towards pioneering solutions like the NXE:3800E and High-NA EUV could potentially bolster its growth trajectory, inviting investor interest in technological transformation within the industry.\n\nIn related market movements, South Korean company SK hynix saw a 6.4% increase in its share value, ending the day at \u20a9182,100. The company drew attention as it prepared to showcase state-of-the-art AI memory solutions at CES 2025. Conversely, JCET Group experienced a decline of 4.9%, closing at CN\u00a536.36, reflecting the unpredictable nature of the semiconductor market.\n\nFor those eager to delve deeper into the expanding AI chip sector, a comprehensive examination of ongoing investment trends is essential.

Companies like ASML Holding are at the forefront, embroiled in controversies linked to new Dutch export protocols. These regulations have attracted scrutiny, suggesting that ASML may have underplayed the potential impacts on its financial performance. This controversy has not only affected ASML\u2019s stock value but also highlighted the broader vulnerability of semiconductor companies to regulatory changes.\n\nTechnological Innovations as a Response\n\nIn response to these challenges, ASML is redirecting its focus towards technological innovations. The company\u2019s introduction of groundbreaking solutions such as the NXE:3800E and High-NA EUV showcases its commitment to pioneering advancements in the semiconductor sector. Such initiatives are aimed at reinstating investor confidence and positioning ASML as a leader in technological transformation.\n\nMarket Dynamics and Investor Insights\n\nWhile ASML navigates its legal hurdles, other players in the semiconductor market are experiencing contrasting fortunes. SK hynix recently saw a significant 6.4% increase in its stock price, boosted by its upcoming display of cutting-edge AI memory solutions at CES 2025. This event highlights SK hynix\u2019s role in the rapidly evolving AI sector.\n\nConversely, JCET Group faced a 4.9% decline in share value, exemplifying the unpredictable and volatile nature of the semiconductor market. Such fluctuations underscore the need for investors to continuously monitor market trends and adapt to the dynamic landscape.\n\nExploring Investment Trends in AI Chips\n\nThe AI chip sector\u2019s momentum is fueled by substantial capital expenditures from major players like Nvidia and TSMC. Understanding the implications of these investments is crucial for stakeholders looking to capitalize on emerging opportunities. The ongoing surge in AI-driven technologies signifies a potential shift in market dynamics, paving the way for innovative applications and industry growth.\n\nFor those interested in further insights into the AI chip industry\u2019s evolving landscape, exploring investment trends and technological advancements offers a comprehensive view of its future trajectory.",

At the time of writing, its share price remains flat year-to-date, compared to a 9% gain in the Euro Stoxx 600 technology index.\n\nThe Dutch computer chip equipment maker lost its position as the largest tech firm in Europe to SAP following disappointing third-quarter earnings. However, there are signs that ASML may experience an acceleration in sales growth in 2025, driven by increasing semiconductor spending and its dominant position within the industry.\n\nA Potential Acceleration in Growth\n\nThe company downgraded its guidance for 2025 amid weaker-than-expected third-quarter earnings. CEO Christophe Fouquet noted that demands were softer than previously projected due to a slower recovery in the semiconductor industry, with this trend likely to extend into 2025. ASML cut its annual growth expectation to a mid-ten percentage from the previously projected 45%.\n\nDespite this, it forecast revenue of \u20ac28bn in 2024, or a 1.4% annual growth from 2023. For 2025, net sales are expected to range between \u20ac30bn and \u20ac35bn, indicating an acceleration in growth of between 7% and 25%.\n\nAdditionally, the guidance downgrade may provide opportunities for earnings surprises in 2025. ASML continues to receive bookings from major industry players. As the producer of the world's most advanced semiconductor-making equipment, particularly its extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, ASML holds a leading position in the market. Its customers include prominent chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Samsung, and Intel.\n\nThe semiconductor industry experienced doldrums in 2022 and 2023, followed by a slow recovery in 2024, despite the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. However, some analysts expect sales of semiconductor equipment to accelerate and increase to $121bn (\u20ac116.2bn) in 2025, a 7% increase from a projected $113bn (\u20ac108.49bn) in 2024. The spending may continue to grow to $139bn (\u20ac133.5bn) in 2026.\n\nFouquet expressed optimism about the company's long-term prospects: \"When it comes to 2030, we are still very, very bullish.\" ASML expects revenue of between \u20ac44bn and \u20ac60bn by 2030, with gross margins of between 56% and 60%, up from the current 51%. The median revenue projection suggests a nearly double growth rate in the next six years. The profit margin is also much higher than the sector\u2019s average of just above 20%.\n\nLimited impact of US-China trade tensions\n\nIn December, the US imposed additional chip export restrictions on China. However, ASML was exempted from these measures and maintained its outlook for 2025, while reducing China's contribution to its business to around 20%, down from nearly half. \"We do not expect any direct material impact on our business\", the company stated in response to the new US rules.\n\nASML's shares have risen 3% since the announcement on 3 December and have rebounded more than 12%, climbing to \u20ac688 as of the market close on 24 December from a one-year low of \u20ac613 in November.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that ASML's price-to-earnings ratio stands at 39, above the industry average of 29. This valuation suggests that the company's shares may not be undervalued in the short term, despite its positive long-term outlook.",

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in ASML ordinary shares, call options, and/or put options. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Matar v. ASML Holding N.V., et al., No. 24-cv-9908.\n\nWhat is the Lawsuit About?\n\nASML is a leading supplier to the semiconductor industry, providing photolithography machines to chipmakers that are used in the semiconductor fabrication process.\n\nThe complaint alleges that ASML repeatedly represented to shareholders that new export controls on semiconductor technology announced by the Dutch government would not have a material effect on ASML\u2019s financial outlook, and that ASML was on a path to recovery in its sales.\n\nOn October 15, 2024, ASML announced earnings significantly lower than expectations. The Company attributed this to a market that was \u201ctaking longer to recover\u201d and admitted that \u201c[i]t now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected.\u201d On this news, the price of the Company\u2019s stock fell 16%, from a closing price of $872.27 per share on October 14, 2024, to $730.43 per share on October 15, 2024.\n\nThen, during the accompanying earnings call with investors on October 16, 2024, the Company attributed the poor earnings results to \u201ca reflection of the slow recovery in the traditional [semiconductor] end markets as customers remain cautious in the current environment.\u201d The Company also disclosed that the decline in ASML\u2019s sales to China would also negatively impact the Company\u2019s gross margins. On this news, the price of the Company\u2019s stock fell 6.4%, from a closing price of $730.43 per share on October 15, 2024, to $683.52 per share on October 16, 2024.\n\nClick here if you suffered losses: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/asml-holding-nv.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\nIf you invested in ASML you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.\n\nAll representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

Luckily for investors looking to put capital into the market, things have cooled down in December, with the S&P down 1% since the start of the month. Looking even deeper, some companies face challenges that have pulled down their stock prices.\n\nHoping for a discount in the share price is only part of the equation for finding the best stocks to buy. Investors should also be searching for companies with competitive advantages and solid track records of success. Short-term challenges have created opportunities to buy shares in these two companies at a discount.\n\nFor investors with $1,000 to put to work in the market, buying one or both of these stocks could end up being a wise decision.\n\nAdobe\n\nIf you've opened a PDF file, you've used an Adobe (ADBE 1.14%) product. While this ubiquitous file type may be Adobe's most well-known application, it's the company's creative suite that is the primary driver of the financial results. Products like Photoshop and Premiere Pro are industry standards for creative fields, even as competition has increased over time.\n\nProof of Adobe's market position is evident in its financial results. Like all businesses, there are sometimes short-term bumps in the road, but over the long run, Adobe has been remarkably consistent. Consider revenue, net income, and free cash flow over the last five years.\n\nWhile Adobe's track record is impressive, investing is about the future and the biggest potential disruption to Adobe's market dominance is artificial intelligence (AI). Many of the tasks creators would do within Adobe's products can already be produced by AI, and the capabilities of AI are increasing every day.\n\nAdobe has chosen to embrace this new technology and has been working hard to embed its AI product, Firefly, into its software suite. Rather than viewing AI as a replacement for Adobe's products, the company believes it can be an assistant to the creative process by taking care of some of the more menial tasks, freeing up the creator to be creative.\n\nTime will tell how successful this strategy will be, and the market seems to be waiting to find out. Adobe currently trades for a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36. While that's not a cheap multiple, it is below Adobe's five-year mean P/E ratio of 47. For investors who believe Adobe will be able to harness the power of AI, rather than be disrupted by it, today's price could prove to be a bargain.\n\nASML\n\nMuch like Adobe, Dutch manufacturer ASML (ASML 1.91%) is the leader in its industry. ASML manufactures the lithography machines necessary to make all semiconductor chips. When it comes to the most advanced semiconductors, ASML is the only company in the world that makes the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines necessary for those cutting-edge chips.\n\nWith that kind of competitive advantage, one would expect ASML to trade for a very rich valuation, and that's usually the case. However, the semiconductor industry's cyclical downtown (AI chips notwithstanding) combined with the geopolitical restrictions on where advanced semiconductors can be sold have cast more uncertainty over the business than is typical. This has led to ASML trading for almost the same discount to its five-year mean P/E ratio as Adobe.\n\nASML PE Ratio data by YCharts\n\nASML's management believes the challenges it is facing will last into 2025 before any recovery is seen. While that could mean further stock dips, ASML's discount right now presents a compelling buying opportunity for a company that will be at the center of one of the most important industries for years to come.\n\nASML expects overall semiconductor sales to grow at a 9% compound annual growth rate between 2025 and 2030, providing some insight into the demand that is waiting on the other side of this cyclical downturn. Perhaps more importantly, the company believes that semiconductor sales for servers, data centers, and storage will be twice that of overall sales.\n\nThis should mean there will be continuing demand for ASML's most advanced EUV machines, as this is where the AI spending should be concentrated.",

On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Nvidia stock has seen prices increase by 178.80% \u2014 and plenty of politicians, including Nancy Pelosi, have made investments in the GPU maker.\n\nNVDA stock price YTD chart. Source: Finbold\n\nThe AI model highlighted strong demand from data centers, Nvidia\u2019s expanding software ecosystem, and strategic partnerships with cloud giants as catalysts for growth in 2025. Additionally, ChatGPT noted that Nvidia\u2019s dealings in autonomous vehicles and robotics could serve to significantly expand its TAM (total addressable market) in the future.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s reasoning for including NVDA stock in its portfolio. Source: OpenAI\n\nWhile Nvidia\u2019s upward trajectory has slowed down as of late, and the stock experienced a pullback in December of 2024, this latest development only serves to provide a more attractive price for a long position \u2014 provided that investors have the necessary tolerance for risk.\n\nExxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM)\n\nExxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) is the largest publicly traded oil company in the world. Oil and gas demand has proven to be unexpectedly robust in spite of the energy transition \u2014 and Exxon\u2019s robust financial performance, extensive stock buyback program, and high dividends have managed to attract the attention of investors.\n\nOn a YTD basis, Exxon Mobil stock has seen prices increase by 11.18%. At the time of writing, the stock was trading at a significant discount, with a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of just 13.4.\n\nXOM stock price YTD chart. Source: Finbold\n\nRepresentative GPT would opt to invest in XOM shares due to steady global demand for oil and Exxon\u2019s recent investments in low-cost, high-output fields. In addition, the company\u2019s pivot to carbon capture technologies was singled out as a potential long-term boon.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s reasoning for including XOM stock in its portfolio. Source: OpenAI\n\nASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML)\n\nFinally, Representative GPT selected ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ: ASML) as the last part of its portfolio. This Dutch semiconductor company is quite unique \u2014 it isn\u2019t engaged in the production or design of chips \u2014 rather, ASML makes the equipment that is necessary to produce chips.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate how crucial ASML is for the wider semiconductor supply chain. The business maintains a monopoly on advanced lithography equipment \u2014 without ASML, most of the wider industry would grind to a halt.\n\nIn spite of that fact, the price of ASML stock has dropped by 3.33% over the course of 2024.

            "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a growing industry worth your investment dollars. One way to invest in this sector is to buy shares in businesses playing an essential role in the AI market. Two such companies are Applied Materials (AMAT 1.41%) and ASML (ASML 1.91%). Both supply machines to manufacture the microchips that make AI possible and are two of the world's biggest providers of this semiconductor equipment.\n\nASML specializes in lithography machines, which apply the blueprint of a microchip onto a silicon wafer. Applied Materials is known for the tools used in other steps of the microchip manufacturing process, such as metrology and inspection systems to ensure chips are defect-free.\n\nBoth play crucial roles in the AI ecosystem, but if you had to choose between them, which one is the superior AI stock?\n\nThe pros and cons of Applied Materials\n\nApplied Materials management sees tremendous long-term business opportunities thanks to the secular trends involving semiconductor components. Many markets now rely on semiconductors, including electric vehicles (EVs), robotics, solar and other renewable energy, and AI.\n\nThe company's products are poised to remain in demand for years as the equipment evolves to meet increasingly complex needs. For example, semiconductor manufacturers are starting to adopt Gate-All-Around (GAA) manufacturing technology to construct microchip transistors.\n\nThe Fin Field-Effect transistor architecture is widely used today, but GAA is the evolution of this approach. It's aimed at improving the performance, power efficiency, and density of transistors.\n\nApplied Materials generated $2.5 billion in revenue from GAA in its 2024 fiscal year, ended Oct. 27, and expects to double that in fiscal 2025. Overall, the company's sales grew 2% year over year in fiscal 2024 to $27.2 billion, the fifth consecutive year of revenue growth.\n\nHowever, a Morgan Stanley analyst downgraded the company's stock in December, expecting weak demand to weigh on the company's 2025 revenue. One factor involves U.S. government restrictions on semiconductor-related sales to China.\n\nChina is one of the company's most important markets. But for now, Applied Materials expects fiscal Q1 sales to reach around $7.2 billion, an increase from the prior-year's $6.7 billion.\n\nA look at ASML\n\nASML is not only a major supplier of lithography equipment to the semiconductor industry, but it's also the only company in the world today to sell the most advanced lithography technology, called extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. EUV machines are the sole means of manufacturing the most advanced microchips, ones that can produce powerful yet energy-efficient AI.\n\nThis gives ASML a competitive advantage. Even so, its stock price declined after announcing third-quarter results on Oct. 15. The company's Q3 revenue was $7.5 billion, up 20% from 2023's $6.2 billion, which is excellent growth. However, ASML management delivered a disappointing outlook.\n\nThe company expects to finish fiscal 2024 with 28 billion euros in revenue, a small increase over 2023's 27.6 billion euros. The macroeconomic factors weighing on Applied Materials is also impacting ASML.\n\nMoreover, management estimates the current weak demand in the semiconductor industry, outside of AI, will extend into 2025. CEO \u200b\u200bChristophe Fouquet stated, \"[O]ther market segments are taking longer to recover.\" This dour outlook contributed to ASML's shares being down about 6% in 2024.\n\nHowever, the company's near monopoly in lithography machines positions it to succeed over the long run once the semiconductor market rebounds from its current softness. After all, the semiconductor sector is a cyclical industry, so a downturn eventually is followed by an upswing.\n\nASML's sales to the China market are expected to be around 20% of total revenue in 2025, which is the company's historical trend. Over the long term, ASML predicts it will hit between 44 billion euros to 60 billion euros by 2030.\n\nChoosing between ASML and Applied Materials\n\nWhile current macroeconomic factors are a short-term headwind for Applied Materials and ASML, over the long run both are poised to benefit from years of growth in demand from the AI, EV, and other industries reliant on semiconductors. Therefore, it's ideal to invest in both companies.\n\nBut if I had to choose one, Applied Materials is the better AI investment. The tie-breaker comes down to stock valuation. To assess this, here's a look at each company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, a widely used metric that tells you how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar's worth of earnings.\n\nThe chart shows that Applied Materials and ASML have seen a drop in their P/E ratios from earlier in the year. However, the former's P/E multiple is considerably lower than ASML's at the time of this writing. This suggests that Applied Materials shares are the better value.\n\nIts stock valuation, combined with the long-term secular trends that can offset a potential decline in sales to China, make now a good time to pick up Applied Materials stock.",

            "content": "BOISE, Idaho\u2014Brienna Hall has the most valuable role that you\u2019ll never see at the most vital company that you\u2019ve never heard of.\n\nUntil she began working at ASML last year, she didn\u2019t know the first thing about the company. She also didn\u2019t know what she would be doing as a customer-support engineer\u2014a \u201cfancy mechanic,\u201d as she calls herself.\n\nAnd she had absolutely no idea that it would be essential to the global economy.\n\nWhen she reports for her shift at a chip plant, Hall slips into a bunny suit. She enters a room where the pristine air is 100 times cleaner than a hospital operating room\u2019s. Then she makes her way over to an unfathomably complex machine.\n\nHer job is to know everything about it\u2014so that she can fix it.\n\n\u201cI thought I had the coolest job ever,\u201d Hall says. \u201cI didn\u2019t process the fact that this job is necessary for our entire world to exist as it does.\u201d\n\nThe piece of equipment that the entire world has come to rely on\u2014and she is specially trained to handle\u2014is called an extreme ultraviolet lithography machine.\n\nIt\u2019s the machine that produces the most advanced microchips on the planet. It was built with scientific technologies that sound more like science fiction\u2014breakthroughs so improbable that they were once dismissed as impossible. And it has transformed wafers of silicon into the engines of modern life.\n\nEven today, there are only a few hundred of these EUV machines in existence\u2014and they are ludicrously expensive. The one that Hall maintains cost $170 million, while the latest models sell for roughly $370 million.\n\nBut maybe the most remarkable thing about these invaluable machines is that they\u2019re all made by the same company: ASML.\n\nASML is the glue holding the chip business together. That\u2019s because this one Dutch company is responsible for all of the EUV lithography systems that help make the chips in so many of your devices. Like your phone. And your computer. And your tablet. And your TV. Maybe even your car, too.\n\nThese machines have become indispensable. And they depend on the invisible work of Brienna Hall.\n\nShe\u2019s one of the engineers assigned to the fabrication plants\u2014or fabs\u2014where ASML customers manufacture their semiconductors. Hall is based here in Boise, the headquarters of Micron Technology , where I hopped into a bunny suit of my own and followed her inside the chip fab.\n\nThen I got a rare, behind-the-scenes peek at what might just be the most important machine ever made.\n\nGoing to extremes\n\nEUV machines aren\u2019t so much a marvel as they are a miracle.\n\nTheir origin story begins 40 years ago in a leaky shed in the Netherlands with the birth of Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography\u2014now simply ASML . Back then, printing chips with extreme ultraviolet light was a fantastical idea. Making it a reality would require more time and money than the visionaries who dreamed up this magical technology could have possibly foreseen.\n\nIt\u2019s a process that involves vaporizing droplets of molten tin and producing light that doesn\u2019t occur naturally on Earth.\n\nOr at least that\u2019s the simplest way to understand the the extremely intricate science of extreme ultraviolet lithography.\n\nThe droplets get zapped by twin laser pulses\u2014explosions that happen 50,000 times a second. The first pulse flattens them. The second one obliterates them into a plasma that emits the EUV light. That light is then collected using the smoothest mirrors ever invented and directed toward the silicon wafer to etch billions of microscopic transistor patterns.\n\nThe existential question of the semiconductor industry is how to pack more and more of those transistors on chips to make them faster and faster. The answer: shorter and shorter wavelengths of light. ASML\u2019s first lithography tools created light at wavelengths of 436 nanometers. The current machines have shrunk that number to 13.5 nanometers. That allows them to fabricate chips at resolutions 10,000 times finer than human hair.\n\nThe more I heard about extreme ultraviolet lithography, the more extraordinary it sounded that anyone ever figured it out.\n\nAnd there are two things I learned about the EUV tool I saw that I can\u2019t get out of my head:\n\nIt took decades for these absurdly sophisticated machines to make their way from labs to fabs. And until recently, it wasn\u2019t clear if the company\u2019s audacious bet on EUV lithography would ever pay off. In 2012, ASML was strapped for cash and sold a 23% equity stake to Intel, Samsung Electronics and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , which meant its biggest customers were literally invested in the company\u2019s success.\n\nASML soon ramped up production\u2014very, very slowly. The company delivered the first EUV system in 2010. Not until 2020 did it deliver the 100th. And last year was a busy one: ASML shipped a total of 42 EUV machines.\n\nThere are still only six companies that own these machines for chip manufacturing. But many others indirectly depend on ASML\u2014including the most valuable companies in history.\n\nApple and Nvidia both design their own chips and outsource production to the fabs of TSMC , which means ASML\u2019s tech is pivotal for making everything from AI data centers to iPhones.\n\nEUV machines have become so crucial that the company now employs an army of 10,000 customer-support employees to keep them humming.\n\n\u201cThey are the front-line troops of ASML,\u201d said Jim Koonmen, the company\u2019s chief customer officer.\n\nASML\u2019s clients expect their lithography tools to be operating day and night, but disruptions are inevitable and unpredictable, as Dutch journalist Marc Hijink writes in \u201cFocus,\u201d his book about the company.\n\nTSMC worries about earthquakes. Intel once traced a lithography issue back to another kind of rumble\u2014a shift in wind patterns that was carrying over methane gas from nearby dairy farms.\n\n\u201cCow farts,\u201d Hijink wrote.\n\nBovine flatulence aside, malfunctions are rare. But the EUV machine is the bottleneck of every fab. The entire factory gets backed up if it goes down\u2014which is why ASML employs people around the clock all over the world.\n\nPeople like Brienna Hall.\n\nThe education of a fancy mechanic\n\nLong before she ever heard of ASML, there were signs that she would fit right in.\n\nHall, 29, grew up in Seattle as a Girl Scout obsessed with tying the perfect knot. She was president of the Edmonds College rocketry club when she got her associate degree. At Washington State University, she majored in materials science and engineering\u2014and transcribed notes for a professor writing a textbook on quantum mechanics. She loves planning camping trips even though she doesn\u2019t actually like camping. In her spare time, she works with her hands, quilting and piecing together elaborate Ravensburger jigsaw puzzles.\n\nAll of which turned out to be excellent preparation for navigating a machine with more than 100,000 parts.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always problem-solving,\u201d said Alex Jordan, another ASML engineer. \u201cHow can I be more efficient? Where can I optimize this ? And what if we tried that ?\u201d\n\nWhen the company recruits for customer-support positions, ASML looks for diligent, disciplined and detail-oriented engineers. Hall had the right kind of technical mind and temperament for the job. When one of her professors heard that a semiconductor company was hiring, Hall passed along her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and soon received emails from ASML asking her to apply.\n\nMost college students know nothing about ASML. In fact, they probably know more about ASMR .\n\nHall was intrigued when her interviewer asked how she felt working in tight spaces and bunny suits. Then she found out the entry-level job included extensive travel. That was all she needed to hear to accept the offer from ASML. \u201cI always wanted to travel,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019d barely been down the West Coast.\u201d\n\nHer first long trip was a month in Taiwan for her Fab Ready 1 course at ASML\u2019s training center, where she familiarized herself with the EUV machine\u2019s parts: the scanner (the part with the mirrors that focus the light onto the wafer), the source (the part that generates the light) and the drive laser (the part with the lasers).\n\nShe also learned that each part has its own personality. At the Micron fab, the scanner is called Monica\u2014as in the \u201cFriends\u201d character.\n\n\u201cBecause everything must be perfect,\u201d Hall says. \u201cThe conditions must be just so for her to function.\u201d\n\nShe came to know Monica when she returned to Boise for on-the-job training. Meanwhile, she developed her expertise through months of Fab Ready 2 classes in Taiwan, San Diego and Germany, where she made a pilgrimage to the puzzle mecca of Ravensburg.\n\nShe apprenticed for nearly a full year before she was cleared to work on the EUV machine by herself. When she\u2019s not on different continents, Hall is stationed in the ASML office a short drive from Micron\u2019s campus. She works in 12-hour shifts, from 6 a.m. till 6 p.m. In the winter, she comes to work long before sunrise and leaves well after sunset.\n\nSome days, she goes straight to the fab. Other days, she\u2019s at her desk, looking at numbers on her multiple screens until \u201cI\u2019m sure the machine isn\u2019t going to self-combust,\u201d she says. At that point, Hall shifts her attention to planning the series of actions she will perform during the \u201cscheduled down,\u201d a routine outage for preventive maintenance to minimize the risk of an \u201cunscheduled down.\u201d\n\nAfter all, the only thing more satisfying than fixing a machine is having a machine that doesn\u2019t need to be fixed.\n\nBut any kind of work on the machine is what she considers fun. It\u2019s dealing with other people that she finds stressful.\n\n\u201cOur machine is complex enough that it has a personality, but it\u2019s still a machine. If you hit the right buttons, she will come up. You just have to figure out what buttons to press. I can solve that. We can solve that,\u201d Hall said. \u201cHumans are vastly more complex than any machine that I know of.\u201d\n\nFab life\n\nNearly a half-century ago, when four entrepreneurs in Boise founded Micron in the basement of a dentist\u2019s office, one of their investors was a local potato baron. In Idaho, it turns out even the microchips come from potatoes.\n\nThese days, Micron is building a $15 billion fab here to bring leading-edge memory manufacturing back to U.S. soil. The factory under construction will be the size of 10 football fields. Its foundation required four times the amount of concrete as the Empire State Building .\n\nAnd next to the dozens of massive cranes on Micron\u2019s campus is the company\u2019s existing research fab.\n\nInside is a machine that weighs more than 300,000 pounds and was chauffeured from the Netherlands on three 747 cargo planes.\n\nBrienna Hall never goes more than a few days of work without going into the fab to see that EUV machine.\n\n\u201cBy then I get itchy,\u201d she said, \u201cand I make a reason to go in.\u201d\n\nSo we did.\n\nWhenever she goes into the cleanroom, she covers herself from head to toe, since even a speck of dust can have disastrous consequences. She also makes sure she won\u2019t have to go to the bathroom. \u201cI\u2019ll space out and limit my sips of water\u2014and I won\u2019t drink coffee,\u201d she says.\n\nUnder the dim yellow lights, it\u2019s hot and loud and disorienting. But not to her. When she\u2019s in the fab, she\u2019s often in a flow state.\n\nHall talks about troubleshooting an EUV machine the way Stephen Curry talks about shooting a basketball.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m on the tool and fixing a problem, it\u2019s like everything else goes quiet\u2014and I\u2019m just focused on getting that one thing done,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing better than just zeroing in on that problem until it\u2019s solved.\u201d\n\nThe machine had been taken out of production mode by the time we entered the bottom level of the fab.\n\nWe had two hours\u2014and the clock was ticking.\n\nShe glanced at her laptop to review the details of this service plan. Then we proceeded through a maze until Hall stopped, removed the door of a cabinet and squeezed inside the machine. While she was fiddling with a tangle of cables in tight quarters, I looked around and noticed the red emergency buttons everywhere. Before I could worry about bumping into one, Hall popped out.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a hose that isn\u2019t doing what it\u2019s supposed to,\u201d she declared.\n\nA blockage in the water line meant the hose wasn\u2019t cooling properly\u2014and now it was having some heat issues. When she touched the hose, Hall could feel a minor distortion. Which had the potential to be a major problem. Even this barely perceptible warpage could bring the whole machine down if the hose burst. That rupture would activate the leak sensor and trigger an immediate stop\u2014the equivalent of smashing one of those red emergency buttons.\n\nASML\u2019s engineers knew this circuit was under strain and had a plan to address it during the next scheduled down. But that was still three weeks away.\n\nThey could wait until then. Or she could just solve the problem now.\n\nHall laid out the situation to a Micron official and he authorized her to proceed with the repair on the spot.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when she reached for two Home Depot buckets.\n\nShe needed the orange pails that cost $3.98 at the hardware store before she could fix a machine that sells for a few hundred million dollars. To swap out the hose without spraying water everywhere, Hall drained the water line until both tubs were almost full. She carefully replaced the Teflon hose, attached thermal sensors for monitoring and shut the door behind her.\n\nIt was time for the machines to get back to work.\n\n\u201cFrom an engineering perspective, it\u2019s a little dull,\u201d Hall said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve learned to take pride in the fact that my machines are staying up and producing for our customers.\u201d\n\nShe had done exactly what she was supposed to do in exactly the way she was supposed to do it.\n\nAnd nobody in the world outside would ever know.",

By the way, only 5% of global ocean was explored today.\n\n\ud83e\udd91 Customers\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Market and Sector Analysis\n\n\ud83d\udedc Major Trends (Mega Trends)\n\nAre there mega-trends supporting the company?\n\nSurging Offshore Renewable Energy\n\nThe shift to clean energy is driving exponential growth in offshore wind farms and other marine-based renewables. Global offshore wind capacity is projected to expand at a CAGR of 16.2% through 2030, fueling demand for advanced underwater robotics and sonar solutions for inspection, maintenance, and data analysis\u2014key areas where Kraken Robotics excels.\n\nIncreasing Subsea Defense Expenditures\n\nGovernments worldwide are boosting their maritime defense budgets, with the undersea warfare market anticipated to reach USD $40+ billion by 2027. Kraken\u2019s cutting-edge sonar and robotics platforms enable naval forces to tackle underwater surveillance, mine detection, and strategic reconnaissance, positioning the company favorably amid rising defense allocations.\n\nRise in Marine Data & Exploration\n\nAs climate change and resource exploration become ever more critical, the need for robust ocean mapping and data acquisition grows. The global subsea survey market is set to grow at a CAGR of 8.5% over the next five years. Kraken\u2019s advanced sensors and autonomous vehicles are well-suited to capture and analyze valuable seabed and environmental data for scientific, commercial, and regulatory purposes.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Market and Trends\n\nIs the market structurally growing?\n\nMarine Robotics Market\n\nThe global marine robotics market is projected to reach USD $7.8 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of ~12.7%. With its advanced underwater robotics and sonar solutions, Kraken Robotics is poised to tap into this expanding demand for autonomous subsea systems.\n\nAutonomous Subsea Vehicles\n\nThe global market for autonomous subsea vehicles is projected to reach USD $3.2 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of around 15.4%. This robust expansion is largely fueled by the rising demand for offshore wind farm development, increased defense expenditure on undersea warfare capabilities, and a growing need for comprehensive ocean mapping. As industries worldwide seek high-resolution data from beneath the waves, the adoption of AUVs continues to accelerate, positioning this market segment for strong, sustained growth.\n\n\ud83e\uddff The x5 Scenario, In My Opinion\n\nHear me out\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s dive deeper into why Kraken Robotics could be a game-changing investment.\n\nWhat makes them stand out isn\u2019t just their cutting-edge technology, but their timing. They\u2019ve positioned themselves perfectly in markets that are heating up\u2014offshore renewable energy, undersea defense, and deep-sea exploration. As global demand for more robust subsea operations grows, Kraken isn\u2019t just playing catch-up; they\u2019re providing next-generation robotics and sonar systems that can handle the deepest, toughest environments. It\u2019s not just about making cool machines; it\u2019s about enabling an entirely new wave of ocean-based innovation.\n\nThey are the right guys, at the right place, at the right time.\n\nNow let\u2019s talk market trends (we just did but anyway, after all, it\u2019s my newsletter). Offshore wind is booming, with capacity projected to grow at a 16.2% CAGR through 2030. Defense expenditures on undersea warfare could top USD $40 billion by 2027. And the global marine robotics market itself is expected to hit around USD $7.8 billion by 2030, rising at 12.7% annually. Kraken is uniquely positioned to supply the critical hardware, software, and data services these sectors need.\n\nHere\u2019s another point worth emphasizing: recurring revenue\u2014the holy grail for any tech-driven business. Kraken is steadily transitioning toward service-based offerings, like its data-as-a-service and long-term support contracts, which provide predictable, high-margin income. Their solutions are often mission-critical, meaning once a client integrates Kraken\u2019s tech into their operations, the switching costs become massive. That\u2019s a recipe for both stability and scalability! The golden combinaison of the investor!\n\nThen there\u2019s their global footprint. Sure, they\u2019re headquartered in St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland, but they\u2019re not tied to one region. Seas are big, and deep, you know. They\u2019ve built relationships in North America and Europe, and are steadily branching into markets where subsea activities\u2014offshore wind, mineral exploration, coastal defense\u2014are set to skyrocket. They\u2019ve also recently raised CAD $51.75 million, providing them with the war chest to ramp up production capacity, pursue strategic acquisitions, and keep fueling R&D.\n\nLet\u2019s not overlook financial discipline either. Growth is great, but profitable growth is even better. Kraken\u2019s revenue reached CAD $52.4 million in FY 2023 (an 18% YoY jump), and they carry a CAD $74 million order backlog. That kind of performance gives them the freedom to invest in game-changing innovations and capture even more market share\u2014all without needing to sacrifice margins.\n\nThe best part? \ud83e\udd91 Despite all these strengths, they\u2019re still somewhat under the radar. They don\u2019t yet have the name recognition of the bigger aerospace or defense giants, but that\u2019s where the opportunity lies. As more investors catch on to the perfect storm of market trends\u2014offshore wind, subsea defense, and environmental monitoring\u2014Kraken Robotics could become a must-have stock for anyone eyeing long-term, ocean-centric growth. If they execute well, seeing their value double\u2014or even hit a 5x\u2014in the next few years isn\u2019t just a wild dream; it\u2019s a real possibility.\n\nIt\u2019s rare to find a company that combines next-level tech, profitable growth, and impeccable market timing as effectively as Kraken does. It feels like one of those gems you\u2019d wish you had discovered sooner.\n\nBuilding upon recent momentum, it\u2019s noteworthy that Kraken\u2019s share price was around CAD $1.60 during their latest funding round, after already soaring more than 215% since October 2023. With substantial new capital on hand and a swelling order backlog, I wouldn\u2019t be shocked to see them cross CAD $3.20 (a 2x from here) or even CAD $8.00 (a 5x scenario). Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t be that surprised.\n\nFrom Betakit\n\n\ud83e\uddea Strategy and Innovation\n\nKraken Robotics has strategically honed its focus on advanced underwater robotics, sonar systems, and subsea data solutions, allowing the company to deliver cutting-edge technology tailored to the specific needs of industries such as defense, offshore energy, and environmental research. A pivotal move in this strategy was the acquisition of PanGeo Subsea, which expanded Kraken's portfolio to include comprehensive subsea services that provide precise data and actionable insights.\n\nThis targeted approach has enabled Kraken to establish itself as a leader in subsea innovation, with its Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) technology delivering high-resolution imaging crucial for applications like mine detection and seabed mapping. Additionally, their Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) enhance efficiency and reliability in underwater exploration and infrastructure inspections.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Future Projects\n\nLooking ahead, Kraken remains committed to staying at the forefront of marine technology. The company is actively developing AI-driven data analytics to provide clients with real-time insights into complex subsea environments. A recent CAD $51.75 million funding round will enable Kraken to scale production, pursue further acquisitions, and continue investing in groundbreaking technologies.\n\n\u201cAt Kraken Robotics, we are redefining what\u2019s possible in the subsea world,\u201d said Karl Kenny, CEO of Kraken Robotics. \u201cOur mission is to deliver innovative, scalable solutions that empower our partners to explore, protect, and harness the potential of our oceans responsibly.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Key Financial Metrics\n\n\u265f\ufe0f Strategic Analysis\n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Strengths\n\nKraken Robotics is a leader in underwater robotics and sonar systems, known for its innovative Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) technology, which delivers unparalleled high-resolution imaging for seabed surveys. This innovation has set them apart as a go-to provider for defense, offshore energy, and environmental applications. Kraken\u2019s diverse product portfolio includes offerings such as AquaPix\u00ae MINSAS sensors, KATFISH\u2122 systems, and SeaPower\u2122 subsea battery systems, allowing them to cater to a wide range of subsea operational needs. Strategic acquisitions, like that of PanGeo Subsea, have expanded their capabilities into 3D acoustic imaging and geophysical surveys, making their service offerings comprehensive. Financially, Kraken has demonstrated robust growth, with revenues reaching $69.6 million in 2023, a remarkable 70% increase from the previous year.\n\n\u26d3\ufe0f Weaknesses\n\nDespite its strengths, Kraken faces some challenges. The company operates at relatively high valuation multiples, with P/E ratios of 58.11 and 37.36 for the current and next fiscal years, respectively, which could concern value-focused investors. Additionally, Kraken's market penetration remains limited compared to larger, more established competitors like Teledyne Technologies or Saab AB. As a smaller company, Kraken may also have fewer resources to allocate toward research and development, potentially impacting its ability to innovate at the same pace as industry giants.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Opportunities\n\nKraken is well-positioned to capitalize on several high-growth opportunities. The global demand for Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) is rising sharply, driven by increasing adoption in both military and commercial sectors. Their ongoing expansion into high-growth regions like the Asia-Pacific presents untapped market potential, particularly in subsea defense and renewable energy projects. Additionally, Kraken\u2019s commitment to advancing underwater robotics and sensor technology allows them to stay ahead in delivering unique, cutting-edge solutions to meet the evolving needs of their clients.\n\n\ud83d\udde1\ufe0f Threats\n\nThe marine technology industry is highly competitive, with major players like Teledyne Technologies and Saab AB commanding significant market share. This intense competition poses a constant challenge for Kraken to maintain its market position. Regulatory complexities across different jurisdictions also add layers of operational risks, particularly in defense contracts and offshore projects. Lastly, fluctuations in global defense and commercial spending can create uncertainties in demand, potentially impacting Kraken\u2019s growth trajectory in the short term.\n\nIn conclusion, Kraken Robotics combines innovative technology and strategic initiatives to carve out a unique position in the marine technology sector. However, navigating resource constraints and competitive pressures will be critical as they aim to sustain their impressive growth and capitalize on expanding global opportunities.\n\nFrom Kraken\u2019s Instagram\n\n\ud83e\uddff Conclusion\n\nSummary of Key Points\n\nKraken Robotics is a high-risk, high-reward play in the fast-evolving subsea robotics industry. With cutting-edge technology like Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Kraken is addressing critical needs in high-demand sectors such as defense, offshore renewable energy, and deep-sea exploration. The company\u2019s CAD $51.75 million funding round and strategic acquisitions, like PanGeo Subsea, show a clear focus on scaling operations and enhancing capabilities. With 18% CAGR revenue growth in FY 2023 and a CAD $74 million order backlog, the company is growing fast, even as profitability remains on the horizon.\n\nWhat sets Kraken apart is its identity as a young, highly innovative company operating in a niche that demands extreme technological specialization. They\u2019ve positioned themselves in high-margin, mission-critical sectors, combining their expertise in underwater robotics and sensors to solve complex problems. This specialization makes Kraken a unique player in industries that are both rapidly expanding and incredibly lucrative.\n\nThat said, the risks are real. As a smaller company, Kraken faces stiff competition from giants like Teledyne Technologies and Saab AB, who have deeper pockets and greater market penetration. Add to that the challenges of competing in cyclical markets like defense and renewable energy, and Kraken\u2019s path forward is anything but guaranteed. But their commitment to innovation and focus on niche markets could be the key to outmaneuvering larger rivals.\n\nMy Investment Thesis\n\n\ud83c\udfe6 This is not investment advice:\n\n\ud83d\udfe3 High Risk, High Reward\n\nKraken Robotics is the kind of investment that isn\u2019t for everyone\u2014it\u2019s bold, speculative, and not without its share of challenges. But it\u2019s also a company with enormous potential, operating at the intersection of mega-trends like renewable energy, subsea defense, and environmental monitoring. With significant room to grow and a clear focus on innovation, Kraken could deliver outsized returns if they execute their strategy well.\n\nBottom Line? Kraken Robotics is a Canadian Hidden Market Gem with the potential to redefine the subsea robotics industry. It\u2019s not a \u201csafe bet\u201d by any means, but for those willing to take on some risk, Kraken offers a rare opportunity to invest in a company at the cutting edge of innovation. If they succeed, the payoff could be huge.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3 : High Risk, High Reward\n\n\ud83d\udd35 : Strong confidence\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 : Good confidence\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 : Watchlist\n\n\ud83d\udfe0 : Mixed Review\n\n\ud83d\udd34 : Red flag\n\nThis newsletter and its articles are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial advice or investment recommendations.

The Federal Reserve is making moves to curb high inflation rates, and many financial experts concur that an economic downturn could be on the horizon.\n\nUnsurprisingly, these developments have affected the market. Notable indices like the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq composite have experienced significant downturns.\n\nIn situations like this, it can be daunting to determine which stocks to invest in, if at all. Yet, even in an environment that feels like navigating through turbulent waters, there are promising opportunities to seize.\n\nTop 10 Stocks to Invest In Now\n\nWhen the bears take hold of the market, it\u2019s easy to second-guess your investment decisions and difficult to find anything you\u2019d be interested in piling your money into. However, no matter how red the market is, there\u2019s always a glimmer of green.\n\nWhere are those glimmers now?\n\nThe top stocks to buy now are large companies with a massive economic moat \u2014 a competitive advantage that keeps competitors from chipping away at them. Many of these are non-cyclical plays that offer strong dividends.\n\nAnd there are a few cyclical gems that risk-tolerant investors may want to dive into for a discount on gains that seem all but guaranteed in the future.\n\nHere are some ideas for the best stocks to consider buying right now. There\u2019s a little something for every kind of investor.\n\nMotley Fool Stock Advisor Do you want to learn about potential investments before they break out? Check out our best stock picking services, including The Motley Fool Stock Advisor. Get Started\n\n1. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN)\n\nBest for Risk-Tolerant Investors\n\nTech stocks like Amazon are likely the last pick you\u2019d expect to find on this list. The company operates in a highly cyclical industry and has given up about a third of its value this year alone.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that some AMZN investors are frustrated beyond words at this point, but that\u2019s often the best time to buy.\n\nAmazon is an e-commerce giant with a clear ability to weather economic storms. The company\u2019s share price didn\u2019t even flinch in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, likely because it benefited greatly from stay-at-home orders and store closures.\n\nThat\u2019s not the first crisis the company has faced. Although it had its ups and downs, the company\u2019s strong fundamentals carried it through the dot-com bubble burst and the Great Recession. And though the stock may be trading down at the moment, that trend isn\u2019t likely to last forever.\n\nIf history is any indication, the company will be sailing toward all-time highs again in no time flat.\n\nThe company also has the potential to bounce back to greatness as fears settle. Throughout the majority of its existence, Amazon has focused on razor-slim margins in the e-commerce space.\n\nHowever, its newer Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing offering is anything but a thin-margin offering. Margins on the AWS business are so big that they\u2019re pushing the company\u2019s average margins to the roof.\n\nAll told Amazon does face some economy-related headwinds ahead, but it\u2019s nothing the company hasn\u2019t already proven to be perfectly capable of handling.\n\nIf you\u2019re risk-tolerant enough to hold on through what may be a short-term rough patch and wise enough to dollar-cost average in the bear market, AMZN is a stock that\u2019s worth your consideration.\n\nVanguard Cash Plus Account Are you looking for a place to store your cash? With a Vanguard Cash Plus Account, you\u2019ll earn a competitive 4.15% APY and FDIC coverage up to $1.25 million for individual accounts and $2.5 million for joint accounts. Get Started\n\n2. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\n\nBest for Long-Term Growth\n\nAlphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, emerges as the option for investors who want long-term growth and innovation.\n\nWhile not offering a dividend yield, Alphabet compensates with its dominant presence across different tech sectors.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s diverse portfolio is ever-expanding as they have expanded into areas such as artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles with Waymo.\n\nOver the years, GOOGL has stood strong in the market and has continued to rise despite the 2008-2008 recession and the COVID-19 pandemic. This makes GOOGL a solid choice for steady, long-term growth.\n\nBest for Growth Investors\n\nMeta Platforms, formerly Facebook, is a favorite on Wall Street; it\u2019s one of the most commonly found stocks in ETF portfolios. However, the past year has been a tough time. Although that may send most investors running for the hills, it\u2019s actually an opportunity.\n\nMeta is a growth stock by just about any definition. The company has had solid revenue growth for years, and earnings per share (EPS) growth was impressive. Moreover, the stock was known for tremendous price appreciation until the rug was pulled from the tech sector, as inflation concerns set in earlier this year.\n\nSure, there are a few short-term headwinds to consider, including:\n\nWeak E-Commerce Spending. As prices rise and recession fears mount, e-commerce and consumer spending will likely fall, which could weigh on the company\u2019s advertising revenue.\n\nAs prices rise and recession fears mount, e-commerce and consumer spending will likely fall, which could weigh on the company\u2019s advertising revenue. Transition to the Metaverse. Meta recently changed its name from Facebook in an effort to rebrand the company as the center of all things metaverse. This transition may come with some growing pains in the near future.\n\nMeta recently changed its name from Facebook in an effort to rebrand the company as the center of all things metaverse. This transition may come with some growing pains in the near future. Economic Headwinds. Many experts are warning of a potential recession, which could eat into the company\u2019s revenue and profitability in the short term.\n\nEven with these headwinds, Meta offers a unique opportunity to tap into a stock that has historically outperformed the market in a big way but to do so at a steep discount to the current market value.\n\n4. H&R Block Inc (NYSE: HRB)\n\nBest for Value Investors\n\nH&R Block is a household name that offers do-it-yourself tax services as well as full-service tax professionals. It\u2019s also one of the most appealing value stocks on the market.\n\nHRB stock has significant appeal in the current economic times.\n\nAll people eat, sleep, and pay taxes. Increasing interest rates and dwindling consumer spending may have a negative impact on other businesses, but people still have to file their taxes regardless of the state of the economy. HRB\u2019s business model fares well even if a recession were to set in.\n\nWhile other companies are looking for ways to cut costs headed into a recession, HRB is working on revamping its small-business product to increase profitability.\n\nIf that\u2019s not enough for you, the company even provides a nice, thick layer of icing on the cake with a respectable dividend yield.\n\n5. ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ: ASML)\n\nBest for Banking on the Microchip Shortage\n\nASML Holdings enjoys a monopoly on the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines needed to make the tiny patterns you find on microchips. They\u2019re not just aesthetically pleasing, either. The smaller and more complex these patterns, the more data a chip is capable of processing.\n\nEven with a potential recession looming, analysts are forecasting significant growth in earnings through the rest of 2025.\n\nThe bottom line is simple. ASML holds a global monopoly on a tool used to create an in-demand product in a global supply shortage. Its tools are used to create the microchips auto manufacturers, medical device manufacturers, and tech companies can\u2019t seem to get enough of.\n\nNot to mention, recent declines in the stock have brought the share price to a more than reasonable valuation.\n\n6. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nBest for Visionary Investors\n\nPerfect for investors looking to support sustainable energy resources, Tesla Inc. is a captivating option.\n\nWhile not offering a dividend yield, Tesla compensates with its forward-thinking innovations in electric vehicles, renewable energy, and cutting-edge technology. Over the last five years, TSLA has exploded in growth and continues to rise.\n\nAlthough it may experience some volatility, investors in it for the long haul may see great rewards. When you invest with TSLA, you are investing with a future-focused vision in a rapidly evolving industry.\n\n7. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\n\nBest for Risk-Averse Investors\n\nApple Inc. is another tech behemoth to make the list that has a long track record of innovation, stability, and steady stock growth.\n\nAAPL also offers its investors a 0.48% dividend yield, which, while not a high-yield income stock, shows a consistent track record of commitment to its shareholders.\n\nApple\u2019s success is based on its iconic products, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and wearable tech. They continue to expand their reach by introducing services like Apple Music, Apple TV+, and the App Store.\n\nOver the years, Apple Inc. has shown explosive, steady growth, perfect for investors seeking stability.\n\n8. Duke Energy Corp (NYSE: DUK)\n\nBest for Recession-Proofing Your Portfolio\n\nDuke Energy is one of the largest electric utility providers in the United States. The company serves more than 7.7 million retail customers across six states.\n\nThere are three compelling reasons to consider investing in DUK in a bear market:\n\nConsumer Habits. When the economy takes a hit, consumers spend less, but they just about always pay their utility bills. That makes DUK a great investment in a recession.\n\nWhen the economy takes a hit, consumers spend less, but they just about always pay their utility bills.

Stability Over Growth. The company has seen some impressive growth in recent years, but management\u2019s core focus is on the stability of the business, making it a low-volatility play.\n\nTruth be told, there\u2019s not much to say about Duke Energy. It\u2019s not a sexy business; it doesn\u2019t have a ton of growth prospects, and it\u2019s not likely to make you rich any time soon. But what it\u2019s not doing only serves to outline what it is doing.\n\nDuke Energy is continuing its mission to provide its customers with quality, fairly priced services. As it does, it gives its investors stable returns, consistently paid dividends, and an easier time going to bed at night regardless of the state of the economy or broader market.\n\n9. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT)\n\nBest for Tech Enthusiasts\n\nAnother tech stock makes our list and with good reason. Tech stocks may seem risky, but Microsoft\u2019s resilience and adaptability make it a stable choice for the risk-tolerant investor.\n\nFrom gadgets and software to cloud services and gaming consoles, Microsoft positions itself as a tech giant with a proven ability to weather the market. Whether that being the dot-com bubble, the 2008 recession, or the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft has continued to stand tall.\n\n10. NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA)\n\nBest for Growth Investors\n\nA powerhouse in semiconductor technology, NVIDIA Corporation has shown explosive growth in the last eight years.\n\nWhile not much, NVDA offers a dividend yield and compensates for it with its pursuit of innovation in graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence.\n\nNVIDIA has a long track record of innovation, including 3D graphics, the GPU, the NVIDIA RTX\u2122 upgrade to the GPU, and their Omniverse platform.\n\nWhile the stock may be volatile, NVDA is a good choice for investors who like innovation, growth, and dividends.\n\nMethodology\n\nAt the beginning of each quarter, Money Crashers compiles a list of the Best Stocks To Buy Now. These stock picks are based on company stability and market trends.\n\nFor each stock included on the list, we include the current dividend yield, P/E ratio, and current market cap.

            "content": "Chinese tech firms entered a brave new world in 2020 as the US began restricting access to advanced semiconductor technologies. Those limitations have only been strengthened in recent years, forcing local manufactures like SMIC to get creative. Despite some concern that China would quickly work around the restrictions, the head of toolmaker ASML says China's chip industry is stuck 10 to 15 years in the past.\n\nThe most advanced sub-5nm silicon nodes require the latest EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography tools like the one above, but Chinese chipmakers are stuck with DUV (deep ultraviolet) lithography. ASML is the leading manufacturer of these tools, so it was an early target of US trade restrictions.\n\nASML is a Dutch company, but the US government successfully lobbied to have limits imposed on what it could ship to China beginning in 2020. The Netherlands has agreed to further restrictions in recent years, making it difficult for Chinese firms to replace the chipmaking equipment they already have. According to a new interview with ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet, a lack of EUV systems in China all but assures it will struggle to keep up with the West.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"By banning the export of EUV, China will lag 10 to 15 years behind the West,\" Fouquet told Dutch publisher NRC. Until recently, ASML was still permitted to sell DUV systems like the Twinscan NXT:2000i. SMIC has modified these devices to produce 7nm chips, and some reports have claimed 5nm is possible. Huawei, previously at the apex of the international smartphone market, has been forced to make do with SMIC's 7nm chips that hamper performance of otherwise cutting edge devices like the Mate 70.\n\nSMIC chip\n\nCredit: SMIC\n\nWith no political forces in the US interested in loosening restrictions, it's unlikely ASML will be able to export any EUV systems to China. This has led the Chinese government to pursue a domestic version of the technology, but it has a long road ahead. It took ASML 20 years to make the advances that power EUV lithography, and while some of that work is now openly available, Fouquet believes 10 to 15 years is an optimistic estimate for China to catch up to current EUV capabilities. By then, the ASML may have fully transitioned to High-NA EUV lithography.\n\nThe US is still pushing ASML and the Dutch government to further clamp down, halting repairs and maintenance of DUV machinery in China. However, ASML wants to remain in control of its equipment. If it fully abandons the Chinese market, SMIC and others could feel emboldened to reverse engineer ASML tech, and there is some concern that China could begin building its own DUV tools in much less than 10-15 years. That would boost domestic chip production and untether Chinese foundries from a key Western company.",

The Company attributed this to a market that was \u201ctaking longer to recover\u201d and admitted that \u201c[i]t now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected.\u201d On this news, the price of the Company\u2019s stock fell 16%, from a closing price of $872.27 per share on October 14, 2024, to $730.43 per share on October 15, 2024.\n\nThen, during the accompanying earnings call with investors on October 16, 2024, the Company attributed the poor earnings results to \u201ca reflection of the slow recovery in the traditional [semiconductor] end markets as customers remain cautious in the current environment.\u201d The Company also disclosed that the decline in ASML\u2019s sales to China would also negatively impact the Company\u2019s gross margins. On this news, the price of the Company\u2019s stock fell 6.4%, from a closing price of $730.43 per share on October 15, 2024, to $683.52 per share on October 16, 2024.\n\nClick here if you suffered losses: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/asml-holding-nv.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\nIf you invested in ASML you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.\n\nAll representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

We explored ETFs and online resources to compile an initial pool of candidates. From there, we narrowed the list by analyzing hedge fund interest, using data from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q3 2024 database, which tracks the activity of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 64\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), a key player in the semiconductor industry, is deeply involved in nanotechnology advancements. The company specializes in lithographic systems that use light to etch complicated patterns on silicon wafers, a critical step in chip manufacturing. ASML\u2019s groundbreaking contribution lies in its development of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, a state-of-the-art technology that enables the creation of nanometer-scale features on silicon.\n\nThe demand for lithography is anticipated to peak in 2025 but stay robust through 2030, driven by the industry\u2019s shift to Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistor architecture and the gradual rollout of high numerical aperture (high-NA) EUV technology. These advancements are expected to fuel continued demand for ASML\u2019s cutting-edge tools in the years ahead.\n\nOn December 3, BNP Paribas Exane resumed coverage of ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) with an Outperform rating and a price target of \u20ac817. The firm highlighted ASML\u2019s dominant position in the semiconductor market and its strong potential for revenue growth through 2030. BNP Paribas Exane expressed confidence that ASML could reach the upper end of its 2030 guidance, projecting a potential 6% upside to consensus revenue estimates for that year. The firm emphasized ASML\u2019s unique position as a cornerstone of the semiconductor ecosystem, describing it as having the \u201cwidest moat in semiconductors\u201d and calling it the \u201cbrains behind the brains of AI.\u201d\n\nPolen Capital mentioned ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cDuring the period, we added to our ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) position in the face of recent volatility across the semiconductor sector broadly. As readers may recall, we trimmed the position in 4Q 2023 as we expected stagnating business trends to set in during 2024. Stagnation did occur, as did Al hysteria. We now foresee robust growth and believe ASML will see a significant ramp in business trends in 2025 and beyond. ASML\u2019s business backlog and its customers\u2019 persistent development of leading-edge chip sizes drive our expectation of rapid growth for the company in the coming years. In our view, shares trade at a very reasonable valuation for one of the world\u2019s most competitively advantaged growth companies, particularly considering the accelerated growth we expect.\u201d\n\nOverall, ASML ranks 6th on our list of best nanotechnology stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of ASML to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.
