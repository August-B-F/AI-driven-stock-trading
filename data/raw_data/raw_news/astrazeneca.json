CEPI funding of up to US$43.5 million will support AstraZeneca to evaluate an innovative antibody, known as a VHH (Variable Heavy domain of a Heavy chain -only antibody), in a preclinical proof-of-concept study through Phase 1 clinical trials.\n\nThe VHH is designed to target four pandemic influenza virus strains\u2014H1, H3, H5 and H7\u2014capable of attaching to multiple parts of the virus, known as a multi-specific molecule, potentially increasing the chance of protection. The multi-specific VHH will also be engineered to offer long-lasting protection against infection. Once proof-of-concept has been established for an antibody targeting influenza, the technology could potentially be used to tackle a range of future infectious disease outbreaks.\n\nA VHH is part of an antibody, found in animals like camels, llamas and some sharks, that recognises a pathogen and triggers an immune response. Unlike conventional antibodies, which must pair with a light chain to form a complete antibody capable of fighting off a virus, VHHs are able to work on their own. This means VHHs are much smaller and more amenable to being incorporated into multi-specific molecules. As a result, they are easier and cheaper to produce than existing monoclonal antibodies, ultimately making them more accessible.\n\nVHHs are also relatively stable, even in extreme conditions, making them a promising prospect for an outbreak response in areas where transport and storage capabilities are limited.\n\n\u201cVHH antibodies, like monoclonal antibodies, have the potential to be highly potent medical countermeasures capable of providing immediate protection against viral diseases. Monoclonal antibodies are expensive to produce, however, and their cost limits their widespread use for protection against viral diseases,\u201d said Dr Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI. \u201cCEPI\u2019s partnership with AstraZeneca on this potentially ground-breaking VHH project could usher in a new era of more affordable antibody-based interventions, meaning that vulnerable populations could be protected from future epidemic or pandemic threats.\u201d\n\nVHH technology is increasingly being explored to target chronic diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, but this latest CEPI investment is among the first to target an infectious disease and provide protection against four different influenza strains in a single molecule.\n\nLike naturally occurring antibodies or monoclonal antibodies, VHHs work by targeting harmful pathogens and neutralising the foreign invader. Upon binding to the virus, VHHs can prevent the virus from entering the body\u2019s cells. In an outbreak setting, this VHH-based multi-specific antibody could serve as a protective bridge prior to the onset of longer-lasting vaccine-induced immunity. This approach limits the time that vulnerable populations are without protection, helping to swiftly contain viral spread.\n\n\u201cAstraZeneca is pleased to partner with CEPI to develop VHH-based multi-specific antibodies targeting influenza. This collaboration demonstrates AstraZeneca's commitment to addressing the impact of infectious diseases and to pushing the boundaries of science to bring innovative medicines to the patients we serve.\u201d \u2013 Mark Esser, Vice President, Early Vaccines & Immune Therapies R&D, AstraZeneca.\n\nCEPI and AstraZeneca are committed to enabling equitable access to potential outputs of this CEPI-supported programme, in line with CEPI\u2019s Equitable Access Policy. This includes sharing of any commercial benefits arising from CEPI\u2019s funding, a mechanism for CEPI to fund a product for a CEPI Priority Pathogen using the same technology, and a commitment to ensure affordable supply of the product in low- and middle-income countries in the event of an outbreak or increased outbreak preparation need.\n\n\u2014ENDS\u2014\n\nAbout CEPI\n\nCEPI is an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic and civil organisations. Its mission is to accelerate the development of vaccines and other biologic countermeasures against epidemic and pandemic threats so they can be accessible to all people in need. CEPI has supported the development of more than 50 vaccine candidates or platform technologies against multiple known high-risk pathogens or a future Disease X. Central to CEPI\u2019s pandemic-beating five-year plan for 2022-2026 is the \u2018100 Days Mission\u2019 to compress the time taken to develop safe, effective, globally accessible vaccines against new threats to just 100 days.",

Expected to close mid-2025, the deal provides that FibroGen will receive an enterprise value of $85 million plus FibroGen\u2019s net cash held in China at closing, currently estimated to be approximately $75 million. Based in Hong Kong, FibroGen\u2019s subsidiary is pursuing oncology pipeline of medications.\n\n\u201cUpon closing, AstraZeneca will obtain all rights to roxadustat in China,\u201d according to the deal\u2019s press release. \u201cRoxadustat is the category leader in brand value share for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease with a pending regulatory decision for chemotherapy-induced anemia. FibroGen maintains its rights to roxadustat in the U.S. . . .\u201d\n\nSource: Council on Foreign Relations\n\nFibroGen International is based in Hong Kong, which had long served as the commercial hub of the region. China\u2019s Qing Dynasty ceded the island to Britain following the British victory in the First Opium War. Under British colonial control, the island emerged as an international economic center that came to enjoy commercial prosperity alongside democratic government even as mainland China came under control of the Chinese Communist Party following the Chinese Civil War. While mainland China\u2019s economy stagnated and faced mass starvation during the following decades, Hong Kong largely remained an island of prosperity.\n\nUnder the terms of an 1898 treaty, Britain was scheduled to return Hong Kong to Chinese control in 1997. As the handover approached, the British and Chinese governments negotiated a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy, whereby Hong Kong would receive a high degree of autonomy for the next five decades with its own laws, including freedom of speech and press.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Real GDP growth rate\n\nSource: KPMG\n\nHowever, little more than halfway through that 50-year period, the ruling Chinese Communist Party has taken steps to encroach upon Hong Kong\u2019s independence. \u201cIn 2020, Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong. Since then, authorities have arrested dozens of pro-democracy activists, lawmakers, and journalists; curbed voting rights; and limited freedoms of the press and speech,\u201d according to the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIn March 2024, Hong Kong lawmakers passed Article 23, an additional security legislation that further cements China\u2019s rule on the city\u2019s rights and freedom. These moves have not only drawn international condemnation, but have also raised questions about Hong Kong\u2019s status as a global financial hub and dimmed hopes that the city will ever become a full-fledged democracy.\u201d\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index Performance\n\nSource: Financial Times\n\nDuring that time, Hong Kong\u2019s economy has suffered as many multinational firms have left the city or diverted hiring to other regions. In 2021, the number of American companies with regional bases in Hong Kong also fell to an eighteen-year low. AstraZeneca has yet to announce its plan for the Hong Kong-based operations following this acquisition.\n\nAccording to DealPulse\u2019s M&A database, which harnesses both AI and attorneys to digest the granular deal points of publicly-announced transactions, FibroGen is advised by Ropes & Gray LLP and financial adviser BofA Securities, Inc.",

Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.92%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 1.41%.\n\nThe pharmaceutical's shares have seen an increase of 3.03% over the last month, surpassing the Medical sector's gain of 0.21% and the S&P 500's loss of 8.26%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Astrazeneca in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.10, reflecting a 6.8% increase from the same quarter last year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $13.6 billion, showing a 7.3% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.49 per share and a revenue of $57.14 billion, representing changes of +9.25% and +5.67%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Astrazeneca. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.55% downward.

Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 19.17, so one might conclude that Astrazeneca is trading at a discount comparatively.\n\nAlso, we should mention that AZN has a PEG ratio of 1.49. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate.

This can lead to inflammation and more severe symptoms for patients.\n\n\u201cThey can hit the pickleball at the eosinophils and score points,\u201d Gray said. \u201c[This effort] is really about the role of eosinophils in asthma and what Fasenra does for these patients.\u201d\n\nMore specifically, AstraZeneca is targeting patients who have been treating their asthma but struggle to get it under control.\n\nThe drugmaker estimates that about 1.3 million people in the U.S. have severe asthma and about 70% of those people are eosinophilic.\n\nHowever, Gray explained that they\u2019re almost universally unaware that they\u2019re eosinophilic.\n\n\u201cIf people are failing those asthma controller inhalers, that\u2019s when biologics step in,\u201d he said. \u201cDriving that awareness of eosinophilic asthma is a big part of what we\u2019re trying to do. When they find out they have a different kind of asthma and that there\u2019s a medication designed to treat it, a lightbulb goes off.\u201d\n\nImage courtesy AstraZeneca; used with permission.\n\nFasenra is currently approved in eosinophilic asthma and recently won an indication for pediatric patients over the age of six, as well as for eosinophilic granule mitosis with polyangus (EGPA) \u2014 a rare autoimmune disease associated with asthma.\n\nGray said AstraZeneca is currently waiting on data in a COPD trial to expand Fasenra\u2019s label further.\n\nWhile pickleball may be a new medium for advertising for AstraZeneca, the company is far from a stranger when it comes to sports marketing.\n\nThe drugmaker has a long-running partnership with the National Hockey League aimed at boosting cancer screening awareness.\n\nOff the ice, the company paired up with NASCAR in 2021 to market its Breztri Aerosphere inhaler for COPD patients.\n\nIn practice, the Stepping Back Out campaign and its pickleball elements will roll out on social media, including TikTok.\n\nGray some additional assets are likely in the future as the company continues delving into sports marketing and opportunities to inspire patients.\n\n\u201cI think the aspirational \u2014 but not overly aspirational \u2014 fit of a sport [like pickleball] that many can participate in is a good place for us to be,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIt demonstrates what we want to give back with Fasenra, which is that ability to get back into their lives.\u201d",

            "content": "Dublin, March 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Urinary Tract Infection Treatment Market Report by Product Types, Indication, End-Users, Countries and Company Analysis 2025-2033\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nUrinary Tract Infection Treatment Market is expected to reach US$ 11.64 billion in 2033 from US$ 9.13 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 2.74% from 2025 to 2033\n\nAmong the main drivers propelling the market are the increase in female urinary tract infection rates, growing awareness of the advantages of prompt detection, and advancements in healthcare infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary driver of the urinary tract infection (UTI) market's growth is the increased prevalence of UTIs brought on by factors such an aging population, a high rate of diabetes, and rising drug resistance. Furthermore, increased knowledge, better diagnostic methods, and the accessibility of cutting-edge therapies and over-the-counter medications all support market growth. Growth is also being aided by the desire for non-antibiotic medicines like probiotics and herbal remedies. Further driving the market's expansion are technical developments in diagnosis and treatment alternatives as well as expanded access to healthcare in emerging markets.\n\n\n\nGrowth Drivers for the Urinary Tract Infection Treatment Market\n\nGrowth in prevalence of UTI\n\n\n\nIncreased prevalence of urinary tract infections (UTIs) is a major factor propelling market expansion. Because UTIs are more prevalent in women, the elderly, and people with long-term illnesses like diabetes, there is a greater need for therapeutic options. Sexual activity, poor cleanliness, and anomalies of the urinary tract are some of the factors that lead to increased infection rates.\n\nBased on epidemiologic data from a study in the United States, about 1 in 3 women have at least 1 UTI diagnosed by a clinician that requires antibiotic medication, and the lifetime risk of UTIs among women is >60%. The market is expected to rise as a result of increased awareness of UTI symptoms and the value of prompt treatment. The demand for efficient treatments, diagnostics, and prevention strategies is rising as the number of UTI cases worldwide rises, all of which support the growing market for urinary tract infections.\n\n\n\nTechnological Advancement\n\n\n\nUTIs are becoming more widely known, which is a major factor propelling the market. Treatments and preventive strategies are in greater demand as people gain knowledge of UTI symptoms, risk factors, and the significance of early detection. Increased access to healthcare information via digital platforms, educational programs, and public health campaigns have all been instrumental in raising awareness of this issue. This increased awareness motivates people to get medical help when they need it, which fuels an increase in diagnostic procedures and therapies. Additionally, proactive infection prevention and management strategies are fueled by knowledge of UTI consequences, such as kidney damage, which promotes market expansion.\n\n\n\nGrowing Awareness\n\n\n\nUTIs are becoming more widely known, which is a major factor propelling the market. As a result of greater awareness of UTI symptoms, risk factors, and the value of early management, more people are seeking prompt diagnosis and treatment. Prevention and management techniques are now well understood because to public health campaigns and the broad availability of healthcare information via digital platforms. People are becoming more proactive in treating UTIs as awareness of potential complications, like kidney damage, increases. The demand for diagnostic equipment, therapies, and preventative measures is fueled by this increased awareness of UTIs, which propels the global market's growth.\n\n\n\nChallenges in the Urinary Tract Infection Treatment Market\n\nAntibiotic resistance\n\n\n\nThe market for urinary tract infections (UTIs) is significantly hampered by antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic overuse and abuse have resulted in the emergence of resistant bacterial strains, which makes it more difficult to treat UTIs. This resistance raises the possibility of complications, protracted infections, and the requirement for stronger and more costly antibiotics.\n\nHealthcare practitioners are consequently faced with fewer treatment alternatives, which frequently results in prolonged recovery periods and increased healthcare expenses. As multidrug-resistant bacteria proliferate, new treatments, diagnostic techniques, and preventative measures must be developed to tackle the escalating issue of antibiotic resistance in the treatment of urinary tract infections.\n\n\n\nHigh Recurrence of UTI\n\n\n\nIn the market for urinary tract infections (UTIs), high recurrence rates provide a serious obstacle. Recurrent UTIs affect a lot of people, especially women, and need constant care and observation. Antibiotic resistance is exacerbated by the overuse of antibiotics that frequently results from this recurrence. Recurrent infections may also lead to higher medical expenses, discomfort for patients, and a lower standard of living. Healthcare resources are further taxed by the frequent need for diagnostic testing, treatment modifications, and preventative actions. Recurrent UTIs are still difficult to manage and prevent, highlighting the need for longer-term preventive measures, better therapies, and patient education to lower recurrence rates.\n\nCompany Analysis: Overview, Recent Developments, Revenue\n\nAstraZeneca\n\nBayer AG\n\nGlaxoSmithKline PLC\n\nJohnson & Johnson\n\nNovartis AG\n\nPfizer\n\nMerck & Co.

            "content": "A new era of opportunity has arrived for the management of diabetes and its associated complications. These novel strategies can effectively treat the co-occurring conditions of obesity and diabetes. A class of drugs known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists is used to treat obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). By 2030, the GLP-1 market, which is equally driven by obesity and diabetes, is expected to grow to $100 billion. About 9% of Americans, or 30 million people, may be GLP-1 users by this point.\n\nToday, CGM technology incorporates AI. For example, Roche introduced Accu-Chek SmartGuide, a cutting-edge CGM gadget driven by predictive AI. At the launch, Julien Boisdron, Chief Medical Officer for Roche Diabetes Care, called it \u201ca solution more than a CGM.\u201d He described how the system, which consists of two algorithms and a sensor, aids in data visualization and prediction.\n\nThe GlobalData marketed products database shows that there are currently 97 products in the CGM category. Most of these devices are standard CGMs, with only a few being implanted sensors. 133 products are either approved or in the development stage, according to the GlobalData pipeline products database. The research indicates that this market niche is expanding quickly and is a hub for innovative new technologies like implantable CGMs.\n\nOne medical device used to assist manage diabetes, both type 1 and type 2, is the continuous glucose monitor (CGM). The market has grown dramatically in recent years, and it is currently a rapidly expanding category of diabetes care equipment. The demand for advanced diabetes care goods, including insulin pumps, pens, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) equipment, was estimated by GlobalData to be worth $21.8 billion in 2023. GlobalData projects that the market will reach $33.4 billion in revenue by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.34%.\n\nThe WHO estimates that 422 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes, with the majority residing in low- or middle-income countries. On average, diabetes directly contributes to 1.5 million deaths annually. Over the past few decades, there has been a steady rise in both the prevalence and the number of cases of diabetes. Nonetheless, the International Diabetes Federation estimates that 500 million people worldwide presently have diabetes, and that figure is predicted to increase by 25% by 2030 and 51% by 2045.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Best Diabetes Stocks To Buy According to Billionaires . In this article, we are going to take a look at where AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) stands against other best diabetes stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTwelve percent of adult Americans report having taken a GLP-1 drug at some point, according to the most recent KFF Health Tracking poll. In the previous five years, 22% of patients with a diagnosis of obesity or overweight also took GLP-1, while 43% of patients with diabetes had the drug. Adults who have heard \u201ca little\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d about these medications have gone from 70% to 82% over the past year, while those who have heard \u201ca lot\u201d about them have increased from 19% to 32%.\n\nHowever, problems have arisen due to the increased demand for these diabetes and weight-loss medications. An \u201cexplosion in the unlicensed sale of medication online\u201d is a potential threat, according to the National Pharmacy Association (NPA). Semaglutides, which are sold under the brand name Ozempic, help persons with type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar. However, in other countries, like the US, where they are sold under the name Wegovy, they are also commonly used to help people lose weight. NPA chairman Nick Kaye stated:\n\n\u201cPharmacists remain deeply concerned that the current medicine shortages crisis could lead to an explosion in the unlicensed sale of medication online.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list, we selected diabetes-related stocks from the HRTS GLP-1, Obesity, and Cardiometabolic ETF, as well as the EDOC Telemedicine and Digital Health ETF. We then ranked these stocks based on the number of billionaire investors holding stakes in them, as per Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q4 2024, prioritizing those with the highest billionaire ownership.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs AstraZeneca PLC (AZN) The Best Diabetes Stock To Buy According to Billionaires?\n\nA pharmacy worker distributing prescription medicines to patientsreceiving treatment for oncology, cardiovascular, renal, metabolism and respiratory diseases.\n\nAstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN)\n\nNumber of Billionaires: 14\n\nDollar Value of Billionaire Holdings: $2,202,563,718\n\nAstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing prescription medicines across various therapeutic areas, including diabetes.

The company also develops combination therapies to enhance treatment convenience and efficacy, catering to a broad range of patients, from those in early diabetes stages to those with advanced cases and comorbidities.\n\nAstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN)\u2019s Q4 2024 financial results highlight robust growth despite some challenges. Total revenue for the year increased by 21%, driven by strong performances across all therapy areas and geographies, particularly in emerging markets, which grew by 22%. This growth reflects rising demand for the company\u2019s products and effective market penetration.\n\nIn terms of regional performance, China saw a slight decline in Q4 due to lower demand for respiratory products, although it grew by 11% for the year. Emerging markets overall showed strong growth. AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN)\u2019s product sales grew by 19%, with alliance and collaboration revenues increasing by 55% and 54%, respectively, demonstrating strength in its portfolio and successful partnerships. High gross margins of 81.2% indicate strong pricing power and efficient cost management.\n\nThe company continued investing in research and development, with a 19% increase in R&D expenses, ensuring future growth and innovation. Despite an increase in net debt to $24.6 billion, the business\u2019s financial position remains solid, with a consistent dividend payout of $3.10 per share appealing to investors seeking stable returns. As one of the best diabetes stocks, AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) also made strides in diabetes care, with a positive Phase III trial for a new diabetes drug that further solidifies its presence in the market.\n\nOverall, AZN ranks 5th on our list of best diabetes stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of healthcare companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "Thank you. Listen to this article using the player above. \u2716\n\nRead time: 3 minutes\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s IMFINZITM (durvalumab) has received approval in the European Union as a monotherapy for treating adults with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) whose disease has not progressed after platinum-based chemoradiation therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe approval follows the favorable opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and is based on results from the ADRIATIC Phase III trial. The trial results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nSCLC is a rare and highly aggressive lung cancer\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, accounting for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths. The cancer is broadly split into non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and SCLC, with SCLC accounting for 10\u201315% (1\u20135 patients in 10,000 persons) of all lung cancer diagnoses.\n\n\n\n\n\nSCLC is a rare and highly aggressive lung cancer, with LS-SCLC (Stage I-III) accounting for approximately 30% of SCLC diagnoses and is classified when the disease is generally only in one lung or one side of the chest.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe disease can affect anyone, but people who smoke, previously used to smoke or were exposed to second-hand smoke have an increased risk of developing it. SCLC is typically recurring and progresses rapidly despite initial positive responses to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The prognosis of SCLC is particularly poor; only 15\u201330% of patients survive 5 years after diagnosis.\n\nThe ADRIATIC trial\n\nThe ADRIATIC initiative is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center global Phase III clinical trial. It evaluated the effects of IMFINZI monotherapy and IMFINZI plus IMJUDOTM (tremelimumab) treatment versus placebo in 730 LS-SCLC patients whose disease had not progressed following concurrent chemoradiation therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\nPatients were randomized to receive IMFINZI (1,500 mg), IMFINZI (1,500 mg) plus INJUDO (75 mg \u2013 for 4 doses only), or placebo every 4 weeks for up to 24 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is IMFINZI? IMFINZI (durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-L1 protein and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with the PD-1 and CD80 proteins. This action counters the tumor's immune-evading tactics and releases the inhibition of immune responses.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results demonstrated that IMFINZI reduced the risk of death by 27% compared to placebo. Those given IMFINZI had an estimated median overall survival of 55.9 months, while those given the placebo had an average survival length of 33.4 months. After 3 years, approximately 57% of patients treated with IMFINZI were still alive, compared to 48% for those on placebo.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, IMFINZI lowered the risk of disease progression or death by 24% when compared to placebo. The median progression-free survival for IMFINZI was 16.6 months, compared to 9.2 months for placebo. An estimated 46% of patients on IMFINZI had not experienced disease progression after 2 years, in contrast to 34% for placebo.\n\n\n\n\n\nIMFINZI\u2019s safety profile was generally well-managed and consistent with its known characteristics. It is also approved in the US and other countries based on the ADRIATIC trial results and is authorized in combination with chemotherapy for treating extensive-stage SCLC, following the CASPIAN Phase III trial.\n\nA leap forward in cancer immunotherapy for LS-SCLC\n\nThe approval of IMFINZI makes it the first and only immunotherapy in the EU for LS-SCLC, taking a major step forward in advancing immunotherapy treatment for these patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis approval marks a turning point for patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer in Europe, bringing them an immunotherapy option for the first time,\u201d Dr. Suresh Senan, radiation oncologist at the Amsterdam University Medical Centers, The Netherlands, and principal investigator in the trial, said. \u201cAn unprecedented 57% of patients treated with durvalumab were still alive at three years in the ADRIATIC trial. This significant advance establishes a new benchmark in a setting where the standard of care has remained unchanged for decades,\u201d he continued.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIMFINZI has the potential to transform how limited-stage small cell lung cancer is treated as the first immunotherapy approved in Europe in this setting,\u201d said Dave Fredrickson, executive vice president, Oncology Haematology Business Unit at AstraZeneca. \u201cAs the only immunotherapy approved for both early and late-stage disease, Imfinzi is poised to become the foundation for transforming outcomes for people with small cell lung cancer,\u201d he concluded.\n\nReference: Cheng Y, Spigel DR, Cho BC, et al.

            "content": "AstraZeneca capped off a hectic Monday with a deal potentially totaling $1.35 billion with South Korean biotech Alteogen to advance novel subcutaneous therapies for cancer.\n\nThe pact, reported by several news outlets, involves two separate contracts, according to Fierce Pharma, citing a Google-translated filing from Alteogen. The first agreement will see AstraZeneca make a $25 million upfront payment and commit up to $725 million in potential milestones, while AstraZeneca will front $20 million in the second deal, alongside a potential $580 million in future payments.\n\nBioSpace has reached out to both Alteogen and AstraZeneca for independent confirmation of these details and to obtain more information on the overall partnership.\n\nAt the center of Monday\u2019s deal is Alteogen\u2019s proprietary recombinant hyaluronidase enzyme ALT-B4, which enables the subcutaneous administration of large volumes of drugs that would otherwise need to be delivered intravenously. Through the Alteogen deal, AstraZeneca bought worldwide rights over ALT-B4, which it plans to use to develop subcutaneous formulations of \u201cseveral assets in our portfolio,\u201d CMO Cristian Massacesi said in a prepared statement on Monday.\n\nThe pharma has yet to specify which these assets are, with Massacesi only noting that this thrust is part of the pharma\u2019s aim to develop new cancer treatment options \u201cthat can transform the way cancer care is delivered.\u201d\n\nThe partnership with AstraZeneca is similar to deals Alteogen has struck with other pharmas to incorporate hyaluronidase into their drugs. The company has collaborations with Merck to work on Keytruda formulations, and with Daichii Sankyo to incorporate ALT-B4 into Enhertu, the cancer drug Daichii developed and co-commercialized with AstraZeneca.\n\nAlso on Monday, AstraZeneca inked a potential $1 billion agreement to buy Belgian biotech EsoBiotec, gaining access to its cell therapy pipeline and technology. The buyout, once it clears customary conditions and closes in the second quarter of 2025, will give the pharma access to the ENaBL platform, which allows for in vivo cell engineering, reprogramming patients\u2019 cells inside their bodies.\n\nAs in the case of Alteogen, AstraZeneca will leverage the EsoBiotec deal for a stronger position in cancer, while also boosting its capabilities in autoimmune and other immune-mediated conditions.\n\nAstraZeneca on Monday also unveiled high-level results from the Phase III CALYPSO trial of its parathyroid hormone receptor 1 agonist eneboparatide, being developed for chronic hypoparathyroidism. At 24 weeks, the pharma reported that the candidate met the study\u2019s primary composite endpoint of normalization of albumin-adjusted serum calcium concentrations and independence from active vitamin D and oral calcium therapy.

Image credit: Kateryna Kon / Shutterstock.\n\nUK-based AstraZeneca\u2019s acquired rare disease drug has met the primary endpoint in a Phase III trial in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism.\n\nThe Calypso trial (NCT05778071) of eneboparatide, an investigational parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor 1 agonist, met its primary endpoint of a composite of normalisation of albumin-adjusted serum calcium levels and independence from active vitamin D and oral calcium therapy.\n\nThe key secondary efficacy endpoints include the normalisation of 24-hour urinary calcium in patients with hypercalciuria at baseline and patient-reported outcomes.\n\nAstraZeneca added eneboparatide to the Alexion and AstraZeneca rare disease pipeline through the acquisition of Amolyt Pharma in July 2024, in a deal valued around $1.05bn. Shareholders received an $800m upfront payment and will receive $250m payment upon the drug meeting a specified regulatory milestone.\n\nThe trial enrolled 202 patients who were evaluated for 24 weeks. The randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study has now become an open-label study that will continue to evaluate patients for 52 weeks. In this open-label period, all patients will receive eneboparatide.\n\nThe rare disease drug was well tolerated across the 24 weeks. Full efficacy and safety data will be analysed again at 52 weeks. At that point, Alexion will share data with global health authorities.\n\nAlexion and AstraZeneca rare disease CEO Marc Dunoyer said: \u201cPeople living with hypoparathyroidism are often at increased risk of hypercalciuria, osteopenia and osteoporosis, and these results from the Calypso trial underscore eneboparatide\u2019s potential to be another option for these patients. We look forward to reviewing clinical results at 52 weeks to fully characterise the risk-benefit profile.\u201d\n\nEneboparatide acts by binding to a specific conformation of the PTH receptor 1 to restore PTH function and manage the symptoms of hypoparathyroidism, while preserving kidney function and bone health.\n\nThe therapy has been granted fast track and orphan drug designations by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and orphan designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).\n\nHypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disease caused by a deficiency of PTH. Symptoms include impaired regulation of calcium and phosphate levels in the blood. This dysregulation of the physiological action of PTH can lead to clinical manifestations, including a negative impact on the kidney and bone. It is one of the largest known rare diseases and affects over 200,000 people in the US and European Union (EU), and approximately 80% of patients are female.\n\nThe clinical space for hypoparathyroidism has been limited, with the standard treatment typically involving oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation. On 12 August 2024, Ascendis Pharma announced that the FDA-approved Yorvipath (palopegteriparatide) as the first and only dedicated treatment for adults with hypoparathyroidism in the US.\n\nGlobalData predicts that Yorvipath will benefit from its first-to-market advantage and generate $1.66bn of sales in 2030. Meanwhile, eneboparatide will likely bring in $492m in the same year.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Clinical Trials Arena.\n\nOn 17 March, AstraZeneca signed an executive licence agreement deal with bio-platform company Alteogen worth up to $1.35bn. The deal allows AstraZeneca to use Alteogen\u2019s hyaluronidase using Hybrozyme platform technology, ALT-B4, to develop subcutaneous formulations of oncology assets.",

Analysts say the deal highlights the pharma industry\u2019s growing interest in this technology.\n\nCurrent CAR-T cell therapies have transformed the treatment landscape for certain blood cancers, but the drugs are complex and time-consuming to manufacture and carry high price tags. They also carry weeks-long post-treatment monitoring protocols and are mostly available only at major medical centers, limiting access. In vivo approaches aim to overcome these limitations and potentially extend cell therapy benefits to more patients.\n\nEsoBiotec\u2019s platform uses immune-shielded lentiviral vectors \u2014 HIV type 1 cells that have had their genetic information removed \u2014 to deliver genetic instructions directly to T cells inside the patient, eliminating the need for complex cell extraction, laboratory modification and reinfusion processes that traditional CAR-T cell therapies require. This allows for treatment in \"just minutes\" through a simple IV injection and without the need for immune cell depletion, AstraZeneca said in its announcement.\n\nSusan Galbraith\n\n\u201cThe platform has the potential to transform cell therapy and will enable us to scale these innovative treatments so that many more patients around the world can access them,\u201d said Susan Galbraith, executive vice president, Oncology Hematology R&D at AstraZeneca, in a news release.\n\nThe acquisition represents a broader industry trend as pharmaceutical companies increasingly pursue in vivo cell therapy approaches, according to a research note from Jefferies. The note cited several companies developing similar technologies through different gene delivery strategies, including Interius, Umoja and Kelonia, which are employing lentiviral vectors to directly reprogram T cells in the body, and Capstan, Myeloid Therapeutics, Orna, Orbital and Carisma, which are using an mRNA-based approach to rapidly induce CAR expression in target cells.\n\n\u201cKey advantages of this platform include precise immune cell targeting, resistance to immune clearance, and modular design for flexible therapeutic applications,\u201d Jefferies analysts wrote in a March 17 note. \u201cImportantly, this approach eliminates the need for complex ex vivo T cell programming (faster turnaround times) and lymphodepletion, potentially making CAR-T more accessible and scalable.\u201d\n\nEsoBiotec's most advanced pipeline asset has already dosed its first multiple myeloma patient in a China investigator-initiated trial. Multiple myeloma is a cancer that forms in plasma cells in bone marrow. About 36,110 new cases will be diagnosed this year, and about 12,030 patients with multiple myeloma will die, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nAccording to Jefferies, the first patient received a single dose without prior lymphodepletion and showed \"high levels of T cell reprogramming and CART expansion\" with minimal residual disease in the bone marrow undetectable by day 28.\n\nESO-T01 is the first in vivo B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR-T candidate to be dosed in a human clinical trial, according to EsoBiotech in a news release. The therapy combines the immune-shielded cell-specific lentiviral vector platform, ENaBL, that reprograms immune cells inside the body with a CAR-T transgene developed by Pregene Biopharma.\n\n\u201cBy combining our expertise and resources [with AstraZeneca}, we can accelerate the development of our in vivo platform, which has a novel delivery technology we believe will have broad therapeutic applicability,\u201d said Jean-Pierre Latere, CEO, EsoBiotec, in a company news release.\n\nAstraZeneca acquisition of EsoBiotec is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025, and EsoBiotec will become a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca.",

            "content": "AstraZeneca already has cell therapies in its pipeline, and it is now expanding its scope further with a deal to acquire EsoBiotec, a company in early clinical development with therapies made by engineering immune cells inside a patient\u2019s body.\n\nUnder acquisition terms announced Monday, AstraZeneca will pay $425 million up front for all outstanding equity of privately held EsoBiotec. The Cambridge, England-based pharmaceutical giant could pay out up to $575 million more if the research achieves development and regulatory milestones.\n\nThe cell therapies currently available to patients are manufactured in an expensive, multi-step process. Such autologous therapies are made by harvesting a patient\u2019s own immune cells and then engineering them to go after a particular target. Before those cells can be infused as treatment, a patient must undergo a conditioning regimen that kill off immune cells to make room for the cells in the cell therapy. This step also prevents the immune system from rejecting the cell therapy. The entire process takes weeks.\n\nWith the approach of Mont-Saint Guibert, Belgium-based EsoBiotec, engineering immune cells into targeted disease fighters happens in vivo. Using a platform technology called Engineered NanoBody Lentiviral (ENaBL), EsoBiotec uses lentiviruses to deliver genetic instructions to specific immune cells, programming them to recognize and destroy disease-driving cells. ENaBL can be applied to cancer, where cell therapy first reached patients. It can also be used to develop treatments for autoimmune disease, a growing area of research for the cell therapy field.\n\nAn EsoBiotec therapy is administered as an intravenous injection that takes minutes. It does not require patients to undergo a conditioning regimen. Unlike autologous cell therapy, in which one batch yields a treatment for a single patient, EsoBiotec claims a batch of its therapy can treat hundreds of patients. These features could make cell therapy more broadly accessible compared to autologous cell therapies, which are expensive to manufacture and are typically available through specialized medical centers rather than community hospitals.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about the acquisition of EsoBiotec and the opportunity to rapidly advance their promising in vivo platform,\u201d Susan Galbraith, executive vice president, oncology hematology R&D, AstraZeneca, said in a prepared statement. \u201cWe believe it has the potential to transform cell therapy and will enable us to scale these innovative treatments so that many more patients around the world can access them.\n\nLate last year, EsoBiotec began an investigator-initiated clinical test of ESO-T01, an in vivo cell therapy for multiple myeloma. This EsoBiotec allogeneic CAR T- therapy engineers a patient\u2019s immune cells to target BCMA, a protein target addressed by the autologous cell therapies Abecma, from Bristol Myers Squibb, and Carvykti, from partners Legend Biotech and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nSponsored Post How to Improve Employee Benefits While Reducing Insurance Costs Balancing healthcare benefits and insurance costs requires research. From becoming a Difference Card member to offering wellness resources, there are many ways to improve healthcare at low cost.\n\nWhile AstraZeneca was not part of the first wave of cancer cell therapies, dealmaking has given it a chance to find a place in the next wave. An R&D alliance with Quell Therapeutics is developing therapies based on regulatory T cells (Tregs). Programs under this partnership are in preclinical development for inflammatory bowel disease and type 1 diabetes. AstraZeneca\u2019s collaboration with Cellectis leverages that company\u2019s gene-editing technology. This partnership spans allogeneic cell therapies currently in preclinical development for cancer.\n\nAstraZeneca also has the opportunity to improve on the manufacturability of autologous cell therapy. Last year, the pharma giant completed its $1 billion acquisition of Gracell Biotechnologies, a company with technology that could offer next-day cell therapy manufacturing. Gracell brought to AstraZeneca a separate technology for the manufacturing of allogeneic cell therapies.\n\nThere are other companies in pursuit of allogeneic cell therapies. The in vivo engineering approach of Capstan Therapeutics, a University of Pennsylvania spinout, uses messenger RNA to reprogram immune cells. Roche ramped up its pursuit of allogeneic cell therapy with its $1 billion acquisition of partner Poseida Therapeutics. Poseida\u2019s approach uses non-viral technologies to engineer immune cells that come from healthy donors.\n\nOrca Bio is also developing allogeneic cancer cell therapies with immune cells sourced from healthy donors. On Monday, the privately held biotech reported Phase 3 data for lead program Orca-T, an experimental treatment for certain blood cancers. On the main goal of survival free of moderate-to-severe chronic graft versus host disease measured at one year, Menlo Park, California-based Orca reported the study drug group achieved a rate of 78% compared to 38% for those who received a conventional stem cell transplant. An FDA submission is now planned for later this year. But first, more study details will be shared at the upcoming annual meeting of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation next month.\n\nEsoBiotec said it had raised \u20ac22 million (about $24 million) to date. AstraZeneca and EsoBiotec expect to close the transaction in the second quarter of this year.\n\nPhoto: Christopher Furlong, Getty Images",

            "content": "AstraZeneca is bolstering its cell therapy capabilities, agreeing on Monday to pay up to $1 billion for a biotechnology startup making treatments that reprogram cells inside the body.\n\nThe British drugmaker is buying EsoBiotech, a Belgian startup, for $425 million in cash upfront. EsoBiotech\u2019s investors, among them Invivo Partners and UCB Ventures, could receive up to $575 million in additional payouts should the startup\u2019s programs hit certain development and regulatory milestones, AstraZeneca said in a statement.\n\nThe deal hands AstraZeneca a technology designed to make cell therapies that can be administered through a single infusion, rather than via a complicated process that involves genetically manipulating cells in a lab. These so-called in vivo cell therapies, if successful, would help broaden the reach of traditional cell therapies, and be more convenient and accessible as well.\n\nSeveral biotechs are pursuing in vivo cell therapy research, among them well-funded startups like Capstan Therapeutics and Umoja Biopharma. Some, such as Interius BioTherapeutics and EsoBiotech, have programs in early clinical testing. EsoBiotech in December started human testing of a multiple myeloma cell therapy called ESO-T01.\n\nThat therapy, like others EsoBiotech is developing, uses what it calls novel, \u201chighly targeted\u201d lentiviruses to deliver genetic instructions into immune cells. This reprogramming process is done inside the body through an intravenous injection that takes \u201cminutes\u201d rather than the multiday or week turnaround typically associated with CAR-T therapy, AstraZeneca said.\n\nAstraZeneca intends to use the technology to advance therapies for cancer as well as autoimmune diseases, the latter of which is a growing research focus for cell therapy companies. EsoBiotech has already been doing so with ESO-T01, which turns immune cells against a protein on B cells that become cancerous in multiple myeloma and malfunction in inflammatory disorders.\n\nEsoBiotech\u2019s technology \u201chas the potential to transform cell therapy and will enable us to scale these innovative treatments so that many more patients around the world can access them,\u201d said Susan Galbraith, the company\u2019s executive vice president of oncology and hematology research and development, in a statement.\n\nThe acquisition is also the latest investment in cell therapy research by AstraZeneca. The company wasn\u2019t part of the initial wave of industry interest into this field. But over the last few years it has been building up internal capabilities and cutting deals with biotechs focused on newer approaches, such as donor-derived treatments or therapies made from different immune cells. An acquisition of Gracell Biotechnologies gave it an autoimmune cell therapy, too, though much of that research remains early.\n\nEsoBiotech \u201cwill accelerate and expand the impact of our recent investments and marks a major step forward in realizing our ambition to harness the full potential of cell therapy,\u201d Galbraith said in the statement.\n\nMore broadly, AstraZeneca\u2019s interest could help rejuvenate a field that\u2019s been struggling through an investment slump. Large pharmaceutical companies\u2019 desire for cell and gene therapy acquisitions \u201ccould continue to grow\u201d as they look for ways to mitigate the impact of patent expirations and drug-price negotiations, wrote Baird analyst Jack Allen, in a Monday note to clients.\n\n\u201c[M]any speculate that large pharmas will need to execute acquisitions in order to preserve their top lines,\u201d he wrote, and cell and gene therapies could be appealing targets because of \u201ccomplicated manufacturing processes\u201d that could protect them from generic competition.\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019ve seen some M&A in this space to date, we believe an increase in large pharma/biotech appetite here could provide a key tailwind of this subsector,\u201d Allen added.",

These vectors will deliver a genetic payload that can, in turn, reprogram immune cells, boosting their function.\n\nThe potential differentiating factor for AstraZeneca in the buy is that ENaBL cell therapies can engineer a patient\u2019s immune cells inside their bodies, without the need to harvest these cells or to subject patients through lengthy lymphodepletion procedures. According to Monday\u2019s news release, such an approach could create off-the-shelf therapies that are more affordable and acceptable for patients.\n\nAstraZeneca did not specify what its priority indications are for the EsoBiotec acquisition, only noting that the ENaBL platform will help develop cell therapies \u201cfor cancer treatment or autoreactive cells for potential use in immune-mediated diseases.\u201d The extra $575 million pays off on hitting development and regulatory milestones.\n\nAstraZeneca is a relative latecomer to the cell therapy space and has had to play catch-up through big-ticket deals in the past few years. In June 2022, for instance, the pharma acquired TeneoTwo in a potential $1.27 billion deal, giving it ownership over the T cell engager TNB-486, which has since been renamed as AZD0486 and leads AstraZeneca\u2019s cell therapy push.\n\nAccording to the pharma\u2019s pipeline page, AZD0486 is in a Phase III study for follicular lymphoma and in a Phase II trial for B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The pharma is also running two early-stage studies for the asset in relapsed or refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\n\nMore than a year after the TeneoTwo buy, AstraZeneca made another major cell therapy play when it dropped $1 billion upfront in December 2023 to buy Gracell Biotechnologies. This deal gave the pharma GC012F, now called AZD0120, an investigational CAR T therapy that targets the CD19 and BCMA proteins and which is being developed for multiple myeloma and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nAstraZeneca has also made other deals in the space, including a $245 million pact with Cellectis in November 2023 and a potential $2 billion contract with Quell Therapeutics in June 2023.",

Its share price fell by 1.2% on Monday afternoon.\n\nEsoBiotec\u2019s approach uses highly targeted lentiviruses to deliver genetic instructions to specific immune cells, such as T-cells, which program them to recognise and destroy tumour cells for cancer treatment, or tackle autoreactive cells (that target the body\u2019s own tissues or cells) for potential use in autoimmune diseases. This means cell therapies can be given through a simple injection.\n\nThe EsoBiotec chief executive, Jean-Pierre Latere, described them as \u201ccost-effective, off-the-shelf therapies\u201d that engineer immune cells within the patient\u2019s body. \u201cIt\u2019s super-effective. Effectively it turns the patient into a factory,\u201d he said.\n\nHe founded the business four years ago after serving as chief operating officer of the Belgian biotech company Celyad Oncology and working for the US chemical producer Dow Corning, having begun his career as a senior scientist at the US drugmaker Johnson & Johnson.\n\nEsoBiotec, which is based in Mont-Saint-Guibert in Walloon Brabant, is backed by Benelux investment groups Thuja Capital, UCB Ventures, Wallonie Entreprendre, Sambrinvest and Investsud, and Spain\u2019s Invivo Partners.\n\nThe company\u2019s approach is much quicker and less complicated than traditional cell therapies, where cells are taken from a patient, genetically modified outside the body, and then put back into the patient as a medicine after immune cell depletion. This can take three to five weeks and costs $450,000 to $500,00 for each treatment.\n\nSusan Galbraith, the executive vice-president of oncology research and development at AstraZeneca, said the company had been \u201clooking for things out of the ordinary\u201d and negotiated the deal quickly after seeing EsoBiotec present data from its first patient at JP Morgan\u2019s healthcare conference in San Francisco in mid-January. In December, the Belgian group launched a clinical trial for its lead product for multiple myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer.\n\nGalbraith added: \u201cWe believe it has the potential to transform cell therapy and will enable us to scale these innovative treatments so that many more patients around the world can access them.\u201d\n\nShe said only 10% to 20% of people who could benefit from cell therapy can obtain it at the moment because clinics in many countries are not set up for the weeks-long process, whereas EsoBiotec\u2019s technology means treatments can be given as a simple infusion \u201cat a fraction\u201d of the cost of traditional cures. If trials show it works, it could ease the pressure on health systems including the NHS.\n\nAstraZeneca, which fended off a hostile \u00a369bn takeover approach from the US drugmaker Pfizer in 2014, will pay $425m initially for the Belgian drug developer, and up to $575m based on development and regulatory milestones.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Marc Dunoyer, who runs the division and is AstraZeneca\u2019s chief strategy officer, defended the deal as a \u201cfantastic acquisition\u201d last month when the company took a $753m hit for scrapping one of the Alexion drugs, while two other medicines from the acquisition have also been abandoned.\n\nSeparately, Britain\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical company said on Monday that its Imfinzi treatment had been approved in the EU as the first and only immunotherapy for patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer, whose disease has not progressed after platinum-based chemoradiation therapy.\n\nAstraZeneca also announced that a drug for a rare endocrine disease, hypoparathyroidism, which can lead to bone density loss and osteoporosis, had met its goal of normalising calcium levels in the blood after 24 weeks. It was well tolerated by patients, and the trial continues as planned to 52 weeks. The company acquired the medicine along with the French rare disease specialist Amolyt Pharma in a deal worth more than $1bn a year ago.",

This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.49% gain on the day. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.2%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 1.22%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the pharmaceutical had gained 2.08% over the past month, outpacing the Medical sector's loss of 1.05% and the S&P 500's loss of 8.15% in that time.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Astrazeneca in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $1.10, indicating a 6.8% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $13.6 billion, indicating a 7.3% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $4.49 per share and a revenue of $57.14 billion, demonstrating changes of +9.25% and +5.67%, respectively, from the preceding year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Astrazeneca. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.55% downward. At present, Astrazeneca boasts a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\n\nLooking at its valuation, Astrazeneca is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 16.53. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 18.97.\n\nWe can additionally observe that AZN currently boasts a PEG ratio of 1.43.

            "content": "This study assessed the incidence of dynamic seroconversion and the factors predictive of this incidence in subjects who received the first dose of SARS-COV-2 vaccine (AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer) in Kinshasa. We know that the aim of any vaccine is to train the immune system to recognize a pathogen, without actually confronting the organism with the real pathogen. In this way, infection can be prevented, or at the very least, symptoms can be considerably reduced, avoiding severe forms of the disease. In this study, subjects with a negative IgG level prior to receiving a dose of one of three vaccines (AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer) were included and summoned on day 30 or 59 to receive the second dose. The median time elapsed between the first and second dose was 30.0 (IQR:29.2\u201330.8) days. The IgG level collected post-dose 1 was compared with the level collected pre-dose 1. The evolution of this level was used to estimate the seroconversion rate.\n\nAfter data analysis, the results on the incidence of seroconversion showed that in subjects having received doses of these three vaccines, the overall incidence of seroconversion was 3.00 per 100 P-D. Thus, IgG levels rose significantly between two doses, demonstrating the impact of vaccination and the acquisition of defenses against SARS-COV-2 in the population.\n\nThe chances of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection after primary vaccination were higher when the subject received the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines compared with the AstraZeneca vaccine. However, irrespective of the vaccine used, the probability of protection persisted from day 25 to day 59 of follow-up without dropping.\n\nThese results are in line with those reported in the ZOE COVID study which showed that mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) offered better efficacy than Oxford-AstraZaneca's COVID-19 vaccine in the UK population [16].\n\nConsistent with this finding, previous studies around the world have reported that IgG levels increase 2\u20136 weeks after vaccination with Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines, and levels begin to decline as early as 3\u201324 weeks [17,18,19]. Numerous studies have shown that peak antibody responses elicited by mRNA vaccines decline rapidly within 6\u20138 months of vaccination [15,16,17]. However, there are also reports of longer durability (> 6 months) of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in subjects after vaccination with [20, 21] mRNA vaccines. In a multi-country longitudinal cohort study of around 13,000 US adults receiving mRNA vaccines, IgG persisted for up to around 9 months, with only 2.4% of the study population showing seroreversion [22]. Compared with the low conversion rate of AstraZeneca's vaccine; studies around the world have shown that inactivated whole-virus vaccines produce a lower initial antibody response than mRNA vaccines [23, 24]. Another reason could explain this low incidence of seroconversion of AstraZeneca vaccine is the high age of the population that received this vaccine, in general, the elderly, especially those over 65, often have a diminished immune response due to immunosenescence, the presence of several comorbidities [22].\n\nThe Cox model in multivariate analysis with the time-dependent variable allowed us to take into account the variables significantly associated with the incidence of seroconversion in univariate analysis. After adjustment, patients who had received Pfizer (aRR: 3.19; 95%CI: 2.62\u20133.88) and moderna (aRR: 1.91; 95%CI: 1.60\u20132.29) vaccines; male subjects (aRR: 2.03; 95%CI: 1.89\u20133.20); those with a comorbidity (aRR: 2.38; 95%CI: 1.89\u20133.21); subjects with normal creatinine (aRR: 2.08; 95%CI: 1.88\u20133.32) and normal ALT (aRR: 3.04; I95%CI: 1.89\u20134.22) emerged as predictive factors for seroconversion after the first dose of SARS-COV-2 vaccine.\n\nThe Pfizer and Moderna vaccines differ from the AstraZeneca vaccine in their ability to induce seroconversion in that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are based on the messenger RNA technique, whereas the AstraZeneca vaccine is based on a non-replicating viral vector. And the two techniques differ in the way the decoy is created. Where the AstraZeneca vaccine introduces an altered version of the infectious agent, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines consist of having the human body directly produce a fragment of the pathogenic agent, thus developing immunity faster than that induced by AstraZeneca [25,26,27,28]. Men were twice more likely to seroconvert than women. This seroconversion is higher in men than in women, because physiologically, men and women have a hormonal difference that can influence their immune system. Our study is contradictory to several studies in the literature that report higher seroconversion in women than in men [29, 30]. The difference between these studies could be due to the nature of the study carried out, our study being carried out only in non-sick people could make a difference, behaviors and hormonal variation between the population included in this study are not comparable with those of the population of other studies. The mechanism by which men develop more seroconversion than women is not clearly elucidated, but there are hypotheses and theories that point to processes occurring within the immune and endocrine systems. In addition, men have higher levels of cytokines, which are proteins displayed as part of the body's innate immune response [31, 32]. It also emerges in this study that subjects with comorbidity were more efficient at developing seroconversion than those without comorbidity. Studies from around the world show that adaptive immunity is strongly activated in people with comorbidity; however, the T-cell and antibody response may differ, which could explain the low frequency of seroconversion over time observed in people without comorbidity [33, 34]. With regard to creatinine and normal ALT as predictors of seroconversion, the literature shows that in cases of renal or hepatic insufficiency, there is a reduction in cytokines and T lymphocytes, resulting in low efficacy in seroconversion [35].\n\nThe limitations of this study are related to the fact of not including hospitalized patients to compare the response of healthy subjects to sick ones. Another limitation of this study is the difference in follow-up times for the different vaccines, which could lead to a potential bias in the seroconversion of different individuals.",

The positive phase III data from Mineralys\u2019 aldosterone synthase inhibitor, lorundrostat, in hypertension is seen as a beneficial indicator for AstraZeneca\u2019s own ASI, Baxdrostat. This drug is expected to show significant results in its upcoming phase III trials, with AstraZeneca projecting substantial peak sales, particularly due to its longer half-life and lack of drug-drug interactions.\n\nFurthermore, AstraZeneca\u2019s pipeline is robust, with multiple catalysts anticipated in the next 18 months, including significant opportunities like AVANZAR and SERENA-4. These developments, along with the company\u2019s attractive valuation and expected high-single-digit sales growth, support the Buy rating. The potential for game-changing outcomes in the near future, with a total sales potential of around $30 billion, further strengthens the investment case for AstraZeneca.\n\nIn another report released yesterday, Morgan Stanley also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a p14,500.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "In December 2024, AstraZeneca shared new findings on Lynparza in patients with HR-positive breast cancer, showing a 32% reduction in the risk of invasive disease recurrence or death. In this discussion, Aliya Omer, VP of US Breast Cancer Franchise at AstraZeneca, offers insights into the study's implications, the potential of Lynparza in high-risk HR-positive patients, and the company's ongoing efforts to address unmet needs in breast cancer treatment.\n\nPharmaceutical Executive: Lynparza demonstrated benefits across all key subgroups, including high-risk, hormone-receptor-positive patients. How might these findings influence treatment strategies for this patient population?\n\nAliya Omer: Inherited BRCAmutations are closely related to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), but they're also prevalent in HR-positive disease. The reason HR-positive disease is so important is because it\u2019s actually the most prevalent subtype of breast cancer if you consider the other two being triple negative and HER2-positive as well. Due to the prevalence, there are actually more HR-positive patients with a gBRCA mutation compared to TNBC overall.\n\nThe study demonstrated that the impact was actually equivalent across all subgroups, and for this one in particular, there was a 32% reduction in the risk of invasive disease recurrence or death, and the survival rate was 77.5%.\n\nFull Interview Summary: The six-year follow-up data from the OlympiA trial demonstrated a 28% reduction in the risk of death with Lynparza (olaparib) for patients with germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative, high-risk, early-stage breast cancer. Notably, 87.5% of patients receiving Lynparza were alive at this point, compared to 83.2% on placebo, reinforcing its role as the first and only PARP inhibitor to show an overall survival benefit in early breast cancer. These findings solidify Lynparza as the standard-of-care for this patient group and emphasize the importance of early BRCA testing to identify high-risk patients who may benefit from treatment.\n\nBeyond triple-negative breast cancer, Lynparza demonstrated a 32% reduction in the risk of invasive disease recurrence or death in high-risk hormone receptor-positive patients, the most prevalent breast cancer subtype. These benefits were consistent across key subgroups, suggesting a broader impact on treatment strategies.\n\nLynparza is already approved in multiple countries, including the U.S., EU, Japan, and China, across eight indications spanning breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. AstraZeneca continues to engage with regulators to expand access and explore new indications, including monotherapy and combination therapies for other PARP-dependent tumor types.\n\nThe safety profile of Lynparza, particularly in younger patients, is reassuring. Given the increasing incidence of breast cancer in younger women, early intervention is critical. The median age in the OlympiA trial was 42, and pregnancy rates were comparable between the Lynparza and placebo groups, highlighting its potential as a viable option for younger patients.",

The growing prevalence of EGFR mutations, a rise in lung cancer diagnoses, and broader approvals for early-stage treatment all contribute to its promising growth potential.\n\nLAS VEGAS , March 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- DelveInsight's \" TAGRISSO Market Size, Forecast, and Market Insight Report \" highlights the details around TAGRISSO, a kinase inhibitor of the EGFR, which binds irreversibly to certain mutant forms of EGFR (T790M, L858R, and exon 19 deletions) at approximately nine-fold lower concentrations than wild-type. The report provides product descriptions, patent details, and competitor products (marketed and emerging therapies) of TAGRISSO. The report also highlights the historical and forecasted sales from 2020 to 2034 segmented into 7MM [the United States, the EU4 (Germany, France, Italy, and Spain), the United Kingdom, and Japan].\n\nAstraZeneca's TAGRISSO (osimertinib) Overview\n\nTAGRISSO is a prescription medication for adults with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that carries specific EGFR gene mutations. It is used to help prevent cancer recurrence after surgical tumor removal, as a first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC, or for patients whose cancer has spread and no longer responds to prior EGFR TKI therapy.\n\nAs a kinase inhibitor, TAGRISSO irreversibly targets specific mutant forms of EGFR (T790M, L858R, and exon 19 deletions) with significantly higher selectivity than the wild-type EGFR. After oral administration, two active metabolites (AZ7550 and AZ5104) circulate at around 10% of the parent drug and exhibit similar inhibitory effects as osimertinib. In vitro studies also show that osimertinib inhibits HER2, HER3, HER4, ACK1, and BLK at clinically relevant levels.\n\nThe recommended TAGRISSO dosage is 80 mg once daily, taken with or without food, and continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.\n\nDrug Name TAGRISSO (osimertinib) Molecule type Small molecule Developer AstraZeneca Primary Indication EGFR mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC First Approval Year US: 2015 (conditional approval), 2017 (full approval) EU: 2016 (conditional approval), 2017 (full approval) JP: 2016 Mechanism of action EGFR TKI Route of administration Oral\n\nLearn more about TAGRISSO projected market size for EGFR mNSCLC @ TAGRISSO Market Potential\n\nEGFR is a protein that plays a crucial role in cell growth. When mutations occur in the EGFR gene, they can lead to excessive cell growth, potentially causing cancer. These mutations can take various forms, including deletions, insertions, and point mutations. Among the most common EGFR mutations detected in test results are the EGFR exon 19 deletion and the EGFR L858R point mutation.\n\nIn non-small cell lung cancer, targeted therapies primarily focus on EGFR-sensitizing mutations and EGFR exon 20 insertions. The most frequently observed EGFR mutations include exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R mutations. To address these, the FDA has approved several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).\n\nIn 2023, the EGFR-mutated NSCLC market across the 7MM was valued at approximately USD 4 billion. The NSCLC treatment landscape is becoming increasingly biomarker-driven, with EGFR emerging as one of the most lucrative targets. TAGRISSO remains the leading therapy in this segment, maintaining a strong market presence. However, resistance to EGFR TKIs, particularly after TAGRISSO treatment, is a growing challenge. Developing treatments for patients who experience resistance remains one of the most pressing unmet needs in this space.\n\nDiscover more about the EGFR mNSCLC market in detail @ EGFR Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Market Report\n\nEmerging Competitors of TAGRISSO\n\nThe promising candidates in EGFR NSCLC pipeline include Patritumab deruxtecan (Daiichi Sankyo/AstraZeneca), Zipalertinib (Cullinan Oncology/Taiho Pharma), Aumolertinib/Almonertinib/HS-10206 (Jiangsu Hansoh Pharmaceutical), Savolitinib (AstraZeneca/Hutchison MediPharma), Ivonescimab (AK112/SMT112) (Akeso Biopharma/Summit Therapeutics), Firmonertinib (ArriVent BioPharma), Sunvozertinib (DZD9008) (Dizal Pharmaceutical), BNT327/PM8002 (Biotheus/BioNTech), Zanidatamab (Jazz Pharmaceuticals), TAS3351 (Taiho Oncology), H002 (RedCloud Bio), JIN-A02 (J INTS BIO), FWD1509 (Forward Pharma), Sasanlimab (Pfizer), Pamvatamig (MCLA-129) (Merus), REQORSA (quaratusugene ozeplasmid) (Genprex), PT-112 (Promontory Therapeutics), HMBD-001 (Hummingbird Bioscience), PLB1004 (Avistone Biotechnology), Carotuximab (ENV-105) (Kairos Pharma), and others.\n\nTo know more about the number of competing drugs in development, visit @ TAGRISSO Market Positioning Compared to Other Drugs\n\nKey Milestones of TAGRISSO\n\nIn December 2024 , TAGRISSO was approved in Europe for patients with unresectable EGFR-mutated lung cancer based on the results of the LAURA Phase III study.\n\nTAGRISSO was approved in for patients with unresectable EGFR-mutated lung cancer based on the results of the LAURA Phase III study.

Since its approval, TAGRISSO has gained significant traction due to its efficacy in treating both first-line and post-resistance settings, particularly in patients with the T790M resistance mutation. The drug's ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and show strong efficacy against brain metastases has further strengthened its market positioning, leading to widespread adoption among oncologists.\n\nA major driver of TAGRISSO's market dynamics is its dominance as the preferred first-line treatment for EGFR-mutated NSCLC. This shift from earlier-generation TKIs has been supported by clinical data demonstrating superior progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) benefits. The expansion of TAGRISSO's indications, including its approval in the adjuvant setting for early-stage EGFR-mutated NSCLC, has further broadened its market reach. Additionally, AstraZeneca has aggressively pursued global regulatory approvals, ensuring market access across multiple geographies, particularly in high-prevalence regions such as East Asia, where EGFR mutations are more common.\n\nHowever, TAGRISSO faces growing challenges, including the emergence of resistance mechanisms such as MET amplification and C797S mutations, which limit long-term efficacy. To counteract this, AstraZeneca is exploring combination strategies with MET inhibitors and other targeted therapies. Furthermore, increasing competition from next-generation EGFR TKIs, such as those under development by companies like Takeda and Johnson & Johnson, poses a potential threat. Pricing and reimbursement pressures, particularly in cost-sensitive markets, also impact its commercial strategy, necessitating a balance between pricing optimization and maintaining accessibility.\n\nDespite these challenges, TAGRISSO remains a blockbuster drug with robust revenue growth, driven by strong clinical performance and strategic lifecycle management. Ongoing clinical trials evaluating its use in earlier disease stages and in combination therapies could further extend its market leadership. With its strong foothold in the EGFR-mutated NSCLC landscape, TAGRISSO is expected to remain a key driver of AstraZeneca's oncology portfolio in the foreseeable future.\n\nDive deeper to get more insight into TAGRISSO's strengths & weaknesses relative to competitors @ TAGRISSO Market Drug Report\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1 Report Introduction 2 TAGRISSO: AstraZeneca 2.1 Product Overview 2.2 Other Development Activities 2.3 Clinical Development 2.4 Clinical Trials Information 2.5 Safety and Efficacy 2.6 Product Profile 2.7 Market Assessment 2.7.1 The 7MM Analysis 2.7.1.1 Cost Assumptions and Rebate 2.7.1.2 Pricing Trends 2.7.1.3 Analogue Assessment 2.7.1.4 Launch Year and Therapy Uptake 2.7.2 The United States Market Analysis 2.7.3 EU4 and the United Kingdom Market Analysis 2.7.3.1 Germany 2.7.3.2 France 2.7.3.3 Italy 2.7.3.4 Spain 2.7.3.5 UK 2.7.4 Japan Market Analysis 2.8 Market Drivers 2.9 Market Barriers 2.10 SWOT Analysis 3 Key Cross of Marketed Competitors of TAGRISSO 4 Key Cross of Emerging Competitors of TAGRISSO\n\nRelated Reports\n\nEGFR Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Market\n\nEGFR Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Market Insights, Epidemiology, and Market Forecast \u2013 2034 report deliver an in-depth understanding of the disease, historical and forecasted epidemiology, as well as the market trends, market drivers, market barriers, and key EGFR NSCLC companies, including AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Genentech/Roche, Eli Lilly, Hansoh Pharmaceutical, J&J Innovative Medicine, Pfizer, Cullinan Oncology, Taiho Pharmaceutical, ArriVent Biopharma, Black Diamond Therapeutics, Daiichi Sankyo, Black Diamond Therapeutic, J INTS BIO, NALO Therapeutics, Scorpion Therapeutics, ORIC Pharmaceuticals, among others.\n\nEGFR Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Pipeline\n\nEGFR Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Pipeline Insight \u2013 2025 report provides comprehensive insights about the pipeline landscape, pipeline drug profiles, including clinical and non-clinical stage products, and the key EGFR non-small cell lung cancer companies, including Cullinan Oncology, Betta Pharmaceuticals, G1 Therapeutics, Janux Therapeutics, Daiichi Sankyo Company, Suzhou Puhe Pharmaceutical Technology, Genor Biopharma, J Ints Bio, Avistone Pharmaceuticals, Mythic Therapeutics, among others.\n\nNon-small Cell Lung Cancer Market\n\nNon-small Cell Lung Cancer Market Insights, Epidemiology, and Market Forecast \u2013 2034 report deliver an in-depth understanding of the disease, historical and forecasted epidemiology, as well as the market trends, market drivers, market barriers, and key NSCLC companies including Daiichi Sankyo, AstraZeneca, Gilead Sciences, BieGene, AbbVie, Roche, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Eli Lilly, BerGenBio, GlaxoSmithKline, Duality biologics, among others.\n\nNon-small Cell Lung Cancer Pipeline\n\nNon-small Cell Lung Cancer Pipeline Insight \u2013 2025 report provides comprehensive insights about the pipeline landscape, pipeline drug profiles, including clinical and non-clinical stage products, and the key non-small cell lung cancer companies, including BridgeBio Pharma, Daiichi Sankyo, EMD Serono, Merck, BridgeBio Pharma, Abbvie, Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Company BioNTech SE, Shenzhen TargetRx, Taiho Pharmaceutical, Chong Kun Dang, Bristol Myers Squibb, Innovent Biologics, Xuanzhu Biopharmaceutical, Bayer, GeneScience Pharmaceuticals, InventisBio, Apollomics, Imugene, Ono Pharmaceutical, Pierre Fabre, Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Bristol-Myers Squibb, Surface Oncology, Inhibrx, Sinocelltech, Mirati Therapeutics, REVOLUTION Medicines, Yong Shun Technology Development, Iovance Biotherapeutics, Galecto Biotech, among others.\n\nAbout DelveInsight\n\nDelveInsight is a leading Business Consultant and Market Research firm focused exclusively on life sciences.

            "content": "The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies AstraZeneca Pharma India Limited ( ) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\n\nWhen Is Debt A Problem?\n\nDebt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.\n\nWhat Is AstraZeneca Pharma India's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of September 2024 AstraZeneca Pharma India had \u20b9171.2m of debt, an increase on \u20b953.5m, over one year. But on the other hand it also has \u20b94.97b in cash, leading to a \u20b94.80b net cash position.\n\nA Look At AstraZeneca Pharma India's Liabilities\n\nZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that AstraZeneca Pharma India had liabilities of \u20b94.75b due within 12 months and liabilities of \u20b9871.2m due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of \u20b94.97b as well as receivables valued at \u20b91.50b due within 12 months. So it actually has \u20b9849.2m more liquid assets than total liabilities.\n\nThis state of affairs indicates that AstraZeneca Pharma India's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So it's very unlikely that the \u20b9195.1b company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Succinctly put, AstraZeneca Pharma India boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\n\nThe good news is that AstraZeneca Pharma India has increased its EBIT by 7.4% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is AstraZeneca Pharma India's earnings that will influence how the balance sheet holds up in the future. So if you're keen to discover more about its earnings, it might be worth checking out .\n\nBut our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. While AstraZeneca Pharma India has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. In the last three years, AstraZeneca Pharma India's free cash flow amounted to 22% of its EBIT, less than we'd expect. That's not great, when it comes to paying down debt.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that AstraZeneca Pharma India has net cash of \u20b94.80b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. And it also grew its EBIT by 7.4% over the last year. So we are not troubled with AstraZeneca Pharma India's debt use. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nIf, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out without delay.\n\nNew: Manage All Your Stock Portfolios in One Place We've created the ultimate portfolio companion for stock investors, and it's free. \u2022 Connect an unlimited number of Portfolios and see your total in one currency\n\n\u2022 Be alerted to new Warning Signs or Risks via email or mobile\n\n\u2022 Track the Fair Value of your stocks\n\nTry a Demo Portfolio for Free\n\nHave feedback on this article?

Credit: ljubaphoto via Getty Images.\n\nAstraZeneca and Ionis Pharmaceuticals\u2019 polyneuropathy drug has won approval in the European Union (EU), where it will be marketed as Wainzua (eplontersen).\n\nThe drug has been approved to treat hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adult patients with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN). This marks the second major regulatory clearance for the therapy, following its approval in the US in December 2023, where it is sold as Wainua.\n\nThe companies have positioned Wainzua as a differentiated treatment for ATTRv-PN, as it is the first therapy for the condition that can be self-administered using a once-monthly pen injector. Other available therapies typically require administration by a healthcare professional.\n\nWainua is a ligand-conjugated antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that works by reducing the production of misfolded transthyretin (TTR) protein. In hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, the accumulation of these misfolded proteins leads to amyloid fibril deposits that cause progressive tissue damage, resulting in neurological impairment. This causes symptoms like pain, numbness, and weakness.\n\nThe drug enters a competitive market currently led by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, which markets two synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapies for ATTRv-PN \u2013 Onpattro (patisiran) and Amvuttra (vutrisiran). Amvuttra, which secured EU approval in 2022, is administered quarterly via a prefilled syringe, rather than Wainua\u2019s monthly self-injection.\n\nIonis already has experience in the ASO space, with its first-generation therapy Tegsedi (inotersen) also approved for ATTRv-PN. However, Tegsedi requires weekly subcutaneous injections and comes with additional safety monitoring requirements due to potential thrombocytopaenia and glomerulonephritis risks. Ionis removed Tegsedi from the US market in 2023, but it continues to be marketed as a treatment option for ATTRvPN in the EU. This could make Wainzua a more favourable option among patients and healthcare providers.\n\nThe European Commission\u2019s decision to approve Wainzua was supported by data from the Phase III NEURO-TTRansform study (NCT04136184). At 66 weeks, the study showed that patients receiving Wainzua experienced a \u201cconsistent and sustained\u201d benefit in neurologic impairment \u2013 as determined by a neuropathy impairment score +7 (mNIS+7) \u2013 and serum transthyretin (TTR) concentration.\n\nThe ATTRv-PN market has seen significant revenue growth in recent years. Alnylam\u2019s Amvuttra generated $970m in 2024, as per the company financials. Wainzua generated sales of $85m in 2024, but is forecast to pull in up to $2.2bn in sales by 2030, according to GlobalData\u2019s Pharma Intelligence Center. Amvuttra is set to make double this in the same year with $4.4bn in projected sales.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Pharmaceutical Technology.",

The recent positive results from Mineralys Therapeutics\u2019 trial for lorundrostat, a competitor drug, have favorable implications for AstraZeneca\u2019s own hypertension treatment, baxdrostat. This development reduces the perceived risk associated with baxdrostat and highlights its potential for significant market success.\n\nKapila believes that the pivotal hypertension data could be a crucial step towards unlocking a substantial revenue opportunity for AstraZeneca, estimated at around $6.5 billion in peak sales. This includes potential sales from both hypertension and chronic kidney disease treatments. Despite the current market consensus valuing these opportunities at a lower figure, Kapila sees considerable upside potential, especially when considering the combination potential with Farxiga in chronic kidney disease. Overall, the positive read-across from competitor data and the underappreciated potential of baxdrostat support the Buy rating for AstraZeneca\u2019s stock.\n\nAccording to TipRanks, Kapila is a 2-star analyst with an average return of 1.0% and a 57.14% success rate.\n\nIn another report released today, UBS also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a \u00a3142.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

(Nasdaq: IONS) announced today that Ionis and AstraZeneca\u2019s WAINZUA (eplontersen) has been approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adult patients with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy, commonly referred to as hATTR-PN or ATTRv-PN. WAINZUA is the only approved medicine in the EU for the treatment of ATTRv-PN that can be self-administered monthly via an auto-injector.\n\nThe approval by the European Commission (EC) follows the positive opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The approval is based on the positive NEURO-TTRansform Phase 3 trial which showed that through 66 weeks, patients treated with WAINZUA demonstrated consistent and sustained benefit on the co-primary endpoints of serum transthyretin (TTR) concentration and neuropathy impairment measured by modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7), and key secondary endpoint of quality of life (QoL) on the Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QoL-DN) versus external placebo. WAINZUA continued to demonstrate a favorable safety and tolerability profile throughout the NEURO-TTRansform trial.\n\nATTRv-PN is a debilitating disease that leads to peripheral nerve damage with motor disability within five years of diagnosis and, without treatment, is generally fatal within a decade. WAINZUA is a once-monthly RNA-targeted medicine designed to reduce the production of TTR protein at its source.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s approval of WAINZUA in Europe offers adults with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis with polyneuropathy a new, self-administered treatment option that provides consistent suppression of transthyretin production and improves neuropathy impairment and quality of life,\u201d said Brett P. Monia, Ph.D., chief executive officer, Ionis. \u201cWith approvals in North America , UK and now across the EU, we are proud of the continued progress as we and our partner, AstraZeneca, rapidly and effectively deliver WAINZUA to people around the world.\u201d\n\nWAINZUA was approved under the brand name WAINUA for the treatment of ATTRv-PN in the U.S. in December 2023 and has gained approvals in additional countries worldwide, including Canada and the United Kingdom . As part of a global development and commercialization agreement, AstraZeneca and Ionis are jointly developing and commercializing WAINUA in the U.S. The companies are seeking regulatory approval in other parts of the world where AstraZeneca has exclusive rest of world commercialization and development rights.\n\nAbout TTR Amyloidosis\n\nATTR is caused by the accumulation of liver-derived misfolded TTR protein in tissues, such as the heart and the peripheral nerves, causing organ damage and failure. ATTR then causes complications, leading to cardiovascular, neurological and renal diseases such as heart failure and chronic kidney disease. There are both hereditary (ATTRv) and non-hereditary (wild-type) forms of ATTR. ATTR is a rapidly progressive and fatal disease that requires timely recognition of symptoms. ATTR has several phenotypes including ATTR-cardiomyopathy (CM), which predominantly impacts the heart, potentially leading to heart failure, ATTR-polyneuropathy (PN), which predominantly affects the peripheral nervous system and mixed phenotype, where patients experience symptoms of both. Worldwide, there are an estimated 300,000 \u2013 500,000 patients with ATTR-CM and about 10,000 \u2013 40,000 patients with ATTRv-PN.\n\nAbout NEURO-TTRansform\n\nNEURO-TTRansform is a global, open-label, randomized trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of eplontersen in patients with ATTRv-PN at week 35, week 66 and week 85. The final analysis comparing eplontersen to an external placebo group was completed at week 66. All patients were then followed on treatment until week 85 and evaluated four weeks after the last dose in an end-of-trial assessment. Following treatment and the end-of-trial assessments, patients were eligible to enter an open-label extension study to continue receiving eplontersen once every four weeks or enter a 20-week post-treatment evaluation period, which is still ongoing. Full results from the NEURO-TTRansform trial were published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) demonstrating the benefit of eplontersen across the spectrum of ATTRv-PN at 35, 66 and 85 weeks of treatment.\n\nAbout WAINZUA / WAINUA\u2122 (eplontersen)\n\nEplontersen is a once-monthly RNA-targeted medicine that provides upstream suppression of transthyretin (TTR) production and is designed to precisely target and reduce the production of TTR protein at its source in the liver.\n\nWAINZUA has been approved in the U.S. and Canada under the brand name WAINUA\u2122 (eplontersen) for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults, commonly referred to as hATTR-PN or ATTRv-PN. Please see link for full U.S. Prescribing Information.\n\nEplontersen is also currently being evaluated in the global CARDIO-TTRansform Phase 3 study for the treatment of adults with ATTR-CM. The trial is fully enrolled with more than 1,400 patients \u2013 making it the largest, most comprehensive study to date in this patient population. More information on the CARDIO-TTRansform study (NCT04136171) is available at www.clinicaltrials.gov.\n\nU.S. INDICATION for WAINUA\u2122 (eplontersen)\n\nWAINUA injection for subcutaneous use 45 mg is indicated for treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION for WAINUA\u2122 (eplontersen)\n\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\nReduced Serum Vitamin A Levels and Recommended Supplementation WAINUA leads to a decrease in serum vitamin A levels. Supplement with recommended daily allowance of vitamin A. Refer patient to an ophthalmologist if ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency occur.\n\nADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nMost common adverse reactions (\u2265 9% in WAINUA-treated patients) were vitamin A decreased ( 15% ) and vomiting ( 9% ).\n\nPlease see link to U.S. Full Prescribing Information for WAINUA.\n\nAbout Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nFor three decades, Ionis has invented medicines that bring better futures to people with serious diseases.

AstraZeneca\u2019s main research and development areas include oncology, rare diseases, and biopharmaceutical intervention, and it has numerous ongoing projects. Global company headquarters are located in Cambridge, England, and it has more than 80,000 employees in more than 60 countries worldwide.\n\nHistory and the 1999 merger AstraZeneca was founded in 1999 when the Swedish pharmaceutical company Astra AB merged with U.K.\u2013based pharmaceutical company Zeneca Group. At the time, it represented one of the largest mergers to ever occur between two European companies. Astra AB dated back to 1913 and had established itself as a leading domestic pharmaceutical manufacturer in Sweden. The company\u2019s first blockbuster drug was Xylocaine (lidocaine), a numbing agent that quickly gained popularity in the United States after it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the 1950s. Zeneca Group was founded in 1993 in Britain and maintained a major share of the oncology care market in both the U.K. and the U.S. The company\u2019s main specialties were cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and respiratory drugs, as well as those relating to oncology and anesthesia. Early 2020s: Product diversification and a failed acquisition\n\nOpen full sized image The numbing drug that put Astra AB on the map. \u00a9 Science & Society Picture Library/Getty Images\n\nSome of AstraZeneca\u2019s most widely prescribed medicines in the 21st century include: Tagrisso (osimertinib), a targeted therapy to treat non-small-cell lung cancer\n\n(osimertinib), a targeted therapy to treat non-small-cell lung cancer Farxiga (dapagliflozin), which is used to treat type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure\n\n(dapagliflozin), which is used to treat type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure Crestor (rosuvastatin), a statin used to treat high cholesterol\n\n(rosuvastatin), a statin used to treat high cholesterol Symbicort (budesonide/formoterol), an inhaled corticosteroid used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease AstraZeneca also manufactures the popular proton-pump inhibitor drugs Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) and Prilosec (omeprazole magnesium), which are used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease. In 2012 AstraZeneca became a founding member, with nine other pharmaceutical companies, of the nonprofit TransCelerate BioPharma Inc. The organization\u2019s mission is to improve access to information that helps facilitate the creation of new medicines. Some recent efforts have centered on refining methods to digitally share clinical trial information. Pfizer, Inc., another of the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies, attempted to acquire AstraZeneca in 2014. The acquisition would have resulted in the creation of the world\u2019s largest drug company. However, the deal garnered much criticism in Britain, primarily because of alleged tax breaks and job cuts that would have resulted from the merger. AstraZeneca ultimately declined the sale on the grounds that its profitability potential was greater than the price offered by Pfizer. COVID-19 vaccine and controversy AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine was created by the University of Oxford. The Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) was a double-stranded DNA-based vaccine, as opposed to the popular Moderna and Pfizer offerings, which were based on single-stranded RNA. Commonly known by the brand names Vaxzevria and Covishield, AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine received high efficacy ratings and proved easier to store than most competitors\u2019 vaccines, which often required storage in below-freezing temperatures. Demand outpaced supply, and the European Union registered complaints that AstraZeneca had failed to deliver millions of promised doses in early 2021.\n\nOpen full sized image Should employers be able to mandate vaccinations? \u00a9 Scaliger/Dreamstime.com",

For years he has experienced stigma and discrimination due to misconceptions about his condition.\n\n\u201cBut the real challenge isn\u2019t just [lack of] awareness; it\u2019s access to the right care, support, and treatment that so many of us still struggle to get,\u201d said Mr. Dela Cruz, who spoke during a roundtable event entitled \u201cMore Than You Can Imagine: Collaboration to Transform Rare Disease Outcomes in the Philippines\u201d on Feb. 28.\n\nIn observance of the Rare Disease Day, the Department of Health (DoH), the Philippine Society of Orphan Disorders (PSOD), the Philippine Alliance of Patients\u2019 Organizations (PAPO), National Institute of Health (NIH), and AstraZeneca Philippines gathered patient advocates, the medical community, and other stakeholders. They are bound by their shared purpose of raising awareness and driving action for better care and support for Filipinos living with rare diseases.\n\nNF1 is one of the over 7,000 known rare diseases impacting more than 300 million people globally, with 70% of these conditions starting in childhood. In the Philippines, an estimated 6,500 Filipinos live with rare diseases, although the actual number may be higher due to lack of diagnosis and awareness.\n\nThe definition of rare diseases, also known as orphan diseases, varies across countries. According to many international organizations, a condition is defined as \u201crare\u201d when it affects fewer than 1 in 2,000 people. In the Philippines, the DoH, upon the recommendation of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), categorizes a disease or disorder as rare when it affects one in 20,000 individuals or less.\n\nSymptoms of rare diseases vary greatly, making early detection challenging. These diseases are often chronic, progressive, and life-threatening, resulting in significant social, financial, and emotional burdens for patients and their families. Typically, it takes years to receive an accurate diagnosis, with many patients misdiagnosed, which prolongs suffering and complicates treatment options.\n\nTreatment is another hurdle. While ongoing research and clinical trials \u2014 often spearheaded by innovative organizations and patient advocacy groups such as PSOD \u2014 hold promise, access remains limited. Only around 5% of rare diseases have FDA-approved therapies worldwide, leaving millions of patients without treatment options.\n\nOn top of these challenges, Filipino rare disease patients and their families confront daily logistical barriers, such as geographic isolation, care coordination difficulties, lack of transportation, and limited access to advanced technologies. Rare diseases also place a heavy emotional burden on families, with caregivers and loved ones facing overwhelming responsibilities to provide care and support.\n\nAddressing rare diseases requires more than just medicines, and should include adapting healthcare systems, fostering education, and enhancing cooperation in the whole rare disease community to ensure improved outcomes, according to Lotis Ramin, President of AstraZeneca Philippines.\n\nJanet Kochis, Program Officer for Patient Care and Family Support at PSOD, acknowledged the enactment of the Rare Diseases Act of the Philippines in 2016 as a milestone, noting that change happens when policies are fully implemented, treatments become accessible, and no patient is left behind.\n\nDr. Melanie Alcausin, Director of the Institute of Human Genetics at the NIH, called for a united effort from policymakers, healthcare professionals, advocates, and the community. She stressed that now is the time to actively push for stronger rare disease policies and to turn awareness into action and ensure that no patient is left behind.\n\nRare diseases pose a unique challenge to patients, their families, societies, healthcare professionals, and healthcare systems. They require \u201corphan drugs,\u201d or drugs that are uniquely developed to target rare conditions. However, developing orphan drugs to treat rare diseases is a risky and complex undertaking for the innovative pharmaceutical industry since the number of rare diseases patients are small and widely dispersed. Because there are not enough clinical centers or sufficient expertise, biopharmaceutical companies seeking to develop treatments for rare diseases face major logistical and regulatory hurdles.\n\nDespite these challenges, the biopharmaceutical industry has more than 700 medicines in development, targeting many known rare diseases. We consider rare diseases not in isolation but as a significant factor in health policy frameworks. We believe the needs of patients living with rare diseases are a public health priority. Hence, patients must be empowered by access to information, patient-reported outcome registries, and active participation in healthcare decisions. Finally, sustainable patient access to diagnostics, treatment, and care is vital.\n\nTeodoro B. Padilla is the executive director of Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines which represents the biopharmaceutical medicines and vaccines industry in the country. Its members are in the forefront of research and development efforts for COVID-19 and other diseases that affect Filipinos.",

            "content": "Advertisement\n\nKey Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, AstraZeneca fair value estimate is UK\u00a3219\n\nCurrent share price of UK\u00a3121 suggests AstraZeneca is potentially 45% undervalued\n\nwhich is 37% below our fair value estimate\n\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of AstraZeneca PLC ( ) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.70b US$12.9b US$15.1b US$17.3b US$18.8b US$19.9b US$20.9b US$21.8b US$22.6b US$23.3b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x8 Analyst x9 Analyst x7 Analyst x4 Analyst x3 Est @ 6.08% Est @ 4.94% Est @ 4.15% Est @ 3.60% Est @ 3.21% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4% US$9.1k US$11.4k US$12.5k US$13.5k US$13.8k US$13.7k US$13.5k US$13.3k US$12.9k US$12.5k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$126b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.4%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$23b\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (6.4%\u2013 2.3%) = US$580b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$580b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$312b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$438b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of UK\u00a3121, the company appears quite good value at a 45% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at AstraZeneca as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for AstraZeneca\n\nStrength Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows. Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows. Weakness Earnings growth over the past year underperformed the Pharmaceuticals industry. Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Pharmaceuticals market. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the British market. Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Threat Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

The company confirmed that the rover's wheels were functional.\n\nThe initial plan after landing on the Moon was for Yaoki to wait around five days to acclimatize to the temperature before detaching from the lander. It then would have been remotely operated from Earth for several hours to capture and transmit images.\n\nThe lander was launched from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Feb. 26.\n\nIn February last year, Intuitive Machines became the first private firm to successfully send a spacecraft to the lunar surface.\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nispace to attempt June Moon landing, would be 1st by Japan firm\n\nFEATURE: Japanese firms aim for one giant leap in space development\n\nJapan Moon rover sets out for world's 1st private lunar exploration",

            "content": "AstraZeneca\u2019s PD-L1 blocker Imfinzi outperformed standard of care at boosting event-free survival in certain types of stomach cancer, according to a late-stage readout posted on Friday.\n\nIn the Phase III MATTERHORN trial, AstraZeneca enrolled nearly 950 patients who had stage II to IVA gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancers. For its active treatment, the pharma combined Imfinzi with a chemotherapy regimen called FLOT\u2014the current standard of care in this indication, consisting of the drugs fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin and docetaxel.\n\nPatients in MATTERHORN were treated with neoadjuvant Imfinzi plus FLOT before surgery, followed by adjuvant Imfinzi and FLOT, then Imfinzi monotherapy. Meanwhile, patients in the control arm were given perioperative FLOT alone.\n\nAstraZeneca did not provide specific data in its news release on Friday, with the company revealing only that the Imfinzi combo elicited a \u201cstatistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement\u201d in event-free survival, the study\u2019s primary outcome, as compared with FLOT.\n\nOverall survival (OS), a key secondary endpoint, was immature at the time of the analysis, but nevertheless showed a \u201cstrong trend\u201d in favor of the PD-L1 inhibitor, according to AstraZeneca. MATTERHORN is an ongoing study and will continue to follow patients to get a mature readout of OS.\n\nAs for safety, Imfinzi\u2019s adverse event profile was consistent with what had been established in prior studies, with no new signals of concern.\n\nImfinzi is an intravenously administered IgG1 monoclonal antibody which binds the PD-L1 ligand and blocks its downstream signaling cascade. Since the biologic was first approved in 2017, it has become a cornerstone of AstraZeneca\u2019s business, bringing in more than $4.7 billion last year.\n\nIn a company presentation last month, AstraZeneca named Imfinzi as one of its key growth drivers for 2025, particularly looking forward to potential approvals in bladder and gastrointestinal cancers \u201cto unlock [its] next wave of growth.\u201d MATTERHORN is one of three studies that could help the pharma achieve this goal\u2014alongside the POTOMAC and VOLGA programs in bladder cancer.\n\n\u201cOur focus is on novel combination approaches to overcome treatment resistance and extend immune responses, as well as leveraging immunotherapy in earlier disease stages where there is greater potential for a cure,\u201d Nancy Ghattas, vice president, U.S. oncology commercial franchise head-immuno oncology at AstraZeneca, told BioSpace in an email. Imfinzi is central to this strategy, she added.\n\nIn its press announcement on Friday, AstraZeneca said it plans on taking MATTERHORN\u2019s findings to global regulatory authorities, positioning Imfinzi as a perioperative treatment option for gastric and GEJ cancers. The pharma will also present complete data and analyses of MATTERHORN at an upcoming medical meeting.\n\nUpdate (March 7): This story has been updated to include comments from AstraZeneca.",

The trial will follow OS, which will be formally assessed at the final analysis.\n\nGastric cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death globally, with nearly one million people diagnosed each year.\n\nIn 2024, there were roughly 43,000 drug-treated patients in the US, European Union, and Japan with early-stage and locally advanced gastric or GEJ cancer. Approximately 62,000 patients in these regions are expected to be newly diagnosed in this setting by 2030.\n\nThe safety profile for Imfinzi and FLOT chemotherapy was consistent with the known profiles of each medicine, and there were no new safety findings.\n\nIn a previously reported interim analysis for the key secondary endpoint of pathologic complete response (pCR), the Imfinzi combination more than doubled the pCR rate compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone.\n\nPrice Action: AZN stock is up 0.22% at $77.64 during the premarket session at the last check Friday.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage by Robert Way via Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

If you are unable to, or do not wish to, participate in the AGM on the day, you may also choose to receive a written response to your question or have it put to the Board during the meeting. Full details of how to ask a question via the online platform during the meeting are set out from page 13. Please endeavour to keep your questions concise and relevant to the business of the AGM. Where we receive a number of questions covering the same topic, we may group these to address as many of your queries as possible. Additionally, we may remove supporting statements or paraphrase questions to ensure they are clear and concise. Entitlement to participate and vote Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, only holders of ordinary shares entered in the register of members of the Company by 18:30 (BST) on 9 April 2025 (or their duly appointed proxies), or if this meeting is adjourned, in the register of members by 18:30 (BST) two days prior to any adjourned meeting, are entitled to participate or vote at the AGM in respect of the number of ordinary shares registered in their name at that time. Changes to the entries in the register of members after 18:30 (BST) on 9 April 2025, or if this meeting is adjourned, in the register of members after 18:30 (BST) two days prior to any adjourned meeting, shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to participate or vote at the AGM. Voting at the AGM All shareholders are encouraged to vote either in advance or on the day. You will be able to vote in one of three ways for each of the resolutions: \u2018For\u2019, \u2018Against\u2019 or \u2018Vote Withheld\u2019. Please note that a \u2018Vote Withheld\u2019 is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation of votes \u2018For\u2019 and \u2018Against\u2019 each resolution. If you are a holder of shares listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm or of American Depositary Shares, you should follow the instructions set out in the specific documentation sent to you. If you hold via the AstraZeneca Nominee Service, you should follow the instructions set out separately on page 11. If you hold shares through another nominee or brokerage account, you should follow the relevant voting instructions that have been provided to you. Voting before the meeting If you are a registered member of the Company, there are several ways to submit your voting instructions before the meeting, which are available from the publication date of this Notice of AGM: (1) via Equiniti\u2019s Shareview website; (2) appointment of proxies through CREST; (3) appointment of proxies through Proxymity; or (4) by completing and returning a paper proxy form. Votes submitted electronically via Equiniti\u2019s Shareview website, or via CREST and Proxymity, (options (1) to (3) above) should be registered by no later than 14:30 (BST) on 9 April 2025. After then, you will no longer be able to submit your proxy vote via Equiniti\u2019s Shareview website or CREST or Proxymity. Paper proxy votes (option (4) above) must be received by no later than 14:30 (BST) on 9 April 2025. If you are voting by paper proxy, you are strongly encouraged to appoint the Chair of the AGM as your proxy.

Paper proxy forms are available from Equiniti on request; you can call our shareholder helpline on +44 (0) 800 389 1580, or use any of Equiniti\u2019s alternative contact details listed on the back page of this Notice of AGM. Any shareholder that votes in advance of the meeting, in accordance with the voting instructions set out in this Notice of AGM, will have their votes cast at the meeting as per the instructions provided. Voting on the day Voting on the day will be available via the online platform once the Chair declares the poll open. Voting will remain open until the Chair closes voting at the end of the meeting. Holders of American Depositary Shares and holders of shares registered on Nasdaq Stockholm that have voted in advance will not be able to vote via the online platform. They will still be able to participate in, and ask questions during, the digitally-enabled meeting. Poll voting All resolutions will be put to a poll vote. This means that a shareholder has one vote for every share held and the votes of all shareholders who submit a proxy form in advance of the meeting are counted, even if the shareholder does not participate in the meeting. Entitlement to appoint proxies A registered member of the Company may appoint one or more proxies (who need not be a member of the Company) to exercise all or any of their rights to participate and to speak and vote at a meeting of the Company provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by the member.

Patients were treated with neoadjuvant Imfinzi in combination with chemotherapy before surgery, followed by adjuvant Imfinzi in combination with chemotherapy, then Imfinzi monotherapy. The trial evaluated this regimen versus perioperative chemotherapy alone for patients with resectable, early-stage and locally advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers. For the secondary endpoint of overall survival, a strong trend was observed in favor of the Imfinzi -based regimen at this interim analysis. The trial will continue to follow OS, which will be formally assessed at the final analysis.\n\nPublished first on TheFly \u2013 the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily loss of 1.78%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.99%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 2.61%.\n\nShares of the pharmaceutical witnessed a gain of 9.9% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Medical sector with its gain of 0.26% and the S&P 500's loss of 3.48%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Astrazeneca will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.10, reflecting a 6.8% increase from the same quarter last year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $13.6 billion, showing a 7.3% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $4.49 per share and a revenue of $57.14 billion, demonstrating changes of +9.25% and +5.67%, respectively, from the preceding year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Astrazeneca. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 3.68% lower within the past month. Astrazeneca is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Astrazeneca is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 17.36. This signifies a discount in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 19.4 for its industry.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AZN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.5. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The average PEG ratio for the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry stood at 1.57 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nThe Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry is part of the Medical sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 66, putting it in the top 27% of all 250+ industries.",

The goal is to empower members of the hockey community to do three things: learn their own risk factors for cancers, talk to their doctors about whether cancer screens are right for them, and encourage their loved ones to do the same.\n\nIn November 2023, AstraZeneca teamed up as an official partner of Hockey Fights Cancer. A joint initiative of the NHL and NHLPA, powered by the V Foundation for Cancer Research, Hockey Fights Cancer is a vital initiative that not only raises funds for cancer research, but also educates and empowers fans to take action for their health to best face the disease.",

The drugmaker's British-Swedish parent has already received 14 product approvals in the past two years, and aims to expedite more launches to bolster its business in India, a top company official said.\n\n\u201cOur first strategy is to bring innovative medicine faster into the country, which otherwise [patients] would go to other parts of the developed world to buy,\" Sanjeev Panchal, managing director of AstraZeneca India, told Mint in an interview.\n\nThe company reported a robust set of numbers for the December quarter of FY25, with its profit nearly doubling year-on-year to \u20b930.8 crore and its Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margin expanding sharply from 4.9% to 17.5%. Its revenues grew 44% to \u20b9440.3 crore.\n\nThe company's quarterly performance was boosted by increased product sales, especially in its oncology portfolio, which contributed 62% to its overall revenues of \u20b91,330 crore in FY24.\n\nAstraZeneca Pharma India stock rose about 1% to settle at \u20b97,354.35 on the BSE on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cYou are clearly seeing growth which is high double-digit in the past year\u2026and we believe that we will continue to have strong growth as we go ahead because we have more assets and new indications in the pipeline,\" Panchal said.\n\nThe parent company has a global ambition of introducing 20 new assets (new medicines, or new indications of existing drugs) into the world by 2030. \u201cWe would want to bring as many products as possible out of this global pipeline into India as well.\"\n\nCancer focus\n\nWith India\u2019s cancer burden rising, AstraZeneca is banking on bringing innovative drugs to meet the country\u2019s needs. In the past year, AstraZeneca secured regulatory approvals to bring some key cancer drugs into the country.\n\nIts breast cancer drug Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (brand name Enhertu), launched in January 2024, emerged as the top-selling new drug brand last year. According to IQVIA data, AstraZeneca had the highest sales among new introductions at \u20b957.9 crore from a single brand, Enhertu.\n\nThe drug reflects the company\u2019s focus on pioneering scientific innovation, Panchal said. Enhertu was granted breakthrough designation by the US drug regulator Food and Drug Administration (FDA), highlighting its scientific innovation and potential relevance to meeting the needs of breast cancer patients.\n\nAlso Read: Metropolis Healthcare amps up North India play with Agra lab chain acquisition\n\nIts lung cancer drug Osimertinib (Tagrisso), continues to be its best-selling oncology brand by sales. Another drug Durvalumab (Imfinzi), used to treat lung cancer, demonstrated robust growth last year.\n\nAccording to a report by HDFC Securities, the oncology market in India is forecast to grow by $947.8 million during 2022-27, at CAGR of 13.5%. The growth is likely to be driven by early diagnosis of patients, continuous introduction of new drugs, improved accessibility to innovative cancer medications, and extended treatment durations for medicines.\n\nApart from oncology, AstraZeneca is also focusing on the rare diseases, respiratory, and cardiovascular segments to boost the product pipeline.\n\nCompetition from local players\n\nWhile the drugmaker has clocked robust sales from its oncology portfolio, Indian generics players have been quick to enter the market as well. Mint reported earlier that Biocon and Cadila Healthcare have signed up under the government\u2019s production linked incentive scheme to produce Trastuzumab.\n\nAs more players enter the market, prices are expected to fall. While Panchal did not comment on pricing strategy, he pointed out that the company is banking on bringing newer innovations which aren\u2019t available to continue its momentum.\n\nThe company is looking at strategic partnerships as the market gets more competitive. Last year, it inked a partnership with Mankind Pharma for distribution of its asthma drug Symbicort. The company will continue to evaluate partnerships for certain drugs which need to be made more accessible, where it can leverage the distribution network of a domestic player, Panchal said.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we also need to build an ecosystem, because when you have new science in oncology, the science is moving very fast,\" Panchal said.\n\nThe company has joined hands with the state governments of Goa and Karnataka for early cancer detection and screening initiatives.\n\n\u201cFor us, bringing innovative medicine faster is [the] important thing, and on the way, we see how we can improve access and affordability\u2026rather than wait for long to get the right price,\" Panchal added.",

Dr. Dolsten has served on several public boards in the US and Europe and has vast experience in business development, including 10 different mergers and acquisitions.\n\n\u201cBy creating oral alternatives to biologics such as antibodies and peptides and designing oral drugs for hard-to-drug intracellular targets, the work Orbis Medicines is doing will dramatically expand access to treatment for patients suffering from many chronic and devastating diseases, which is truly the next frontier in drug discovery,\u201d said Dr. Dolsten. \u201cWhat the Orbis Medicines team led by Morten are achieving in the field of oral macrocycle medicines positions the company to be a disruptor of the biologics market. I believe Orbis Medicines has the potential to become the leading oral macrocycles and oral biologics biotech company.\u201d\n\nDr. Dolsten\u2019s accomplishments include the introduction of a new class of oral medications for autoimmune diseases, the development and approval of targeted anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer and Pfizer\u2019s rapid R&D response to the COVID-19 pandemic (see \u201cNote to Editors\u201d below for more information).\n\nOrbis Medicines is pioneering the systematic discovery and development of targeted, orally available macrocycles for diseases and targets traditionally treated with biologics. Orbis develops compounds known as nCycles, which can address a wide range of validated protein targets with unique oral bioavailability and membrane permeability features.\n\nAbout Orbis Medicines\n\nOrbis Medicines is pioneering a new era for oral macrocycle drug discovery. Its nGen platform systematically delivers macrocycle candidates, termed nCycles. These are optimized for oral bioavailability, which has historically hindered therapeutic development of this versatile class of molecules. Orbis\u2019 pipeline is initially focused on nCycle candidates against targets validated by blockbuster biologic drugs delivered by injection. Proof-of-concept of Orbis\u2019 work has been published in Nature Communications and Nature Chemical Biology. The company has raised \u20ac116 million in venture funding to date, including a \u20ac90 million series A round led by NEA with new investors Lilly Ventures, Cormorant, EIFO and existing investors Forbion and Novo Holdings. Orbis is located in Copenhagen, Denmark and Lausanne, Switzerland. For more information, please visit: www.orbismedicines.com\n\nAbout nGen\n\nnGen is Orbis Medicines\u2019 technology platform for generating nCycles, a new class of fully synthetic macrocycle compounds optimized for oral bioavailability and membrane permeability. It consists of multiple proprietary integrated elements in a \u201clab in a loop\u201d system starting with hit finding libraries of 100 billion compounds. The highly automated chemistry-based nGen platform can synthesize and analyze up to 100,000 distinct synthetic macrocycles in weeks, allowing the company to discover candidates with the right properties to enable oral dosing and intracellular targeting. The scale and quality of the data produced from these real compounds, paired with machine learning, creates an industry-leading platform that de-risks and accelerates development.\n\nNote to Editors\n\nNotable accomplishments of Mikael Dolsten, M.D., Ph.D., during his tenure as Chief Scientific Officer, President, Pfizer Research & Development\n\nIntroduced a new class of oral medications for autoimmune diseases dominated by biologics, including first-in-class JAK inhibitor Xeljanz (tofacitinib) for rheumatoid arthritis & ulcerative colitis, first-in-class Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor Cibinqo (abrocitinib) for atopic dermatitis and the tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma/Janus kinase 3 (Tec/JAK3) drug Litfulo (ritlecitinib) for alopecia areata.\n\nOversaw the development and approval of targeted ALK inhibitors in the highly competitive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) market, including first-in-class ALK inhibitor Xalkori (crizotinib) and third-generation ALK inhibitor Lorbrena (lorlatinib). Other major drug approvals during Dr. Dolsten\u2019s tenure at Pfizer included the breast cancer drug Ibrance (palbociclib), the myeloma drug Elrexfio (elranatamab-bcmm), the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor Talzenna, the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor Inlyta (axitinib), the oral anti-coagulant Eliquis (apixaban), the transthyretin amyloid stabilizing drug Vyndaqel (tafamadis), the Prevnar 20 vaccine and the RSV vaccine Abrysvo.\n\nSpearheaded Pfizer\u2019s rapid R&D response to the COVID-19 pandemic, receiving emergency use authorization and subsequently full approval for the oral antiviral therapy Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) and for COVID-19 mRNA vaccine Comirnaty, in partnership with BioNTech.\n\nDr. Dolsten announced his retirement from Pfizer in July 2024.\n\nContacts\n\n\n\nMedia:\n\nMatt Crenson\n\nTen Bridge Communications\n\n(917) 640-7930\n\nmcrenson@tenbridgecommunications.com",

Improvements in NPS were observed as early as week four and NCS as early as week two (the first post-treatment assessment respectively) and were sustained through week 52.\n\nStatistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements were observed across all key secondary outcomes assessed in the overall trial population. Importantly, Tezspire significantly reduced the need for subsequent nasal polyp surgery by 98% (p<0.0001) and the need for systemic corticosteroid treatment by 88% (p<0.0001) compared to placebo.\n\nDr Joseph Han, vice chair of department of otolaryngology - head and neck surgery, Old Dominion University, US, and co-primary investigator in the trial, said: \u201cMany patients living with nasal polyps are at risk of repeat surgeries and serious systemic side effects from long-term oral corticosteroids. The WAYPOINT results are clinically meaningful and suggest that tezepelumab could greatly reduce the burden of nasal polyps for patients by nearly eliminating the need for future surgery and corticosteroid use and by significantly reducing nasal polyp size and congestion.\u201d\n\nSharon Barr, executive vice president, biopharmaceuticals R&D said: \u201cThe WAYPOINT results demonstrate the potential for Tezspire to provide a much-needed option for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. With its first-in-class mode of action, targeting TSLP at the top of the inflammatory cascade, the data add to the body of evidence that tezepelumab can transform care for patients with epithelial-driven inflammatory diseases.\u201d",

This move marks a significant step in the company\u2019s pursuit to break into the growing market for obesity drugs.\n\nWhat Happened: The MARITIME program, the drug\u2019s phase three development program, is advancing remarkably well, said Dr. Jay Bradner, Amgen\u2019s Executive Vice President of Research and Development at the 45th Annual TDCowen Healthcare Conference on Wednesday, as per CNBC. MariTide, a monthly injection, is anticipated to rival the existing weekly weight loss injectables from Novo Nordisk\u2018s NVO Ozempic and Wegovy and Eli Lilly\u2018s LLY Zepbound. These medications belong to a class called GLP-1s, which mimic specific gut hormones to regulate appetite and blood sugar levels.\n\nThe initial trial in the new phase three series will evaluate MariTide in approximately 3,500 individuals with obesity or those who are overweight but do not have Type 2 diabetes. The second trial will evaluate MariTide in 999 patients who are obese or overweight and have Type 2 diabetes. Both studies are primarily focussed to measure the percentage of weight loss over 72 weeks.\n\nIn November, Amgen revealed that MariTide enabled obesity patients to lose an average of up to 20% of their weight over a year in a phase two trial, without reaching a weight loss plateau. However, these results did not meet Wall Street\u2019s lofty expectations for the drug. Amgen is set to release additional information on MariTide this year.\n\nSEE ALSO: Jim Cramer Doubles Down On CrowdStrike Despite Drop: \u2018Analysts Who Were So Negative\u2026Had It Wrong\u2019\n\nWhy It Matters: According to Morgan Stanley Research, the global market for weight-loss drugs is projected to reach $105 billion by 2030. The obesity drug market is also highly competitive, with companies like Novo Nordisk recently enhancing access to its weight-loss medication, Wegovy, by lowering prices and offering home delivery. Amgen\u2019s entry into this market with MariTide could potentially disrupt the current market dynamics.\n\nMoreover, Amgen\u2019s recent success with its partnered asthma drug with AstraZeneca AZN in treating chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, further underscores the company\u2019s commitment to addressing significant health issues. The success of MariTide in the upcoming trials could further cement Amgen\u2019s position in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.",

With the approval, it becomes the first and only treatment for pediatric patients living with the disease.1\n\nThe use of eculizumab in pediatric patients for this indication was supported by evidence from a well-controlled trial in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric patients with gMG who are 12 years of age and older, as well as pharmacokinetic and safety data in other pediatric populations in the range of at least 6 years to younger than 12 years.

The injection is administered in doses of 300 mg/30 mL (10 mg/mL) as a clear, colorless solution in a single-dose vial. It remains contraindicated for patients with unresolved serious Neisseria meningitidis infection.\n\nEculizumab, first approved for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) in 2007, is a monoclonal antibody that targets the complement system, specifically inhibiting the protein C5. By preventing the cleavage of C5 into C5a and C5b, it halts the formation of the membrane attack complex, which is a critical mediator of complement-related tissue damage. For context, the complement system is a part of the immune system and plays a significant role in inflammation and the destruction of pathogens, but its dysregulation can lead to autoimmune and other complement-mediated diseases.\n\nREAD MORE: Early Phase 1 Trial Data Suggests Therapeutic Potential for PGN-EDODM1 in Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1\n\nThe therapy comes with several important safety information, including a boxed warning label. Patients may only access the therapy through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation Management Strategy (REMS) program, called Ultomiris and Soliris REMS, because of the risk of serious meningococcal infections. To be eligible, patients must complete or update their meningococcal vaccine(s) at least 2 weeks before the first dose of eculizumab. If patients experience symptoms of a serious meningococcal infection, they are advised to call their healthcare provider or get emergency care immediately. These symptoms include fever alone, fever with high heart rate, fever and headache, fever and a rash, confusion, muscle aches with flu-like symptoms, headache with nausea or vomiting, headache with a stiff neck or stiff back, or eye sensitivity to light.\n\nEculizumab gained its second indication in 2011 for the treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, a life-threatening condition leading to blood clot formation and organ damage. Years later, in 2017, it was approved for adults with gMG with AChR antibodies, helping to reduce complement-mediated damage to the neuromuscular junction, thus improving symptoms of weakness. It made history in 2019, becoming the first approved therapy for patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), a rare, autoimmune disorder that affects the central nervous system, specifically the optic nerves and spinal cord.\n\nREFERENCE\n\n1.

(Nasdaq: CGEN) (TASE: CGEN) a clinical-stage cancer immunotherapy company and a pioneer in computational target discovery, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024 and provided a corporate update.\n\n\"I believe Compugen is well-positioned for growth, building on significant progress made in 2024 together with a diverse and innovative pipeline and with a strong focus on execution in 2025,\" said Anat Cohen-Dayag, Ph.D., President and CEO of Compugen. \"The clinical data we presented at SITC 2024, consistent with previous data, support advancing our potential first-in-class anti-PVRIG, COM701, to be evaluated as a maintenance treatment option for patients with platinum sensitive ovarian cancer. We are on track to initiate an adaptive platform trial, which is scheduled to start with a randomized placebo controlled sub-trial evaluating single agent COM701 therapy in Q2 2025. This development path is supported by a strong clinical and biological rationale and has the potential to open the door to advance COM701 as a single agent and as a backbone to future drug combinations.\"\n\nDr. Cohen-Dayag continued, \"We are also encouraged by the promising rilvegostomig data presented by our partner, AstraZeneca, in 2024. Rilvegostomig is a PD-1/TIGIT bispecific antibody, the TIGIT component of which is derived from COM902. AstraZeneca is running seven Phase 3 trials with rilvegostomig across lung and gastrointestinal cancers and plans to share early data for rilvegostomig in combination with their ADCs in 2025. AstraZeneca's broad development strategy for rilvegostomig to replace existing PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors represents a significant potential revenue source for Compugen as we may be eligible for both future milestone payments and mid-single digit tiered royalties on future sales.\n\nDr. Cohen-Dayag added, \"Our solid financial position with a cash runway expected to fund our operations into 2027 allows us to advance our innovative clinical and early-stage pipeline. This includes advancing the Phase 1 trial of GS-0321, a potential first-in-class anti-IL18BP licensed to Gilead, for which we received a $30 million milestone payment for achieving IND clearance in 2024. Additionally, it enables us to continue to leverage our AI/ML powered predictive computational discovery platform, UnigenTM, to accelerate our research efforts supporting our early pipeline. Our Unigen platform is validated by our multiple potential first-in-class and potential best-in-class clinical programs, as well as our partnerships with AstraZeneca and Gilead.\"\n\nNext Planned Milestones\n\nQ2 2025 \u2013 initiation of a randomized adaptive platform trial comparing COM701 maintenance therapy to placebo in total of 60 patients with relapsed platinum sensitive ovarian cancer\n\n\u2013 initiation of a randomized adaptive platform trial comparing COM701 maintenance therapy to placebo in total of 60 patients with relapsed platinum sensitive ovarian cancer 2025 \u2013 Compugen's partner, AstraZeneca, plans to share early data for rilvegostomig in combination with their ADCs\n\n\u2013 Compugen's partner, AstraZeneca, plans to share early data for rilvegostomig in combination with their ADCs H2 2026 \u2013 data from projected interim analysis of single agent COM701 sub-trial 1 as maintenance therapy in relapsed platinum sensitive ovarian cancer\n\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Highlights\n\nCash: As of December 31, 2024, Compugen had approximately $103.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits and investment in marketable securities. The cash balance at the end of 2024 includes the receipt of the upfront payment of $60 million from Gilead for the licensing of GS-0321, the $30 million milestone payment from Gilead for IND clearance (both subject to a 15% withholding tax) and the $15 million milestone payments from AstraZeneca on dosing of the first patient in the first and second major indications for rilvegostomig Phase 3 trials.\n\nIn January and February 2025, subsequent to the financial results for the year ended December 31, 2024, a total of approximately 3.96 million shares were sold through the Company's ATM facility contributing net proceeds of approximately $8.87 million (net of $274 thousand commission issuance expenses).\n\nCompugen expects that its current cash will be sufficient to fund its operating plans into 2027. The Company has no debt.\n\nRevenues: Compugen reported approximately $1.5 million in revenues for the fourth quarter of 2024 and $27.9 million in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to approximately $33.5 million in revenues for each of the comparable periods in 2023. The revenues for 2024 include the portion of the upfront payment and the IND milestone payment from the license agreement with Gilead and the $5 million clinical milestone payment from AstraZeneca, while the revenues for 2023 reflect the portion of the upfront payment from the license agreement with Gilead allocated to the license and the previous clinical milestone from the license agreement with AstraZeneca in the amount of $10 million .\n\nCost of Revenues for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024, were approximately $0.7 million and $7.9 million , respectively, compared with approximately $2.0 million for both comparable periods in 2023. Cost of revenues for 2024 represents the cost of IND and Phase 1 activities and royalty payments in connection with Compugen's revenues, offset by royalty reversal in 2024 due to exemption received from the Israeli Innovation Authority from the requirement to pay royalties on income derived from sales associated with products related to IL-18BP, while cost of revenues for 2023 represents milestone and royalty payments in connection with our revenues.\n\nR&D expenses for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024, decreased to approximately $5.9 million , and $24.8 million , respectively, compared with approximately $10.9 million and $34.5 million for the comparable periods in 2023, respectively. The decrease in 2024 was mainly due to the classification of expenses related to GS-0321 to cost of revenues and to lower CMC and IND enabling activities related to GS-0321, partially offset by an increase in clinical expenses.\n\nG&A expenses for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024, were approximately $2.2 million and $9.4 million , respectively, compared with approximately $2.5 million and $9.7 million for the comparable periods in 2023, respectively.\n\nNet Income / Loss: During the fourth quarter of 2024, Compugen reported a net loss of approximately $6.1 million , or approximately 7 cents per basic and diluted share, compared to a net income of approximately $9.7 million , or approximately 11 cents per basic and diluted share in the comparable period of 2023. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024, was approximately $14.2 million , or approximately 16 cents per basic and diluted share, compared with a net loss of approximately $18.8 million , or approximately 21 cents per basic and diluted share in the comparable period in 2023.\n\nFull financial tables are included below.\n\nConference Call and Webcast Information\n\nThe Company will hold a conference call today, March 4, 2025, at 8:30 AM ET to review its fourth quarter and full year 2024 results.

Credit: Emily Frost / Shutterstock.\n\nAmgen and AstraZeneca have reported complete outcomes from the registrational Phase III WAYPOINT trial of Tezspire (tezepelumab-ekko) for treating chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP).\n\nThe trial showed that treatment with the therapy decreased the severity of nasal polyps and congestion at week 52, as well as the need for surgery and the use of systemic corticosteroid.\n\nSeverity of nasal polyps and congestion were measured using the measurements of co-primary endpoints, Nasal Polyp Score (NPS), and participant-reported Nasal Congestion Score (NCS).\n\nThe results highlight the therapy\u2019s impact on reducing the need for nasal polyp surgery by 98% and systemic corticosteroid treatment by 88% against placebo.\n\nThey reflect Tezspire\u2019s mechanism of action, which targets the primary source of inflammation at the airway epithelium.\n\nAmgen research and development executive vice-president Jay Bradner said: \u201cChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is a recurrent condition often requiring repeat courses of systemic corticosteroids, even for patients on currently available biologics, and can require repeat surgeries.\n\n\u201cThe WAYPOINT data highlight the potential of targeting inflammation at the epithelium to provide lasting relief for those with CRSwNP, adding to the efficacy profile that has been well established for Tezspire in severe asthma.\u201d\n\nDeveloped jointly by AstraZeneca and Amgen, tezepelumab is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) activity.\n\nThe companies updated their partnership agreement in 2020, with AstraZeneca overseeing the drug\u2019s general development and Amgen leading manufacturing, sharing expenses and profits equally.\n\nGovernance of the partnership is overseen by joint bodies, with Amgen recognising sales of Tezspire in the US and AstraZeneca in Canada.\n\nAstraZeneca also leads commercialisation outside North America.\n\nAstraZeneca recently reported positive outcomes from a planned interim analysis of a Phase III trial of camizestrant with a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor for treating hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.",

            "content": "While regulatory preparations are underway, powerhouse partners AstraZeneca and Amgen continue to beef up their case for the expansion of the subcutaneous antibody Tezspire into chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.\n\nFull data from the Phase III WAYPOINT trial showed Tezspire could elicit a more than 2-point reduction in the Nasal Polyp Score (NPS) at 52 weeks versus placebo. Similarly, the biologic lowered patient-reported Nasal Congestion Score (NCS) by more than 1 point as compared with placebo. Both treatment effects were highly statistically significant, according to the companies\u2019 announcement.\n\nAside from hitting its co-primary endpoints NPS and NCS, Tezspire also aced key secondary outcomes, including the time to first use of a systemic glucocorticoid, loss of smell, total symptom score and the time before patients decide to undergo surgical removal of their polyps. Tezspire also reduced the need for subsequent surgery by 98% and for systemic corticosteroids by 88%, according to the companies.\n\nAstraZeneca and Amgen presented the data Saturday at a late-breaking oral presentation at the Joint Congress of the American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and World Allergy Organization, held in San Diego.\n\nIn an investor note on Sunday, analysts at Leerink Partners also took the WAYPOINT readout as a positive for Amgen and AstraZeneca, noting that Tezspire \u201cdemonstrated marginally better efficacy cross-trial vs. Dupixent,\u201d with better NPS and NCS improvements.\n\nStill, the analysts cautioned that cross-study comparisons could be fraught, particularly given \u201ctrial inclusion differences.\u201d WAYPOINT, in particular, \u201cenrolled a more selective group regarding respiratory comorbidities, but a broader population in terms of prior surgery,\u201d the analysts noted.\n\nSharon Barr, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals R&D at AstraZeneca, said Saturday\u2019s readout points to the \u201cpotential of Tezspire to provide a much-needed option for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP).\u201d\n\n\u201cWith its first-in-class mode of action, targeting TSLP [thymic stromal lymphopoietin] at the top of the inflammatory cascade, the data add to the body of evidence that tezepelumab can transform care for patients with epithelial-driven inflammatory diseases,\u201d Barr added.\n\nTSLP is a cytokine that is a crucial upstream player in the inflammatory cascade. Tezspire, a humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody, works by binding to TSLP and preventing its interaction with its corresponding receptor, thereby disrupting the inflammation pathway.\n\nThis mechanism of action won it the FDA\u2019s approval for severe asthma in December 2021, backed by data from the Phase III NAVIGATOR trial, where Tezspire significantly reduced the annualized rate of asthma exacerbations versus placebo, while also eliciting improvements in lung function, symptom burden, disease control and quality of life. Tezspire can only be used in patients aged 12 and above.\n\nIn its fourth-quarter business presentation, Amgen disclosed that it was preparing to file regulatory submissions for Tezspire in CRSwNP in the first half of 2025. Beyond asthma and CRSwNP, AstraZeneca and Amgen are studying Tezspire for other inflammatory respiratory indications, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and eosinophilic esophagitis.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) stands against other best immunology stocks to buy now.\n\nThe Growing Market for Immune System Treatments\n\nImmunology is a rapidly advancing field with significant potential for growth, especially in the realm of biotech and pharmaceutical companies. As the global demand for innovative treatments for autoimmune diseases, cancer immunotherapies, and vaccines continues to rise, immunology stocks present lucrative investment opportunities. The market for immunotherapy medications is expected to rise at a high pace, from $240 billion in 2023 to $1.3 trillion in 2033. The rise in chronic illnesses like infections, autoimmune diseases, and various forms of cancer worldwide is what is causing the surge.\n\nThe prevalence of cancer in particular is rising worldwide. In its 2024 Global Cancer Statistics report, the American Cancer Society has brought attention to the rising global cancer burden. About 9.7 million individuals lost their lives to cancer in 2022 alone, while an estimated 20 million new cases were identified. About 35 million new cases of cancer are predicted to occur annually by 2050, increasing the need for cutting-edge therapies like immunotherapy.\n\nImmunotherapy is a viable substitute for conventional treatments, and as research progresses, its uses are growing. It can be used alone or in conjunction with chemotherapy or other treatments for a variety of cancer types. A form of non-specific immunotherapy called immunomodulating drugs aids in enhancing the body\u2019s immune system\u2019s capacity to identify and combat cancer cells.\n\nInvestments and Advancements in Immunotherapy Treatments\n\nLeading pharmaceutical companies are also making significant investments in research and development to increase the variety of immunotherapy medications available due to the rising demand for treatments. These consist of monoclonal antibodies, CAR-T cell treatments, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Immunotherapy is being used in novel ways and is poised to transform cancer treatment and other medical fields by combining several therapies and customizing care for each patient.\n\nMedical breakthroughs and regulatory approvals, especially in the US, propelled North America to the top of the worldwide immunotherapy medication market in 2023, accounting for about 48.19% of total revenue.

            "content": "Alberta\u2019s Human Rights Tribunal has ruled that a workplace dispute over a vaccine mandate must proceed to a hearing, setting the stage for a key test of religious freedom in employment decisions.\n\nBlacklock's Reporter says the case centers on an oil and gas worker who refused the COVID-19 vaccine on religious grounds, arguing that his beliefs, rooted in the Ten Commandments, prohibited him from complying with his employer\u2019s mandate.\n\n\u201cThere is a genuine issue to be resolved,\u201d wrote tribunal adjudicator Wilma Shim, overturning an earlier decision by human rights commissioners who dismissed the complaint.\n\nThomas Elliott, a self-described \u201cborn again, charismatic Christian,\u201d was suspended without pay by Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. for refusing vaccination. He claimed religious discrimination, stating that his Christian faith required adherence to the Bible as \u201cthe one and only true word of God.\u201d\n\nAccording to the tribunal\u2019s ruling, Elliott argued that vaccines were developed and tested using fetal cell lines derived from abortion, which he believes to be murder. \u201cTo take the vaccine would be complicit with murder,\u201d he claimed.\n\n\u201cThis is not a case where the complainant has made a bare assertion that his Christian faith requires him to refuse vaccination,\u201d the tribunal wrote. \u201cHe has provided what he alleges is Scriptural authority for his belief that accepting the vaccine would be a sin.\u201d\n\nCanadian Natural Resources countered that Elliott\u2019s pastor had not explicitly mentioned vaccines in a letter submitted as part of the complaint. However, Shim ruled that spiritual beliefs need not be narrowly defined to be legitimate.\n\n\u201cThe complainant stated adherence to Scripture is a tenet of the Christian faith and that his eternal salvation depends on obedience to God\u2019s will as expressed in Scripture,\u201d the tribunal noted.\n\n\u201cGod has the power to grant eternal life in heaven or cast one into hell. The complainant provided Scriptural authority for these statements. The complainant clearly has sincere and deeply held beliefs.\u201d\n\nScientists have acknowledged that \u201cfetal cell lines\u201d were used in the production of Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines during the pandemic, though they maintain that the vaccines themselves contain no fetal cells or tissue.\n\n\u201cFetal cell lines are cells that are grown in a laboratory,\u201d the Public Health Association of B.C. explained in a statement. \u201cThey descend from cells taken from fetuses aborted in the 1970s and 1980s.\u201d\n\nThe tribunal cited the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s 2004 ruling in Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem, which affirmed that religious freedoms must be broadly interpreted. \u201cThe state is in no position to be, nor should it become, the arbiter of religious dogma,\u201d the court wrote.\n\nThe decision in that case involved Orthodox Jews in Montr\u00e9al accused of violating condo bylaws by erecting temporary religious shelters on their balconies.\n\nThe court ruled that sincerity of belief, rather than strict doctrinal consistency, was the key test for religious accommodation. \u201cSincerity of belief simply implies an honesty of belief,\u201d the court stated, adding that an individual\u2019s convictions need not be entirely consistent or literal to be protected.",

            "content": "\u201cGLP-1s have been used to treat T2D since 2005, starting with the approval of Byetta, with follow-on products continually improving on efficacy. The most recent, Ozempic and Mounjaro, offer significant advantages over previous products and have accelerated class growth,\u201d \u201cIndeed, the newest generations of GLP-1s and combos lead to 15-25+% weight loss on average, well above prior generations of products.\u201d\n\nAccording to JP Morgan Research, obesity and diabetes will drive the GLP-1 market\u2019s growth to $100 billion by 2030. By that year, there may be 30 million GLP-1 users in the US or around 9% of the total population. Increased demand for obesity medications will benefit some industries, such as biotech, while posing problems for others, such as the food and beverage sector.\n\nAccording to Forbes, Semaglutide, a market leader for obesity drugs and the generic version of Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus, was the most prescribed Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 GLP-1 agonist in 2023. Nearly 88% of all new prescriptions were for it. Tirzepatide, Liraglutide, and Semaglutide are the only three GLP-1 weight-control drugs currently approved by the FDA.\n\nMorgan Stanley Research has increased its prediction for the global market for obesity medications from $77 billion to $105 billion by 2030 in light of this demand increase. In 2023, brand-name obesity drugs brought in almost $6 billion.\n\nMost people have tried to include fitness and weight loss into their everyday routines. Due to the immediate physical and psychological benefits of increasing one\u2019s fitness, the weight loss and fitness sector is rather large globally. The WHO estimates that over one billion individuals worldwide\u2014650 million adults, 340 million adolescents, and 39 million children\u2014are obese. A brand-new class of weight-loss drugs that don\u2019t require rigorous diets or exercise routines appears to be ground-breaking. These innovative drugs can help people who are overweight or obese shed 15% to 20% of their body weight. According to Andy Acker, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, \u201cThis may be the largest opportunity we\u2019ve ever seen in the pharmaceutical industry.\u201d Medication for weight loss is very popular. Investors are comparing the US top in weight-loss medications with the leading in artificial intelligence chips.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Best Weight Loss Drug Stocks to Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) stands against other best weight loss drug stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nChallenges and Accessibility Issues in the GLP-1 Weight Loss Medication Market\n\nThe latest generation of GLP-1 medications are being hailed by some as \u201cmiracle drugs\u201d that can cure obesity. However, not all obese persons can utilize GLP-1s due to their high cost and restricted insurance coverage. At the current rate, treating 40% of obese Americans would cost more than $1 trillion annually, according to Jonathan Gruber, an economics professor and the chairman of MIT\u2019s economics department. That is nearly equal to what the government spends on Medicare as a whole. That is a startling amount.\n\nThe usage of GLP-1 drugs, such as semaglutide, for weight loss has increased over the past decade, whereas among those with type 2 diabetes, it has decreased by roughly 10%, per a report published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The prolonged medicine shortage that results could restrict diabetics\u2019 access to the treatments, the experts caution. As the need for obesity drugs rises, it is imperative to guarantee that diabetic patients have access to GLP-1 medicines, stressed Dr. Yee Hui Yeo, a clinical fellow in Cedars-Sinai\u2019s Karsh Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology.\n\nThe FDA says the shortages are a result of rising demand. The GLP-1 medication scarcity is a \u201cmajor public health concern\u201d that is unlikely to be addressed in 2024, according to the European Medicines Agency, suggesting that the shortages are not limited to the US. NPR reports that some people with diabetes have had to cut back on the number of drugs they can take due to shortages that have made it difficult for them to have their prescriptions filled.\n\nJulia Angeles of Baillie Gifford, Debra Netschert of Jennison Investments, and Gentry Lee of Fayez Serofim were among the panelists on \u201cWeighing the Future of Obesity Drugs,\u201d which discussed the potential of GLP-1 medications, which were initially developed to treat diabetes but are now being used to treat obesity. The evolution of GLP-1 medication delivery from weekly dosages to several daily injections was also noted by Netschert, who also emphasized current attempts to further reduce injection frequency and minimize adverse effects. Notwithstanding their remarkable effectiveness, 1.5 million of the 110 million eligible patients in the US are currently undergoing treatment with GLP-1 drugs, according to Netschert, because of supply constraints.\n\nIn their dispute over who should pay, Angeles claimed that the majority of patients paid cash, while Netschert cited large insurance and Medicare/Medicaid reimbursements. Up to 700 million individuals worldwide may need these drugs outside of the United States, according to Netschert. Notably, the panel discovered that the UK had the fastest approval rate of GLP-1 drugs of any nation, demonstrating the recognized worth of these drugs. In general, UK payors are strict.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks that demonstrated over 10% analyst upside, had a market cap above $2 billion and were backed by strong institutional ownership. We then ranked these stocks based on their price target upside.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs AstraZeneca PLC (AZN) the Best Weight Loss Drug Stock to Buy According to Analysts?\n\nA pharmacy worker distributing prescription medicines to patientsreceiving treatment for oncology, cardiovascular, renal, metabolism and respiratory diseases.\n\nAstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN)\n\nPrice Target Upside: 20.92%\n\nAstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) develops and sells prescription medications across various therapeutic areas, including oncology, cardiovascular, and respiratory diseases. The company is notable for its innovative approach to obesity treatment, with its experimental drug AZD5004 showing promise as an oral GLP-1 receptor antagonist.\n\nAstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN)\u2019s lead candidate for weight loss treatment is AZD5004, an oral GLP-1 receptor antagonist acquired from Eccogene in 2023. In Phase I trials, it showed promising results, with type 2 diabetes patients losing an average of 5.8% of their weight over four weeks. AZD5004 is currently in Phase 2b trials for obesity and type 2 diabetes, with results expected in late 2025 and early 2026. The drug is generally well-tolerated, though some gastrointestinal side effects have been noted at higher doses. Its target market includes obese patients with type 2 diabetes, positioning it as one of the best weight loss drug stocks.\n\nAstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) is also advancing AZD6234, a long-acting amylin receptor agonist, designed to manage appetite and slow gastric emptying. Early trials showed a significant reduction in body weight compared to a placebo, with no major side effects. AZD6234 is in Phase 2 and 2b trials and is aimed at individuals who cannot tolerate existing GLP-1 obesity treatments.\n\nThe company is exploring combination therapies, such as AZD6234 with AZD9550, a GLP-1/glucagon dual agonist, for a once-weekly treatment. Additionally, AZD5004 may be combined with other drugs like Farxiga and AZD0780 to improve efficacy.\n\nAstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) is further strengthening its position in the weight loss market by investing $80 million in SixPeaks Bio, a startup developing a weight loss antibody that preserves muscle mass. The company has an option to acquire SixPeaks once it reaches the investigational new drug filing stage.\n\nOverall, AZN ranks 10th on our list of best weight loss drug stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The WAYPOINT results are clinically meaningful and suggest that tezepelumab could greatly reduce the burden of nasal polyps for patients by nearly eliminating the need for future surgery and corticosteroid use and by significantly reducing nasal polyp size and congestion.\u201d\n\nSharon Barr, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D said, \u201c The WAYPOINT results demonstrate the potential for TEZSPIRE to provide a much-needed option for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. With its first-in-class mode of action, targeting TSLP at the top of the inflammatory cascade, the data add to the body of evidence that tezepelumab can transform care for patients with epithelial-driven inflammatory diseases.\u201d\n\nTable M1: Summary of co-primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints1,2\n\nEndpoint Tezepelumab (n=203) Placebo (n=205) Difference vs. Placebo (95% CI) Co-primary endpoints Total nasal polyp score (range 0-8)* -2.458 (0.114) -0.392 (0.118) -2.065 (-2.389, -1.742) p<0.0001** Nasal congestion score (range 0-3)* -1.743 (0.062) -0.715 (0.064) -1.028 (-1.201, -0.855) p<0.0001** Key secondary endpoints Assessed in the overall trial population Time to first nasal polyp surgery decision (% patients)*** 0.5 (0.0, 2.5) 22.1 (16.4, 28.2) 0.02 (0.00, 0.09) p<0.0001** Time to first systemic glucocorticoid use (% patients)*** 5.2 (1.1, 14.7) 18.3 (13.3, 24.1) 0.12 (0.04, 0.27) p<0.0001** Time to nasal polyp surgery decision and/or systemic glucocorticoid use (% patients)*** 5.7 (1.3, 15.0) 30.6 (24.2, 37.1) 0.08 (0.03, 0.17) p<0.0001** Loss of smell score (range 0-3)* -1.26 (0.06) -0.26 (0.06) -1.00 (-1.18, -0.83) p<0.0001** Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) total score (range 0-110)* -45.02 (1.81) -17.76 (1.84) -27.26 (-32.32, -22.21) p<0.0001** Sinus Computed Tomography Lund\u2013Mackay (CT-LMK) score (range 0-24)* -6.27 (0.24) -0.55 (0.24) -5.72 (-6.39, -5.06) p<0.0001** Total Symptom Score (TSS) (range 0-24)* -10.39 (0.40) -3.50 (0.41) -6.89 (-8.02, -5.76) p<0.0001** Key secondary endpoint Assessed in a subset of patients with co-morbid asthma or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug exacerbated respiratory disease Pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1 in liters)* 0.02 (0.04) 0.03 (0.04) -0.01 (-0.12, 0.11) p=0.9362 *LS mean change (SE) from baseline at Week 52 **Denotes statistically significant at 0.01 level after adjustment for multiplicity.

Postmarketing cases of anaphylaxis have been reported. These reactions can occur within hours of administration, but in some instances have a delayed onset (ie, days). In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient to determine whether to continue or discontinue treatment with TEZSPIRE.\n\nAcute Asthma Symptoms or Deteriorating Disease\n\nTEZSPIRE should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms, acute exacerbations, acute bronchospasm, or status asthmaticus.\n\nAbrupt Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage\n\nDo not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with TEZSPIRE. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy.\n\nParasitic (Helminth) Infection\n\nIt is unknown if TEZSPIRE will influence a patient\u2019s response against helminth infections. Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before initiating therapy with TEZSPIRE. If patients become infected while receiving TEZSPIRE and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue TEZSPIRE until infection resolves.\n\nLive Attenuated Vaccines\n\nThe concomitant use of TEZSPIRE and live attenuated vaccines has not been evaluated. The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided in patients receiving TEZSPIRE.\n\nADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22653%) are pharyngitis, arthralgia, and back pain.\n\nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n\nThere are no available data on TEZSPIRE use in pregnant women to evaluate for any drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Placental transfer of monoclonal antibodies such as tezepelumab-ekko is greater during the third trimester of pregnancy; therefore, potential effects on a fetus are likely to be greater during the third trimester of pregnancy.\n\nPlease see full Prescribing Information, including Patient Information and Instructions for Use.\n\nYou may report side effects related to AstraZeneca products.\n\nNotes\n\nChronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP)\n\nCRSwNP is a complex inflammatory disorder, characterized by persistent inflammation of the nasal mucosa accompanied by benign growths, called nasal polyps.6,7 Nasal polyps and the accompanying inflammation can block nasal passages and lead to breathing problems, difficulty in sense of smell, nasal discharge, facial pain, sleep disturbance and other adverse effects on quality of life.8-10 Current treatments for CRSwNP include intranasal and/or systemic corticosteroids, surgery and biologics.7,10-16\n\nPhase III WAYPOINT trial\n\nWAYPOINT was a double-blind, multi-centre, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tezepelumab in adults with severe CRSwNP.1,2,17 Participants received tezepelumab or placebo, administered via subcutaneous injection.1,2,17 The trial also included a post-treatment follow-up period of 12-24 weeks for participants who completed the 52-week treatment period.1,17\n\nTEZSPIRE\n\nTEZSPIRE\u00ae (tezepelumab) is being developed by AstraZeneca in collaboration with Amgen as a first-in-class human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a key epithelial cytokine that sits at the top of multiple inflammatory cascades and is critical in the initiation and persistence of allergic, eosinophilic, and other types of epithelial-driven inflammation associated with severe asthma and other inflammatory diseases.18,19\n\nTSLP is released in response to multiple epithelial triggers and insults (including allergens, viruses, bacteria, smoke, air pollution and other airborne particles) associated with asthma, CRSwNP, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and other diseases.19,20 Expression of TSLP is increased in these patients and has been correlated with disease severity.10,18 Blocking TSLP can prevent the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells, resulting in the prevention of exacerbations and improved disease control.18,19,21 Tezepelumab acts at the top of the inflammatory cascade and research indicates that targeting TSLP released by the airway and gastrointestinal epithelium may be a potential approach to treating other diseases in the future.18,22,23\n\nTEZSPIRE is approved in the US, the EU and over 60 countries for the add-on maintenance treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with severe asthma.3-5\n\nBeyond CRSwNP, tezepelumab is also in development for other potential indications including COPD and EoE.24,25 In October 2021, tezepelumab was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of EoE. In July 2024, the US FDA granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for tezepelumab for the add-on maintenance treatment of patients with moderate to very severe COPD characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype.\n\nAmgen collaboration\n\nIn 2020, Amgen and AstraZeneca updated a 2012 collaboration agreement for TEZSPIRE. Both companies will continue to share costs and profits equally after payment by AstraZeneca of a mid-single-digit inventor royalty to Amgen. AstraZeneca continues to lead development, and Amgen continues to lead manufacturing. All aspects of the collaboration are under the oversight of joint governing bodies. Under the amended agreement, Amgen and AstraZeneca will jointly commercialize TEZSPIRE in North America. Amgen will record product sales in the US, with AZ recording its share of US profits as Collaboration Revenue. Outside of the US, AstraZeneca will record product sales, with Amgen recording profit share as Other/Collaboration revenue.\n\nAstraZeneca in Respiratory & Immunology\n\nRespiratory & Immunology, part of AstraZeneca BioPharmaceuticals is a key disease area and growth driver to the Company.\n\nAstraZeneca is an established leader in respiratory care with a 50-year heritage and a growing portfolio of medicines in immune-mediated diseases.

            "content": "The Clinical Transformer framework\n\nThe Clinical Transformer framework (Fig. 1a) consists of: input-agnostic modeling for integrating multiple molecular (e.g., omics), clinical, and demographic modalities into a single system, handling sparse features, missing data, and different annotation hierarchies (e.g., gene vs. protein name) (Fig. 1b); self-supervision and transfer learning for analysis of small datasets typical in clinical studies (Fig. 1c); an interpretability module that can suggest biological insights for clinical applications that require high confidence (Fig. 1a); and a generative model for creating synthetic populations of patients by modifying real patient features and predicting virtual responses. This generative AI capability enables the exploration of scenarios that affect resistance or enhance response across a diverse array of patient populations (Fig. 1a).\n\nFig. 1: Overview of the Clinical Transformer framework. a Framework capabilities and analysis overview of the Clinical Transformer to process data to insights. Model interpretability is extracted by using the output embeddings to generate functional modules (group or input features) that are associated with the outcome. The Clinical Transformer is shown as a generative model to recreate a patient\u2019s trajectory of response, using patient embeddings with a perturbation-based approach. Embeddings can also generate synthetic data restricted by certain conditions. b Input data are represented by [Key, Value] pairs, where the key is the feature name and the value corresponds to the numerical score of the feature (e.g., [Age, 20] represents a patient with an age of 20 years). Feature names and values are embedded and fed to a transformer encoder architecture without positional encoding. The special input token [TASK, 1] is added in front of every input sample, and the output of this token is used to predict patient survival or classification outcomes. The special token [MASK] is used for performing the pretraining stage, in which the model is asked to predict the masked token names (corresponding to the masked features). c The Clinical Transformer trained in self-supervised mode uses dataset A to train over a masked-prediction task in which input features are randomly ignored and used as labels. Thus, the objective of the model is to predict the feature name of the ignored input features. After pretraining, the weights of the model can be used to fine-tune into a specialized task such as responder prediction or survival analysis. When input data A are different from input data B, it refers to transfer learning, whereas if the same data are used for both tasks (data A = data B), it is called gradual learning, as the model first learns about the data in an unsupervised way and then specializes on a specific task over the same dataset (e.g., survival prediction). Full size image\n\nThe Clinical Transformer employs three learning strategies: (1) direct learning, in which the model is trained from scratch for a task like survival or response prediction; (2) gradual learning, in which, using the same input data for survival prediction, the model is first trained with self-supervised learning for masked feature prediction, similar to the strategy used to train large language models such as BERT23 (Fig. 1c), and is then fine-tuned for specific tasks (e.g., patient response or survival prediction); and (3) transfer learning, in which a model is pretrained on large amounts of data, using self-supervision for masked feature prediction, and the weights are then used to initialize other models that are fine-tuned to predict survival or patient response. The pretraining step (i.e., gradual learning and/or transfer learning) enables the model to identify general biological and clinical patterns in the data, offering a more informative starting point than random initialization, and allows further refinement of a new model that focuses on patient outcome as a target function (Fig. 1c).\n\nPerformance compared with state-of-the-art survival prediction models\n\nIn total, 12 datasets from clinical trials and real-world data (pan- and cancer-specific), totaling 156,192 patients, were used for multiple tasks, including direct, gradual, and transfer learning (Table 1, Supplementary fig. 1, Methods). We evaluated the Clinical Transformer against common methods like other neural network-based methods24,25,26,27,28, CoxPH, TMB as risk score, and random survival forest, using five independent datasets (Table 2).\n\nTable 1 Datasets used in this study Full size table\n\nTable 2 Overall performance of the Clinical Transformer compared with other modeling approaches. Results are reported as mean c-index \u00b1 standard deviation across the 10 train/test splits Full size table\n\nIn a pan-cancer setting evaluated on a study by Chowell et al.3, which integrated multiple variables into a machine learning model to predict patient response to immunotherapy3, the Clinical Transformer achieved a concordance index (C-index)29 of 0.73, outperforming the Chowell et al.3 random forest model (0.68) and TMB (0.55; recently FDA-approved for this purpose30; Fig. 2a\u2013c). Models were trained using the same training and testing data splits as in the Chowell study, along with the reported prediction scores from the trained random forest model and TMB (Supplementary Note 1).\n\nFig. 2: Clinical Transformer performance and impact of pretraining. a Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves of the Clinical Transformer applied to the Chowell et al.3 dataset, using the median survival score to stratify patients into high and low populations. b KM curves of Chowell et al.3 random forest model used in the testing dataset (using Chowell et al. optimal pan-cancer cutoff = 0.238). c KM curves for evaluating TMB score in the Chowell et al.3 dataset (cutoff = 10 mutations per megabase [mut/mb]).

Source data are provided in the SourceData file. Full size image\n\nTo assess the Clinical Transformer\u2019s ability to stratify patients, we classified patients into high- or low-risk populations using specific cutoffs: 0.239 for the Chowell et al.3 classifier (the optimal cutoff that study reported)3; 10 mutations per megabase (mut/mb) for TMB (the FDA-approved cutoff)30; and the median score derived from the training set for our model. The Clinical Transformer best stratified patients (Fig. 2a), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.29 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21\u20130.40; P = 3e-14), outperforming the Chowell et al.3 random forest model (HR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.25\u20130.47; P = 2e-11), and TMB (HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.50\u20130.97; P = 3e-2) (Fig. 2b, c).\n\nTo evaluate the gradual learning strategy, we pretrained the Clinical Transformer in a self-supervision mode for 30,000 iterations on the complete Chowell et al.3 dataset and then fine-tuned it on the dataset\u2019s survival endpoints. We then evaluated its performance on an independent dataset of 150 patients with non\u2013small-cell lung cancer (74 patients treated with anti-PD-L1 and 76 treated with anti-PD-L1 + anti-CTLA-4 from the MYSTIC trial [NCT02453282]; Supplementary Note 2). The Clinical Transformer showed superior performance with gradual learning (C-index: 0.643; HR: 0.50, 95% CI, 0.34\u20130.74; P = 2.64e-3) compared to direct learning (C-index: 0.616, HR: 0.56, 95% CI, 0.38\u20130.81; P = 3.79e-3) and TMB (C-index: 0.608, HR: 0.68, 95% CI, 0.47\u20130.99; P = 4.4e-2) when trained on the Chowell et al. data and evaluated on MYSTIC data (Supplementary fig. 2, Supplementary Table 1). These results indicate the benefit of gradual learning for predicting survival outcomes with limited datasets.\n\nThe Clinical Transformer outperformed all other approaches in independent evaluations of IO treatment arms in the MYSTIC31 study (anti-PD-L1, anti\u2013PD-L1 + anti\u2013CTLA-4; NCT02453282) and OAK32 trials (anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1; NCT02008227). It achieved survival predictions with C-indexes of 0.67 and 0.669 for MYSTIC and OAK, respectively, compared to the random survival forest model (C-indexes: 0.606 and 0.664), CoxPH (C-indexes: 0.599 and 0.620), and TMB (C-index: 0.589 for MYSTIC) (Table 2).\n\nWe next evaluated the Clinical Transformer\u2019s performance using nonclinical features. Using data from Samstein et al.33, a molecularly-derived study which profiled 1662 tumors from 32 different cancer types using the Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (IMPACT) panel (Supplementary Note 3), the Clinical Transformer achieved a C-index of 0.649, surpassing the random survival forest (0.638), CoxPH (0.594), and TMB (0.543). Using immunogenomic features of the tumor microenvironment (TME), reported by Thorsson et al.34 (Supplementary Note 4), the Clinical Transformer showed improved prediction of overall survival (OS) and similarly outperformed the random survival forest, CoxPH, and TMB models (Table 2).\n\nOverall, the Clinical Transformer consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods, including other neural network and transformer-based models, in predicting patient survival (Table 2).\n\nPretraining with large, unlabeled real-world data to predict patient response in small immunotherapy cohorts\n\n\u201cReal-world data\u201d broadly refers to data generated during routine clinical practice and includes datasets such as UK Biobank35, Flatiron36, TEMPUS37, and GENIE38. GENIE, a cancer registry from 19 leading international cancer centers, links clinical and genomic data to support the identification of biomarkers associated with treatment response. We incorporated the use of transfer learning to take advantage of GENIE data. Similar to large language models (e.g., ChatGPT), which are pretrained on large amounts of data for specific language-related tasks, the Clinical Transformer uses unlabeled real-world data to learn general patterns, which are then fine-tuned (or specialized) for tasks like predicting treatment response or survival in smaller clinical trial datasets.\n\nWe implemented pretraining and transfer learning using GENIE data and fine-tuned on four, smaller independent datasets (Samstein et al., MSK Multi-modal Integration of Data (MIND), MYSTIC, and Dana Farber Cancer Institute [DFCI] datasets; Table 1) to predict patient survival (Supplementary Note 5). Transfer learning based on GENIE improved survival predictions across all datasets (average C-index, 0.617) compared to direct learning (average C-index, 0.583) (Supplementary Table 2), and, on average, reduced training time by 40% (Fig. 2d, e; Supplementary fig. 3). We further evaluated the advantage of transfer learning by using a different independent dataset, from Chowell et al.3, for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on MYSTIC trial data (Fig. 2f; Supplementary Note 6). This achieved a C-index of 0.670 versus 0.628 for direct learning (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, two-sided; P = 0.045). For patient stratification, transfer learning achieved an HR of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.21\u20131.15; cutoff: average median risk) across 10 testing splits, compared to an HR of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.24\u20131.33) without transfer learning. Superior performance via pretraining and transfer learning was also achieved on other tasks than survival such as predicting primary versus metastatic sample origin (Supplementary Note 7; Supplementary Table 3). Together, these analyses underscore the versatility of the Clinical Transformer and its potential to build foundation models adaptable to various downstream clinical tasks.\n\nUsing the Clinical Transformer\u2019s explainability module to identify features associated with survival outcomes\n\nClinical applications require not only prediction results, such as risk or response prediction, but also insight into the features driving these results and their underlying assumptions39. Explainability is important for verifying predictions, increasing human confidence in results, and uncovering the mechanisms behind both successful and erroneous predictions, and has been an important area of research in recent years40,41,42. The Clinical Transformer\u2019s explainability module enables a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing disease biology and their relationships with patient outcomes. To estimate feature importance in the model, we used a feature permutation importance algorithm (Methods). In Chowell et al.3 data, albumin, neutrophil-to-lymphocytes ratio (NLR), prior chemotherapy, TMB, fraction of copy number alterations (FCNA), and hemoglobin (HGB) were the most informative features. In contrast, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) evolutionary divergence (HED), age, sex, and cancer type did not have a strong effect on the model\u2019s outcome (Fig. 3a). The Clinical Transformer\u2019s rankings of feature importance strongly aligned with those reported in the original study3.\n\nFig. 3: Patient stratification and model interpretability. a Global feature permutation importance from the Clinical Transformer applied to the Chowell et al.3 dataset.

Full size image\n\nTo understand how input features relate to immunotherapy response, we stratified patients into four categories based on quartile cutoffs of the model\u2019s predicted survival scores (Fig. 3b): (1) short-term survivors ( < 25th percentile, median OS: 4.4 months); (2) mid-low survivors (25th\u201350th percentile, median OS: 10.3 months); (3) mid-high survivors (50th\u201375th percentiles, median OS: 19 months); and (4) long-term survivors (>75th percentile, median OS: 37 months). Significant differences in albumin and NLR scores were observed between short- and long-term survivors (P < 1e-16). Short-term survivors displayed lower albumin scores (\u03bc = 3.2 g/L, \u03b4 = 0.4 g/L) than long-term survivors (\u03bc = 4.1 g/L, \u03b4 = 0.27 g/L). Short-term survivors also exhibited higher average NLR levels (\u03bc = 12, \u03b4 = 11.8) than long-term survivors (\u03bc = 3.15, \u03b4 = 1.79) (Fig. 3c). The high NLR variance in the short-term survivors suggests that this group may be less stable than the long-term survivor population. Interestingly, the TMB score exhibited statistical significance only when the long-term survivors were compared with all other populations (P < 1e-4). However, no significant differences were observed between short-term survivors and intermediate-term survivors (P = 0.2) or long-term survivors (P = 1.0). Therefore, in accordance with the literature33,43, high TMB scores (e.g. \u226510 mut/mb) could be indicative of a positive IO treatment response, while lower TMB scores may be less informative for predicting IO responses. Moreover, in this dataset, the Clinical Transformer identified that approximately 60% of long-term survivors did not receive chemotherapy prior to IO treatment (P < 1e-4; Fig. 3c). Nevertheless, the generally better outcomes of patients treated with first-line therapies make it unclear if this association is specific to IO response.\n\nUsing the Clinical Transformer\u2019s explainability module to identify key functional groups associated with survival outcomes\n\nThe attention mechanism is a key feature of the Clinical Transformer that distinguishes it from other deep neural-network architectures (e.g., fully connected and convolutional neural networks) and enables the model to identify higher-order patterns in the data, such as interactions between two features that are associated with patient survival and response. While the attention mechanism has been previously employed to interpret model predictions44,45,46, previous studies considered only the attention weights, which can be influenced by nonlinear relationships within other transformer components (e.g., feed-forward network following multi-head attention, layer normalization) and do not fully capture the underlying significance of the features47,48,49. We implemented a more direct approach for assessing interpretability by calculating the cosine similarity between the model\u2019s feature and outcome embeddings, which are downstream of the transformer\u2019s neural-network components and encode both linear and nonlinear relationships between input features and clinical outcomes (Fig. 1b). Cosine similarity quantifies the relationship type and strength between two features: high positive value suggests redundancy, near-zero value suggests independence and/or orthogonality, and negative value suggests inverse relationships. This approach leverages information flow through the entire transformer network instead of relying on scores derived from individual attention heads in the model.\n\nIn the Chowell et al3. dataset, albumin and TMB were the most orthogonal features (cosine similarity of 0.09; Supplementary Table 4, Supplementary fig. 4), suggesting they contribute complementary information to survival prediction. This aligns with previous studies showing that albumin enhances immunotherapy response predictions when combined with TMB50. We then grouped the Chowell input features into four \u201cfunctional groups\u201d based on their cosine similarity (Methods), where a group contains interacting features that share similar information related to survival outcomes (Fig. 3d):\n\nCluster 1 included a grouping of TMB, MSI score, and HLA\u2013loss of heterozygosity (LOH), with a mean cosine similarity of 0.65 (0.59, 0.68, and 0.70 cosine similarities for MSI-TMB, HLA-LOH\u2013MSI, and HLA-LOH\u2013TMB interactions, respectively; Supplementary Table 4), implying that these three features may share a common underlying mechanism. Both MSI and TMB have been linked to improved outcomes with immunotherapy and anti\u2013PD-1 therapy has been tumor-agnostically approved in patients with either of these markers9,51. Conversely, HLA-LOH has been previously associated with resistance to immunotherapy52. The well-documented association between high MSI and high TMB53,54,55,56 supports the grouping of these features. A potential connection between these two features and HLA-LOH\u2014previously shown to have a non-linear relationship with TMB52\u2014is the process of antigen availability and presentation. TMB and MSI are both surrogates for neoantigen availability, and tumors with higher neoantigen loads face greater pressure to evade immune recognition through the loss of HLA.\n\nCluster 2 included patient-related variables, such as albumin, body mass index, HED, HGB, NLR, platelets, and age. These markers primarily reflect overall health and inflammatory status and have been associated with differential benefits from immunotherapy, though it remains unclear if they are predictive versus prognostic57,58,59,60. Interestingly, HED, a molecular-based biomarker derived from germline DNA, clustered with clinical laboratory markers rather than tumor-derived molecular features like TMB, MSI, or HLA-LOH. This distinction may arise because HED is derived from germline DNA and represents overall immune health and functionality, associating with overall risk of cancer and protection from infection61,62. Cluster 3 included FCNA, prior chemotherapy, and sex, with a mean cosine similarity of 0.60. Finally, cluster 4, which included cancer type, drug class, and tumor stage, had the highest average within-cluster cosine similarity (cosine, >0.95), perhaps reflecting the underlying dependencies among these features in clinical practice.\n\nWe then applied this approach to the Samstein et al. dataset33, clustering tumor tissue gene-level mutational features from the MSK IMPACT panel (469 genes; Supplementary Note 8) into 50 functional groups based on cosine similarity. The mutational features were ranked by their association with immunotherapy benefit (Fig. 3e, Supplementary fig. 5). We aggregated each functional group of multiple genes into a single binary variable: if any gene in a group was mutated, the group was assigned the value 1; if none were mutated, it was assigned 0.\n\nTwo functional groups, denoted C47 (HR = 1.32; APC, PIK3CA, and TP53) and C48 (HR = 1.43; KEAP1 and STK11), were associated with short-term survival with immunotherapy. These findings align with prior studies showing the negative prognostic impact of KEAP1 and STK11 for both immunotherapy and chemotherapy63,64,65,66. While the impact of mutations in APC, PIK3CA and TP53 are less consistent67,68,69,70,71,72, these genes are key drivers of several tumors, with their impact likely varying depending on the specific setting and therapeutic regimen.\n\nFunctional group C8 contained AKT2, BTK, CDC73, HLA-B, IKBKE, INPPL1, RFWD2, TRAF2, and WHSC1 and was associated with regulation of the immune response (GO:0002682, P = 8.69e-4). We used this group to stratify patients across independent IO-treated datasets and found a significant and selective benefit of IO treatment in both Samstein et al33. and Miao et al73. pan-cancer IO-treated datasets (HR = 0.58, P = 3.3e-4; HR = 0.42, P = 4.8e-2, respectively), whereas no meaningful stratification was observed for pan-cancer non\u2013IO-treated patients in the TCGA dataset (HR = 0.86, P = 4.6e-2; Fig. 3f).\n\nTranslating the Clinical Transformer to simple and interpretable linear models\n\nWe explored whether these functional groups could be leveraged to construct a simple linear model. Binary variables representing functional groups were used as inputs to a CoxPH model to predict patient OS. Multiple functional groups could be used to construct a multivariate CoxPH model.\n\nTo test this approach, we selected the top 10 molecularly derived functional groups from the Samstein et al33. dataset, which showed the strongest relationship with OS (Fig. 3e), as inputs to a multivariate CoxPH model to predict patient OS (Methods). The CoxPH model achieved an average C-index of 0.63 on held-out test splits from Samstein et al. data (Fig. 4a), with an HR of 0.53 on the Miao et al. validation dataset73 (Fig. 4b); whereas the Clinical Transformer with all features (including clinical and demographics) resulted in a C-index of 0.65 on held-out test splits from Samstein et al. data (Table 2). In contrast to CoxPH and random CoxPH, the Clinical Transformer guided the selection of the functional groups, and the performance could not be recovered using a random selection of functional groups (C-index = 0.55 on test splits from Samstein et al.; HR = 0.76 for Miao et al. dataset73) or a random set of 10 hallmark gene sets (C-index = 0.58 on test splits from Samstein et al.; HR = 0.76 for Miao et al73. dataset) (Supplementary fig. 6).\n\nFig. 4: Using top functional groups to yield a simple and interpretable linear model. a CoxPH model trained on top 10 functional groups derived from Clinical Transformer trained on Samstein et al.33 discovery dataset.

Full size image\n\nStratifying the population by the median risk score cutoff derived from the discovery dataset (Samstein et al.33), the CoxPH model achieved an average HR of 0.45 across testing splits (Fig. 4a). In the pan-cancer IO-treated population from the Miao et al.73 dataset, the CoxPH model outperformed TMB (median cutoff), achieving an HR of 0.53 (Fig. 4b). However, using non\u2013IO-treated patients in the TCGA dataset, the CoxPH model did not show significant stratification (HR = 0.99). Further evaluation in melanoma datasets showed similar trends. In the Miao et al. dataset73, the functional-group CoxPH model achieved an HR of 0.52, outperforming TMB (HR = 0.72). The same pattern was observed in the Van Allen et al.74 dataset, where the CoxPH model achieved an HR of 0.72, outperforming TMB (HR = 0.86; Fig. 4c). Conversely, the opposite trend was observed in the TCGA melanoma dataset (Fig. 4c).\n\nThese results demonstrate the potential to translate patterns recognized with complex nonlinear models, such as the Clinical Transformer, into interpretable linear models, such as CoxPH. In addition, our approach enables clearer understanding of feature-outcome relationships and could accelerate the generation of biomarkers insights for clinical development.\n\nClinical Transformer embeddings capture biological patterns associated with response\n\nSimilar to language models that generate word embeddings encoding both word-level characteristics and contextual semantics11,75,76,77, the Clinical Transformer\u2019s outcome embeddings encode relationships among the molecular and clinical features in the context of a clinical endpoint (e.g., survival time) that the model was trained to predict. These embeddings may capture higher-order dependencies that unravel biological mechanisms related to response, resistance, or survival. To visualize these relationships, we transformed the 128-dimension outcome embeddings space (Fig. 1b) into a two-dimensional space using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) transformation, a widely used computational biology method78,79. By clustering and labeling the outcome embeddings and projecting them onto a UMAP plane, we can explore patterns related to response level, treatment lines, and other clinical outcomes.\n\nFigure 5a presents an example projection for the patients in the Chowell et al.3 dataset, where patients are organized in a clinically meaningful order on the embeddings plane of the Clinical Transformer. The left panel in Fig. 5a shows a clear trajectory from short-term survivors to long-term survivors for IO-treated patients. The right panel highlights distinct separation of two patient groups, one with prior chemotherapy and the other without.\n\nFig. 5: Impact of functional groups on patient response to IO treatment. a Two-dimensional projection of patient embeddings with UMAP labeled by response of patient populations (left) and by prior chemotherapy (\u2018chemo,\u2019 right).

Boxplots: centerline, median; box limits, quartile 1 and 3; box whiskers, 1.5x interquartile range; diamonds, outliers; dots, data points. Source data are provided in the SourceData file. Full size image\n\nExploring alternatives of clinical response for patients using Clinical Transformer perturbation analysis\n\nTo explore alternative responses of short-time survivors, we separately perturbed each of their input features (i.e., artificially changing the value of a feature such as NLR, TMB, or gene or pathway expression) while keeping the other features fixed. By comparing the predicted survival score of the patients before and after perturbation (Methods, Supplementary Note 9), we identified patients who may benefit from specific feature modulations related to the therapy\u2019s mechanism of action (Fig. 5b). By examining these patients\u2019 other features, we may identify new segments for potential treatment. Similarly, understanding patients whose disease failed to improve may inform potential resistance mechanisms and combination opportunities.\n\nIndividual feature perturbation (Fig. 5c) showed that patient sensitivity can vary: some were affected by perturbations to one or two features; others showed no sensitivity. Figure 5c (top) shows an example of a patient who was more sensitive to changes when TMB and NLR were perturbed together rather than individually. Figure 5c (bottom) depicts a patient who was not sensitive to NLR or TMB perturbations, individually or together.\n\nNext, we examined all pairwise combinations of features to observe whether any two features influenced survival outcomes. Interestingly, interactions between features from different clusters (i.e., clusters indicated in Fig. 3d) had a stronger impact on survival than interactions within the same cluster (binomial test between clusters, P = 0.004; within clusters, P = 0.58; Fig. 5d). TMB-NLR exhibited the most impactful pairwise-feature interaction, followed by TMB-HGB and TMB-albumin (Fig. 5d). This analysis also revealed two population subtypes: a variant population, which exhibited a strong change in survival score when either of those features were perturbed (Fig. 5e), and an invariant population, which was unaffected by perturbations (Fig. 5f). We further investigated patients that exhibited improvement of their predicted survival from short- to long-term (patients labeled Q1 by using the cutoff defined from the training set). As expected, patients from the variant population exhibited values within the normal ranges for albumin, HGB, and platelets (albumin, 3.4\u20135.4; NLR, 1\u20133; HGB, 12\u201317; platelets, 150\u2013450; Fig. 5g, blue boxes). These values may indicate better health compared to patients with values outside of the normal ranges. As expected, high values of TMB along with low values of NLR tended to produce the greatest changes in survival scores for this population (Fig. 5g). In contrast, the invariant population generally exhibited poorer health, with albumin and HGB outside the normal range (Fig. 5g).\n\nIdentification of potential drivers of response and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment via perturbation of a T-cell gene expression signature\n\nWe used the Clinical Transformer to train a survival model for melanoma patients (skin cutaneous melanoma [SKCM], IO treatment naive) in TCGA, using tumor microenvironment (TME) gene signatures defined in Bagaev et al.80. Quartile survival groups resulting from this training are illustrated in Fig. 6a.\n\nFig. 6: Clinical Transformer and TME on SKCM data. a Survival stratification of SKCM patients from TCGA. Patients are grouped into quartiles from the Clinical Transformer survival score. The solid line represents the mean survival time across the 10 testing splits. Shaded regions represent the 95% confidence interval. b UMAP projection of patient embeddings in the TCGA SKCM dataset. c Effect of T-cell perturbations (variant and invariant populations) in TCGA SKCM dataset exclusive to patients in the Q1 and Q2 populations.

N for each comparison can be found in Supplementary Table 6. Source data are provided in the SourceData file. Full size image\n\nHaving established a model of the TME\u2019s impact on survival in melanoma patients (Supplementary fig. 7, Supplementary fig. 8; Bagaev et al.80), we investigated whether it could help identify drivers of response and resistance to checkpoint blockade in this setting. Figure 6b presents the UMAP projection of generative embeddings of the patients from this model. To simulate the T-cell infiltration and activation expected during checkpoint blockade, we perturbed the T-cell gene expression signature in Q1 and Q2 patients of the TCGA-SKCM cohort. Similar to the preceding section, this perturbation generated a variant group of patients, where increased T-cell gene expression improved survival, and an invariant group, where it did not. Changes from these perturbations are visualized on the UMAP plane in Fig. 6c, and gene expression signature differences between the variant and invariant groups are presented in Fig. 6d (Supplementary fig. 9). The variant group, which may benefit from checkpoint blockade, demonstrated significantly increased expression of signatures associated with major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and effector immune cells. This suggests, as previously found80, that some preexisting immunity to the tumor and functional antigen presentation are key determinants of checkpoint blockade benefit. In contrast, the invariant group, potentially resistant to checkpoint blockade, displayed elevated signatures of angiogenesis, matrix remodeling, and infiltration of cancer-associated macrophages and fibroblasts. These signatures align with known pathways of resistance to checkpoint blockade, such as T-cell suppression by intratumoral macrophages and T-cell exclusion from the microenvironment by cancer-associated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix changes. While the role of angiogenesis in checkpoint blockade response is less well established, its role in blood vessels may impact T-cell access to tumors.\n\nTo further validate these findings, we assessed if the identified signatures could stratify melanoma patients treated with checkpoint blockade. Gene signatures were ranked by the magnitude of difference between variant and invariant populations (Supplemental Table 5). The four signatures most associated with the variant population were effector cells, MHC-I, checkpoint molecules, and natural killer cells, while the four signatures least associated were endothelium, cancer-associated fibroblasts, angiogenesis, and matrix remodeling. These eight signatures were examined in three independent studies, selecting patients who received second-line IO treatment and had pre-IO therapy tumor biopsies (Fig. 6e; Supplementary Table 6)74,81,82. While survival stratification differences were not statistically significant, several signatures showed consistent trends for differential HRs across studies. For example, high versus low levels of the effector cell signature resulted in HRs of 0.53, 0.53, and 0.35 for survival across the three studies, respectively, whereas matrix remodeling produced HRs of 3.65, 1.46, and 1.89 (Supplementary Table 6).\n\nThese results demonstrate the potential for the Clinical Transformer to provide insights into response and resistance, even in early clinical data lacking the treatment under investigation.",

Postmarketing cases of anaphylaxis have been reported. These reactions can occur within hours of administration, but in some instances have a delayed onset (i.e., days). In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient to determine whether to continue or discontinue treatment with TEZSPIRE.\n\nAcute Asthma Symptoms or Deteriorating Disease\n\nTEZSPIRE should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms, acute exacerbations, acute bronchospasm, or status asthmaticus.\n\nAbrupt Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage\n\nDo not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with TEZSPIRE. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy.\n\nParasitic (Helminth) Infection\n\nIt is unknown if TEZSPIRE will influence a patient's response against helminth infections. Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before initiating therapy with TEZSPIRE. If patients become infected while receiving TEZSPIRE and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue TEZSPIRE until infection resolves.\n\nLive Attenuated Vaccines\n\nThe concomitant use of TEZSPIRE and live attenuated vaccines has not been evaluated. The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided in patients receiving TEZSPIRE.\n\nADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 3% ) are pharyngitis, arthralgia, and back pain.\n\nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n\nThere are no available data on TEZSPIRE use in pregnant women to evaluate for any drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Placental transfer of monoclonal antibodies such as tezepelumab-ekko is greater during the third trimester of pregnancy; therefore, potential effects on a fetus are likely to be greater during the third trimester of pregnancy.\n\nPlease see the full Prescribing Information including Patient Information and Instructions for Use.\n\nYou may report side effects related to AstraZeneca products by clicking here.\n\nAbout TEZSPIRE\u00ae (tezepelumab-ekko)\n\nTEZSPIRE is a first-in-class human monoclonal antibody that works on the primary source of inflammation: the airway epithelium, which is the first point of contact for viruses, allergens, pollutants and other environmental insults. Specifically, TEZSPIRE targets and blocks TSLP, a key epithelial cytokine that sits at the top of multiple inflammatory cascades and initiates an overreactive immune response to allergic, eosinophilic and other types of airway inflammation associated with severe asthma.18,19 TSLP is released in response to multiple triggers associated with asthma exacerbations, including allergens, viruses and other airborne particles.\n\nExpression of TSLP is increased in the airways of patients with asthma and has been correlated with disease severity.8,18 Blocking TSLP may prevent the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells, resulting in the prevention of asthma exacerbations and improved asthma control.18-20 By working at the top of the cascade, TEZSPIRE helps stop inflammation at the source and has the potential to treat a broad population of severe asthma patients.10,18,21\n\nTEZSPIRE is currently approved for the treatment of severe asthma in the U.S. , Europe, Japan, and more than 50 countries across the globe.22-25 It is approved as a pre-filled, single-use pen and auto-injector for self-administration in the U.S. and Europe .22, 23\n\nBeyond severe asthma and CRSwNP, TEZSPIRE is also in development for other potential indications including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).26,27 Regulatory filings for TEZSPIRE in CRSwNP are currently under review by regulatory authorities in multiple regions. In October 2021, tezepelumab was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of EoE. In July 2024, the U.S. FDA granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for tezepelumab for the add-on maintenance treatment of patients with moderate to very severe COPD characterised by an eosinophilic phenotype.\n\nAbout Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP [nasal polyps])\n\nCRSwNP is a complex inflammatory disorder characterized by persistent inflammation of the nasal mucosa accompanied by benign growths, called nasal polyps.4,5 Nasal polyps can block nasal passages and lead to breathing problems, difficulty in sense of smell, nasal discharge, facial pain, sleep disturbance and other adverse effects on quality of life.6-8\n\nEpithelial dysfunction and inflammation are important characteristics of chronic rhinosinusitis and impede the ability of the epithelium to act as a physical and immunological barrier against the external environment.9 Estimates suggest that up to 56% of patients with CRSwNP have comorbid asthma. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an epithelial cytokine that has been implicated in shared pathophysiological processes underlying severe asthma and CRSwNP.10,11\n\nCurrent treatments for CRSwNP include intranasal and/or systemic corticosteroids, surgery and biologic medication.5,8,12-17\n\nAbout the Phase 3 WAYPOINT Trial\n\nWAYPOINT is a double-blind, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tezepelumab in adults with severe CRSwNP.1,2,3 Participants received tezepelumab or placebo, administered via subcutaneous injection. The trial also included a post-treatment follow-up period of 12-24 weeks for participants who completed the 52-week treatment period.1,2,3\n\nThe co-primary endpoints of the trial were change from baseline in total nasal polyp size, measured by the endoscopic total Nasal Polyp Score, and change from baseline in bi-weekly mean nasal congestion, measured by the participant-reported Nasal Congestion Score evaluated as part of the daily Nasal Polyposis Symptom Diary.3\n\nKey secondary endpoints included loss of smell; improvement in disease-specific health-related quality of life as measured by SinoNasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) score; Lund-Mackay score; time to surgery decision and/or systemic corticosteroids for nasal polyposis; time to nasal polyposis surgery decision; time to systemic corticosteroids for nasal polyposis; Nasal Polyposis Symptom Diary total symptom score and pre-bronchodilator FEV1 in patients with comorbid asthma and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease/NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (NSAID-ERD) at Week 52.3\n\nAbout the Amgen and AstraZeneca Collaboration\n\nIn 2020, Amgen and AstraZeneca updated the 2012 collaboration agreement for TEZSPIRE. Both companies will continue to share costs and profits equally after payment by AstraZeneca of a mid-single-digit royalty to Amgen. AstraZeneca continues to lead development and Amgen continues to lead manufacturing. All aspects of the collaboration are under the oversight of joint governing bodies. Under the amended agreement, in North America , Amgen, as the principal, recognizes product sales of TEZSPIRE in the United States , and AstraZeneca, as the principal, recognizes product sales of TEZSPIRE in Canada . AstraZeneca leads commercialization for TEZSPIRE outside North America .\n\nAbout Amgen\n\nAmgen discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative medicines to help millions of patients in their fight against some of the world's toughest diseases.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd. or Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.), the performance of Otezla\u00ae (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), our acquisitions of Teneobio, Inc., ChemoCentryx, Inc., or Horizon Therapeutics plc (including the prospective performance and outlook of Horizon's business, performance and opportunities, any potential strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities expected as a result of such acquisition, and any projected impacts from the Horizon acquisition on our acquisition-related expenses going forward), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems on our business, outcomes, progress, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nNo forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.\n\nOur results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico , and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize any of the strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities arising from the Horizon acquisition, and such benefits, synergies or opportunities may take longer to realize than expected. We may not be able to successfully integrate Horizon, and such integration may take longer, be more difficult or cost more than expected. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach of our information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\n\nAny scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for our products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products. The products are not approved for the investigational use(s) discussed in this news release, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the products for these uses.\n\nCONTACT: Amgen, Thousand Oaks\n\nKate Meyer, 872-867-0754 (media)\n\nElissa Snook, 609-251-1407 (media)\n\nJustin Claeys, 805-313-9775 (investors)\n\nReferences:\n\nLipworth, BJ, Han JK, et al.

The recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission, which has the authority to grant marketing authorizations for medicines in the EU.\n\nIn the DESTINY-Breast06 trial, ENHERTU demonstrated a 38% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death versus chemotherapy in patients with chemotherapy-na\u00efve HR positive, HER2 low metastatic breast cancer (n=713; hazard ratio [HR] 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52-0.75; p<0.0001) as assessed by blinded independent review (BICR). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 13.2 months (95% CI: 11.4-15.2) in the ENHERTU arm compared to 8.1 months (95% CI: 7.0-9.0) in the chemotherapy arm.\n\nConfirmed objective response rate (ORR) in the HER2 low population was 56.5% (95% CI: 51.2-61.7) in the ENHERTU arm versus 32.2% in the chemotherapy arm (95% CI: 27.4-37.3). There were nine complete responses (CRs) and 194 partial responses (PRs) seen in the ENHERTU arm, compared to zero CRs and 114 PRs in the chemotherapy arm. Median duration of response (DOR) was 14.1 months in the ENHERTU arm versus 8.6 months in the chemotherapy arm.\n\nIn the overall trial population of patients with chemotherapy-na\u00efve HR positive, HER2 low or HER2 ultralow metastatic breast cancer (n=866), ENHERTU achieved a similar 36% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death versus chemotherapy (HR 0.64; 95% CI: 0.54-0.76; p<0.0001). A median PFS of 13.2 months (95% CI: 12.0-15.2) was seen in patients treated with ENHERTU compared to 8.1 months (95% CI: 7.0-9.0) in patients treated with chemotherapy.\n\nConfirmed ORR in the overall trial population was 57.3% (95% CI: 52.5-62.0) in the ENHERTU arm versus 31.2% (95% CI: 26.8-35.8) in the chemotherapy arm. There were 13 CRs and 237 PRs seen in the ENHERTU arm, compared to zero CRs and 134 PRs in the chemotherapy arm. Median DOR was 14.3 months in the ENHERTU arm versus 8.6 months in the chemotherapy arm.\n\nAn exploratory analysis of the HER2 ultralow population (n=153; HR 0.78; 95% CI: 0.50-1.21) showed the clinically meaningful improvement in PFS was consistent between patients with HER2 low and HER2 ultralow expression, with 13.2 months (95% CI: 9.8-17.3) in patients treated with ENHERTU compared to 8.3 months (95% CI: 5.8-15.2) in those treated with chemotherapy. Confirmed ORR was 61.8% (95% CI: 50.0-72.8) in the ENHERTU arm versus 26.3% in the chemotherapy arm (95% CI: 16.9-37.7). There were four CRs and 43 PRs seen in the ENHERTU arm, compared to zero CRs and 20 PRs in the chemotherapy arm. Median DOR was 14.3 months in the ENHERTU arm versus 14.1 months in the chemotherapy arm.\n\n\u201c ENHERTU is the first HER2 directed treatment and antibody drug conjugate to show a progression free survival of more than one year in patients with HER2 low or HER2 ultralow metastatic breast cancer following endocrine therapy,\u201d said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. \u201c The CHMP recommendation is encouraging and supports our goal of further developing and advancing the way breast cancer is classified and treated.\u201d\n\n\u201c Endocrine therapy is typically used in the initial treatment of HR positive metastatic breast cancer but as the disease progresses the benefit of continued endocrine therapy is limited and subsequent standard of care chemotherapy is associated with poor outcomes,\u201d said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology Hematology R&D, AstraZeneca. \u201c ENHERTU has the potential to be the first HER2 directed treatment for patients in the EU with HR positive, HER2 low or HER2 ultralow metastatic breast cancer directly following endocrine therapy, which would mark an important shift in how patients in this setting are treated.\u201d\n\nIn DESTINY-Breast06, the safety profile of ENHERTU was consistent with previous breast cancer clinical trials with no new safety concerns identified. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring in 5% or more of patients treated with ENHERTU were neutropenia (20.7%), leukopenia (6.9%) and anemia (5.8%). Interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis occurred in 11.3% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The majority of ILD or pneumonitis events were low grade (grade 1 [n=7; 1.6%] or grade 2 [n=36; 8.3%]). There were three grade 3 ILD events (0.7%), zero grade 4 events and three grade 5 events (0.7%) as determined by an independent adjudication committee.\n\nENHERTU is already approved in more than 75 countries, including the EU, for patients with HER2 low metastatic breast cancer who have received a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY-Breast04 trial.\n\nAbout DESTINY-Breast06\n\nDESTINY-Breast06 is a global, randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) versus investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, paclitaxel or nab paclitaxel) in patients with HR positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) or HER2 ultralow (defined as IHC 0 with membrane staining) advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients in the trial had no prior chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease and received at least two lines of prior endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting. Patients also were eligible if they had received one prior line of endocrine therapy combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in the metastatic setting and experienced disease progression within six months of starting first-line treatment or received endocrine therapy as an adjuvant treatment and experienced disease recurrence within 24 months.\n\nHER2 IHC status was confirmed by a central laboratory and determined based on the most recent evaluable HER2 IHC sample prior to randomization. In tumor samples from patients screened for trial eligibility, nearly two-thirds of tumors previously assessed as IHC 0 at a local laboratory were re-classified as HER2 low or HER2 ultralow upon central analysis of the archival tumor sample. It was also observed that approximately 85% to 90% patients with HR positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer may have actionable levels of HER2 expression.\n\nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY-Breast06 is PFS in the HR positive, HER2 low patient population as measured by BICR. Key secondary endpoints include PFS by BICR in the overall trial population (HER2 low and HER2 ultralow), OS in patients in the HER2 low patient population and OS in the overall trial population. Other secondary endpoints include ORR, DOR, time to first subsequent treatment or death, time to second subsequent treatment or death and safety. Analysis of the HER2 ultralow subgroup was not powered to demonstrate statistical significance.\n\nDESTINY-Breast06 enrolled 866 patients (n=713 for HER2 low and n=153 for HER2 ultralow) in Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and South America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\nAbout Breast Cancer and HER2 Expression\n\nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide.1 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022 with more than 665,000 deaths globally.1 In Europe, approximately 557,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually.2 While survival rates are high for those diagnosed with early breast cancer, only about 30% of patients diagnosed with or who progress to metastatic disease are expected to live five years following diagnosis.3\n\nHR positive, HER2 negative is the most common breast cancer subtype, accounting for approximately 70% of all breast cancers.3 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors, including breast cancer.4 Patients with high levels of HER2 expression (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) are classified as HER2 positive and treated with HER2 targeted therapies, representing approximately 15% to 20% of all breast cancers.5 Historically, tumors that were not classified as HER2 positive were classified as HER2 negative, despite the fact that many of these tumors still carry some level of HER2 expression.6\n\nEndocrine therapy is widely given consecutively in the early lines of treatment for HR positive metastatic breast cancer. However, after initial therapy, further efficacy with additional endocrine treatment is often limited.7 The current standard of care following endocrine therapy is chemotherapy, which is associated with poor response rates and outcomes.7,8,9,10\n\nPrior to the approval of ENHERTU in HER2 low metastatic breast cancer based on the DESTINY-Breast04 trial, there were no targeted therapies approved specifically for patients with HER2 low expression.11 There are no targeted therapies specifically approved in the EU for patients with HER2 ultralow expression.12\n\nAbout ENHERTU\n\nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo\u2019s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca\u2019s ADC scientific platform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide-based cleavable linkers.\n\nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 75 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or in-situ hybridization (ISH)+) breast cancer who have received a prior anti-HER2-based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy based on the results from the DESTINY-Breast03 trial.\n\nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 75 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) breast cancer who have received a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY-Breast04 trial.\n\nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) or HER2 ultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA-approved test, that have progressed on one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting based on the results from the DESTINY-Breast06 trial.\n\nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 50 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2 (ERBB2) mutations, as detected by a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results from the DESTINY-Lung02 and/or DESTINY-Lung05 trials. Continued approval in China and the U.S. for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\n\nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 65 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab-based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY-Gastric01, DESTINY-Gastric02 and/or DESTINY-Gastric06 trials. Continued approval in China for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\n\nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Brazil, Israel, Russia and the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options based on efficacy results from the DESTINY-PanTumor02, DESTINY-Lung01 and DESTINY-CRC02 trials. Continued approval for this indication in the U.S. may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\n\nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program\n\nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.\n\nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration\n\nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU in March 2019 and DATROWAY\u00ae in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and DATROWAY.\n\nAbout the ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo\n\nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven ADCs in clinical development crafted from two distinct ADC technology platforms discovered in-house by Daiichi Sankyo.\n\nThe ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo\u2019s DXd ADC Technology where each ADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide-based cleavable linkers. The DXd ADC portfolio currently consists of ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and DATROWAY, a TROP2 directed ADC, which are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd), a HER3 directed ADC, ifinatamab deruxtecan (I-DXd), a B7-H3 directed ADC, and raludotatug deruxtecan (R-DXd), a CDH6 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with Merck & Co., Inc, Rahway, NJ, USA. DS-3939, a TA-MUC1 directed ADC, is being developed by Daiichi Sankyo.\n\nThe second Daiichi Sankyo ADC platform consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a modified pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) payload. DS-9606, a CLDN6 directed PBD ADC, is the first of several planned ADCs in clinical development utilizing this platform.\n\nIfinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan, raludotatug deruxtecan, DS-3939 and DS-9606 are investigational medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\nAbout Daiichi Sankyo\n\nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of society that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the world.

(NYSE American: AIM) (\u201cAIM\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) today announced that Paul Goepfert, MD, of the University of Alabama-Birmingham (\u201cUAB\u201d), has agreed to act as the Principal Investigator for the company\u2019s planned clinical study in the combination of Ampligen and AstraZeneca\u2019s FluMist as an intranasal vaccine for influenza, including avian influenza. Ampligen would serve as a vaccine adjuvant.\n\nThis will be a follow-up study to a previous clinical trial at UAB, which indicated that intranasal delivery of Ampligen after the intranasal delivery of the FluMist seasonal influenza vaccine not only increased the immune response to seasonal variants in the vaccine by greater than four-fold, but most importantly induced cross-reactive secretory Immunoglobulin A against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus strains H5N1, H7N9 and H7N3.\n\nPaul Goepfert, MD, Director for the Alabama Vaccine Research Clinic, stated: \u201cI\u2019m excited for the opportunity to follow-up on my previous work regarding the combination of Ampligen and FluMist, especially with the rising threat of avian influenza.\u201d\n\nAIM has engaged Amarex Clinical Research, its Clinical Research Organization, with the preparation of an Investigational New Drug application and the eventual management of the planned clinical study. A key next step will be to identify study funding through industry or governmental grants.\n\nAIM CEO Thomas K. Equels states: \u201cOur strong belief in the potential of a second Ampligen and FluMist study in humans stems directly from the pre-clinical and clinical work performed with Ampligen and multiple influenza variants, including in the original UAB study. We believe that the U.S. government \u2014 which has made the growing threat of avian influenza a top priority \u2014 should take a long and close look at this data when deciding how best to prepare for a potential epidemic. Rather than spend perhaps billions of dollars on the lengthy development of a new mRNA vaccine, the government should instead consider the combination of Ampligen and FluMist, which would be no more than $10 million in development costs and far quicker to develop, since it already has strong human and non-human primate data suggesting its potential preventive efficacy against avian influenza. AIM believes that the potential for a rapidly deployable vaccine that includes Ampligen is clear.\u201d\n\nRead more about the Ampligen-involved avian influenza pre-clinical and clinical work here.\n\nAbout AIM ImmunoTech Inc.\n\nAIM ImmunoTech Inc., an Ocala, Florida-based company, is an immuno-pharma company focused on the research and development of therapeutics to treat multiple types of cancers, immune disorders and viral diseases, including COVID-19. The Company\u2019s lead product is a first-in-class investigational drug called Ampligen\u00ae (rintatolimod), a dsRNA and highly selective TLR3 agonist immuno-modulator with broad spectrum activity in clinical trials for globally important cancers, viral diseases and disorders of the immune system.\n\nFor more information, please visit aimimmuno.com and connect with the Company on X, LinkedIn, and Facebook.\n\nCautionary Statement\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \u201cPSLRA\u201d).

            "content": "Pharmaceutical MNCs\u2019 India story, though, is not just about selling medicines. They are, in fact, shaping Indian healthcare by introducing innovative technologies, groundbreaking medicines and patient-centric programmes on their own as well as through partnerships with Indian firms. They are also deepening their India presence through research and development hubs, clinical trials and skill development. Almost every MNC pharmaceutical major has set up or is setting up a global capability centre (GCC) in India. \u201cThese centres of excellence (CoEs) play a significant role in generating jobs, upskilling the workforce and increasing the country\u2019s knowledge base. They provide employment to over 90,000 people across India,\u201d says Anil Matai, director general, Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI), the association of research-based global pharmaceutical companies in the country. A recent report by BCG and OPPI says 70% global pharmaceutical companies expect over 10% annual growth in India over the next five years, while 85% OPPI member companies plan to invest over $20 million on an average over the next five years. OPPI says India\u2019s pharmaceutical market can touch $120 billion by 2030, which means big headroom for growth. Can the MNCs grab this opportunity?\n\nCollaboration Is Key\n\nThe year 2025 marks two decades of product patent protection for medicines in India. This was expected to expand the market share of foreign MNCs but domestic companies continue to grow fast. Market intelligence firm IQVIA\u2019s July-September 2024 quarter business insights report says revenues of domestic pharmaceutical firms grew 8% while that of MNCs grew 7% in Q3 2024. There are several factors behind this. First, new products from global pharmaceutical companies are a small part of the Indian market. Second, these MNCs cannot match the distribution network of domestic drug makers. Third, India is a price-sensitive market that prefers affordable alternatives launched by the domestic players. All this has forced global pharmaceutical companies to build their strategy around collaboration with local firms to launch India-specific brands with differential pricing for the domestic market. \u201cBayer has always focused on strengthening its presence in India by bringing innovative therapies to the Indian market faster, improving access to these therapies through tiered pricing & strategic partnerships, and accelerating R&D,\u201d says Shweta Rai, managing director, India and Country Division Head South Asia, Bayer Pharmaceuticals. \u201cWe successfully innovated therapies in India, including Kerendia for chronic kidney disease, Verquvo for heart and Nubeqa for prostate cancer shortly after their global launch. We have entered into partnerships with Indian companies for enhanced reach and affordability,\u201d says Rai.\n\nAnother example is the Covid-19 collaboration between U.K.\u2019s AstraZeneca and Serum Institute of India. \u201cOur vaccine, developed with the University of Oxford, was manufactured by Serum Institute of India post a technology transfer in India. We offered the vaccine at zero profit. We delivered three billion doses and saved over six million lives all over the world between December 8, 2020, and December 8, 2021,\u201d says Sanjeev Panchal, country president & managing director, AstraZeneca Pharma India Ltd.\n\n\u201cCollaborations can help foreign firms navigate regulatory complexities, reduce costs and expand reach,\u201d says OPPI\u2019s Matai. India\u2019s healthcare market, projected to double by 2030, presents significant opportunities, he says. \u201cMNCs are poised to tap this expanding market by investing in R&D, digital healthcare and patient support programmes tailored to local needs. With the Indian government working towards making India a \u2018Vishwaguru\u2019 in drug discovery and healthcare, global companies have an opportunity to play a crucial role in this transformation by contributing innovative therapies and advanced technologies,\u201d says Matai.",

Recognising the importance of early detection, AstraZeneca has launched initiatives to improve timely and accurate diagnoses,\u201d said Arora adding, \u201cOne such programme, Connect to Care, developed with Axios International and key medical associations, fosters multidisciplinary collaboration to accelerate lung cancer diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.\u201d\n\nWhile emphasising the importance of such initiatives, Arora said AstraZeneca\u2019s mission is to bridge the gap in cancer care.\n\n\u201cBy improving access to diagnostics and treatments, we aim to transform the landscape of cancer outcomes on the continent. Early detection plays a critical role in improving survival outcomes, and we remain committed to supporting initiatives that make a meaningful difference for patients,\u201d Arora said in a statement.\n\nAstraZeneca is enhancing molecular testing infrastructure in Nigeria and Kenya, collaborating with Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) and Nigeria\u2019s Federal Ministry of Health to introduce advanced diagnostics like EGFR testing for lung cancer.\n\nAdditionally, its diagnostic patient navigation programme streamlines the journey from suspicion to diagnosis, ensuring efficient specimen handling for critical testing.\n\nArora\u2019s sentiments were echoed by Dr Khomotso Mashilane, Medical Director at AstraZeneca who said the company is committed to advancing innovation in oncology care through early detection and precision diagnostics.\n\n\u201cBy leveraging cutting-edge technologies, developing patient-centred solutions, and fostering meaningful partnerships, we aim to empower patients and healthcare providers to improve outcomes and enhance quality of life. On this World Cancer Day, we honour every patient\u2019s unique journey and reaffirm our dedication to advancing science and delivering meaningful care,\u201d said Dr Mashilane.\n\nAs part of its commitment to strengthening cancer care infrastructure, AstraZeneca has supported the availability of diagnostic tools, including ultrasound biopsy machines for prostate cancer and biomarker testing technology for lung cancer.\n\nThe company also supports training for healthcare professionals, fostering a more skilled oncology workforce equipped to address Africa\u2019s growing cancer burden.",

GSK is preparing to bump Emma Walmsley\u2019s salary to be better aligned with her male peers this year.\n\nAfter a readjustment of GSK\u2019s pharma peer group, the company determined that Walmsley\u2019s salary was more in line with the number two position\u2014CFO\u2014at those peer companies, according to the U.K. drugmaker\u2019s 2024 annual report, which was released Thursday. The discrepancy was leading to a retention risk for Walmsley, who took home \u00a310.6 million ($13.3 million) in 2024 after bonuses and other incentives.\n\n\u201cThe CEO\u2019s current package, which is currently in the lower quartile of the new size-adjusted global biopharma peer group, is insufficient either to reward her performance, or to provide the appropriate capacity for succession,\u201d wrote GSK Renumeration Chair Wendy Becker in the report, calling Walmsley a \u201chigh performer.\u201d\n\nGSK will now move the CEO towards the median pay of the peer group analyzed, which was \u00a313.3 million ($16.8 million). In 2024, Walmsley\u2019s total compensation was greater than her basic comp of \u00a36.6 million ($8.4 million). The new package bumps that basic comp to \u00a38.8 million ($11.1 million) and her total take-home pay could reach \u00a321.6 million ($27.2 million) when on-target bonus and long-term incentive payouts for performance are factored in.\n\nTo reach that number, GSK\u2019s share price must increase by 50% during the year. So far, the company\u2019s shares are trading up about 11% since Jan. 1.\n\nGSK\u2019s new peer group includes Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Bristol Myers Squibb, Moderna and others. Fellow U.K.-based pharma AstraZeneca paid CEO Pascal Soriot \u00a314.73 million ($18.7 million) in 2024, including long-term incentives, bonuses and other variables.\n\n\u201cOur revised proposals will initially result in our CEO being remunerated between lower and median quartile of our new size-adjusted global biopharma peer group,\u201d Becker wrote. \u201cWe will have the flexibility to move towards median remuneration by the end of the 2025 policy period in line with shareholder experience.\u201d\n\nThe new compensation package was developed with feedback from shareholders. Becker acknowledges that Walmsley still will be in the lower part of the median and that, if she were running a company that did not stray outside the U.K., \u201cthe 2025 policy proposal could be viewed differently.\u201d However, due to GSK\u2019s global operations the adjustments are necessary.\n\n\u201cThat said, we are of the view that these changes are essential to move towards competitive performance-related pay opportunity in the context of GSK\u2019s global operations,\u201d Becker said.\n\nWalmsley is one of the most prominent women leaders in the industry as the CEO of a top 20 pharma company by market cap. Her only other peer in this list of 20 companies is Vertex Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Reshma Kewalramani. Vertex has not yet published its 2024 proxy, which will reveal her pay for the year, but Kewalramani took home $20.6 million (\u00a316.3 million) in 2023.\n\nAs CEO of the pharma with the highest market cap in the industry, Eli Lilly\u2019s David Ricks took home $26.6 million (\u00a321 million) in 2023.",

In autoimmune diseases such as Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s, this mode of action could potentially disrupt pathological pathways that would otherwise culminate in a defective immune response that attacks healthy cells.\n\nBefore being shelved, abiprubart was one of Kiniksa\u2019s most mature assets. In July 2024, the biotech kicked off its Phase IIb study for the asset, testing biweekly and monthly dosing schedules in approximately 200 patients.\n\nThe decision to discontinue abiprubart is in line with Kiniksa\u2019s \u201cstrategic reprioritization of its portfolio and certain capital allocation considerations,\u201d the biotech wrote in an SEC filing dated Feb. 21. The company will \u201cimmediately\u201d stop enrollment into abiprubart\u2019s mid-stage study and start winding down activities linked to the asset, while looking for strategic alternatives.\n\nAbiprubart\u2019s termination has already cost Kiniksa $19 million, and the biotech expects to incur around $14 million to $17 million more in discontinuation expenses, mostly attributed to \u201ccontract termination costs\u201d for existing supply agreements. Kiniksa expects to wrap up wind-down activities for abiprubart by the end of the year.\n\nOther players in the Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome space include J&J and Horizon Therapeutics, which reported respective mid-stage wins in June 2024 and January 2023.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Kiniksa announced it is terminating its licensing deal with AstraZeneca\u2019s MedImmune for the GM-CSF blocker mavrilimumab. The asset, also a monoclonal antibody, was being tested for the chronic autoimmune disease giant cell arteritis and COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nKiniksa entered its licensing deal with MedImmune in December 2017, paying $23 million in upfront, pass-through and certain clinical milestone payments. At the time, the London biotech also promised up to $57.5 million in future milestones for the first two programs covered by the contract, plus up to $15 million for additional indications.\n\nIn January 2024, however, Kiniksa announced it had slowed down investment into mavrilimumab and was in the process of looking for potential development partners for the asset.\n\nWith abiprubart and mavrilimumab discontinued, Kiniksa is down to a completely cardiovascular pipeline\u2014though the indication for its most immature candidate, the IL-1 antagonist KPL-1161, has yet to be disclosed. As per its Tuesday press release, Kiniksa will now focus its development efforts on KPL-387, also an IL-1 blocker, for recurrent pericarditis.

The drug, an oral, hormone receptor protein-degrading therapy known as a SERD, was tested alongside an approved CDK4/6 inhibitor in people whose HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors have an \u201cemergent\u201d ESR1 mutation. People in the study were receiving standard hormone therapy and a CDK4/6 drug and then either continued, or swapped out the hormone treatment for camizestrant, once a tumor scan showed signs of an ESR1 mutation. The result was a \u201chighly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement\u201d in progression-free survival for camizestrant recipients, AstraZeneca said. Menarini Group\u2019s similar drug Orserdu is available in the second-line setting, while others from Arvinas, Eli Lilly and Roche are in advanced testing. \u2014 Jonathan Gardner\n\nSales of Rezdiffra, the first approved therapy in the U.S. for the liver disease metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, continue to outpace Wall Street\u2019s projections. Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, the drug\u2019s developer, said Wednesday that fourth-quarter and full-year sales in 2024 reached $103.3 million and $180 million, respectively, with more than 11,800 patients on treatment by the end of the year. According to the team at Leerink Partners, general consensus among analysts in January was that the fourth-quarter total would be around $92 million. Rezdiffra could be cleared for use in Europe later this year. \u2014 Ben Fidler\n\nLava Therapeutics is laying off about 30% of its workforce and evaluating strategic options such as a sale or merger, the company said Tuesday. Lava has been developing so-called gama delta T cell engagers for blood cancers, and has partnerships in place with Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. But the company abandoned one program in December after disappointing study results and, with \"only one product in clinical development and an early-stage pipeline,\" decided it was \"appropriate to investigate strategic opportunities,\" said CEO Steve Hurly, in a statement. \u2014 Ben Fidler\n\nShares of PepGen nearly doubled Monday on early study results suggesting its treatment for a rare form of muscular dystrophy may be as potent as others in clinical testing. Those findings showed a single dose of PepGen\u2019s oligonucleotide-based therapy appeared to help correct an RNA splicing error implicated in the disease. The level at which it did so, at least so far, indicated the drug is \u201cat least competitive\u201d with therapies being developed by Avidity Biosciences and Dyne Therapeutics, with room for better efficacy at higher or additional doses, wrote Leerink Partners analyst Joseph Schwartz. More data are expected later this year and early next. \u2014 Ben Fidler\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has cleared Entrada Therapeutics to begin U.S. testing of an experimental Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug that the regulator placed on hold more than two years ago. The FDA in December 2022 halted a planned study of the therapy, which is being developed for a particular genetic subset of Duchenne patients. But while it loosened restrictions on Monday, the agency is still only allowing Entrada to test the therapy in adults, whereas U.K. regulators recently cleared the company to enroll children and adults in a separate trial. After speaking with management, William Blair analyst Myles Minter wrote to investors that Entrada executives \u201cimplied that the FDA remains \u2018conservative,\u2019\u201d asking the company to accrue data in adults first before greenlighting broader testing. \u2014 Ben Fidler",

They later presented with a mutation of the estrogen-coding ESR1 gene, which can trigger cancer growth.\n\nThe trial used residual DNA from cancer cells that can find its way into a patient's bloodstream to identify when patients were beginning to resist the standard endocrine treatment, and were switched to the camizestrant combination after an ESR1 mutation was detected.\n\n(Reporting by Pushkala Aripaka in Bengaluru; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips and Louise Heavens)",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) stands against the other high growth mega cap stocks.\n\nExactly 5 years ago, the world struggled to deal with a black swan event: the COVID-19 pandemic. There was so much uncertainty that people didn\u2019t even know if they\u2019d be alive in the next few weeks, let alone figure out where the market was heading. Anyone who invested in the S&P 5 years ago would have gained 83%. If you had bought at the exact bottom, you\u2019d have gained twice that amount.\n\nWhat the above proves is that the present isn\u2019t necessarily an indicator of what the future holds. All companies that had their workflows disrupted have recovered, some more than others. Some companies have strengthened their supply chains. Others have improved their work-from-home capabilities. Industries like airlines and restaurants have modified their business models to cater to the new dynamics.\n\nThese companies have been able to deal with the changing dynamics because of their financial strength and innovation. A company\u2019s past performance and its finances give a good idea of whether it will be able to survive bad times. That\u2019s why when we look at the best mega-cap stocks to hold for the next 5 years, we look at how well they have grown in the last 5 years.\n\nTo come up with our list of top 20 mega-cap stocks to hold for the next 5 years, we considered stocks with a market cap of at least $200 billion and a 5-year sales growth rate of at least 10%.\n\nIs AstraZeneca PLC (AZN) the Best Global Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA pharmacy worker distributing prescription medicines to patientsreceiving treatment for oncology, cardiovascular, renal, metabolism and respiratory diseases.\n\nAstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN)\n\nAstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) is a biopharmaceutical company that explores, develops, manufactures, and commercializes prescription medicines. It supplies its products and services to specialty and primary care physicians. AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) distributes its products and services through local representative offices and distributors. The company has grown its revenue by 17.77% over the last 5 years.\n\nUBS recently upgraded AstraZeneca from neutral to buy on improving growth prospects:\n\nWe like the diversified catalyst path for AZN, no longer dominated by Dato-DXd.\n\nDato DXd is a treatment for advanced-stage breast cancer and with its approval in January, the company continues to strengthen its portfolio of FDA-approved drugs. AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) estimated annual sales of $5 billion with this particular treatment and that seems to be on target. The company can now focus on the seven high-value drugs it plans to get to the market in 2025. Investors can expect multiple catalysts throughout the year, but due to the nature of drug trials, volatility is expected.",

The milestone comes 42 days after the first COVAX doses were shipped and delivered internationally, to Ghana on February 24th.\n\nCOVAX has now delivered more than 38 million doses across six continents, supplied by three manufacturers, AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech and the Serum Institute of India (SII). Of the over 100 economies reached, 61 are among the 92 lower-income economies receiving vaccines funded through the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC).\n\nDespite reduced supply availability in March and April \u2013 the result of vaccine manufacturers scaling and optimising their production processes in the early phase of the rollout, as well as increased demand for COVID-19 vaccines in India \u2013 COVAX expects to deliver doses to all participating economies that have requested vaccines in the first half of the year.\n\n\u201cIn under four months since the very first mass vaccination outside a clinical setting anywhere in the world, it is tremendously gratifying that the roll-out of COVAX doses has already reached one hundred countries,\u201d said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. \u201cCOVAX may be on track to deliver to all participating economies in the first half of the year yet we still face a daunting challenge as we seek to end the acute stage of the pandemic: we will only be safe when everybody is safe and our efforts to rapidly accelerate the volume of doses depend on the continued support of governments and vaccine manufacturers. As we continue with the largest and most rapid global vaccine rollout in history, this is no time for complacency.\u201d\n\n\u201cCOVAX has given the world the best way to ensure the fastest, most equitable rollout of safe and effective vaccines to all at-risk people in every country on the planet,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \u201cIf we are going to realize this great opportunity, countries, producers and the international system must come together to prioritize vaccine supply through COVAX. Our collective future, literally, depends on it.\u201d\n\n\"This is a significant milestone in the fight against COVID-19. Faced with the rapid spread of COVID-19 variants, global access to vaccines is fundamentally important to reduce the prevalence of the disease, slow down viral mutation, and hasten the end of the pandemic,\u201d said Dr Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). \u201cThe extraordinary scientific achievements of the last year must now be matched by an unprecedented effort to protect the most vulnerable, so the global community must remain firmly focused on reducing the equity gap in COVID-19 vaccine distribution.\"\n\n\u201cIn just a month and a half, the ambition of granting countries access to COVID vaccines is becoming a reality, thanks to the outstanding work of our partners in the COVAX Facility,\u201d said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. \u201cHowever, this is no time to celebrate; it is time to accelerate. With variants emerging all over the world, we need to speed up global rollout. To do this, we need governments, along with other partners, to take necessary steps to increase supply, including by simplifying barriers to intellectual property rights, eliminating direct and indirect measures that restrict exports of COVID-19 vaccines, and donating excess vaccine doses as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nAccording to its latest supply forecast, COVAX expects to deliver at least 2 billion doses of vaccines in 2021. In order to reach this goal, the COVAX Facility will continue to diversify its portfolio further, and will announce new agreements with vaccine manufacturers in due course.\n\nFurthermore, in March it was announced that the United States government will host the launch event for the 2021 Gavi COVAX AMC Invest Opportunity to catalyse further commitment and support for accelerated access to vaccines for AMC-supported economies. An additional US$2 billion is required in 2021 to finance and secure up to a total of 1.8 billion donor-funded doses of vaccines. COVAX is also working to secure additional sourcing of vaccines in the form of dose-sharing from higher income countries.\n\nQuotes from donors and partners\n\nPresident of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cAs we continue our common race to speed up safe and effective vaccination everywhere, I want to commend COVAX for having delivered first vaccines to 100 countries in every corner of the world, including some of the most vulnerable warn torn countries like Afghanistan and Yemen. This is a real milestone. Team Europe has strongly invested in COVAX and I urge all partners to support COVAX to make sure no one is left behind\u201d.\n\nSenator the Hon Marise Payne, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Women, Australia said: \u201cAustralia welcomes the progress made by COVAX in COVID-19 vaccine distribution across the world. One hundred countries now have access to life-saving COVID-19 vaccines through COVAX. We are proud to work with global partners to achieve equitable global access to safe and effective vaccines.\u201d\n\nKarina Gould, Minister of International Development, Canada and co-chair, COVAX AMC Engagement Group said: \u201cDespite the many challenges it faced, the COVAX Facility has continued to deliver. In just a matter of weeks, it\u2019s been supplying vaccines to 100 countries. This is a milestone we can all be proud of. Now, more than ever, we must continue to work together and support multilateral mechanisms like the COVAX Facility and the ACT-Accelerator.\u201d\n\nJean-Yves le Drian, Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs, France said: \u201cOne hundred countries have now received safe, WHO-approved vaccines against COVID-19 through the COVAX Facility. France welcomes this crucial step forward, which demonstrates that multilateralism in global health, as well as the spirit of solidarity and responsibility on which it is based, constitutes the most effective response to this pandemic. But the fight against the virus is far from over: we must continue to support COVAX and accelerate equitable access to vaccines in fragile countries, in particular through sharing of vaccine doses. This is what France wants to do, together with its EU and G7 partners.\u201d\n\nDr Gerd M\u00fcller, Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany said: \u201cWe either beat the pandemic worldwide or we will not beat it at all. The only way out of the crisis is a global immunisation campaign. In order to now be able to vaccinate people quickly, we are using the tried and tested structures of the global vaccine alliance Gavi. Thanks to the vaccination platform Covax, the structures are in place to provide vaccines for at least 20 per cent of people in developing countries and emerging economies over the course of this year.\u201d\n\nHeiko Maas, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Germany said: \u201cThe fact that St.Lucia yesterday became the 100th country to be supplied with vaccines via the COVAX platform supported by Germany and the EU, is a milestone on the way out of the pandemic. This progress gives us hope, for we too will only be safe when everyone around the world is safe. Access to vaccines, medicines and tests must not become a geopolitical pawn. Rather, they must be available to all countries in a fair and transparent manner. That\u2019s why we\u2019re committed to COVAX, to a multilateral approach.\u201d\n\nColm Brophy TD, Minister of State for Overseas Development and the Diaspora, Ireland said: \u201cThrough our funding to COVAX, Ireland is supporting developing countries, who most need vaccines and can least afford them, secure their share of global supply.\u201d\n\nDag-Inge Ulstein, Minister of International Development, Norway, and Co-chair of the ACT-Accelerator Facilitation Council said: \u201cIn less than a year, the world has come together to develop and secure equitable global access to COVID-19 vaccines. That is a huge victory. But the risk of vaccine nationalism is still looming large. Countries and manufactures must prioritise global solutions. It is also crucial that all manufacturers continue to make their vaccines available and affordable to COVAX, so that the global rollout can continue. Countries that have more vaccines than they need should share vaccines through COVAX. I also expect all relevant stakeholders to take action to ensure that the world can produce enough vaccines, at a price that even the poorest countries can afford.\u201d\n\nH.E. Dr Tawfig AlRabiah, Minister of Health in Saudi Arabia said: \u201c\u2018People\u2019s health first\u2019 has been the guiding principle, driving all efforts in the fight against the pandemic - both nationally and globally - to ensure that \u201cNo one is left behind\u201d. We in the kingdom are proud contributors to GAVI and the COVAX facility, which has now shipped over 37 million vaccines. This show of solidarity is the cure to fighting COVID-19, and our collective resilience will enable us to overcome any future pandemic we may face.\u201d\n\nForeign, Commonwealth and Development Office Minister Wendy Morton, United Kingdom said: \u201cFrom Nigeria to Nepal, COVAX has now delivered life-saving vaccine doses to 100 countries and territories which is a huge achievement and another step towards making us all safe. The UK has played a leading role in achieving equitable access to vaccines by providing \u00a3548 million for COVAX early on, which will help to deliver more than one billion doses around the world, as well as lobbying international partners to increase their funding.\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said: \u201cThe United States welcomes the news that COVAX has delivered safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to 100 countries. The United States signaled our strong support for COVAX through an initial $2 billion contribution to Gavi. Through unprecedented partnerships among donors, manufacturers, and participating countries, COVAX has achieved extraordinary milestones in equitably distributing doses to the global community in record time.\u201d\n\nWerner Hoyer, President of the European Investment Bank said: \u201cAs part of Team Europe the European Investment Bank is pleased to provide EUR 400 million for COVAX, representing the EIB\u2019s largest ever support for global public health. COVAX has already provided vaccines to vulnerable groups and front line workers and brought hope to millions more. COVAX demonstrates the benefit of global cooperation to tackle the shared challenge of COVID. Congratulations to the COVAX team and global partners in 100 countries around the world. Together we are ensuring equitable access to vaccines and together we are directing our efforts towards a global recovery.\u201d\n\nPascal Soriot, AstraZeneca CEO, said: \u201cToday marks a significant milestone in the global fight against the pandemic as 100 countries have received vaccine through COVAX. I am proud that the supply of our vaccine accounts for the vast majority of doses being delivered through COVAX in the first half of this year. Over 37 million doses of our vaccine have been delivered to date which are protecting the most vulnerable populations around the world. Together with our COVAX partners, we continue to work 24/7 to deliver on our unwavering commitment to broad, equitable and affordable access.\u201d\n\nPfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla said: \u201cCongratulations to everyone who has worked tirelessly to reach this impressive milestone. At Pfizer we are driven every day by the belief that science will win. Through collaboration and commitment, COVAX has brought forth a global solution that helps to bring breakthrough science to everyone, everywhere. We are proud to work together with the facility and all of its partners and remain firmly committed to working toward the shared vision of equitable access for all to end this pandemic.\u201d\n\nSai D. Prasad, President, Developing Countries Vaccines Manufacturing Network (DCVMN) said: \u201cCOVAX has made history by ensuring equitable access for COVID-19 vaccines to all countries irrespective of their economic status. The 100th delivery marks a great milestone for COVAX, leading to enhanced deliveries during 2021. We commend the efforts by all partners in COVAX for this achievement. Developed and developing country manufacturers have played a crucial role in product development and large scale manufacturing. In order to meet the requirements of all countries, more partnerships between innovators and manufacturers are required. COVAX\u2019s leadership in COVID-19 vaccines will ensure that we leave no one behind.\u201d\n\nThomas Cueni, Director General, International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) & founding partner of ACT-A said: \u201cThe timeline is truly impressive; one that is difficult to square with warnings of \u201ccatastrophic moral failure\u201d. It\u2019s an innovation success story with the first WHO vaccine approval on 31 December 2021, less than a year after the virus was first shared. It\u2019s a manufacturing success story with the scaling up from zero to one billion doses being produced by April 2021. It is a logistics and country preparedness success story, with 100 countries receiving the vaccines. And last but by no means least, it\u2019s a collaboration and solidarity success story thanks to the commitment from donors and the tireless efforts of the partners of COVAX including the developing and the developed world manufacturers. The COVAX public private partnership and political leadership to equitably share surplus vaccines are the best guarantees we have that people who need the vaccine will get it whenever they live, fast enough to outpace the virus\u2019 mutations.\u201d\n\nNotes to editors\n\nThe list of 102 Facility participants (as of 14h CET, 8 April) that have received a combined total of 38,392,540 doses of COVAX-delivered vaccines so far is as follows (in alphabetical order):\n\nAfghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Bermuda, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Canada, Colombia, Congo (DRC), Costa Rica, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Jamaica, Jordan, Kenya, Kosovo, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Maldives, Mali, Mauritius, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Nauru, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Oman, Palestine, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Republic of Moldova, Rwanda, Samoa, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, St. Lucia*, Sudan, Suriname, Taiwan, Tajikistan, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Tuvalu, Uganda, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam, Yemen.\n\n*100th Facility participant to receive a COVAX delivery",

We are proud to work with trailblazers like Professor Malapelle, who are utilizing our technology and the collective power of our network to make strides in the next wave of cancer care,\" said Ross Muken, President, SOPHiA GENETICS.\n\nOf the thirty-seven institutions adopting MSK solutions, thirty-four have signed on to adopt MSK-ACCESS\u00ae powered with SOPHiA DDM\u2122, just ten months after the Liquid Biopsy application's launch. The decentralized deployment of MSK-ACCESS\u00ae has enabled hospitals and labs across the globe to launch world-renowned Liquid Biopsy testing from within the walls of their own institution, providing patients with a less-invasive option for genomic testing. In many cases, this decentralized testing also results in lower costs and faster turnaround times, while also enabling institutions to retain control of their patients' data for research or other purposes.\n\nInternationally recognized organizations adopting the application include: Heidelberg University Hospital in Germany ; Biopticka Laboratory in the Czech Republic ; Hospital del Mar and Hospital La Fe in Spain ; University Hospital of Nice and Marseille Regional Hospital Center in France ; and Jewish General Hospital in Canada .\n\nThe complementary solid tumor application, MSK-IMPACT\u00ae powered with SOPHiA DDM\u2122, has also attracted significant interest from leading organizations across the globe, including: the Jim\u00e9nez D\u00edaz Foundation University Hospital in Spain ; the Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics in Cyprus ; and Sofiva Genomics in Taiwan .\n\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and SOPHiA GENETICS partnered in 2023 with a vision to use the sophisticated technology of the SOPHiA DDM\u2122 Platform to bring MSK's state-of-the-art cancer testing capabilities to precision medicine institutions worldwide. The two leaders launched the Liquid Biopsy test MSK-ACCESS\u00ae powered with SOPHiA DDM\u2122 in April 2024. In October 2024, SOPHiA GENETICS announced a definitive partnership agreement with AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) to accelerate the deployment of MSK-ACCESS\u00ae powered with SOPHiA DDM\u2122, aiming to increase the availability of this innovative Liquid Biopsy solution worldwide. In November 2024, SOPHiA GENETICS announced the launch of the complementary Solid Tumor test, MSK-IMPACT\u00ae powered with SOPHiA DDM\u2122. These collaborations have the potential to transform cancer research as they enable healthcare providers to draw from a continuously evolving base of real-world data and gain insights from diverse populations while using best-in-class technology.\n\nJoin us on Tuesday, February 25, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. (11:00) EDT / 5:00 p.m. (17:00) CET for the Precision Oncology Showcase, a virtual webinar which will spotlight the transformative potential of decentralized, AI-driven technologies for the advancement of cancer care.\n\nAbout SOPHiA GENETICS\n\nSOPHiA GENETICS (Nasdaq: SOPH) is a cloud-native healthcare technology company on a mission to transform patient care by expanding access to data-driven medicine globally.

            "content": "On February 20, 2025, FibroGen Inc (FGEN, Financial) released its 8-K filing announcing the sale of its China subsidiary to AstraZeneca for approximately $160 million. This strategic transaction is expected to bolster FibroGen's financial position by extending its cash runway into 2027 and simplifying its capital structure through the repayment of a term loan to Morgan Stanley Tactical Value.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nFibroGen Inc is a biotechnology company dedicated to discovering, developing, and commercializing novel therapeutics for serious cancer biology and anemia. Operating primarily in Europe and Japan, the company generates most of its revenue through collaboration agreements. FibroGen's strategic partnerships enhance its research, development, and marketing capabilities, allowing it to advance its product candidates effectively.\n\nPerformance and Challenges\n\nThe sale of FibroGen China to AstraZeneca represents a significant strategic move for the company. The transaction, valued at $160 million, includes an enterprise value of $85 million and approximately $75 million in net cash held in China. This sale is crucial as it allows FibroGen to focus on its oncology pipeline, particularly the development of FG-3246 and FG-3180 for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).\n\nHowever, the company faces challenges in maintaining its market position and advancing its clinical programs amidst a competitive biotechnology landscape. The sale of its China operations may impact its revenue generation capabilities in the region, necessitating a strong focus on its remaining markets and product development.\n\nFinancial Achievements\n\nThe transaction with AstraZeneca is a pivotal financial achievement for FibroGen. By extending its cash runway into 2027, the company gains the financial stability needed to advance its clinical programs. This move is particularly important in the biotechnology industry, where substantial capital is required for research and development.\n\nKey Financial Metrics\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, FibroGen reported preliminary unaudited cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable of $121.1 million. This financial position, coupled with the proceeds from the sale, strengthens the company's balance sheet and supports its ongoing and future clinical trials.\n\nCommentary\n\n\u201cToday, we announced the sale of FibroGen China to AstraZeneca, our long-time strategic partner for roxadustat in China, bolstering our company on several fronts. It strengthens our financial position, meaningfully extending our cash runway into 2027, and enables us to continue progressing the clinical development program for FG-3246, our first-in-class, CD46 targeting antibody drug conjugate, and FG-3180, our companion PET imaging agent, in mCRPC,\u201d said Thane Wettig, Chief Executive Officer of FibroGen.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe sale of FibroGen China to AstraZeneca is a strategic decision that aligns with the company's focus on its oncology pipeline. By simplifying its capital structure and extending its cash runway, FibroGen is better positioned to navigate the challenges of the biotechnology industry. The company's ability to maintain its rights to roxadustat in the U.S. and other markets not licensed to Astellas further supports its strategic objectives.\n\nOverall, FibroGen's recent financial maneuvers highlight its commitment to advancing its clinical programs and strengthening its financial foundation, which are critical for its long-term success in the competitive biotechnology sector.\n\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from FibroGen Inc for further details.",

Revenue generated by major U.S. tech firms is only expected to grow in Japan as individuals and businesses increasingly digitize.\n\nWhile there has been investment in the development of domestic cloud services, Kengo Wataya, a researcher at the Mitsubishi Research Institute, noted that the gap in development capabilities between Japanese and U.S. firms remains significant.\n\nThe digital deficit is unlikely to shrink any time soon, so \"Japan needs to leverage digital technologies to generate revenue in other sectors,\" Wataya said.\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nJapan antitrust watchdog to set up new section to regulate IT giants",

            "content": "In a sense, every investor is a growth investor. Even those who are primarily seeking income enjoy when the stocks they buy increase in value. But which stocks are likely to deliver growth over the next few years?\n\nThree Motley Fool contributors think they've found magnificent growth stocks to buy right now. Here's why they picked AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN), Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX).\n\nAstraZeneca is an underrated growth stock with tons of potential\n\nDavid Jagielski (AstraZeneca): One of the best growth stocks right now is AstraZeneca. The stock hasn't been the hottest buy of late, and entering trading this week it was down more than 11% over the past six months. But there's tremendous value here if you're willing to buy and hold.\n\nThe company wrapped up a solid year in 2024 where its revenue rose by 21% (when excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to $54 billion. And for this year, it's projecting its top line to continue to increase in the high single digits. But the real upside is for investors who are willing to buy and hold. That's because by 2030, AstraZeneca expects sales to soar to $80 billion as it launches new medications in the years ahead.\n\nAstraZeneca sees significant growth opportunities in expanding its oncology, biopharmaceutical, and rare-disease portfolios. With a diversified product mix, it's in an excellent position to continue growing at a rapid pace, and acquisitions have played a big part in its growth. It has closed multiple deals within the past 12 months, including for Amolyt Pharma and Fusion Pharmaceuticals. It's working on next-gen cancer treatments involving radioconjugates.\n\nNot only are the company's growth prospects promising, but the stock's valuation also looks incredible as it's trading at a price-to-earnings-growth multiple of around 0.9, which tells investors that there's excellent value here given the long-term potential for the business to grow its bottom line in the years ahead. Plus, with a dividend that yields 2%, there's some good incentive for investors to buy and wait for this magnificent growth stock to realize its potential and rise higher in value in the future.\n\nNot just a diabetes and weight loss company\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny (Eli Lilly): The title of \"largest therapeutic area in the pharmaceutical industry in terms of revenue\" might go to oncology or immunology, but right now, the weight loss space may be the fastest-growing. And as a leader in this niche, Eli Lilly is cashing in more than almost any of its peers. Eli Lilly's revenue and earnings have been growing at an incredible pace in the past two years thanks to tirzepatide, a weight loss management clinical compound also used to treat diabetes.",

            "content": "Where could be the top place to invest this spring? Europe \u2013 according to the latest edition of the hugely influential Bank of America fund manager survey.\n\nMore than a third of the respondents \u2013 the professionals who together take care of $482billion worth of global savings \u2013 say European shares are undervalued against their global peers.\n\nIf your portfolio is concentrated in US tech stocks, then a taste of Europe may be what you need.\n\nThis can be found among the Granolas, a group of 11 European multinationals, selected by US bank Goldman Sachs, which is made up of GSK (also known as GlaxoSmithKline), Roche, ASML, Nestle, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, L'Oreal, LVMH, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.\n\nYes, the name actually spells out 'Grannnllass'.\n\nTwo are British \u2013 AstraZeneca and GSK. But all are global leaders in sectors like luxury, pharmaceuticals, beauty and software, and deserving of a place in your portfolio.\n\nSunnier outlook?: For the past two years, European markets have been overshadowed by the stellar feats of the 'Magnificent Seven' US tech stocks\n\nThis may not seem an ideal moment to bet on Europe: the world order is shifting, and the continent is being rocked by the pace of change. But there are signs of revival and resolve to deliver long-overdue reform.\n\nGermany goes to the polls tomorrow, as gloom over its economy gathers. But there are hopes the election could produce a conservative-led coalition which would cut corporate taxes and bolster growth.\n\nMarcel Stotzel, manager of the Fidelity European fund, says some of the enthusiasm for Europe arises from the view that there is a widening disconnect between the prices of some US stocks and their fundamental value.\n\nBut there are other reasons. Stotzel explains: 'There has been a deep sigh of relief over the introduction of tariffs by President Trump. It seems as if they are going to affect Canada, China and Mexico more than the EU.'\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek, a cheap Chinese artificial intelligence system, may have rocked the share prices of the US tech titans who have spent billions on the more expensive ChatGPT.\n\nBut Stotzel argues that DeepSeek is good news for European firms because they must deploy AI and may now do so for far less.\n\nThe heightened geopolitical tensions with the US over Ukraine are one of the forces compelling investors to look at Europe.\n\nStotzel says European companies, such as the French industrial group LeGrand, are set to play major role in rebuilding Ukraine. This is why analysts think its shares could jump from \u20ac110.30 to as much as \u20ac126.\n\nMeanwhile, European defence and aerospace stocks have soared this week in response to US calls for EU states to increase their military spending.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, has promised that such expenditure would be exempted from the normal limits on states' budgets. Among the beneficiaries of her announcement have been shares in firms usually overlooked by UK investors such as Italian defence aerospace group Leonardo.\n\nThere have also been gains of 14 per cent to 25 per cent among the German giants such as Thyssenkrupp, the engineering and steel manufacturer. The price of Rheinmetall, a specialist in ammunition, drones and tanks, has soared by 30 per cent.\n\nAnalysts still rate Rheinmetall a 'buy', although the increase since the start of the year could tempt some investors to take profits.\n\nIf you are contemplating exploring Europe, this is why investors fell out of love with this region \u2013 and why it may be worth your attention now.\n\nWhy did Europe lose its bite?\n\nFor the past two years, European markets have been overshadowed by the stellar feats of the 'Magnificent Seven' US tech stocks \u2013 Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.\n\nThe gains made from these shares have reinforced the adage that 'the US innovates, the EU regulates'. The belief that a bureaucratic Europe was being badly left behind in an era of American exceptionalism was amplified by the Donald Trump's victory last November.\n\nThis sparked an exodus of investors in the final quarter. Europe's main stock market index, the Stoxx 600, ticked up by just 6 per cent in 2024, against 23 per cent for the US S&P 500 index .\n\nBut there are moves, driven by Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), and other officials to introduce reforms and relax the stranglehold of bureaucracy.\n\nHow big should your appetite be?\n\nThe members of the Granola gang are global players. They do not depend on their domestic economies, but they do get a boost from lower interest rates.\n\nThe ECB has cut interest rates five times since last June and could order three more reductions, if inflation eases.\n\nOne of the best ways to back the Granolas is through a fund or trust such as BlackRock Greater Europe, Fidelity European or Henderson European.\n\nBut Ben Yearsley of Fairview Investing says that there are currently some bargains among the Granolas.\n\nASML, a Dutch business, is the world's number one maker of the equipment required for the manufacture of microchips. Its shares have fallen 14 per cent over the past six months to \u20ac709.90, driven by the alarm over DeepSeek.\n\nThe view that DeepSeek could expand, rather than contract sales of ASML's kit explains why analysts rate the shares a 'buy'. The average target price is \u20ac842, although one analyst is forecasting a price of \u20ac1,057.\n\nNovo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceutical behemoth, is the maker of the anti-obesity drugs Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nNovo Nordisk shares are more than 300 per cent higher than ten years ago at 630 Danish krone, nearly \u00a364. In common with other analysts, the broker UBS rates shares a 'buy', with a target price of 750 krone.\n\nFundsmith and Stonehage Fleming Global Best Ideas are among the funds that hold LVMH, the Tiffany and Moet Hennessy luxury goods conglomerate led by Bernard Arnault, one of the world's richest men. Arnault, a member of Trump's billionaire mates gang, is considering 'bulking up' LVMH's production in America to exploit its 'dynamic market'.\n\nThere are predictions that the new era of more overt glamour ushered in by the Trump administration will be good for sales of LVMH's bags, scents and watches. The shares stand at \u20ac702.40 \u2013 and are worth holding, according to analysts.\n\nAre there other opportunities?\n\nIF you are looking for a thrill-packed European adventure, take a peek at the group also named for a breakfast cereal \u2013 Cheerios. They are: Coface, H Lundbeck, Evonik, Eramet, Repsol, Indra Sistemas, OTP Bank and SAF-Holland.\n\nThese lesser-known businesses operate in the fields of automobile parts, chemicals, insurance and oil and gas, but such smaller firms are difficult to research.\n\nIf you want a stake in the bounty that could flow from the lessening of regulation in Europe and the new confidence that its markets can compete with the US, the European Smaller Companies represents a route. Its managers have a special mission to find bargains.",

The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that (1) AstraZeneca engaged in insurance fraud in China; (2) as a result, AstraZeneca faced heightened legal exposure in China, which eventually resulted in the AstraZeneca China President being detained by Chinese law enforcement authorities; (3) as a result, AstraZeneca understated its legal risks; (4) the foregoing, once revealed, could materially harm AstraZeneca\u2019s business activities in China; and (5) as a result, Defendants\u2019 statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.\n\nOn October 30, 2024, AstraZeneca announced that Leon Wang, Executive Vice President International and AstraZeneca China President, was \"cooperating with an ongoing investigation by Chinese authorities.\"\n\nOn this news, AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares (\"ADS\") fell 3.1% on October 30, 2024.\n\nThen, on November 5, 2024, Yicai Global published an article entitled \"AstraZeneca Insurance Fraud Involves Dozens of Senior Executives in China, Source Says.\" This article stated that \"[d]ozens of senior executives at AstraZeneca China have been implicated in an ongoing insurance fraud case as of last week, according to a person familiar with the matter.\" Further, it stated that \"[o]ver the past three years, insurance fraud cases involving AstraZeneca have surfaced in Shenzhen as well as the provinces of Fujian and Jiangxi. [. . .] These cases amount to the largest insurance fraud in the nation's pharmaceutical sector for years, a person familiar with the matter pointed out.\"\n\nOn this news, AstraZeneca ADSs fell a further 7.2% on November 5, 2024.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AstraZeneca\u2019s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nTo learn more about the AstraZeneca class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/AZN or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

            "content": "The week has ended with a flurry of M&A in the drug industry, with Cosette Pharmaceuticals agreeing to buy Australia's Mayne Pharma and AstraZeneca buying the Chinese subsidiary of FibroGen.\n\nFirst up, Cosette's AUD 672 million (around $430 million) play for Mayne Pharma, which the company said would build its presence in women's health in the US and expand its geographic reach.\n\nBoth companies have a focus on women's health and dermatology, and adding Mayne to Cosette's stable will extend the US company's portfolio with brands like oral contraceptive Nextstellis, which saw sales in fiscal 2024 grow 113% to $30 million and helped the company's revenues rise 112% to nearly $248 million.\n\nCosette is not publicly listed and is backed by private equity group Avista Healthcare Partners and funds managed by Hamilton Lane \u2013 so doesn't publish financial results \u2013 but has shown itself to have deep pockets with a series of bolt-on acquisitions in recent years.\n\nDeals in the last 18 months alone include the purchase of Sanofi's US Ambien (zolpidem) insomnia range, Palatin's female hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) product Vyleesi (bremelanotide), and Endoceutics' Intrarosa (prasterone) for menopause-related disorder dyspareunia.\n\nApurva Saraf, president and chief executive of Cosette, said that adding Mayne would be a \"transformational step\", giving the company 12 patented brands in women's health and dermatology. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter, after which Mayne's 480-strong workforce will join Cosette's team of around 350 staffers. Mayne's share price rose 33% after the announcement.\n\nMeanwhile, it appears that AZ's recent run-ins with the Chinese authorities have not stopped the company from expanding its presence in the country.\n\nThe UK-headquartered group has agreed to buy the Chinese subsidiary of FibroGen for around $160 million, claiming ownership of Evrenzo (roxadustat), FibroGen's treatment for anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which AZ has been helping to sell in China.\n\nAZ was formerly partnered on the drug in other markets, including the US, but exited the alliance a year ago and returned rights to FibroGen. That decision came a couple of years after Evrenzo was turned down for approval by the FDA, with its future in the US still up in the air.\n\nSales of the drug in China were around $281 million in 2023, and AZ also has comarketing rights to the drug in South Korea.\n\nAZ is already a major overseas player in the Chinese pharma market, but has been under the spotlight of late as a result of an investigation into unpaid taxes on drug imports and suspected data privacy breaches. Last October, the president of AZ's Chinese operations, Leon Wang, stepped down and was detained by the authorities.",

            "content": "AstraZeneca plunked down $160 million on Thursday to acquire FibroGen\u2019s China business, a likely sign that the pharma will continue to pump money into China despite ongoing government investigations.\n\nPer Thursday\u2019s agreement, AstraZeneca will pay $85 million to match the enterprise value of FibroGen China, plus an additional $75 million, corresponding to the net cash held by the Chinese business. The companies expect the deal to close by mid-2025, subject to regulatory clearances in China and other customary conditions.\n\nThe acquisition will give AstraZeneca full rights over roxadustat in China, where it is approved for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is undergoing regulatory review for chemotherapy-induced anemia. For FibroGen, the transaction will give it more cash, which will allow it to repay an outstanding term loan facility to Morgan Stanley Tactical Value, in turn extending the biotech\u2019s runway into 2027.\n\nThe move to buy FibroGen\u2019s Chinese business\u2014and local rights to roxadustat\u2014comes nearly a year to the day since AstraZeneca shut down the bulk of its U.S. partnership with FibroGen. At the time, however, the two companies retained relationships in South Korea and in China, where roxadustat is the leading the CKD anemia market.\n\nIn the U.S., on the other hand, roxadustat has been having a rough run. In August 2021, the FDA declined to approve the drug for anemia in CKD, pointing to the need for an additional study.\n\nAstraZeneca and FibroGen\u2014at the time still working together on roxadustat\u2019s clinical studies in the U.S.\u2014ran the Phase III MATTERHORN study to test roxadustat for anemia in patients with transfusion-dependent lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Results in May 2023, however, showed that roxadustat was unable to significantly improve transfusion independence versus placebo.\n\nFibroGen will retain U.S. rights over roxadustat and plans to push through with the molecule\u2019s development for anemia in lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.\n\nThe FibroGen deal also signals AstraZeneca\u2019s continued investment in China, where it is currently facing several government probes. In October 2024, the pharma announced that former president of AstraZeneca China Leon Wang was being investigated by authorities, though the company at the time did not explicitly say why.\n\nA week later, local financial publication Yicai reported that several other top AstraZeneca executives in China were embroiled in the investigation for insurance fraud. In December 2024, the pharma was forced to name Iskra Reic, executive vice president for its international operations, as the interim China head while Wang undergoes investigation.\n\nEarlier this month, the pharma also revealed during its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial report that it could have potentially missed $900,000 in unpaid importation taxes. That could lead to a fine of up to five times the avoided tax, or around $4.5 million.",

Credit: Sundry Photography via Getty Images.\n\nAstraZeneca has agreed to acquire FibroGen\u2019s China subsidiary for approximately $160m, securing full control over the anaemia drug roxadustat in the country.\n\nThe deal strengthens AstraZeneca\u2019s presence in China, a key growth market for the company, and is expected to close by mid-2025, subject to regulatory approvals. Following the announcement of the acquisition, FibroGen\u2019s stock price surged 42% when the market opened on 20 February. The company expects to use proceeds from the sale to repay its term loan to Morgan Stanley Tactical Value and to extend its cash runway into 2027.\n\nAstraZeneca and FibroGen have been partnered on roxadustat since 2013, which is marketed in China under the brand name Evrenzo. The drug was approved by Chinese regulators in 2018 for anaemia caused by chronic kidney disease and generated $284m in sales in China in 2023, reflecting a 36% year-over-year growth.\n\nThis deal comes a year after AstraZeneca exited most of its US collaborations with FibroGen. Despite that exit, the companies maintained partnerships in China and South Korea, where roxadustat leads the chronic kidney disease-related anaemia market.\n\nIn the US, roxadustat has struggled to gain approval. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rejected the drug in August 2021, citing the need for additional studies. AstraZeneca and FibroGen continued working together on the Phase III MATTERHORN study (NCT04592913), but the drug failed to demonstrate efficacy in anaemia patients with myelodysplastic syndromes in the study in May 2023, further hindering its path to market in the US.\n\nFibroGen will retain US rights over roxadustat and said it plans to meet with the FDA in Q2 2025 to figure out the drug\u2019s \u201cnext steps\u201d in the US. Astellas licences roxadustat in some markets, including Japan.\n\nFibroGen CEO Thane Wettig stated the transaction will support the company\u2019s financial position and allow it to focus on the development of FG-3246, a CD46-targeting antibody-drug conjugate, and FG-3180, a companion PET imaging agent for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.\n\nThe company has recently faced setbacks with its oncology pipeline. In July 2024, two Phase III trials for its lead oncology candidate, pamrevlumab, failed to meet their primary endpoints. Following these failures, the company announced plans to halt pamrevlumab\u2019s development and reduce its US workforce by 75%, leading to a sharp decline in its share price.\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s latest acquisition aligns with its broader expansion strategy in China. The company has been actively pursuing deals in the region, including a 2023 partnership with Eccogene for obesity treatments and a $1.2bn agreement to acquire Gracell Biotechnologies to strengthen its chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy portfolio.\n\nThe deal also comes at a time when AstraZeneca is facing legal challenges in China. The company confirmed that its Chinese operations are under investigation for alleged unpaid import taxes on certain cancer drugs, including Imfinzi (durvalumab) and Imjudo (tremelimumab). AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot told investors in the company\u2019s Q4 2024 earnings call that the import duties in question amount to $900,000 and that the company could face a fine of up to five times that amount. He also noted that a similar issue related to Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan) could increase the potential fine. AstraZeneca has stated that it is fully cooperating with Chinese authorities. In October 2024, Leon Wang, president of AstraZeneca\u2019s China operations, stepped down and was detained along with other current and former employees amid the allegations.",

The company plans to use the money to repay a term loan to Morgan Stanley Tactical Value and now expects to be able to fund research and operations into 2027.\n\nAs part of the agreement, AstraZeneca will take over full rights to the anemia drug roxadustat in China. The two companies have been collaborating on the medicine\u2019s development since 2013.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nFor FibroGen, the deal offers a much-needed cash infusion as the company strives to advance its oncology pipeline after a series of setbacks with other medicines. For AstraZeneca, the transaction represents a doubling down in China even as it continues to deal with government investigations in the country that have hurt its share price.\n\nAstraZeneca has had a presence in China since 1993 and its 2013 collaboration with FibroGen focused on that country as well as the U.S. and certain other markets. Although roxadustat has done well in China, it has yet to be approved in the lucrative U.S. market. Last year, the two companies scaled back their agreement, leaving AstraZeneca with rights only in China and South Korea.\n\nFibroGen has been reeling since the Food and Drug Administration rejected its application to sell roxadustat in 2021. The company cut jobs and restructured, only to face a series of research failures. FibroGen shares, which topped $55 in early 2021, now trade for less than a dollar.\n\nStill, FibroGen isn\u2019t giving up on the U.S. market for roxadustat. The company plans to meet with FDA officials in the second quarter. And sales of the drug overall are strong. In November, FibroGen forecast 2024 revenue of as much as $350 million in China alone. The drug is also approved in the major markets of Europe and Japan, where FibroGen partners with Astellas.\n\nFibroGen expects the sale of its Chinese unit to AstraZeneca to close mid-year.

Following the close of the transaction, FibroGen will repay its term loan facility to investment funds managed by Morgan Stanley Tactical Value, further simplifying the Company\u2019s capital structure. The combined transactions are expected to extend the Company\u2019s cash runway into 2027.\n\nUpon closing, AstraZeneca will obtain all rights to roxadustat in China.

The Company continues to evaluate a development plan for roxadustat in anemia associated with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (LR-MDS), a high-value indication with significant unmet medical need. The Company is planning for an FDA meeting in the second quarter of 2025 to determine the potential next steps for the development program for roxadustat in the U.S.\n\nIn addition, FibroGen continues to advance the clinical development of its lead asset, FG-3246, and its companion PET imaging agent, FG-3180, with the initiation of the Phase 2 monotherapy trial of FG-3246 in patients with mCRPC expected in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nBofA Securities, Inc. is acting as exclusive financial advisor and Ropes & Gray LLP is acting as legal advisor to FibroGen on this transaction.\n\nConference Call and Webcast Presentation\n\nFibroGen management team will host a conference call and webcast presentation today, February 20, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss the sale of FibroGen China.

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN), the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant, has seen its stock price tumble 15 percent over the past six months, buffeted by a series of unsettling reports emanating from China. A widening investigation by China regulators into alleged illegal drug imports, data breaches, and potential health insurance fraud has cast a shadow over the company\u2019s prospects in a critical market, triggering a securities class action lawsuit in the United States.\n\nHagens Berman has opened an investigation into the allegations and urges investors in AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 23, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 17, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Feb. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/azn\n\nContact the Firm Now: AZN@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nProbe Into AstraZeneca\u2019s China Operations\n\nThe probe conducted by China regulators, which reportedly centers on allegations that AstraZeneca employees improperly imported cancer medications like Enhertu and Imjudo from Hong Kong into mainland China and mishandled patient data, has been compounded by a broader investigation into a large-scale health insurance fraud case. The confluence of these issues has raised serious concerns among investors about the potential impact on the company\u2019s regional sales and overall financial performance.\n\nThe situation escalated with the arrest of Leon Wang, AstraZeneca\u2019s Executive Vice President International and China President. This development, coupled with internal forecasts predicting a downturn in sales within the Chinese market, has prompted a sharp investor reaction, culminating in the legal action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe AstraZeneca Securities Class Action Suit\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that AstraZeneca issued \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d and withheld crucial information regarding the company\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory risks in China. The complaint specifically accuses AstraZeneca of engaging in insurance fraud, facing heightened legal exposure that led to Mr. Wang\u2019s detention, understating the risks associated with its Chinese operations, and failing to disclose the potential for these issues to significantly harm its business and finances in the region.\n\nThe truth allegedly began to emerge in late October. On October 30, AstraZeneca announced that Mr. Wang was cooperating with a Chinese investigation, offering few details. This initial announcement triggered a 3 percent drop in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nThe situation worsened on November 5, when Yicai, a Chinese business news outlet, reported that dozens of AstraZeneca China executives were implicated in the investigation, with some potentially facing lengthy prison sentences. The report, citing an industry insider, attributed the alleged compliance issues to \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on sales representatives to meet aggressive sales targets. This news sent AstraZeneca\u2019s stock down another 7 percent.\n\nOn November 12, AstraZeneca confirmed Mr. Wang\u2019s detention and disclosed that the Chinese investigation encompassed allegations of medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation, and breaches of personal information.\n\nMore recently, on December 18, The Financial Times reported that AstraZeneca executives anticipate a decline in Chinese revenue due to the arrests of Mr. Wang and other senior executives. The report quoted an AstraZeneca executive who stated that \u201cdoctors are unwilling to interact with our salespeople and prescribe our medicines\u201d following the investigation, precipitating a further nearly 4 percent decline in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nHagens Berman Investigation\n\nThese events have prompted shareholder rights firm to open an investigation in the allegations.\n\n\u201cShould the allegations be confirmed, it suggests AstraZeneca misled investors about the true extent of its exposure in China, a failure with potentially serious consequences,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, an attorney leading the firm's investigation.\n\nIf you invested in AstraZeneca and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the AstraZeneca investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding AstraZeneca should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than February 21, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWhy Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDetails of the case: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) AstraZeneca engaged in insurance fraud in China; (2) as a result, AstraZeneca faced heightened legal exposure in China, which eventually resulted in the AstraZeneca China President being detained by Chinese law enforcement authorities; (3) as a result, AstraZeneca understated its legal risks; (4) the foregoing, once revealed, could materially harm AstraZeneca\u2019s business activities in China; and (5) as a result, defendants\u2019 statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the AstraZeneca class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=1331 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

            "content": "AstraZeneca (AZ) has shared positive post-hoc results from late-stage study of its Imfinzi (durvalumab) perioperative regimen in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).\n\nThe phase 3 NIAGARA trial randomised 1,063 MIBC patients to receive Imfinzi plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to bladder removal surgery (cystectomy) followed by Imfinzi, or neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone prior to cystectomy with no further treatment after surgery.\n\nMore than 614,000 people are diagnosed with bladder cancer globally every year, with MIBC, named for its growth into the muscle wall of the bladder, accounting for about one in four cases. Despite standard-of-care cystectomy, approximately half of MIBC patients experience disease recurrence.\n\nAZ previously reported that the Imfinzi/chemotherapy combination demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in NIAGARA\u2019s primary endpoint of event-free survival (EFS) and its key secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS) versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nThe new data from an exploratory subgroup analysis of the trial presented at this year\u2019s American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium showed that AZ\u2019s regimen reduced the risk of disease progression, recurrence, not undergoing surgery, or death by 42% in patients who achieved pathologic complete response (pCR) and by 23% in those who did not, and lowered the risk of death by 28% in patients who achieved pCR and by 16% in those who did not.\n\nThe Imfinzi combination also reduced the risk of developing distant metastases or death by 33% and the risk of death specifically due to bladder cancer by 31%, two secondary endpoints, compared to the comparator arm.\n\nImfinzi already holds approvals in lung cancer, biliary tract cancer, endometrial cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nPerioperative Imfinzi plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy was recently accepted for priority review by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat MIBC, and regulatory applications are also currently under review in the EU and several other countries based on data from NIAGARA.\n\nCristian Massacesi, chief medical officer and oncology chief development officer at AZ, said: \u201cNIAGARA was the first phase 3 trial of a perioperative immunotherapy regimen in MIBC to show statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in EFS and OS.\n\n\u201cThe 33% reduction in the risk of distant metastases, which are associated with a poorer prognosis, further reinforces the potential of perioperative Imfinzi to become a new standard of care in this setting.\u201d",

            "content": "The board of AstraZeneca PLC ( ) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $1.68 on the 24th of March, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. The payment will take the dividend yield to 2.1%, which is in line with the average for the industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAstraZeneca's Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. The last dividend was quite easily covered by AstraZeneca's earnings. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth.\n\nOver the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 96.0%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 28% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $2.80 in 2015 to the most recent total annual payment of $3.10. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 1.0% over that duration. We're glad to see the dividend has risen, but with a limited rate of growth and fluctuations in the payments the total shareholder return may be limited.\n\nThe Dividend Looks Likely To Grow\n\nGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. AstraZeneca has impressed us by growing EPS at 35% per year over the past five years. AstraZeneca is clearly able to grow rapidly while still returning cash to shareholders, positioning it to become a strong dividend payer in the future.\n\nAstraZeneca Looks Like A Great Dividend Stock\n\nIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.\n\nIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

A widening investigation by China regulators into alleged illegal drug imports, data breaches, and potential health insurance fraud has cast a shadow over the company\u2019s prospects in a critical market, triggering a securities class action lawsuit in the United States.\n\nHagens Berman has opened an investigation into the allegations and urges investors in AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 23, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 17, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Feb. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/azn\n\nContact the Firm Now: AZN@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nProbe Into AstraZeneca\u2019s China Operations\n\nThe probe conducted by China regulators, which reportedly centers on allegations that AstraZeneca employees improperly imported cancer medications like Enhertu and Imjudo from Hong Kong into mainland China and mishandled patient data, has been compounded by a broader investigation into a large-scale health insurance fraud case. The confluence of these issues has raised serious concerns among investors about the potential impact on the company\u2019s regional sales and overall financial performance.\n\nThe situation escalated with the arrest of Leon Wang, AstraZeneca\u2019s Executive Vice President International and China President. This development, coupled with internal forecasts predicting a downturn in sales within the Chinese market, has prompted a sharp investor reaction, culminating in the legal action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe AstraZeneca Securities Class Action Suit\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that AstraZeneca issued \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d and withheld crucial information regarding the company\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory risks in China. The complaint specifically accuses AstraZeneca of engaging in insurance fraud, facing heightened legal exposure that led to Mr. Wang\u2019s detention, understating the risks associated with its Chinese operations, and failing to disclose the potential for these issues to significantly harm its business and finances in the region.\n\nThe truth allegedly began to emerge in late October. On October 30, AstraZeneca announced that Mr. Wang was cooperating with a Chinese investigation, offering few details. This initial announcement triggered a 3 percent drop in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nThe situation worsened on November 5, when Yicai, a Chinese business news outlet, reported that dozens of AstraZeneca China executives were implicated in the investigation, with some potentially facing lengthy prison sentences. The report, citing an industry insider, attributed the alleged compliance issues to \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on sales representatives to meet aggressive sales targets. This news sent AstraZeneca\u2019s stock down another 7 percent.\n\nOn November 12, AstraZeneca confirmed Mr. Wang\u2019s detention and disclosed that the Chinese investigation encompassed allegations of medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation, and breaches of personal information.\n\nMore recently, on December 18, The Financial Times reported that AstraZeneca executives anticipate a decline in Chinese revenue due to the arrests of Mr. Wang and other senior executives. The report quoted an AstraZeneca executive who stated that \u201cdoctors are unwilling to interact with our salespeople and prescribe our medicines\u201d following the investigation, precipitating a further nearly 4 percent decline in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nHagens Berman Investigation\n\nThese events have prompted shareholder rights firm to open an investigation in the allegations.\n\n\u201cShould the allegations be confirmed, it suggests AstraZeneca misled investors about the true extent of its exposure in China, a failure with potentially serious consequences,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, an attorney leading the firm's investigation.\n\nIf you invested in AstraZeneca and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the AstraZeneca investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding AstraZeneca should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.

Patients were treated with four cycles of IMFINZI in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy before radical cystectomy followed by eight cycles of IMFINZI monotherapy. These new data were presented at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium. In NIAGARA, treatment with the IMFINZI perioperative regimen improved EFS and OS versus the comparator arm both in patients who achieved pCR and those who did not. This regimen reduced the risk of disease progression, recurrence, not undergoing surgery, or death by 42% in patients who achieved pCR and by 23% in those who did not; and reduced the risk of death by 28% in patients who achieved pCR and by 16% in those who did not. The IMFINZI perioperative regimen also improved metastasis-free survival and disease-specific survival, two secondary endpoints, versus the comparator arm in the intent-to-treat population. This regimen reduced the risk of developing distant metastases or death by 33% and the risk of death specifically due to bladder cancer by 31% versus the comparator arm. These new data build on findings presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress and published in The New England Journal of Medicine which showed NIAGARA met the primary endpoint of EFS and the key secondary endpoint of OS.\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving strong buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nPublished first on TheFly \u2013 the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that (1) AstraZeneca engaged in insurance fraud in China; (2) as a result, AstraZeneca faced heightened legal exposure in China, which eventually resulted in the AstraZeneca China President being detained by Chinese law enforcement authorities; (3) as a result, AstraZeneca understated its legal risks; (4) the foregoing, once revealed, could materially harm AstraZeneca's business activities in China; and (5) as a result, Defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.\n\nOn October 30, 2024, AstraZeneca announced that Leon Wang, Executive Vice President International and AstraZeneca China President, was \"cooperating with an ongoing investigation by Chinese authorities.\"\n\nOn this news, AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares (\"ADS\") fell 3.1% on October 30, 2024.\n\nThen, on November 5, 2024, Yicai Global published an article entitled \"AstraZeneca Insurance Fraud Involves Dozens of Senior Executives in China, Source Says.\" This article stated that \"[d]ozens of senior executives at AstraZeneca China have been implicated in an ongoing insurance fraud case as of last week, according to a person familiar with the matter.\" Further, it stated that \"[o]ver the past three years, insurance fraud cases involving AstraZeneca have surfaced in Shenzhen as well as the provinces of Fujian and Jiangxi. [. . .] These cases amount to the largest insurance fraud in the nation's pharmaceutical sector for years, a person familiar with the matter pointed out.\"\n\nOn this news, AstraZeneca ADSs fell a further 7.2% on November 5, 2024.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AstraZeneca's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nTo learn more about the AstraZeneca class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/AZN or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

Both finished 2024 slightly in the red. They're already doing better in 2025, though. And there are good reasons to think both could maintain a strong performance throughout the year. Here's why.\n\n1. Vertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals performed well for much of 2024. The stock slid during the year's final months, culminating in a massive one-day drop prompted by a clinical setback.\n\nIn a phase 2 study, the company's medication suzetrigine barely performed better than a placebo in treating painful lumbosacral radiculopathy (LSR), a condition that causes pain in patients' lower backs, hips, and legs. While Vertex will advance the medicine to phase 3 studies in this indication, the market isn't convinced it will be successful.\n\nHowever, Vertex remains an attractive stock. Since that setback, the biotech has earned approval for Alyftrek, a next-generation medicine in its core area of expertise, cystic fibrosis (CF).\n\nFurthermore, suzetrigine earned its first indication in treating moderate to severe acute pain -- where it is marketed as Journavx -- becoming the first of a new class of oral non-opioid pain inhibitors on the market.\n\nThese regulatory wins (especially the second) are lifting Vertex's stock, a rally that could continue for much of the year. Alyftrek should start making some noise, as will Journavx. Vertex's Casgevy, a gene-editing treatment for two rare blood-related diseases that has been on the market for a little over a year, could also contribute to the company's financial results.\n\nVertex should see more pipeline progress, too. The company has a duo of novel medicines in phase 3 studies and several more in earlier stages of development. So, after a subpar 2024, Vertex Pharmaceuticals could perform much better in 2025.\n\nWhat's more important, though, are the company's long-term prospects. And on that front, investors have little to worry about today. Vertex's strategy of developing medicines in areas with large unmet needs has proven to work. The company's dominance in CF in the past decade -- which led to excellent financial results and stock-market performances -- proves as much:\n\nVertex's approvals in areas beyond CF and its exciting pipeline make it a great biotech stock to buy.\n\n2. AstraZeneca\n\nAstraZeneca's financial results were strong for most of 2024, as was its stock performance. However, the company faced legal issues in the last few months of the year. Some of its executives in China, including its former president in the country, Leon Wang, have been the subject of investigation by the authorities there. That's on top of an insurance fraud investigation and allegations of smuggling of unapproved drugs, also in China.\n\nThese issues have weighed on AstraZeneca's stock, and certainly add some degree of uncertainty to the company's prospects. However, AstraZeneca's legal problems stem from its operations in China, which strongly suggests wrongdoing by specific people affiliated with the company there. These issues will somewhat affect AstraZeneca's performance in the country, and the company will have to pay back unpaid importation taxes related to the smuggling of unapproved drugs in China.\n\nBut as AstraZeneca starts moving beyond this issue, its stock price will bounce back. The drugmaker once again proved the strength of its underlying operations in the fourth quarter. The company's revenue of $14.9 billion grew by 24% year over year, a very strong performance by a pharmaceutical giant. AstraZeneca's earnings per share (EPS) soared by 44% year over year to $2.09. Its shares jumped following its earnings release.\n\nEven with the China-related issues, AstraZeneca expects its revenue in 2025 to grow by a healthy high-single-digit percentage and its EPS by low double digits. Elsewhere, it expects well over a dozen clinical trial readouts this year, including for AZD6234, a potential anti-obesity medicine. Between AstraZeneca's current lineup, which is still producing excellent results, and its deep pipeline that will lead to plenty of approvals and label expansions, the drugmaker has strong long-term prospects.\n\nIf not for its issues in China, AstraZeneca's shares would almost certainly be in the green over the trailing-12-month period, so that headwind is already factored into its stock price. If it can deal with that problem, AstraZeneca could perform much better this year. And the stock could also deliver outsized returns to long-term investors.",

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN), the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant, has seen its stock price tumble 15 percent over the past six months, buffeted by a series of unsettling reports emanating from China. A widening investigation by China regulators into alleged illegal drug imports, data breaches, and potential health insurance fraud has cast a shadow over the company\u2019s prospects in a critical market, triggering a securities class action lawsuit in the United States.\n\nHagens Berman has opened an investigation into the allegations and urges investors in AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 23, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 17, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Feb. 21, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/azn Contact the Firm Now: AZN@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895\n\nProbe Into AstraZeneca\u2019s China Operations\n\nThe probe conducted by China regulators, which reportedly centers on allegations that AstraZeneca employees improperly imported cancer medications like Enhertu and Imjudo from Hong Kong into mainland China and mishandled patient data, has been compounded by a broader investigation into a large-scale health insurance fraud case. The confluence of these issues has raised serious concerns among investors about the potential impact on the company\u2019s regional sales and overall financial performance.\n\nThe situation escalated with the arrest of Leon Wang, AstraZeneca\u2019s Executive Vice President International and China President. This development, coupled with internal forecasts predicting a downturn in sales within the Chinese market, has prompted a sharp investor reaction, culminating in the legal action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe AstraZeneca Securities Class Action Suit\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that AstraZeneca issued \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d and withheld crucial information regarding the company\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory risks in China. The complaint specifically accuses AstraZeneca of engaging in insurance fraud, facing heightened legal exposure that led to Mr. Wang\u2019s detention, understating the risks associated with its Chinese operations, and failing to disclose the potential for these issues to significantly harm its business and finances in the region.\n\nThe truth allegedly began to emerge in late October. On October 30, AstraZeneca announced that Mr. Wang was cooperating with a Chinese investigation, offering few details. This initial announcement triggered a 3 percent drop in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nThe situation worsened on November 5, when Yicai, a Chinese business news outlet, reported that dozens of AstraZeneca China executives were implicated in the investigation, with some potentially facing lengthy prison sentences. The report, citing an industry insider, attributed the alleged compliance issues to \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on sales representatives to meet aggressive sales targets. This news sent AstraZeneca\u2019s stock down another 7 percent.\n\nOn November 12, AstraZeneca confirmed Mr. Wang\u2019s detention and disclosed that the Chinese investigation encompassed allegations of medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation, and breaches of personal information.\n\nMore recently, on December 18, The Financial Times reported that AstraZeneca executives anticipate a decline in Chinese revenue due to the arrests of Mr. Wang and other senior executives. The report quoted an AstraZeneca executive who stated that \u201cdoctors are unwilling to interact with our salespeople and prescribe our medicines\u201d following the investigation, precipitating a further nearly 4 percent decline in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nHagens Berman Investigation\n\nThese events have prompted shareholder rights firm to open an investigation in the allegations.\n\n\u201cShould the allegations be confirmed, it suggests AstraZeneca misled investors about the true extent of its exposure in China, a failure with potentially serious consequences,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, an attorney leading the firm's investigation.\n\nIf you invested in AstraZeneca and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the AstraZeneca investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding AstraZeneca should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Foreign Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) stands against the other foreign dividend stocks.\n\nDividends have historically been a key driver of investor returns, contributing 85% of the broader market's total return since 1960. In Q3 2024, global dividends hit a record $431.1 billion, despite a drop in special one-off dividends. Underlying dividend growth remains strong at 6.4% for 2024.\n\nSome markets saw major milestones. According to a Janus Henderson report, China, India, and Singapore hit record-high dividends, while the US got a boost from Big Tech firms, which started paying dividends for the first time. In fact, 96% of US companies either increased their payouts or kept them steady. Financials and tech were the biggest growth drivers, while mining and transport lagged behind.\n\nIndia stood out in a big way, and its dividends surged 27.4% to a record $16.2 billion in Q3. Nearly every company posted double-digit increases, and a whopping 97% of Indian companies in the Janus Henderson index have raised or maintained dividends over the last two years, well above the global average. Japan and Canada also continued their upward trend in the third quarter, with a 6.1% and 6.5% increase in dividends, respectively. On the other hand, Europe\u2019s dividend growth slowed a bit to 3.9%, and the UK saw a 7% drop in dividends, mainly because a few commodity giants slashed payouts to manage debt and weak profits.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region was a mixed bag. Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Australia saw dividend declines in Q3, while Singapore and South Korea posted steady gains. Meanwhile, Brazil\u2019s dividends plunged 42% in Q3, but since Brazilian companies have irregular payout patterns, the drop is not as dramatic as it seems. Elsewhere in emerging markets, Saudi Arabia and Thailand were among the strongest performers in the third quarter. Despite some regional setbacks, the overall outlook for dividends remains positive, with financials and tech leading the charge globally.\n\nFor years, international stocks have taken a backseat to the dominance of major US tech companies, but that trend could be shifting. A combination of global factors is making foreign equities more attractive to investors, with the main reason being the recent decline of the US dollar against the euro and other major currencies since last October. Given this, we will take at some of the best foreign dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to filter out foreign dividend stocks. Next, we manually searched for the average upside potential of each stock and selected 13 stocks with the highest values. The list below is ranked in ascending order of the upside potential as of February 12. We have also mentioned the dividend yields and hedge fund sentiment as of Q3 2024.",

The primary outcome, objective response rate as assessed by a blinded independent review board, was 41% in the adult cohort and 52% in pediatric patients. These response results were accompanied by \u201cdeep and durable\u201d reductions in tumor volume, according to SpringWorks, as well as \u201cearly and sustained\u201d improvements in pain and quality of life.\n\n\u201cThe NF1-PN patient community has a great need for more treatment options,\u201d SpringWorks CEO Saqib Islam said in a statement, noting that Gomekli\u2019s approval provides these patients with a therapy that has the potential to shrink their tumors and offer meaningful symptomatic relief.\u201d Gomekli will be available through specialty distributors and pharmacies \u201cwithin two weeks,\u201d as per Tuesday\u2019s announcement.\n\nNeurofibromatosis is a highly diverse condition that refers to the development of mostly benign tumors affecting the brain, spinal cord and nerves. NF1-PN, specifically, afflicts around 40,000 patients in the U.S. The mostly benign tumors that develop in patients with NF1-PN carry an extra risk of transforming into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.\n\nWith the approval of Gomekli, SpringWorks will now go head-to-head with AstraZeneca\u2019s drug Koselugo, which was approved in 2020 for NF1-PN. Koselugo is a high-growth asset for the pharma, surging 96% year-on-year to earn $631 million in 2024. SpringWorks is challenging AstraZeneca\u2019s first-to-market advantage with a broader label. Unlike Gomekli, Koselugo is indicated only for pediatric NF1-PN patients.\n\nGomekli\u2019s regulatory win also comes just days after German pharma Merck KGaA confirmed that it is in talks with SpringWorks regarding a potential acquisition. The parties have yet to enter into any legally binding agreements and the \u201cthere is no certainty that any transaction will materialize,\u201d Merck KGaA insisted.\n\nStill, news of the acquisition sent shares of SpringWorks soaring 34% in its aftermath, bringing the biotech\u2019s market value to approximately $4 billion at market close on Monday. Gomekli is only SpringWorks\u2019 second FDA-approved drug, after Ogsiveo, a treatment for desmoid tumors approved in November 2023.",

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN), the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant, has seen its stock price tumble 15 percent over the past six months, buffeted by a series of unsettling reports emanating from China. A widening investigation by China regulators into alleged illegal drug imports, data breaches, and potential health insurance fraud has cast a shadow over the company\u2019s prospects in a critical market, triggering a securities class action lawsuit in the United States.\n\nHagens Berman has opened an investigation into the allegations and urges investors in AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 23, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 17, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Feb. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/azn\n\nContact the Firm Now: AZN@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nProbe Into AstraZeneca\u2019s China Operations\n\nThe probe conducted by China regulators, which reportedly centers on allegations that AstraZeneca employees improperly imported cancer medications like Enhertu and Imjudo from Hong Kong into mainland China and mishandled patient data, has been compounded by a broader investigation into a large-scale health insurance fraud case. The confluence of these issues has raised serious concerns among investors about the potential impact on the company\u2019s regional sales and overall financial performance.\n\nThe situation escalated with the arrest of Leon Wang, AstraZeneca\u2019s Executive Vice President International and China President. This development, coupled with internal forecasts predicting a downturn in sales within the Chinese market, has prompted a sharp investor reaction, culminating in the legal action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe AstraZeneca Securities Class Action Suit\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that AstraZeneca issued \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d and withheld crucial information regarding the company\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory risks in China. The complaint specifically accuses AstraZeneca of engaging in insurance fraud, facing heightened legal exposure that led to Mr. Wang\u2019s detention, understating the risks associated with its Chinese operations, and failing to disclose the potential for these issues to significantly harm its business and finances in the region.\n\nThe truth allegedly began to emerge in late October. On October 30, AstraZeneca announced that Mr. Wang was cooperating with a Chinese investigation, offering few details. This initial announcement triggered a 3 percent drop in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nThe situation worsened on November 5, when Yicai, a Chinese business news outlet, reported that dozens of AstraZeneca China executives were implicated in the investigation, with some potentially facing lengthy prison sentences. The report, citing an industry insider, attributed the alleged compliance issues to \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on sales representatives to meet aggressive sales targets. This news sent AstraZeneca\u2019s stock down another 7 percent.\n\nOn November 12, AstraZeneca confirmed Mr. Wang\u2019s detention and disclosed that the Chinese investigation encompassed allegations of medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation, and breaches of personal information.\n\nMore recently, on December 18, The Financial Times reported that AstraZeneca executives anticipate a decline in Chinese revenue due to the arrests of Mr. Wang and other senior executives. The report quoted an AstraZeneca executive who stated that \u201cdoctors are unwilling to interact with our salespeople and prescribe our medicines\u201d following the investigation, precipitating a further nearly 4 percent decline in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nHagens Berman Investigation\n\nThese events have prompted shareholder rights firm to open an investigation in the allegations.\n\n\u201cShould the allegations be confirmed, it suggests AstraZeneca misled investors about the true extent of its exposure in China, a failure with potentially serious consequences,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, an attorney leading the firm's investigation.\n\nIf you invested in AstraZeneca and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the AstraZeneca investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding AstraZeneca should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC. For more information, call Reed Kathrein at 844-916-0895 or email AZN@hbsslaw.com.\n\nAbout Hagens Berman\n\nHagens Berman is a global plaintiffs\u2019 rights complex litigation firm focusing on corporate accountability.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than February 21, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) AstraZeneca engaged in insurance fraud in China; (2) as a result, AstraZeneca faced heightened legal exposure in China, which eventually resulted in the AstraZeneca China President being detained by Chinese law enforcement authorities; (3) as a result, AstraZeneca understated its legal risks; (4) the foregoing, once revealed, could materially harm AstraZeneca\u2019s business activities in China; and (5) as a result, defendants\u2019 statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the AstraZeneca class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=1331 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified.

Analyst Sachin Jain from Bank of America Securities maintained a Buy rating on the stock and has a p14,500.00 price target.\n\nSachin Jain\u2019s rating is based on AstraZeneca\u2019s strong growth prospects and an attractive valuation. The company\u2019s valuation, approximately 14 times the estimated 2026 Price-to-Earnings ratio, is considered appealing, particularly with the potential for re-rating to an 18 times P/E ratio based on projected sales growth. AstraZeneca\u2019s mid-term guidance suggests a high-single-digit sales compound annual growth rate, which supports the optimistic outlook.\n\nAdditionally, over the next 18 months, AstraZeneca is expected to deliver significant clinical trial results that could transform its business landscape. These include several key Phase III trials with a potential sales impact of around $30 billion. Among these, the Dato 1L NSCLC (AVANZAR) and Camizestrant SERENA-6 in ESR1m BC are highlighted as pivotal, alongside promising developments in hypertension, ATTR-CM, and HER2+ breast cancer treatments. These factors, coupled with two additional Phase III blockbuster trials for rare disease assets, underpin the Buy rating and reflect confidence in the company\u2019s future performance.\n\nIn another report released today, Morgan Stanley also initiated coverage with a Buy rating on the stock with a p14,500.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "A genetic disease that causes tumors to form on nerves has a new FDA-approved treatment, a SpringWorks Therapeutics drug that can address a wider range of patients than the AstraZeneca product that was first to treat this rare disorder.\n\nThe disease, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), is technically not cancer as the tumors that form are benign. But NF1 can lead to cancers. Even if a patient\u2019s tumors aren\u2019t cancerous, they are painful and disfiguring. The FDA approval announced Tuesday covers the treatment of NF1 tumors that cannot be surgically removed. The drug, known in development as mirdametinib, will be marketed under the brand name Gomekli. SpringWorks expects the new product will become available within two weeks.\n\nStamford, Connecticut-based SpringWorks estimates that of the approximately 100,000 in the U.S. who have NF1, about 40,000 have tumors that infiltrate nerves. The disease stems from mutations in the NF1 gene, which codes for a protein key to suppressing MAPK, a pathway that, when hyperactivated, drives cancer growth. Tumors that result from the mutations are usually aggressive, growing rapidly during a patient\u2019s childhood. Surgery is the first treatment option, but the location of tumors at or near vital structures or organs can make this choice risky. Off-label drug options include cancer medications, such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy.\n\nSponsored Post Tackling Messy Provider Data with an NPI-Forward Approach Mike Wirth of ProviderTrust shares insights about the company in this interview at the ViVE 2025 conference in Nashville last month.\n\nGomekli is an oral small molecule designed to block MEK1 and MEK2, two proteins that play key roles in the MAPK pathway. MEK inhibitors have already been approved for treating certain cancers. Koselugo, the AstraZeneca drug that became the first FDA approved NF1 therapy in 2020, is a MEK inhibitor that was initially tested in various solid tumors. In NF1, Koselugo is approved only for treating pediatric patients age 2 and older. The SpringWorks drug has an advantage with an approval that covers the treatment of adults as well as children.\n\nThe FDA decision for Gomekli was based on the results of a single-arm, Phase 2 study that enrolled 114 patients \u2014 58 adults and 56 children \u2014 with symptomatic, inoperable NF1-associated tumors. The main goal was to measure for the disappearance or reduction of tumors. Results showed the overall response rate was 41% for adults and 52% for children. The most common adverse reactions included rash, diarrhea, nausea, and muscle pain.\n\nThe study results were published this past November in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Dr. Christopher Moertel, medical director pediatric neuro-oncology and neurofibromatosis programs at the University of Minnesota and the lead investigator of the ReNeu clinical trial, said NF1 patients face significant health challenges and have limited treatment options.\n\n\u201cIt was very encouraging in the ReNeu trial to see that Gomekli provided deep and durable responses, with a manageable safety profile that enabled patients to stay on therapy,\u201d Moertel said in SpringWorks\u2019 announcement. \u201cThis approval represents an important advance, especially for adults who previously did not have an approved treatment.\u201d\n\nSponsored Post How PDPM Optimization Improves Facility Financial Performance Transitioning to PDPM models significantly shifted the healthcare industry. By replacing the RUG system, healthcare providers cut waste and more accurately reflect the care each patient received.\n\nGomekli is still under regulatory review in Europe. In the U.S., the drug will be available as a capsule as well as a tablet that may be swallowed or mixed in water. The twice-daily drug will come in two dosage strengths. Precise dosing is determined by a patient\u2019s body surface area, taking into account both height and weight. SpringWorks set a wholesale price of $206.25 per mg, according to a Wednesday regulatory filing. The company estimates the average cost of treatment will be about $22,000 per month for pediatric patients and $30,000 per month for adults.\n\nThe Gomekli approval comes as SpringWorks has emerged as a potential acquisition target for Merck KGaA. Following a Reuters report of negotiations for a deal, the German company issued a statement Monday confirming advanced discussions with SpringWorks. However, Merck KGaA said the companies have not entered a legally binding agreement, adding that \u201ccritical conditions have yet to be met.\u201d\n\nIf Merck KGaA can swing a deal for SpringWorks, it will get more than the new NF1 drug. In 2023, SpringWorks drug Ogsiveo received the FDA nod for treating desmoid tumors, a rare type of tumor affecting connective tissue. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024, Ogsiveo accounted for $110 million in revenue, according to the biotech\u2019s most recent financial report. Both Ogsiveo and Gomekli were initially developed by Pfizer, which spun them off into standalone company SpringWorks in 2017.\n\nBeyond NF1, SpringWorks is testing Gomekli in certain cancers. As a monotherapy, the drug has reached mid-stage clinical testing in pediatric low-grade gliomas. Under a partnership with BeiGene, Gomekli is also being tested in solid tumors driven by RAS and RAF mutations; a Phase 1 study is evaluating the SpringWorks drug in combination with BeiGene\u2019s experimental lifirafenib, a small molecule inhibitor of RAF enzymes.\n\nPhoto by SpringWorks Therapeutics",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best International Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) stands against the other international dividend stocks.\n\nDividend stocks have been grabbing investors' attention for a while now. According to JP Morgan, over the last two decades, global dividends per share have increased at an annual rate of 5.6%, but analysts expect this to rise to 7.6% in the future, driven by historically low payout ratios. During the 2020 pandemic, many companies cut dividends, but as earnings have recovered, especially in Big Tech and AI, dividends have not kept up. With payout ratios at 25-year lows, simply returning to normal could add 2% annual growth over the next five years.\n\nAfter slowing down post-COVID, global dividend growth made a surprising comeback last year, increasing 8% and adding an extra $180 billion in payouts despite ongoing economic and geopolitical challenges. According to S&P Global, this was largely driven by record dividend initiations in US tech, European banks, Japan\u2019s auto industry, and solid growth from China. Even oil and gas companies held strong despite market volatility. Looking ahead, experts predict global dividends will hold steady at $2.3 trillion in 2025.\n\nRegionally, developed Asia, which includes Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, South Korea, and Singapore, is looking at a 3% rise in dividends this year. Europe, on the other hand, is expected to see a 3.4% decline. In emerging markets, the trends are mixed. Asia, led by China, India, and Taiwan, is on track for a 5% increase, while dividends in the Middle East and Africa could drop by 20%, mainly because Saudi Aramco\u2019s special dividend program ended. Latin America is also expected to see a small dip of around 4%.\n\nWhen it comes to sectors, banks and energy companies remain the biggest dividend payers. Banks are expected to distribute around $380 billion globally, but after four years of rapid 20% growth, they are now down to just 2%. Banks are playing it safe, waiting to see how interest rates move. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best international dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the BlackRock International Dividend ETF to filter out dividend stocks listed on US exchanges but headquartered internationally. We focused on picking stocks that were most popular among hedge funds. The list below is ranked in the ascending order of Q3 2024 hedge fund sentiment, and dividend yields are mentioned as of February 11.",

The company is expected to achieve significant double-digit growth in both revenue and earnings per share by 2025, which has helped allay investor concerns regarding its high investment spending and potential market challenges. With continued momentum in product sales, particularly for its key drugs Imfinzi, Teszpire, and Enhertu, AstraZeneca is well-positioned for potential earnings upgrades.\n\nFurthermore, AstraZeneca\u2019s diverse pipeline offers considerable optionality and exposure to lucrative markets, including targeted chemotherapy for cancer, cardiovascular and renal therapies, and next-generation immuno-oncology. These areas present significant upside potential and could unlock value closer to Morgan Stanley\u2019s bullish valuation target. The upcoming year is expected to be rich in catalysts, with pivotal clinical data readouts that could positively impact AstraZeneca\u2019s stock performance and support its long-term revenue goals.\n\nIn another report released yesterday, Bernstein also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a \u00a3190.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Safest Dividend Stocks in the UK. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) stands against other safest dividend stocks in the UK.\n\nIn recent years, investors have increasingly shifted away from UK equities, favoring global stocks, particularly high-growth sectors like US technology. The UK stock market is shrinking at its fastest pace in over a decade, largely due to a wave of takeovers involving London-listed companies. Bloomberg data showed that around 45 firms have been delisted from the London market in 2024 through mergers and acquisitions, reflecting a 10% rise from last year\u2019s total. This marks the highest level of delistings since 2010. At the same time, the value of deals involving UK companies has climbed 81% this year, surpassing $160 billion.\n\nOver the last ten years, the British index has delivered an annual total return of 6%, significantly lagging behind the 13% return of the broader US market. Analysts attribute this weaker performance to sluggish earnings growth, political uncertainty within the UK, and the lack of a dominant technology sector. However, a key factor has been the sharp drop in valuations as investors have increasingly moved away from UK stocks. According to Goldman Sachs, the issue is not a lack of foreign investor interest\u2014who currently account for roughly two-thirds of the UK market capitalization\u2014but rather the low engagement of domestic investors in UK equities.\n\nAlso read: 10 Best Annual Dividend Stocks To Buy Now\n\nThat said, several factors seem to be contributing to a shift in investor sentiment. In November 2024, UK equity funds saw inflows after more than three years of continuous monthly withdrawals and a large sell-off leading up to the Budget. According to data from Calastone, retail investors invested a net \u00a3317 million into UK-focused stock funds that month. This marks a significant change, halting a streak of 41 months of net outflows, during which over \u00a325 billion had been pulled from these funds since May 2021.\n\nAnalysts also believe that the UK stock market may be on the verge of recovery, although the exact timing and pace of this shift are unclear. In this context, dividend stocks are crucial. Focusing on stocks with growing dividends can offer stability and consistency across different market conditions. These stocks also provide long-term growth potential, compounding returns as share prices recover. The UK market offers some of the highest dividend yields among major markets, with the \u201cFootsie\u201d yielding 3.46%, and the FTSE 250 offering slightly lower but still attractive yields. This setup enables investors to focus on high-growth areas, like smaller companies, while enjoying the benefit of increasing dividends. According to BlackRock, UK market dividends are currently growing at a rate of 2-3%, roughly in line with long-term inflation. Companies with growing dividends typically have strong cash flows, allowing them to increase payouts over time.",

However, revised budget allocations led to a reduction in financial backing, making the investment unfeasible for AstraZeneca.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t make the business case work and couldn\u2019t make the investment economically viable. We needed the same level of support to make this economically viable. It wasn\u2019t possible for the Government to justify it, which we totally understand, and we said we couldn\u2019t justify it either. We were all very disappointed, but that\u2019s business life,\u201d Pascal Soriot, CEO of AstraZeneca, told The Guardian.\n\nCancellation of AstraZeneca\u2019s Liverpool vaccine manufacturing facility\n\nImpact on UK\u2019s pharmaceutical sector\n\nAs global pharmaceutical companies seek stability and financial incentives, responsibility lies with the government to ensure that the UK remains a viable destination for research, development, and manufacturing investments\u201d\n\nThe cancellation raises concerns about the UK\u2019s competitiveness in pharmaceutical manufacturing. With increasing global competition, including incentives from countries such as Singapore and the US, AstraZeneca\u2019s move signals potential challenges for the UK\u2019s ability to retain large-scale pharmaceutical investments.\n\nAstraZeneca remains committed to its UK operations but continues to assess opportunities in regions that offer more favourable financial conditions and regulatory support.\n\nIndustry experts warn that this development could have long-term implications for the UK\u2019s life sciences sector. As global pharmaceutical companies seek stability and financial incentives, responsibility lies with the government to ensure that the UK remains a viable destination for research, development, and manufacturing investments.\n\nInternational investment\n\nDespite this setback in the pharmaceutical firm\u2019s UK operations, a new investment announced the last month will focus on strengthening its presence in Canada, supporting the company\u2019s goal of bringing 20 novel medicines to patients worldwide by the end of the decade.",

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN), the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant, has seen its stock price tumble 15 percent over the past six months, buffeted by a series of unsettling reports emanating from China. A widening investigation by China regulators into alleged illegal drug imports, data breaches, and potential health insurance fraud has cast a shadow over the company\u2019s prospects in a critical market, triggering a securities class action lawsuit in the United States.\n\nHagens Berman has opened an investigation into the allegations and urges investors in AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 23, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 17, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Feb. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/azn\n\nContact the Firm Now: AZN@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nProbe Into AstraZeneca\u2019s China Operations\n\nThe probe conducted by China regulators, which reportedly centers on allegations that AstraZeneca employees improperly imported cancer medications like Enhertu and Imjudo from Hong Kong into mainland China and mishandled patient data, has been compounded by a broader investigation into a large-scale health insurance fraud case. The confluence of these issues has raised serious concerns among investors about the potential impact on the company\u2019s regional sales and overall financial performance.\n\nThe situation escalated with the arrest of Leon Wang, AstraZeneca\u2019s Executive Vice President International and China President. This development, coupled with internal forecasts predicting a downturn in sales within the Chinese market, has prompted a sharp investor reaction, culminating in the legal action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe AstraZeneca Securities Class Action Suit\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that AstraZeneca issued \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d and withheld crucial information regarding the company\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory risks in China. The complaint specifically accuses AstraZeneca of engaging in insurance fraud, facing heightened legal exposure that led to Mr. Wang\u2019s detention, understating the risks associated with its Chinese operations, and failing to disclose the potential for these issues to significantly harm its business and finances in the region.\n\nThe truth allegedly began to emerge in late October. On October 30, AstraZeneca announced that Mr. Wang was cooperating with a Chinese investigation, offering few details. This initial announcement triggered a 3 percent drop in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nThe situation worsened on November 5, when Yicai, a Chinese business news outlet, reported that dozens of AstraZeneca China executives were implicated in the investigation, with some potentially facing lengthy prison sentences. The report, citing an industry insider, attributed the alleged compliance issues to \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on sales representatives to meet aggressive sales targets. This news sent AstraZeneca\u2019s stock down another 7 percent.\n\nOn November 12, AstraZeneca confirmed Mr. Wang\u2019s detention and disclosed that the Chinese investigation encompassed allegations of medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation, and breaches of personal information.\n\nMore recently, on December 18, The Financial Times reported that AstraZeneca executives anticipate a decline in Chinese revenue due to the arrests of Mr. Wang and other senior executives. The report quoted an AstraZeneca executive who stated that \u201cdoctors are unwilling to interact with our salespeople and prescribe our medicines\u201d following the investigation, precipitating a further nearly 4 percent decline in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nHagens Berman Investigation\n\nThese events have prompted shareholder rights firm to open an investigation in the allegations.\n\n\u201cShould the allegations be confirmed, it suggests AstraZeneca misled investors about the true extent of its exposure in China, a failure with potentially serious consequences,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, an attorney leading the firm's investigation.\n\nIf you invested in AstraZeneca and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the AstraZeneca investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding AstraZeneca should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than February 21, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) AstraZeneca engaged in insurance fraud in China; (2) as a result, AstraZeneca faced heightened legal exposure in China, which eventually resulted in the AstraZeneca China President being detained by Chinese law enforcement authorities; (3) as a result, AstraZeneca understated its legal risks; (4) the foregoing, once revealed, could materially harm AstraZeneca\u2019s business activities in China; and (5) as a result, defendants\u2019 statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the AstraZeneca class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=1331 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

One of the key reasons is the company\u2019s promising pipeline of new drugs, which positions it well for future success in the pharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, AstraZeneca has shown strong financial performance, particularly with its recent earnings report exceeding market expectations.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the Buy rating is AstraZeneca\u2019s strategic focus on expanding its presence in key markets, including China, where it has managed to secure a favorable position despite regulatory challenges. Additionally, the company\u2019s commitment to innovation and its ability to adapt to changing market dynamics further bolster confidence in its long-term prospects. These elements combined make AstraZeneca an attractive investment opportunity according to Ronald Keung\u2019s analysis.\n\nIn another report released on February 6, Bank of America Securities also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a p14,500.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "At a tense meeting with senior civil servants on the afternoon of 29 January, the UK chair of AstraZeneca, Shaun Grady, pulled the plug on a planned \u00a3450m expansion of its childhood flu vaccine factory in Merseyside \u2013 bringing a year and a half of negotiations to an abrupt halt.\n\nThe decision, announced publicly two days later, came just hours after the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, had singled out Britain\u2019s biggest drugmaker as one of the country\u2019s \u201cgreat companies\u201d in her long-awaited speech on kickstarting UK growth.\n\nIf successful, the scheme would have transformed the site into a six-hectare research and manufacturing centre producing the next generation of vaccines \u2013 strengthening the UK\u2019s pandemic readiness with the ability to make several at a time from start to finish.\n\nIn July last year, AstraZeneca\u2019s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, had declared the project in the Liverpool suburb of Speke \u201cabsolutely ready to go\u201d. So how did months of wrangling over a \u00a390m state support offer made by the previous government collapse into recriminations?\n\nIt is not the UK\u2019s first big investment loss in this sector. At the height of Covid, Britain\u2019s second biggest pharma firm, GSK \u2013 a major vaccine maker whose biggest site is in Belgium \u2013 was keen to start producing jabs in the UK. \u201cThey were looking at where they were going to build their future manufacturing,\u201d said Clive Dix, who chaired the UK\u2019s Covid vaccine taskforce during the pandemic. \u201cI helped broker, getting them talking to government, and there were some great ideas going forward, but [GSK] walked away in the end. They just said: \u2018Too slow. It\u2019s too difficult.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe said government departments \u201cwant you to fill so many forms in and go through so many hoops \u2013 it\u2019s just not how business works, unfortunately\u201d.\n\nSome have questioned the way civil servants calculate value for the taxpayer from big corporate investments that are supported by government incentives. In AstraZeneca\u2019s case, Dix put the blame squarely on the \u201cmachinery at Whitehall\u201d, pointing to \u201cpenny-pinching\u201d civil servants who \u201cdon\u2019t understand the ecosystem\u201d. He argues that \u201cministers can only go by the recommendation they\u2019re given\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen Liverpool has a significant life sciences sector. Photograph: Rolf Richardson/Alamy\n\nKeith Neal, emeritus professor of epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said: \u201cVaccines are a massive growth industry. I know the drug companies play one country [against] another, but \u2026 this was a potential major benefit to ensuring the vaccine supply\u201d.\n\nAstraZeneca \u2013 the UK\u2019s largest listed company, with a valuation of about \u00a3180bn \u2013 first began talking to ministers about the Speke expansion in July 2023 and it was announced in last year\u2019s March budget by the then chancellor, Jeremy Hunt. The next day, he was pictured striding at the Speke factory where he described the investment as a \u201cvote of confidence in the UK and an investment that helps to grow our economy\u201d.\n\nThe government\u2019s press release noted the decision was \u201ccontingent upon mutual agreement \u2026 and successful completion of regulatory processes\u201d.\n\nBut after Labour won the election on 4 July, all spending was put on hold by Reeves. Then, given the precarious state of the public finances, the government decided to cut the Speke support package to \u00a340m \u2013 less than half Hunt\u2019s offer of \u00a370m in grants and \u00a320m in research and development (R&D) support.\n\nAs meetings between the company, the Treasury, the business department, the science department and the Office for Life Sciences \u2013 part of the health and science departments \u2013 continued over months, the timetable, from AstraZeneca\u2019s point of view, slipped.\n\nWhy are billions of pounds pumped into the south on projects but they\u2019re squabbling over small amounts for Liverpool? Carl Cashman, local authority opposition leader\n\nIt had wanted to wrap up the deal by August to keep it on track with regard to other investments. The company is putting in $3.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) in the US, and building a $1.5bn site to make next-generation cancer treatments in Singapore \u2013 where it has received \u201cvery substantial support\u201d, Soriot said pointedly last week.\n\nThe cell-based technology to be introduced at Speke \u2013 which can make vaccines more effective and easier to produce than the current egg-based process \u2013 required clinical trials ahead of regulatory approval.\n\nShortly after Labour was elected, Grady told the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, that beginning in August was \u201can urgent issue \u2026 to meet our business case timelines\u201d, according to a letter obtained by the Times.\n\nThe government upped its offer at the end of October, after Reeves announced a new \u00a3520m life sciences innovative manufacturing fund, and the Financial Times reported it was eventually revised to \u00a378m. But AstraZeneca wanted the government to honour Hunt\u2019s \u00a390m proposal and Soriot said on Thursday the firm had been willing to increase its investment to \u00a3500m to seal the deal.\n\nSpeaking after AstraZeneca reported a 38% jump in annual profits to $8.7bn, he denied any rift with the government: \u201cWe could not make the business case work and we needed a certain level of support to make this economically viable. And that was not possible for the government to justify, which we totally understand. We were all very disappointed.\u201d\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s breast cancer drug Enhertu was rejected by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) for use in England and Wales for the third time in November on pricing grounds. The rejection came despite months of negotiations and the intervention of the health secretary, Wes Streeting.\n\nSoriot denied any link between the decisions on Enhertu and Speke. He said the UK\u2019s recent move to increase in the amount it clawed back from sales of NHS drugs had discouraged investment, but said that had \u201cnothing to do with Speke\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen Emma Walmsley of GSK: \u2018It is absolutely critical that the UK government does step up and accelerate progress.\u2019 Photograph: REX/Shutterstock\n\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cAll government funding must demonstrate value for the taxpayer and, due to a change in the terms originally agreed, we could not justify offering the same amount of funding.\u201d\n\nChris Bryant, the science minister, told MPs last week that the support package had been cut because the drugmaker had reduced its proposed R&D spending at Speke from \u00a3150m to \u00a390m, describing the cancelled investment as \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d. This left shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith to crow: \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine for incompetence.\u201d\n\nDix said: \u201cThis was a slam dunk. They shouldn\u2019t be quibbling over \u00a310m or \u00a320m; we\u2019re talking about trying to build resilience for the UK \u2026 It\u2019s what the UK needs. It needs manufacturing capability. Manufacturing capability for science has moved abroad.\u201d\n\nIn Liverpool, the news was greeted with dismay and disbelief. The city\u2019s regional combined authority was not part of the talks, but its mayor, Steve Rotheram, said he \u201ccontinues to be in discussions with the government about the funding that had been earmarked for this project, and we are pushing to ensure that it remains in the city region, helping to fuel other transformational life \u00adsciences projects\u201d.\n\nCarl Cashman, the authority\u2019s opposition leader, urged the mayor to \u201cdemand answers\u201d from parliament. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s devastating news for the growth of the sector and for jobs but I think a wider point is: why [are] billions of pounds pumped into the south on projects but they\u2019re squabbling over small amounts for Liverpool and the north in comparison?\u201d\n\nThe ditched investment may have ramifications for the city\u2019s life science investment zone, where several disease projects are getting under way, said Janet Hemingway, former president of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, who set up an infection innovation consortium in the city in 2020. AstraZeneca\u2019s current Speke site only does routine flu vaccine manufacturing. \u201cBy expanding the site to do more vaccine-related R&D, it would have made it easier to collaborate,\u201d she said.\n\nGSK\u2019s chief executive, Emma Walmsley, also weighed into the debate, saying: \u201cIt is absolutely critical \u2026 that the UK government does step up and accelerate progress alongside industry, given the pace of change across the world and the fierce competition from other countries, which is only getting stronger.\u201d\n\nThe 450 people working at the Speke site found out about the cancellation when the news leaked, forcing AstraZeneca to rush out its announcement. While the 31 January statement stressed the facility would continue to produce childhood flu nasal spray for the UK and US vaccination programmes, this was cold comfort to those who had banked on a boost to the city \u2013 and to Reeves in her push for investment in Britain.",

But \"the matter was smoothed over\" and the chancellor at the time, Jeremy Hunt, got a final government offer of \u00a390 million \"over the line\".\n\nThe relationship \"frayed\" again when the AstraZeneca board became \"angered\" by the government's \"aggressive negotiations\" on drug pricing.\n\nHunt announced the proposed deal but then Rishi Sunak called a general election and the government \"entered campaign mode\", leaving the deal and a pending AstraZeneca grant application \"hanging in limbo\".\n\nAfter the election, the new Labour government claimed there had been no due diligence done on the deal and it offered a revised subsidy of just \u00a340 million, prompting a \"hissy fit\" at AstraZeneca. Later, the Treasury put \u00a378 million \"on the table\".\n\nWithin months, the company announced it was scrapping the plan. It told the FT this was partly because of \"the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government's proposal\".\n\nThe announcement was particularly embarrassing for Reeves because it came just hours after she'd named AstraZeneca as one of Britain's \"great companies\" in a speech about growth.\n\nWhat does this all mean?\n\nThe company\u2019s decision to abandon the Speke project was \"seen as a heavy blow to the government\", said The Telegraph. In \"substance and timing\", AstraZeneca's decision is \"a blow to the government's recent zeal for growth\", said Sky News.\n\nIt's the \"second multinational to blame the new government for a withdrawal of investment\". In November, Vauxhall owner Stellantis said it would close its Luton van plant, blaming net zero targets.\n\nMike Storey, a Liberal Democrat peer and former leader of Liverpool City Council, told the BBC it was \"absolutely shocking\" that the deal had collapsed at a time when \"billions\" were being spent on the life sciences sector in the Southeast.\n\nAndrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said that \"in the same week\" the government talked about growth, it had apparently \"fumbled\" a deal with \"one of the UK's largest companies\".",

            "content": "AstraZeneca PLC ( NASDAQ:AZN ) faces challenges in gaining market access for new products like Airsupra, which has seen slower-than-expected uptake due to access issues.\n\nThe company expects a 60 to 70 basis points decline in product sales gross margin in 2025 due to factors like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the US and VBP in China.\n\nAstraZeneca PLC ( NASDAQ:AZN ) has eight new medicines approved to date, including the recent approval of Datroway, contributing to its goal of 20 new medicines by 2030.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: How did AstraZeneca's revenue in China evolve during Q4 2024, and what is the outlook for 2025 considering the ongoing investigations and potential VBP inclusion? A: Pascal Soriot, CEO, explained that the Q4 decline was primarily due to hospital ordering dynamics and a mild winter affecting respiratory products. For 2025, despite headwinds from VBP inclusion for several medicines, AstraZeneca expects continued growth in China. The company is cooperating with the government on the investigations, and any potential fines would be based on avoided import duties.\n\nQ: What is the impact of the Part D redesign on AstraZeneca's 2025 outlook, and which products are most affected? A: David Fredrickson, EVP of Oncology, noted that the Part D redesign primarily affects the oral Oncology portfolio, with manageable impacts due to improved adherence and lower free drug utilization. The redesign is included in the company's guidance, and AstraZeneca anticipates continued growth opportunities in 2025 to offset these headwinds.\n\nQ: Can you provide an update on the market share for key drugs in China and any notable changes? A: Iskra Reic, EVP of International, stated that there have been no major changes in market share for key drugs like Tagrisso. The decline in Farxiga's market share was due to hospital capping, but it is expected to recover. Overall, AstraZeneca's market share remains stable.\n\nQ: What are AstraZeneca's plans for the oral PCSK9 inhibitor, and how does it differentiate from competitors? A: Sharon Barr, EVP of BioPharmaceuticals R&D, highlighted that the oral PCSK9 inhibitor, AZD0780, is a true small molecule with no food effect, unlike competitors. It is well-suited for monotherapy and combination use, with a favorable PK profile. The company is planning pivotal studies but has not yet commented on cardiovascular outcomes trials.\n\nQ: How does AstraZeneca plan to address the competitive threat from GSK's depemokimab in the asthma biologics market? A: Ruud Dobber, EVP of BioPharmaceuticals, emphasized that while convenience is important, efficacy remains the key factor for physicians and patients. Fasenra's strong efficacy and market leadership position it well against competition. AstraZeneca is also expanding its respiratory portfolio in China and other emerging markets.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN), the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant, has seen its stock price tumble 15 percent over the past six months, buffeted by a series of unsettling reports emanating from China. A widening investigation by China regulators into alleged illegal drug imports, data breaches, and potential health insurance fraud has cast a shadow over the company\u2019s prospects in a critical market, triggering a securities class action lawsuit in the United States.\n\nHagens Berman has opened an investigation into the allegations and urges investors in AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 23, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 17, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Feb. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/azn\n\nContact the Firm Now: AZN@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nProbe Into AstraZeneca\u2019s China Operations\n\nThe probe conducted by China regulators, which reportedly centers on allegations that AstraZeneca employees improperly imported cancer medications like Enhertu and Imjudo from Hong Kong into mainland China and mishandled patient data, has been compounded by a broader investigation into a large-scale health insurance fraud case. The confluence of these issues has raised serious concerns among investors about the potential impact on the company\u2019s regional sales and overall financial performance.\n\nThe situation escalated with the arrest of Leon Wang, AstraZeneca\u2019s Executive Vice President International and China President. This development, coupled with internal forecasts predicting a downturn in sales within the Chinese market, has prompted a sharp investor reaction, culminating in the legal action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe AstraZeneca Securities Class Action Suit\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that AstraZeneca issued \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d and withheld crucial information regarding the company\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory risks in China. The complaint specifically accuses AstraZeneca of engaging in insurance fraud, facing heightened legal exposure that led to Mr. Wang\u2019s detention, understating the risks associated with its Chinese operations, and failing to disclose the potential for these issues to significantly harm its business and finances in the region.\n\nThe truth allegedly began to emerge in late October. On October 30, AstraZeneca announced that Mr. Wang was cooperating with a Chinese investigation, offering few details. This initial announcement triggered a 3 percent drop in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nThe situation worsened on November 5, when Yicai, a Chinese business news outlet, reported that dozens of AstraZeneca China executives were implicated in the investigation, with some potentially facing lengthy prison sentences. The report, citing an industry insider, attributed the alleged compliance issues to \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on sales representatives to meet aggressive sales targets. This news sent AstraZeneca\u2019s stock down another 7 percent.\n\nOn November 12, AstraZeneca confirmed Mr. Wang\u2019s detention and disclosed that the Chinese investigation encompassed allegations of medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation, and breaches of personal information.\n\nMore recently, on December 18, The Financial Times reported that AstraZeneca executives anticipate a decline in Chinese revenue due to the arrests of Mr. Wang and other senior executives. The report quoted an AstraZeneca executive who stated that \u201cdoctors are unwilling to interact with our salespeople and prescribe our medicines\u201d following the investigation, precipitating a further nearly 4 percent decline in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nHagens Berman Investigation\n\nThese events have prompted shareholder rights firm to open an investigation in the allegations.\n\n\u201cShould the allegations be confirmed, it suggests AstraZeneca misled investors about the true extent of its exposure in China, a failure with potentially serious consequences,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, an attorney leading the firm's investigation.\n\nIf you invested in AstraZeneca and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the AstraZeneca investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding AstraZeneca should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.

            "content": "AstraZeneca ((AZN)) has held its Q4 earnings call. Read on for the main highlights of the call.\n\nThe latest earnings call from AstraZeneca reveals a robust performance, characterized by remarkable revenue growth and multiple successful product approvals. Despite the positive financial trajectory, the company faces challenges within the China market and other operational headwinds. The sentiment during the call was a mix of optimism for future growth and caution regarding existing hurdles.\n\nStrong Revenue Growth\n\nAstraZeneca reported an impressive 21% increase in total revenue for 2024, alongside a 19% growth in core EPS. This growth exceeded the double-revised guidance range, highlighting the company\u2019s strong financial health. The results underscore the effectiveness of AstraZeneca\u2019s strategies in driving revenue expansion.\n\nSuccessful Product Launches and Approvals\n\nThe company celebrated the approval of eight new medicines, including innovative oncology therapies like Tagrisso, Enhertu, and Imfinzi. These approvals significantly contributed to AstraZeneca\u2019s revenue, showcasing the strength of its product pipeline and its ability to bring new treatments to market.\n\nEmerging Markets Growth\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s performance in emerging markets was robust, with a 22% growth rate in 2024. The company identified substantial opportunities in China and other emerging regions, which are expected to drive future growth and revenue diversification.\n\nPipeline Advancements\n\nThe company made notable advancements in its pipeline, with nine high-value pivotal trials readouts in 2024. These trials are projected to contribute over $5 billion in non-risk adjusted peak year revenue, indicating promising future prospects as more readouts are expected in 2025.\n\nDividend Increase\n\nAstraZeneca announced an increase in its full-year 2024 dividend to $3.10 per share, with plans to further increase it to $3.20 in 2025. This move reflects the company\u2019s commitment to returning value to shareholders and confidence in its financial stability.\n\nChina Market Challenges\n\nThe company is facing ongoing investigations in China regarding suspected unpaid importation taxes totaling $900,000. These investigations could lead to fines of up to five times the amount, posing a significant challenge to its operations in the region.\n\nQuarter 4 Revenue Decline in China\n\nDespite an overall 11% revenue growth in China for 2024, the fourth quarter saw a 3% decline. This dip was attributed to hospital ordering dynamics and a mild winter affecting respiratory product sales, highlighting the volatility of the market.\n\nImpact of VBP and IRA\n\nAstraZeneca anticipates headwinds from the inclusion of several medicines in China\u2019s VBP program and the impact of Part D redesign in the U.S. These factors are expected to affect revenue and gross margins moving forward.\n\nIncreased Operating Expenses\n\nCore operating expenses rose by 14% in 2024. Although this increase was below the revenue growth rate, it signifies rising costs that accompany the company\u2019s strong revenue performance.\n\nNet Debt Increase\n\nThe company\u2019s net debt increased by $2.1 billion to $24.6 billion, driven by significant deal-related payments anticipated in 2025. This reflects strategic investments but also highlights the need for careful financial management.\n\nForward-Looking Guidance\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s outlook for 2025 includes a high single-digit percentage increase in total revenue and a low double-digit percentage increase in core EPS. The company plans to significantly boost its CapEx by about 50% to enhance manufacturing and technology capabilities, despite anticipated margin declines due to external factors. AstraZeneca remains focused on sustaining growth through its diverse product portfolio and strategic investments.\n\nIn conclusion, AstraZeneca\u2019s earnings call portrayed a positive yet cautious outlook. The company demonstrated strong revenue growth and strategic progress, although challenges in China and other operational areas remain. Investors should watch how AstraZeneca navigates these challenges while continuing to leverage its robust product pipeline and market opportunities.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "AstraZeneca on Thursday revealed it has discontinued the development of two Alexion-developed rare disease assets due to underwhelming efficacy findings.\n\nVemircopan, an investigational small molecule drug, was culled from the pharma\u2019s development pipeline \u201cbased on safety and efficacy data\u201d from mid-stage studies, according to a press release issued on Thursday. The drug, an oral blocker of the alternative complement protein factor D, was being tested for impaired hepatic function, lupus nephritis or immunoglobulin A nephropathy, according to AstraZeneca\u2019s clinical trials appendix.\n\nAstraZeneca also dropped its early-stage enzyme replacement therapy ALXN1910, which it was trialing for bone metabolism indications. ALXN1910 was designed to target the activity of the TNSALP protein, which is crucial for bone mineralization.\n\nBoth vemircopan and ALXN1910 came from rare disease leader Alexion, which AstraZeneca acquired in December 2020 for $39 billion. The deal has paid off well for the pharma\u2014giving it the high-performing assets Ultomiris and Soliris\u2014but has also returned its fair share of disappointments.\n\nIn April 2023, for instance, AstraZeneca terminated its Wilson disease program, citing \u201cfeedback\u201d from regulators that had reviewed its data. Meanwhile, in August 2021, the company reported that Alexion\u2019s Ultomiris failed its Phase III study in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The company is no longer studying Ultomiris in this indication.\n\nWhen asked in a media call if Thursday\u2019s discontinuations shook the company\u2019s confidence in the Alexion buy, CEO Pascal Soriot said AstraZeneca continues to believe that Alexion was a \u201cfantastic acquisition.\u201d\n\nThe discontinuations are part of \u201cthe life in our industry,\u201d Soriot said. In biopharma, he added, \u201csome [products] die, some others are accelerated, some new ones come in.\u201d\n\nOverall, AstraZeneca\u2019s rare disease portfolio has seen a lot of growth.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, AstraZeneca recorded a 22% increase in revenue for its rare disease portfolio, hitting nearly $2.4 billion in revenue. Ultomiris, indicated for generalized myasthenia gravis, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, accounted for much of this, surging 33% in the quarter to bring in nearly $1.1 billion.\n\nUltomiris will continue to be a key driver of growth for AstraZeneca in 2025, with the pharma working toward expansion into hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy, cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury and IgA nephropathy, according to a company presentation.\n\nA Strong Quarter, An Achievable Year\n\nAstraZeneca made almost $14.90 billion in the fourth quarter, coming in slightly ahead of the consensus figure of $14.23 billion. Net income was at $3.24 billion, also exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations of $3.21 billion. For the full year 2024, AstraZeneca recorded $54 billion in total revenue, a 21% year-on-year increase at constant exchange rates.\n\nAccording to an investor note from Leerink Partners, much of AstraZeneca\u2019s quarterly beat was driven by the better-than-expected performance of its oncology unit, which brought in $5.34 billion in the quarter to come 4% ahead of the consensus. Key cancer assets, including antibody-drug conjugate Enhertu and PARP inhibitor Lynparza, likewise outperformed expectations.\n\nOutside of cancer\u2014and aside from Ultomiris\u2014other notable growth drivers include the inhaler Symbicort, the stroke therapy Brilinta and Strensiq, another rare disease asset indicated for perinatal/infantile- and juvenile-onset hypophosphatasia.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, AstraZeneca expects its total revenue to grow by a high single-digit percentage, while core earnings-per-share are projected to increase by a low double-digit percentage.\n\nIn an investor note Thursday, analysts at BMO Capital Markets called this goal \u201cachievable\u201d and in-line with the consensus expectations.",

On this news, AstraZeneca\u2019s stock price fell $4.07, or 5.4%, over two consecutive trading days to close at $71.15 per share on November 1, 2024, thereby injuring investors.\n\nThen, on November 5, 2024, news outlets reported that a fraud investigation linked to AstraZeneca had expanded to several Chinese government agencies, implicating dozens of senior executives at the Company. On this news, AstraZeneca\u2019s stock price fell $5.16, or 7.2%, to close at $66.27 per share on November 5, 2024.\n\nThen, on December 18, 2024, Financial Times reported that Wang had been arrested and that AstraZeneca \u201cexpect[ed] to see an \u2018evident\u2019 revenue hit in China in the wake of the arrest,\u201d stating that \u201cthe sales impact is already very evident.\u201d On this news, AstraZeneca\u2019s stock price fell $2.54, or 3.8%, to close at $64.64 per share on December 18, 2024, thereby injuring investors further.\n\nWhat Is The Lawsuit About?\n\nThe complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) AstraZeneca engaged in insurance fraud in China; (2) as a result, AstraZeneca faced heightened legal exposure in China, which eventually resulted in the AstraZeneca China President being detained by Chinese law enforcement authorities; (3) as a result, AstraZeneca understated its legal risks; (4) the foregoing, once revealed, could materially harm AstraZeneca\u2019s business activities in China; and (5) as a result, Defendants\u2019 positive statements about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.\n\nIf you purchased or otherwise acquired AstraZeneca securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than February 21, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.\n\nContact Us To Participate or Learn More:\n\nIf you wish to learn more about this action, or if you have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact us:\n\nCharles Linehan, Esq.,\n\nGlancy Prongay & Murray LLP,\n\n1925 Century Park East, Suite 2100,\n\nLos Angeles, California 90067\n\nEmail: shareholders@glancylaw.com\n\nTelephone: 310-201-9150\n\nToll-Free: 888-773-9224\n\nVisit our website at: www.glancylaw.com.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, Twitter, or Facebook.\n\nIf you inquire by email, please include your mailing address, telephone number and number of shares purchased.\n\nTo be a member of the class action you need not take any action at this time; you may retain counsel of your choice or take no action and remain an absent member of the class action.\n\nThis press release may be considered Attorney Advertising in some jurisdictions under the applicable law and ethical rules.\n\nContact Us:\n\nGlancy Prongay & Murray LLP,\n\n1925 Century Park East, Suite 2100\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90067\n\nCharles Linehan\n\nEmail: shareholders@glancylaw.com\n\nTelephone: 310-201-9150\n\nToll-Free: 888-773-9224\n\nVisit our website at: www.glancylaw.com.",

Credit: Shutterstock / LightField Studios.\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s diabetes drug Bydureon (exenatide) has failed to slow the progression of Parkinson\u2019s disease motor symptoms in a Phase III trial.\n\nThe University College London (UCL) in the UK led the Exenatide-PD3 trial (NCT04232969), which sought to examine how the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) could impact a Parkinson\u2019s disease progression. However, results published in The Lancet detail that the trial failed to meet the primary and secondary endpoints.\n\nThe trial compared two arms, one was dosed weekly with 2mg of Bydureon and the other treated with a placebo.\n\nThe primary endpoint was measured using the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) whilst off Parkinson\u2019s medication. At 96 weeks, MDS-UPDRS III scores had increased, meaning disease progression had worsened, by a mean of 5.7 points in the Bydureon group, and by 4.5 points in the placebo group.\n\nAdditionally, of the 192 patients enrolled on the trial, 9% of participants in the Bydureon group had at least one serious adverse event compared with 11% in the placebo group.\n\nPresenting initial findings at the Cure Parkinson\u2019s Autumn research update meeting, trial lead Tom Foltynie said: \u201cI am trying to be absolutely definitive about this and leave nobody in any doubt that in this population of patients, the drug did not work. It is clear, it is definitive that the drug did not change the rate of progression in this population.\n\n\u201cSo, what does this mean? This has to be in the context of a lot of work that led to us doing this work in the first place. In the laboratory, the rats and the mice, exposed to toxins or alpha-synuclein-preformed fibrils, in all of those poor rats and mice exenatide is brilliant. It works really, really well.\n\n\u201cIf you have diabetes and are at increased risk of Parkinson\u2019s\u2019 and you get given Bydureon, your risk of Parkinson\u2019s diminishes. Why can all of that be true but when we give it to patients with Parkinson\u2019s it doesn\u2019t seem to make any difference?\u201d\n\nThe trial follows on from the Phase II LixiPark trial (NCT03439943) that saw Parkinson\u2019s patients dosed with Sanofi\u2019s GLP-1RA Lyxumia (lixisenatide), which appeared to slow disease progression when compared to placebo in a 12-month-study. Both trials were in part funded by the UK-based charity Cure Parkinson\u2019s.\n\nGLP-1RAs are being investigated in several indications beyond metabolic disorders. Research by the Clinical Trials Arena found that in 2024, after metabolic disorders, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and central nervous systems were indications where GLP-1RAs had the most research ongoing.\n\nElsewhere in the field of Parkinson\u2019s disease, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma America has announced that a Phase III trial of its candidate, ND0612, has met its primary endpoint. Meanwhile, AbbVie and Cerevel Therapeutics have reported positive top-line results from the Phase III TEMPO-3 clinical trial evaluating a once-a-day dose of tavapadon.",

            "content": "A fresh earnings release was the news development powering AstraZeneca's (AZN 1.55%) share price higher on Thursday. Investors were clearly impressed by the pharmaceutical company's numbers, as the stock closed the day more than 2% higher in value. This was notably better than the 0.4% bump of the S&P 500 index.\n\nA crushing bottom-line beat\n\nAstraZeneca unveiled both its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results before market open today, revealing that its total revenue was $14.89 billion. This represented a meaty 24% improvement over Q4 2023's figure. On the bottom line the company's \"core\" (i.e., non-GAAP) earnings per share rose even more sharply, advancing by 44% to $2.09.\n\nThere was quite some distance between AstraZeneca's performance and analyst estimates for the quarter. On average, pundits following the company were anticipating it would post a lower revenue number ($14.15 billion) and a far lower adjusted net profit of $1.06 per share.\n\nBy far the largest contributor to AstraZeneca's top line is sales of its own medications. For the period the company did particularly well with oncology and respiratory and immunology treatments, the take for which rose 24% and 25% year over year, respectively. Cardiovascular, renal, and metabolism (CVRM) wasn't far behind with 20% growth.\n\nA very effective player in its industry\n\nAstraZeneca also proffered guidance for full-year 2025 in its earnings report. The company is estimating that its total revenue will rise at a high-single-digit percentage rate this year, on a constant-currency basis, compared to 2024. Core earnings per share should increase at a low double-digit percentage rate. It did not get more specific.\n\nFor me, the most encouraging news item within the report was the robust growth seen in most drug categories. If I were a shareholder, I'd also be impressed by the greater efficiencies driving that robust bottom-line improvement. AstraZeneca seems like a fine choice among global pharmaceutical stocks these days.",

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than February 21, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWhy Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDetails of the case: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) AstraZeneca engaged in insurance fraud in China; (2) as a result, AstraZeneca faced heightened legal exposure in China, which eventually resulted in the AstraZeneca China President being detained by Chinese law enforcement authorities; (3) as a result, AstraZeneca understated its legal risks; (4) the foregoing, once revealed, could materially harm AstraZeneca's business activities in China; and (5) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the AstraZeneca class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=1331 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

They have since recovered and are up more than 10% this year, including Thursday's gains.\n\nAstraZeneca forecast 2025 revenue to increase by a high single-digit percentage, with core earnings projected to grow by a low double-digit percentage, at constant currency rates, after it also beat fourth-quarter sales and profit expectations.\n\nAnalysts expect 2025 sales growth of 6.5% and profit to rise by 12.6%, according to a LSEG poll.\n\nStill, AstraZeneca cautioned about some headwinds, including in the United States, over changes in Medicare drug price negotiations.",

She named AstraZeneca in her speech as an example of one of the \"great companies\" that was investing in the UK.\n\nThe project would have seen an expansion of its vaccine manufacturing plant in Speke, Merseyside.\n\nBut AstraZeneca said that following \"protracted\" talks with the government, it would not be going ahead with the investment, although existing production and jobs would be maintained.\n\nThe firm said a number of factors had led to the decision including \"the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government's proposal\".\n\nSir Chris said the company had decided to lower the amount it was investing in research and development.\n\n\"AstraZeneca were going to put in \u00a3150m of R&D.

            "content": "In its upcoming report, Astrazeneca (AZN) is predicted by Wall Street analysts to post quarterly earnings of $1.07 per share, reflecting an increase of 46.6% compared to the same period last year. Revenues are forecasted to be $14.28 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 18.8%.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This represents how the covering analysts, as a whole, have reassessed their initial estimates during this timeframe.\n\nBefore a company announces its earnings, it is essential to take into account any changes made to earnings estimates. This is a valuable factor in predicting the potential reactions of investors toward the stock. Empirical research has consistently shown a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as indicators of quarterly business performance, exploring analysts' projections for specific key metrics can offer valuable insights.\n\nBearing this in mind, let's now explore the average estimates of specific Astrazeneca metrics that are commonly monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Alliance Revenue- Total' should come in at $615.99 million. The estimate suggests a change of +45.3% year over year.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'BioPharmaceuticals- CVRM- Crestor- World' will reach $250.88 million. The estimate indicates a change of +1.6% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect 'BioPharmaceuticals- CVRM- Seloken/Toprol-XL- World' to come in at $146.96 million. The estimate suggests a change of +2.1% year over year.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Oncology- Zoladex- World' of $260.68 million. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +2.6%.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'BioPharmaceuticals- CVRM- Crestor- U.S.' stands at $12.07 million. The estimate points to a change of -19.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Other Medicines- Nexium- U.S.' will likely reach $22.59 million. The estimate points to a change of -13.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'BioPharmaceuticals- R&I- Fasenra- U.S.' will reach $272.75 million. The estimate indicates a change of -0.8% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'BioPharmaceuticals- CVRM- Brilinta- U.S.' should arrive at $166.89 million. The estimate points to a change of -14% from the year-ago quarter.",

            "content": "AstraZeneca has launched new lawsuits against four generic drug manufacturers in an ongoing patent battle over its cancer drug Lynparza (olaparib), approved to treat ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, and breast cancers.\n\nIn the new complaints issued January 9, AstraZeneca claims that generic drug companies Sandoz, Cipla, Natco Pharma, and Zydus Pharmaceuticals are planning to make and sell generic versions of Lynparza, which infringes on a new patent that covers the active pharmaceutical ingredient, olaparib.\n\nThe recent wave of lawsuits follows several years of litigation against the generic companies related to Lynparza\u2019s patents. In February 2023, AstraZeneca filed the original suit against Natco Pharma, alleging that the generic company was seeking US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to commercially manufacture, use, offer for sale, sell, and/or import generic versions of Lynparza and thus would be infringing on several existing patents for AstraZeneca\u2019s Lynparza before the patents expired. That litigation, which involves patents expiring in 2027, is still pending, according to court records.\n\nIn late 2024, AstraZeneca filed lawsuits against Sandoz, Cipla, and Zydus Pharmaceuticals alleging the same infringement claims pertaining to its existing patents over Lynparza.\n\nIn the most recent filings, attorneys for AstraZeneca said they received notice in December 2024 that the US Patent and Trademark Office would be issuing a new patent covering Lynparza. Despite being aware of the new patent, AstraZeneca alleged that the generic drugmakers are still moving forward with plans for their generic products upon FDA approval, in violation of the new patent. Unless the court enjoins the drugmakers from infringing on the new patent, AstraZeneca will \u201csuffer irreparable injury,\u201d according to its complaint.\n\nThe latest suits, filed in New Jersey District Court, asked a judge to immediately stop the generic drug companies from any manufacturing, use, or sale of generic products of Lynparza.\n\nA spokesperson for AstraZeneca told Medscape Medical News that AstraZeneca \u201cis confident in the strength of its intellectual property covering Lynparza and is prepared to vigorously defend its intellectual property.\u201d\n\nCipla, Natco, and Zydus did not return messages seeking comment. A spokesman for Sandoz said the company does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nAt least three of the generic drugmakers have countersued AstraZeneca. In separate countersuits filed between 2023 and 2024, Cipla, Natco Pharma, and Sandoz argued that they are not infringing on AstraZeneca\u2019s existing patents over Lynparza and that AstraZeneca\u2019s claims are invalid. The drugmakers are requesting a \u201cjudicial declaration\u201d that their actions involving Lynparza do not and \u201cwould not infringe any valid and enforceable claim of the \u2018695 patent,\u201d one of the older patents.\n\nThe countersuits say AstraZeneca\u2019s \u2018695 patent is invalid for failure to satisfy one or more federal law requirements and/or because of double patenting. Double patenting refers to attempting to secure multiple patents for the same product to extend its patent protection beyond what\u2019s legally permitted.\n\nIntellectual property expert Richard Gold said the patent litigation involving the back-and-forth between AstraZeneca and the drugmakers is generally \u201cthe normal litigation process surrounding drug patents.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, given the high costs of this type of litigation \u2014 costs starting at $2.5 million per side if this goes to trial \u2014 it is the consumer who ultimately suffers by paying higher drug prices,\u201d said Gold, director of the Centre for Intellectual Property Policy at McGill University in Montreal. \u201cI don\u2019t know the patents enough to know who will win. Usually, the patent holder wins, but up to 42%-46% of overall US patents are held invalid in the US, so\u201d it\u2019s anyone\u2019s call.",

            "content": "The announcement in March last year that AstraZeneca would be investing \u00a3450m to expand its vaccine plant in Speke in Liverpool was presented in full flag-waving style by the company and the government of the day.\n\nSir Pascal Soriot, the AstraZeneca chief executive, reflected it had been 25 years since the merger of Astra of Sweden and Zeneca of the UK; the firm was now \u201ctruly global\u201d but also \u201cproud of our British roots\u201d. Jeremy Hunt, then the chancellor, said the \u00a3450m investment, plus \u00a3200m to expand its research facility in Cambridge, was \u201ca vote of confidence in the attractiveness of the UK as a life sciences superpower\u201d.\n\nThere were additional reasons for the boosterish tone. Relations between the life sciences industry and the Tory government had been dire in the two years after the Covid pandemic. Companies grumbled about research and development tax credits, the NHS\u2019s spending formula for prescription medicines and a post-Covid hangover in the health service\u2019s ability to conduct clinical trials. The Speke deal seemed to signal a reset.\n\nIt helped that the investment would be in vaccine-making capacity, the very thing the UK found itself lacking during the pandemic. And it was definitely useful that this was AstraZeneca. Only a year earlier, Soriot had blamed the UK\u2019s \u201cdiscouraging\u201d tax rate for a decision to build a separate \u00a3320m manufacturing plant in Ireland rather than the north-west of England.\n\nThe only doubt over expansion at Speke came in the small print. The company\u2019s final investment decision was \u201ccontingent upon mutual agreement with the UK government and third parties\u201d. But that clause didn\u2019t sound significant because both sides knew how the game was played. While at one level it is outrageous that a \u00a3175bn company such as AstraZeneca should expect a bung from the taxpayer, the reality in global pharma-land is that countries fall over themselves to offer incentives to build state-of-the-art facilities, especially the vaccine-making variety, that will be around for decades. You wouldn\u2019t believe what Singapore will offer, pharma executives have said for years.\n\nNow the Speke investment is off and the precise reasons are disputed, inevitably. \u201cSeveral factors have influenced this decision including the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government\u2019s proposal,\u201d said AstraZeneca. Did the incoming Labour government, wielding the Treasury\u2019s \u201cvalue for money\u201d formula, have good reasons to trim the \u00a390m offer from the Tories? Possibly, if it turned out that AstraZeneca\u2019s R&D spend would be lower than expected.\n\nYet the company\u2019s reference to the timing of the final offer is significant, sources say. Note that the Times reported last month, after obtaining correspondence under the Freedom of Information Act, that AstraZeneca\u2019s UK chair had warned the incoming government soon after the general election last July that getting the deal over the line was \u201can urgent issue as we need to begin work on the project in August in order to meet our business case timelines\u201d.\n\nDelay in Whitehall decision-making \u2013 as much as haggling over money \u2013 looks to have been key. If so, the timing of the general election didn\u2019t help, but the killer may have been the failure to move quickly afterwards. The government can\u2019t claim it was unaware of the risk of the investment slipping away. There were warnings aplenty, including from this column last August, that ministers should take the worsening mood music seriously and get the deal nailed down if it wanted to avoid being embarrassed.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the bottom line here is that the outline terms were agreed and the goal was wide open.\n\nViewed from abroad, it must look bizarre that the UK\u2019s largest company and an \u201cunashamedly pro-growth\u201d UK government have not been able to complete a major investment in a life sciences sector that is supposed to have a starring role in the new \u201cmodern\u201d industrial strategy.

Estimated median overall survival was 55.9 months for Imfinzi versus 33.4 months for placebo, and an estimated 57% of Imfinzi-treated patients were alive at three years compared to 48% of those in the placebo group.\n\nAZ\u2019s drug was also shown to reduce the risk of disease progression or death by 24% compared to placebo.

            "content": "AstraZeneca Cancels \u00a3450 Million Vaccine Plant Investment The pharma giant cites reduced subsidies under Labour government as key reason for abandoning plans out of Liverpool.\n\nAstraZeneca has canceled its ambitious plans for a \u00a3450 million vaccine manufacturing plant in Merseyside, significantly impacting the UK's economic revival efforts. The multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology company announced this decision on January 31, 2025, declaring it was no longer pursuing the planned investment at Speke, Liverpool, due to disappointing subsidies offered by the government.\n\nAccording to AstraZeneca's spokesperson, the decision came after \"protracted discussions with the government\" marked by unresolved subsidy issues. The company highlighted unfortunate timing factors, explaining, \"Following protracted discussions with the government, we are no longer pursuing our planned investment.\" This turn of events is viewed as a significant blow to the Labour government led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, which assumed office only last July, as it has ambitions to rejuvenate the sluggish economy.\n\nThe UK's Labour government had proposed offering \u00a340 million to AstraZeneca for the new facility, significantly lower than the \u00a390 million offered by the previous Conservative government. A government spokesperson explained, \"A change in the make-up of the investment originally proposed by AstraZeneca led to a reduced government grant offer being put forward,\" emphasizing the need for government funding to deliver value for taxpayers. The spokesperson noted, \"unfortunately, due to extensive work from government officials, it has not been possible to achieve a solution\" to keep AstraZeneca's investment on track.\n\nThe cancellation of the investment has sparked concern among industry leaders. Sharon Todd, chief executive of the Society of Chemical Industry, expressed worry over the long-term consequences of AstraZeneca's decision. She articulated, \"If life sciences are going to be a major pillar of the UK\u2019s new industrial strategy, then the UK needs to make some bold steps forward to compete for life sciences investments.\" Todd's words reflect growing anxiety about the UK\u2019s competitiveness and attractiveness for future investments.\n\nDespite this setback, AstraZeneca confirmed it would continue operations at its existing factory on the site, which produces flu vaccines, indicating no immediate impact on current production. Analysts had already flagged potential challenges facing the UK economy, which saw minimal GDP growth of just 0.1 percent last November after previous declines.\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves faced scrutiny following the announcement. Her recent recovery plans included proposals deemed significant for boosting investment, including the controversial approval of a third runway at Heathrow Airport, among other economic reforms. Reeves has been championing growth and reassurance to businesses shaken by tax increases announced last October. The AstraZeneca investment cancellation serves as yet another challenge for the Chancellor\u2019s efforts to solidify confidence among the business community.\n\nMedia reports have characterized the cancellation of AstraZeneca\u2019s investment as a notable snub to the government. A visual representation of the struggle emerged as Reeves outlined broader industrial strategies aimed at establishing the Oxford-Cambridge axis as the \u201cEuropean Silicon Valley,\u201d with aspirations to stimulate the life sciences sector.\n\nLooking forward, industry experts are hoping the UK government can strategize effectively to attract future investments, especially following this setback with AstraZeneca. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had previously heightened its growth projections for the UK economy to 1.6 percent for the year, demonstrating some hope for recovery, albeit amid cautious optimism.\n\nAnalysts argue this moment is pivotal as the UK grapples with its new industrial identity post-Brexit, with life sciences being highlighted as potentially transformative. The AstraZeneca situation may serve as both a warning and catalyst for necessary changes within the government to assure investors of the UK's viability as a destination for pharmaceutical investment.\n\nOverall, the cancellation of AstraZeneca's planned vaccine plant serves as both a tragic fall-off from ambitious growth initiatives and as evidence for the urgent need for the Labour government to fully commit and reallocate investment resources to regain corporate confidence within the pharmaceutical sector.",

The pharmaceutical giant had originally announced the investment during the previous Conservative government, seeing it as integral to bolstering the UK\u2019s life sciences sector and preparing for future pandemics.\n\nThis decision marks a significant setback for the city of Liverpool and the UK\u2019s ambitions for advancing its vaccine production capabilities. The planned facility was set to expand AstraZeneca's existing site in Speke, which has been operational and plays a role in manufacturing flu vaccines for the UK and exports worldwide.\n\nAccording to AstraZeneca, the investment was lost due to negotiations with government officials, who reportedly could not align on financial support levels. An AstraZeneca spokesperson elaborated, noting, \u201cFollowing discussions with the current government, we are no longer pursuing our planned investment in Speke.\u201d The company emphasized the influence of multiple factors, primarily the decreased offer compared to what had been proposed by the former government.\n\nAt the time of the initial announcement by the then-chancellor Jeremy Hunt during the March budget, the investment was described as both a leap for public health protection and pandemic preparedness. Disappointment now resonates among stakeholders and industry experts, particularly as this decision stretches the dynamic of the UK\u2019s economic growth strategy.\n\nA spokesperson from the UK government responded to AstraZeneca's cancellation, stating, \u201cAll government grant funding must demonstrate value for taxpayers and unfortunately... it has not been possible to reach a solution.\u201d This statement indicates the nuanced balance between supporting large-scale investments and ensuring fiscal responsibility amid increasing public finance scrutiny.\n\nThe political ramifications are evident as figures like Andrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, lambasted the government, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine for incompetence.\u201d He criticized the Labour government for fumbling negotiations and allowing AstraZeneca, one of the UK\u2019s largest pharmaceutical firms, to withdraw from such a pivotal deal. This development feeds the narrative of Labour\u2019s struggles to create a positive investment climate, with Griffith asserting, \u201cWhen will Labour learn? Only businesses can create growth and jobs.\u201d\n\nConversely, Labour representatives pushed back against these accusations, emphasizing the need for careful management of taxpayer funds rather than reckless financial commitments. \u201cOf course we want to bring investment to the UK, but we\u2019re prioritising every pound of taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d noted a Labour source, reflecting on the previous government's alleged mismanagement.\n\nThe cancellation also raises alarms about the UK\u2019s ability to handle its own vaccine production. Former health secretary Matt Hancock had previously highlighted the necessity for the UK to bolster its manufacturing capabilities, marking it as \u201ccritical.\u201d At the Covid Inquiry earlier this January, he pointed out the weaknesses within Britain\u2019s manufacturing base for vaccines, asserting, \u201cHaving manufacture and fill and finish onshore, physically within the UK, is... not only important but urgent.\u201d\n\nAdding to the growing concerns, industry expert Sharon Todd, chief executive of the Society of Chemical Industry, labeled AstraZeneca\u2019s withdrawal as \u201ca real concern for industry.\u201d She warned it sends the wrong message about the UK\u2019s competitiveness in attracting life sciences investments, underscoring the need for strategic adjustments as the government plans its new industrial approach under the Invest 2035 framework.\n\nThese developments call for immediate attention as the health and resilience of the UK\u2019s pharmaceutical industry hang precariously on securing investments such as AstraZeneca\u2019s. With continued assertions of improving the country\u2019s international investment appeal and economic growth, this setback poses questions not only of fiscal policy but also of strategic vision for the future of the life sciences sector.\n\nWhile AstraZeneca's existing facility will remain operational, producing flu vaccines among other products, the broader ramifications of this decision reflect on the UK\u2019s economic strategies and its commitment to becoming a global leader within the life sciences discipline. For the government, this cancellation is more than just the loss of infrastructure; it signifies potential hesitations about the future direction of public health initiatives and biopharmaceutical progress.",

The paper says executives have warned that policies pursued by the government will make the UK a less attractive place to invest.\n\nThe Times, external says it has seen letters which show that AstraZeneca asked for assurances about the plant as soon as Labour took office, but did not get a result for months. The Daily Mail, external calls the news a \"sharp setback\" for the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves. The paper's City editor, Alex Brummer, external, says AstraZeneca was a hero of the pandemic and that failing to support its project \"makes a nonsense\" of the government's goal of turning Britain into a science powerhouse.\n\nMinisters are working on an overhaul of welfare which could mean the long-term sick are required to look for work, according to the Times, external. The paper predicts that hundreds of thousands of people might have their sickness benefits cut. It says Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer could be pitched into a bitter fight with his party, with changes likely to anger Labour's base.\n\nThe Daily Mail, external says Prince Andrew \"faces fresh pressure\" after an email emerged undermining his claims about when he broke contact with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. It calls the revelations a \"bombshell\" and in its editorial says they further underline how the Duke of York is a \"dangerous liability\" to the monarchy.\n\nThe Sun, external speaks of a \"humiliation\" for Prince Andrew, while the Daily Mirror, external concludes that \"the more we learn, the worse it appears to get for the Prince and the Royal Family\".\n\nThe front page of the Guardian, external features an account by its reporter in Gaza of her return to the territory. Malak Tantesh says she felt she could have \"flown away with joy\" when the road was finally opened.

            "content": "Speaking at a Siemens factory in Oxfordshire, she said: \u201cWe are at the forefront of some of the most exciting developments in the world like artificial intelligence and life sciences, with great companies like DeepMind, AstraZeneca, Rolls Royce and of course Siemens delivering jobs and investment across Britain.\n\n\u201cWe have already provided funding to unlock investment in sectors like aerospace, automotives and life sciences and we have set out reforms to boost financial services, the AI sector and creative industries.\u201d\n\nMs Reeves said the economy \u201chas suffered due to chronic underinvestment\u201d and that she will solve this by \u201crecognising that first and foremost it is businesses, investors and entrepreneurs who drive economic growth a government that systematically removes the barriers that they face\u201d.\n\nIn its election manifesto, Labour listed life sciences as one of the industries it had worked with to plan future growth policies, and promised that \u201cin government, we will set out plans for these and other vital sectors of the economy\u201d.\n\nInvestors have been increasingly downbeat on the UK\u2019s economic prospects since the Chancellor\u2019s tax-raising Budget, despite Ms Reeves and Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s insistence they growth is their \u201cnumber one priority\u201d.\n\nAndrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine for incompetence. In the same week they talked about growth, Labour seem to have fumbled a deal with AstraZeneca, one of the UK\u2019s largest companies and central to the critical life sciences sector.\n\n\u201cThis is yet another sign that their tax rises and changes to employment law have made the UK an unattractive place to invest.\u201d\n\nAstraZeneca said it will continue to use the existing site in Speke to produce and supply the flu vaccine.\n\nThe vaccine project was originally announced by Jeremy Hunt during his last budget in March 2024, saying at the time it represented a \u201cvote of confidence in the attractiveness of UK as a life sciences superpower\u201d.\n\nAt the time, Sir Pascal Soriot, the AstraZeneca chief executive, said the factory would \u201cenhance the UK\u2019s pandemic preparedness and demonstrates our ongoing confidence in UK life sciences\u201d.\n\nEarlier this week, The Times reported that Shaun Grady, the UK chairman of AstraZeneca, had appealed to Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds urging him to sign off on the vaccine project and warning it risked missing its planned timeline.\n\n\u201cThis is an urgent issue,\u201d he said.\n\nLabour has attracted criticism for cutting several key investment pledges originally trailed by Rishi Sunak\u2019s Conservatives, such as a supercomputer in Edinburgh. The Chancellor has accused the Tories of leaving behind a multibillion-pound black hole in the country\u2019s financing through unfunded spending pledges.\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s investment plans have long been subject to a tug of war between Britain and the Republic of Ireland, which has an appealing corporate tax system.\n\nIn 2023 Sir Pascal blamed Britain\u2019s \u201cdiscouraging\u201d tax regime for a decision to build a \u00a3320m drug factory in Ireland rather than the UK.\n\nBut in March 2024, Mr Hunt, the then-chancellor, referred to Sir Pascal as \u201cmon ami\u201d and said that government support had persuaded the business to invest \u00a3650m across the Cambridge Biomedical Campus and the now-scrapped Speke site.\n\nMr Hunt said: \u201cIt beggars belief that in a week when the Chancellor has given a speech about being pro-growth, the Government has dropped the ball on such a major manufacturing investment. Words don\u2019t create jobs, but factories do \u2013 this is an absolute tragedy.\u201d\n\nIt came as business leaders across the economy slashed investment plans, according to a survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD), which also found bosses have cut back their employment intentions in the wake of Ms Reeves\u2019s Budget.\n\nLess than a quarter of companies expect to increase investment this year, the business group found, with almost 40pc planning to cut back spending.\n\nAnna Leach, the IoD chief economist, said the Chancellor\u2019s new focus on growth and investment is not enough to undo the hammer blow dealt by the \u00a340bn of tax increases announced in October.\n\n\u201cThe recent shift in the Government\u2019s rhetoric to emphasise growth is very welcome. The focus on unblocking planning constraints and the delivery of major infrastructure investments that will enhance transport capacity and drive innovation are the right ones,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut it is clear that companies continue to be challenged by the breadth and scale of cost increases announced at the Budget, and this risks undermining both the investment needed to drive growth and the sustainability of the public finances.\u201d\n\nThe IoD survey showed that bosses believed the most effective way to boost the economy would be a reduction in the tax burden on businesses, with an about-turn on the employment rights bill the second most popular option.\n\nBetter trading relations with the EU, lower interest rates and a simplification of the tax system were also cited by a significant share of businesses as potentially helpful policies.",

The company\u2019s decision was first reported by the Financial Times.\n\n\u201cSeveral factors have influenced this decision, including the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government\u2019s proposal,\u201d an AstraZeneca spokesperson said.\n\nThe move will likely come as a blow to Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves, who has spent this week trying to reset the economic narrative and pledging to \u201ckickstart\u201d growth. She has faced a backlash from businesses after the \u00a340 billion of tax rises on employers and wealth she put forward in her budget in October, and both consumer and business confidence have slumped.\n\n\u201cA change in the make-up of the investment originally proposed by AstraZeneca led to a reduced Government grant offer being put forward,\u201d the government said in an emailed statement. \u201cAll government grant funding has to demonstrate value for the taxpayer and unfortunately, despite extensive work from government officials, it has not been possible to achieve a solution.\u201d\n\nThe opposition Conservatives accused the government of making the UK an \u201cunattractive place to invest\u201d with higher taxes. \u201cIn the same week they talked about growth, Labour seem to have fumbled a deal with AstraZeneca,\u201d shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe new facility in Speke, Liverpool was meant to include the research, development and manufacture of vaccines in a building that was planned to be powered by renewable energy sources. Astra also produces flu vaccines in Speke, which is unaffected by the decision, the company said.\n\nChief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot has previously warned about the UK\u2019s ability to attract investment, describing the tax rate as \u201cdiscouraging.\u201d Still, last year he expressed more optimism, telling Bloomberg TV that the environment was now much better for the sector.",

In the same week they talked about growth, Labour seem to have fumbled a deal with AstraZeneca, one of the UK\u2019s largest companies and central to the critical Life Sciences sector.\n\n\"This is yet another sign that their tax rises and changes to employment law have made the UK an unattractive place to invest.\n\n\"When will Labour learn that only businesses can creates growth and jobs in the economy?\u201d\n\nThe major pharmaceutical company claimed Labour had failed to match the previous tory government\u2019s offer of support.\n\nThe decision reverses an announcement made by then-chancellor Jeremy Hunt at last year\u2019s March budget that would have seen the pharmaceutical company expand its existing facility in Speke.\n\nAt the time, the Conservative government said the investment would both boost the UK\u2019s life sciences sector and improve public health protection and pandemic preparedness.\n\nConfirming the reversal on Friday, a spokesperson for AstraZeneca said: \u201cFollowing discussions with the current Government, we are no longer pursuing our planned investment in Speke.\n\n\u201cSeveral factors have influenced this decision including the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government\u2019s proposal.\u201d\n\nopen image in gallery AstraZeneca research ( PA Media )\n\nThe existing facility will continue to operate and no jobs are at risk.\n\nThe decision comes as a blow to the Government following a week in which Chancellor Rachel Reeves sought to stress its commitment to growing the economy and making Britain more attractive to international investors.\n\nIt also follows warnings by former health secretary Matt Hancock that the UK needed to improve its own vaccine manufacturing capability as a \u201ccritical\u201d part of preparing for a future pandemic.\n\nMr Hancock told the Covid Inquiry, earlier in January, that Britain\u2019s vaccine manufacturing capacity was \u201cweak\u201d, adding: \u201chaving that manufacture and fill and finish onshore, physically within the UK, is critical in the way that it simply isn\u2019t in normal times\u201d.\n\nA government spokesperson said a \"change in the make-up of the investment\" proposed by AstraZeneca had \"led to a reduced Government grant offer being put forward\".\n\nThe spokesperson added: \"All Government grant funding has to demonstrate value for the taxpayer and unfortunately, despite extensive work from Government officials, it has not been possible to achieve a solution.\n\n\"AstraZeneca remains closely engaged with the Government's work to develop our new industrial strategy, and more broadly we continue to have a thriving life sciences sector, worth \u00a3108 billion to the economy and providing over 300,000 highly skilled jobs across the country.\"",

The FT suggests that plan is unaffected by AZ's decision on the Speke investment.\n\nAZ's decision comes against a backdrop of anger among pharma companies about the UK's system of paying rebates on sales of prescription drugs to the NHS, which according to the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) has resulted in the value of the UK branded medicines market declining by 11% in real terms in the last decade.\n\nThe introduction of a new voluntary scheme in late 2023 reduced what had been skyrocketing repayment rates, reaching upwards of 20% from the usual rate in the mid-single digits. However, the sector has been incensed by an announcement by the government in December to set the rate in 2025 to 22.9% - which the ABPI says will mean companies will have to repay around \u00a33.4 billion.\n\nJust last week, AZ revealed a $570 million investment in Canada, while last year the company said it would invest a whopping $3.5 billion to expand its R&D and manufacturing operations in the US by 2026.",

How can she possibly implement a growth strategy if penny pinching once again wins the day?\u201d he said.\n\nA spokesperson for AstraZeneca said: \u201cFollowing discussions with the current government, we are no longer pursuing our planned investment at Speke.\n\n\u201cSeveral factors have influenced this decision including the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government\u2019s proposal.\u201d\n\nThe AstraZeneca chief executive, Pascal Soriot \u2013 the highest-paid boss in the FTSE 100, with a pay package of \u00a318.7m \u2013 had previously suggested the investment was \u201cabsolutely ready to go\u201d.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company stressed that the existing facility at Speke, which employs 450 people, would continue to manufacture its nasal flu vaccine.\n\nHowever, the expansion of the facility has been under threat since the Labour government decided to review taxpayer funding for investment projects, seeking to get better value for money, given what Reeves has claimed was a \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d in the public finances.\n\nA government spokesperson said \u201ca change in the makeup of the investment originally proposed by AstraZeneca\u201d was behind the decision to offer a reduced government grant.\n\nThe spokesperson added: \u201cAll government grant funding has to demonstrate value for the taxpayer and unfortunately, despite extensive work from government officials, it has not been possible to achieve a solution.\u201d\n\nThe company said the level of investment it was planning to make had not decreased.\n\nIn her growth speech in Oxfordshire on Wednesday, the chancellor said that as part of the government\u2019s industrial strategy, it had already \u201cprovided funding to unlock investment in sectors like aerospace, automotives and life sciences\u201d.\n\nIt is understood she recently increased the amount of support available to AstraZeneca from an initial gambit of around \u00a340m.\n\nBut the offer remained significantly below what Hunt had put on the table, which sources suggest amounted to up to \u00a390m, including a direct grant as well as support from the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The focus on unblocking planning constraints and the delivery of major infrastructure investments that will enhance transport capacity and drive innovation are the right ones.\n\n\u201cBut it is clear that companies continue to be challenged by the breadth and scale of cost increases announced at the budget, and this risks undermining both the investment needed to drive growth and the sustainability of the public finances.\u201d",

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than February 21, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) AstraZeneca engaged in insurance fraud in China; (2) as a result, AstraZeneca faced heightened legal exposure in China, which eventually resulted in the AstraZeneca China President being detained by Chinese law enforcement authorities; (3) as a result, AstraZeneca understated its legal risks; (4) the foregoing, once revealed, could materially harm AstraZeneca\u2019s business activities in China; and (5) as a result, defendants\u2019 statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the AstraZeneca class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=1331 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

            "content": "Our regular look at the FTSE 350 and other companies reporting from 03 \u2013 07 February.\n\nWith lofty expectations, Palantir needs to deliver knockout results\n\nSearch remains the crown jewel at Alphabet\n\nHigh-teens growth expected for AstraZeneca\n\nDisney looking for a fairytale start to 2025\n\nPalantir, Q4 Results, Monday 3 February\n\nMatt Britzman, senior equity analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown: Palantir has become a standout in the AI revolution, capturing attention with its innovative data-driven products and a CEO who knows how to tell a compelling story. While its growth potential is exciting, the key question is whether it can deliver earnings fast enough to justify its steep valuation \u2013 around 150 times next year\u2019s expected earnings. This sets high stakes for next week\u2019s fourth quarter results, where nothing shy of perfect execution will be tolerated.\n\nMarkets expect a 28% rise in revenue and a 45% jump in underlying operating income, driven by growth in government and commercial contracts. A spotlight will be on Palantir\u2019s AI platform, with investors eager to see how it\u2019s driving enterprise adoption and converting pilot programs into full-scale deals.\n\nAlphabet, Q4 Results, 4 February\n\nMatt Britzman: Having arrived fashionably late to the AI party, Alphabet is now making a splash. AI-powered overviews in Google search are starting to show their value, and investors will be laser-focused on ad revenue, still the core growth driver with a 9.5% uplift expected from next week\u2019s fourth-quarter results. Despite the cloud business stealing some headlines, search remains Alphabet\u2019s crown jewel. Google is still the best search brand on the planet, the key is nailing AI integration to keep the dollars flowing and the dominance intact.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet\u2019s cloud business impressed with 35% growth last quarter, outpacing Amazon and Microsoft \u2013 though from a smaller base. Elevated investment is expected to continue, but efficiency gains have so far kept profits buoyant. Sustaining this balancing act will be a critical storyline next week.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Q4 Results, 4 February\n\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets, Hargreaves Lansdown: AMD offers a comprehensive range of microprocessors and graphics cards and has been considered to be one of the few players with the technology capable of powering the latest advances in artificial intelligence. However, the arrival of new kid on the block, DeepSeek, the Chinese startup which has used low-cost chips to power its large language model, has put the cat among the pigeons and caused big jitters on Wall Street. So, investors are likely to be more sensitive to AMD\u2019s results this time around, concerned that demand for its chips may wane.\n\nGrowth in revenue was already expected to slow, with estimates for the fourth quarter between $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion. That would present growth of 22%. This is still not to be sniffed at, but a miss may be punished more severely in the current climate.\n\nNevertheless, Data Center sales are likely to remain the key growth driver for some time to come, driven by not just the boom in all things AI but also the relentless thirst for digital content. With lower cost AI models coming in, it may increase the addressable market and the seemingly insatiable demand for chips.\n\nDisney, Q1 Results, Wednesday 5 February\n\nAarin Chiekrie, equity analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown: Disney\u2019s performance in recent years has been a far cry from the fairytale management investors were hoping for. But after years of hard work and investment, things may just be about to turn. Growth in streaming profits at the likes of Disney+ are finally at a point where they can more than offset declines in linear TV. Alongside a much-improved content slate and reduction in customers switching to peers, its competitive position is looking much stronger.\n\nThere are also the parks to consider, which have received a step-up in investment in recent years, driving hopes of strong profit growth for the foreseeable future. But with the opening of Comcast\u2019s new Epic Universe theme park later this year, some analysts wonder if Disney may turn slightly more cautious on its parks outlook in the near term.\n\nInvestor confidence was buoyed by the group issuing three-year guidance last quarter. With high single-digit earnings per share (EPS) growth expected this year, investors will be keen to see how much early progress the group has made when it announces first-quarter results next week.\n\nAstraZeneca, Full Year Results, Thursday 6 February\n\nDerren Nathan, head of equity analysis, Hargreaves Lansdown: Following an upgrade after its third-quarter numbers, AstraZeneca expects to deliver high-teens growth for both revenue and underlying earnings per share in next week\u2019s full-year results. Attention will now turn towards the outlook for the current year both in terms of sales and profits, but also the key clinical programmes from Astra\u2019s deep research pipeline.\n\nInvestors are also likely to be sensitive to any word on fraud investigations by the Chinese Authorities into certain senior staff members. The company will be hoping that reported moves to overhaul its management in the region will give some grounds for optimism that the fallout can be limited.\n\nThis article has been brought to you in association with Hargreaves Lansdown.

With a median progression-free survival exceeding one year and a response rate of more than 60 per cent, trastuzumab deruxtecan offers a potential new standard of care for patients with HR-positive, HER2-low or HER2-ultralow metastatic breast cancer following endocrine therapy.\u201d\n\nDave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Haematology Business Unit, AstraZeneca, said: \u201cBuilding on the practice-changing previous approvals for Enhertu, this new approval brings this important medicine to an earlier treatment setting and a broader patient population with HER2-expressing metastatic breast cancer. The approval also highlights the importance of testing metastatic breast cancer tumours for detectable staining with a standard IHC test to identify those who may be eligible for treatment with Enhertu following endocrine therapy.\u201d\n\nKen Keller, Global Head of Oncology Business, and President and CEO, Daiichi Sankyo, said: \u201cEnhertu continues to redefine the classification and treatment of HR-positive metastatic breast cancer with important new data across the spectrum of HER2 expression. Today\u2019s approval underscores our ongoing commitment to realising the full potential of this innovative antibody drug conjugate and represents another paradigm shift in how certain breast cancers can be treated.\u201d\n\nKrissa Smith, Vice President, Education, Susan G. Komen, said: \u201cWe are excited to see more treatment options for these patients which enable more personalised care. It is critical for patients to understand the HER2 status of their metastatic breast cancer to help them make informed treatment decisions. Patients with tumours that are HER2-low or HER2-ultralow now have more options to consider with their healthcare team.\u201d\n\nEnhertu is a specifically engineered HER2-directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by Daiichi Sankyo and being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo.\n\nEnhertu is already approved in more than 70 countries, including the US, for patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer who have received a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY-Breast04 trial. Regulatory applications are under review in the EU, Japan and several other countries based on the DESTINY-Breast06 results.",

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN), the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant, has seen its stock price tumble 15 percent over the past six months, buffeted by a series of unsettling reports emanating from China. A widening investigation by China regulators into alleged illegal drug imports, data breaches, and potential health insurance fraud has cast a shadow over the company\u2019s prospects in a critical market, triggering a securities class action lawsuit in the United States.\n\nHagens Berman has opened an investigation into the allegations and urges investors in AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 23, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 17, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Feb. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/azn\n\nContact the Firm Now: AZN@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nProbe Into AstraZeneca\u2019s China Operations\n\nThe probe conducted by China regulators, which reportedly centers on allegations that AstraZeneca employees improperly imported cancer medications like Enhertu and Imjudo from Hong Kong into mainland China and mishandled patient data, has been compounded by a broader investigation into a large-scale health insurance fraud case. The confluence of these issues has raised serious concerns among investors about the potential impact on the company\u2019s regional sales and overall financial performance.\n\nThe situation escalated with the arrest of Leon Wang, AstraZeneca\u2019s Executive Vice President International and China President. This development, coupled with internal forecasts predicting a downturn in sales within the Chinese market, has prompted a sharp investor reaction, culminating in the legal action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe AstraZeneca Securities Class Action Suit\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that AstraZeneca issued \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d and withheld crucial information regarding the company\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory risks in China. The complaint specifically accuses AstraZeneca of engaging in insurance fraud, facing heightened legal exposure that led to Mr. Wang\u2019s detention, understating the risks associated with its Chinese operations, and failing to disclose the potential for these issues to significantly harm its business and finances in the region.\n\nThe truth allegedly began to emerge in late October. On October 30, AstraZeneca announced that Mr. Wang was cooperating with a Chinese investigation, offering few details. This initial announcement triggered a 3 percent drop in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nThe situation worsened on November 5, when Yicai, a Chinese business news outlet, reported that dozens of AstraZeneca China executives were implicated in the investigation, with some potentially facing lengthy prison sentences. The report, citing an industry insider, attributed the alleged compliance issues to \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on sales representatives to meet aggressive sales targets. This news sent AstraZeneca\u2019s stock down another 7 percent.\n\nOn November 12, AstraZeneca confirmed Mr. Wang\u2019s detention and disclosed that the Chinese investigation encompassed allegations of medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation, and breaches of personal information.\n\nMore recently, on December 18, The Financial Times reported that AstraZeneca executives anticipate a decline in Chinese revenue due to the arrests of Mr. Wang and other senior executives. The report quoted an AstraZeneca executive who stated that \u201cdoctors are unwilling to interact with our salespeople and prescribe our medicines\u201d following the investigation, precipitating a further nearly 4 percent decline in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nHagens Berman Investigation\n\nThese events have prompted shareholder rights firm to open an investigation in the allegations.\n\n\u201cShould the allegations be confirmed, it suggests AstraZeneca misled investors about the true extent of its exposure in China, a failure with potentially serious consequences,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, an attorney leading the firm's investigation.\n\nIf you invested in AstraZeneca and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the AstraZeneca investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding AstraZeneca should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.

            "content": "PE: The ADRIATIC trial demonstrated significant survival benefits for LS-SCLC patients. How do you envision this approval changing the standard treatment paradigm for these patients?\n\nGhattas: LS-SCLC is an aggressive form of lung cancer where we\u2019ve seen a poor prognosis. Around 15% to 30% of patients were alive five years post-diagnosis. For the last 40 years or so, this treatment landscape has remained unchanged, and now for the first time, we see with ADRIATIC a huge advancement. It\u2019s a significant breakthrough that addresses a huge unmet need.\n\nADRIATIC has the potential for making Imfinzi (durvalumab) new standard of care, especially in the earlier stage, limited-stage small cell lung cancer with the curative intent in mind. This has also been endorsed by the NCCN guidelines as category number one.\n\nPE: What key design elements of the ADRIATIC Phase III trial contributed most to its success, especially considering the challenges with past trials in LS-SCLC?\n\nGhattas: The ADRIATIC trial has been very robust, and it built on our key learnings that we've seen with Imfinzi in previous studies in small cell lung cancer, especially with the role of Imfinzi in post-chemo radiotherapy. With the approval from ADRIATIC, Imfinzi has now been extended to be used in limited-stage small cell lung cancer, as well as extensive-stage small cell lung cancer within the United States.\n\nFull Interview Summary: The approval of Imfinzi represents a landmark advancement in the treatment of limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC), a highly aggressive cancer with historically poor outcomes. For decades, the treatment paradigm for LS-SCLC has remained stagnant, with only 15\u201330% of patients surviving five years post-diagnosis. The trial demonstrated impressive results, with Imfinzi improving median overall survival to 55.9 months compared to 33.4 months with placebo\u2014a nearly 22-month survival benefit. These outcomes highlight the benefits of early diagnosis and treatment in a curative-intent setting, solidifying Imfinzi as a potential new standard of care endorsed by NCCN guidelines as a Category 1 option.\n\nThe robust design of the ADRIATIC Phase III trial was key to its success, leveraging insights from prior studies on Imfinzi in extensive-stage SCLC and incorporating its use post-chemoradiotherapy. This strategy ensured optimal progression-free and overall survival outcomes, extending Imfinzi\u2019s utility to LS-SCLC.\n\nWhile Imfinzi is already approved in the U.S. and Switzerland, AstraZeneca is focused on securing regulatory approvals in other regions, including the EU and Japan. The unprecedented data from the ADRIATIC Phase III trial, coupled with AstraZeneca\u2019s collaboration with regulatory authorities, is expected to expedite global access.\n\nLooking ahead, AstraZeneca aims to innovate further in immuno-oncology, with priorities in redefining standards of care for early-stage cancers and improving survival outcomes for hard-to-treat malignancies. The company remains committed to advancing its robust pipeline and developing novel therapies to transform cancer care.",

This approval is for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable, or metastatic HER2-positive biliary tract cancer (BTC), confirmed by an FDA-approved test.In November 2024, CTX-009 is a bispecific antibody that targets both Delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), two pathways crucial for angiogenesis and tumor vascularization. Preclinical and early clinical data suggest that inhibiting both pathways offers strong anti-tumor effects across various solid tumors, including colorectal, gastric, cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic, and non-small cell lung cancer. Partial responses have been observed in heavily pre-treated cancer patients who were resistant to approved anti-VEGF therapies. The COMPANION-002 trial, a Phase 2/3 study, is evaluating the combination of CTX-009 and paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone in patients with previously treated, advanced metastatic or recurrent biliary tract cancers (BTC). Clinical trial information: NCT05506943.In August 2024, Compass Therapeutics, Inc.

With this expansion, the ADC can now be used in patients with unresectable or metastatic breast cancer and who are HR-positive and HER2-low or HER2-ultralow. HER2 is a key breast cancer biomarker. Patients with higher expression levels of the protein tend to progress more rapidly than HER2-negative counterparts, but also respond more readily to HER2-targeted therapies.\n\nAccording to Monday\u2019s news release, Enhertu is now the first HER2-directed therapy approved for HER2-low and HER2-ultralow metastatic breast cancer in patients whose disease has progressed after at least one prior line of endocrine therapy.\n\nThe label expansion will bring Enhertu \u201cto an earlier treatment setting and a broader patient population with HER2 expressing metastatic breast cancer\u201d Dave Fredrickson, executive vice president of AstraZeneca\u2019s Oncology Hematology Business Unit, said in a statement.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s decision on Monday was backed by data from the Phase III DESTINY-Breast06 trial, in which Enhertu elicited a 36% drop in the risk of disease progression or death compared to chemotherapy. In the study\u2019s patient population of chemotherapy-na\u00efve metastatic breast cancer patients with HR-positive and HER2-low or HER2-ultralow disease, Enhertu additionally yielded a confirmed objective response rate (ORR) of 62.6%, whereas chemotherapy counterparts only saw an ORR of 34.4%.\n\nIn an exploratory analysis, Enhertu treatment improved progression-free survival by 24% in those with HER2-ultralow disease. AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo in Monday\u2019s press announcement called this effect \u201cclinically meaningful,\u201d though it fell short of statistical significance.\n\nPatients in the DESTINY-Breast06 trial tolerated Enhertu overall, with 20% of treated patients developing serious adverse events. Common serious toxicities included interstitial lung disease (ILD), hypokalemia and febrile neutropenia, and 2.8% of patients died from treatment-related adverse events. Enhertu\u2019s label carries a boxed warning for ILD and embryo-fetal toxicity.\n\nEnhertu\u2019s label expansion on Monday comes just days after AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo won another ADC approval from the FDA. Datroway\u2014previously known as Dato-DXd\u2014recently secured the agency\u2019s go-ahead for use in unresectable or metastatic HR-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer. The companies are also proposing the use of Dato-DXd for non-small cell lung cancer, the decision for which is expected in the third quarter of this year.",

            "content": "The Food and Drug Administration on Monday expanded use of AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo\u2019s Enhertu, allowing the drug to be given earlier and more broadly in people with an aggressive form of breast cancer.\n\nSince 2022, Enhertu has been approved in the U.S. to treat advanced breast tumors expressing \u201clow,\u201d but still detectable, levels of the HER2 protein. With its new decision, the agency widened Enhertu\u2019s availability to include treatment of tumors with \u201cultralow\u201d HER2 expression. HER2 protein levels must be determined by an FDA-approved test, AstraZeneca and Daiichi said in a statement.\n\nThe new approval positions Enhertu, an antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, to be used before chemotherapy in people with low HER2-expressing tumors. Until now, Enhertu was available only for people whose cancer had progressed despite one or more hormone therapies as well as chemo. (The drug is also approved for use after HER2-targeted treatment in people with classically HER2 positive tumors.)\n\nThe approval \u201crepresents another paradigm shift in how certain breast cancers can be treated,\u201d said Ken Keller, Daiichi Sankyo\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement.\n\nEnhertu, which delivers a toxin to tumor cells expressing HER2, has secured a series of approvals since AstraZeneca and Daiichi began collaborating five years ago. U.S. regulators have cleared it for use in breast, lung and gastric tumors. And it became the first ADC to win a pan-tumor OK, having been approved last year for use treating any solid tumor expressing HER2.\n\nThe approvals for HER2-low and, now, HER2-ultralow breast cancers are changing clinical practice, making it important for doctors to view expression beyond binary positive or negative terms.\n\nFor example, AstraZeneca estimates that as many as two-thirds of hormone receptor-positive breast cancers typically classified as negative for HER2 actually have low levels of the protein. The company has said another 20% to 25% may have \u201cultralow\u201d HER2 expression.\n\n\u201cIt is critical for patients to understand the HER2 status of their metastatic breast cancer to help them make informed treatment decisions,\u201d said Krissa Smith, the vice president of education at the nonprofit group Susan G. Komen, in the statement provided by AstraZeneca and Daiichi.\n\nEnhertu is part of AstraZeneca and Daiichi\u2019s plan to prove ADCs can replace chemo in many tumor types. The company has six ADCs in clinical development, among them Datroway, which produced mixed results in testing but won its first U.S. approval in breast cancer this month.\n\n\u201cThe key goal from this trial is to show the power of ADCs in truly replacing chemotherapy,\u201d said Mohit Manrao, the senior vice president of AstraZeneca\u2019s U.S. oncology division, in an interview last year. \u201cWe are seeing with this therapy, we can displace traditional chemotherapy and bring it earlier to the patients.\u201d\n\nEnhertu\u2019s clearance was based on study results, published in The New England Journal of Medicine last September, showing that Enhertu delayed cancer progression or death by a median of 13.2 months, versus 8.1 months among those who received chemo. That equated to a 36% reduction in the risk of cancer progression for study participants treated with Enhertu.\n\nNearly identical results were observed in the smaller group of people with ultralow HER2 levels, though the study wasn\u2019t powered to detect a statistical difference on that measure.\n\nThe study hasn\u2019t run for long enough to prove whether Enhertu extends survival. At the time of data cut-off last year, treatment was associated with a roughly 17% reduction in the risk of death, which was not statistically significant. There were also higher rates of serious drug-related side effects in people who received Enhertu, among them a kind of lung scarring called interstitial lung disease. Although this side effect wasn\u2019t serious in most, three patients died, study results showed.\n\nAstraZeneca and Daiichi are evaluating Enhertu even earlier in HER2-positive breast cancer, with Phase 3 tests ongoing in the first-line setting as well as before or after surgical removal of a tumor. Results from all three trials are expected later this year.\n\nDaiichi will receive a $175 million milestone payment from AstraZeneca as a result of Monday\u2019s approval.",

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN), the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant, has seen its stock price tumble 15 percent over the past six months, buffeted by a series of unsettling reports emanating from China. A widening investigation by China regulators into alleged illegal drug imports, data breaches, and potential health insurance fraud has cast a shadow over the company\u2019s prospects in a critical market, triggering a securities class action lawsuit in the United States.\n\nHagens Berman has opened an investigation into the allegations and urges investors in AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 23, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 17, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Feb. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/azn\n\nContact the Firm Now: AZN@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nProbe Into AstraZeneca\u2019s China Operations\n\nThe probe conducted by China regulators, which reportedly centers on allegations that AstraZeneca employees improperly imported cancer medications like Enhertu and Imjudo from Hong Kong into mainland China and mishandled patient data, has been compounded by a broader investigation into a large-scale health insurance fraud case. The confluence of these issues has raised serious concerns among investors about the potential impact on the company\u2019s regional sales and overall financial performance.\n\nThe situation escalated with the arrest of Leon Wang, AstraZeneca\u2019s Executive Vice President International and China President. This development, coupled with internal forecasts predicting a downturn in sales within the Chinese market, has prompted a sharp investor reaction, culminating in the legal action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe AstraZeneca Securities Class Action Suit\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that AstraZeneca issued \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d and withheld crucial information regarding the company\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory risks in China. The complaint specifically accuses AstraZeneca of engaging in insurance fraud, facing heightened legal exposure that led to Mr. Wang\u2019s detention, understating the risks associated with its Chinese operations, and failing to disclose the potential for these issues to significantly harm its business and finances in the region.\n\nThe truth allegedly began to emerge in late October. On October 30, AstraZeneca announced that Mr. Wang was cooperating with a Chinese investigation, offering few details. This initial announcement triggered a 3 percent drop in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nThe situation worsened on November 5, when Yicai, a Chinese business news outlet, reported that dozens of AstraZeneca China executives were implicated in the investigation, with some potentially facing lengthy prison sentences. The report, citing an industry insider, attributed the alleged compliance issues to \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on sales representatives to meet aggressive sales targets. This news sent AstraZeneca\u2019s stock down another 7 percent.\n\nOn November 12, AstraZeneca confirmed Mr. Wang\u2019s detention and disclosed that the Chinese investigation encompassed allegations of medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation, and breaches of personal information.\n\nMore recently, on December 18, The Financial Times reported that AstraZeneca executives anticipate a decline in Chinese revenue due to the arrests of Mr. Wang and other senior executives. The report quoted an AstraZeneca executive who stated that \u201cdoctors are unwilling to interact with our salespeople and prescribe our medicines\u201d following the investigation, precipitating a further nearly 4 percent decline in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nHagens Berman Investigation\n\nThese events have prompted shareholder rights firm to open an investigation in the allegations.\n\n\u201cShould the allegations be confirmed, it suggests AstraZeneca misled investors about the true extent of its exposure in China, a failure with potentially serious consequences,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, an attorney leading the firm's investigation.\n\nIf you invested in AstraZeneca and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the AstraZeneca investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding AstraZeneca should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than February 21, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar.

The Company also expects seven first Phase III clinical trial data readouts in 2025.\n\nAstraZeneca is one of the leading R&D investors in Canada, contributing more than C$230 million in research and development in 2023, much of which is focused on delivery of over 210 AstraZeneca global clinical studies of new medicines and indications.\n\nThe Company\u2019s investments in Canada since 2023 now exceed C$1.3 billion, creating a combined 1,200 new high-skilled jobs. In 2024, AstraZeneca completed a C$3 billion agreement to acquire Hamilton, Ontario-based Fusion Pharmaceuticals, which is developing next-generation radioconjugates with the promise to redefine radiotherapy for cancer patients.\n\nThe Fusion announcement represents one of the largest research investments made in a Canadian biotechnology company.1 Together these investments are contributing to the growth of Canada\u2019s life sciences sector and the advancement of AstraZeneca\u2019s global clinical studies pipeline.\n\nPascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, AstraZeneca said: \u201cThis investment is a reflection of our growing clinical pipeline, our strong belief in Canada\u2019s potential as a global hub for life sciences innovation, and the value of public-private collaboration with the Ontario government. We believe the diverse talent pool together with the network of world-class universities, hospitals, and research centres will help us bring new medicines to Canadians and patients worldwide.\u201d\n\nDoug Ford, Premier of Ontario said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is fantastic news for Ontario and another testament to the incredible talent, innovation and opportunities our province has to offer. Our government, through Invest Ontario, is proud to support AstraZeneca with C$16.1 million to help bring these hundreds of new, highly-skilled jobs to Ontario, strengthening Ontario\u2019s position as a global leader in life sciences and innovation.\u201d\n\nGaby Bourbara, President, AstraZeneca Canada said: \u201cAstraZeneca\u2019s continued investment in Ontario is crucial to advancing innovative medicines that treat, prevent, and may one day cure complex diseases like prostate, lung, and breast cancer, as well as rare diseases. AstraZeneca\u2019s investment of C$820 million (US$570m), alongside the Government of Ontario\u2019s contribution through Invest Ontario, will strengthen the Province\u2019s life sciences strategy, driving economic growth, and foster innovation that benefits patients in Canada and around the world.\u201d",

            "content": "Daiichi Sankyo is growing rapidly thanks to AstraZeneca-partnered breast cancer med Enhertu, with revenue of just under $4 billion expected for 2024. But U.S. chief executive Ken Keller is pretty upfront that 2024 didn\u2019t exactly go as planned.\n\nIt was \u201cnot a perfect year,\u201d he told BioSpace on the sidelines of the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. That\u2019s because, while Enhertu flourished, the Japanese pharma received a complete response letter for patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd) and withdrew an application for up-and-coming antibody drug conjugate datopotamab deruxtecan, or Dato-DXd , in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nSo, all in all, a \u201cgood year, not perfect last year,\u201d said Keller, who serves as CEO of Daiichi Sankyo, Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of the global pharmaceutical company, and as head of the Global Oncology Business.\n\nBut 2025 is starting off with a bang. Dato-DXd has now been approved for its first indication\u2014for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic breast cancer who are HR-positive and HER2-negative. The AstraZeneca-partnered drug will be marketed as Datroway. BioSpace sat down with Keller prior to the FDA approval, but his enthusiasm for what\u2019s to come was clear.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been able to say, \u2018We\u2019ve got eight top line readouts for registration trials\u2019 at any company I\u2019ve been at,\u201d Keller said. \u201cSo I think it could be a really special year.\u201d\n\nLearning From Mistakes\n\nBut first, it\u2019s important to look at how Daiichi got to this point, because the stumbles of 2024 will define 2025. On the withdrawal, Keller explained that Daiichi and AstraZeneca chose to walk back an application for Dato-DXd in patients with metastatic NSCLC who did not have genomic alterations, with non-squamous disease. Trials had demonstrated that the ADC achieved two-month progression-free survival and a \u201cnon-significant\u201d trend in overall survival, Keller explained. After talking with the FDA, it became clear \u201cthat wasn\u2019t going to be enough,\u201d he said.\n\nDaiichi pulled the application and refiled it in a smaller population for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. The FDA granted a priority review and set a decision date in July. Keller said that while the population is smaller in the U.S. and Europe, there are actually more patients in China and Japan with EGFR-mutated disease.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big, important drug there,\u201d he said. \u201cA key thing we learned is that Dato-DXd may require us to be smarter in selecting the patients that it will benefit.\u201d The company is working on digital biomarker pathology to further break down which patients may benefit.\n\nAs for the complete response letter for HER3-DXd, Daiichi and partner Merck had been seeking an accelerated approval of the drug for patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC who had already received two or more other therapies. The FDA rejected the application due to manufacturing concerns. Keller could not provide an update on the process to address the concerns flagged by the FDA.\n\nLooking into 2025, Keller said Daiichi is expecting top line readouts for eight registrational trials across its ADC portfolio, including five new indications for Enhertu and two for Dato-DXd: the EGFR-mutated NSCLC group plus a trial in triple negative breast cancer.\n\nAnother prospect with clinical milestones this year is ifinatamab deruxtecan (I-DXd). Partner Merck acquired Harpoon Therapeutics a year ago and offered Daiichi the chance to participate through their existing deal . The amendment added an upfront payment of $170 million for Merck to provide access to the delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) targeting T cell engager MK-6070. That drug will now be combined with I-DXd in clinical trials for small cell lung cancer (SCLC).\n\nEarly data from I-DXd in this indication showed a 52% overall response rate, Keller said. A registrational trial will read out this year.\n\n2025 will also see Daiichi working hard on the Datroway launch. Keller said the company is actually going to be competing against itself in the initial breast cancer indication, as Enhertu has the nod here as well. Gilead\u2019s Trodelvy is also approved for this population. Keller said that Datroway has an every-three-week infusion schedule compared to every two weeks for Trodelvy.\n\n\u201cI think the efficacy looks similar right now, and we\u2019ll have to see,\u201d Keller said. Regarding safety, he said the data for Datroway show fewer grade 3 adverse events than Gilead\u2019s offering.\n\nMoving as Fast as Cancer\n\nKeller said that Daiichi\u2019s key to staying on top of the ADC world is to do more clinical trials as fast as possible. He has seen the frenzy of interest, with Big Pharmas swallowing up ADC-focused biotechs, licensing assets from China and new companies launching. Daiichi has even been a participant, partnering with Merck in a mega-licensing deal in 2023 worth a potential $22 billion.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been over $100 billion in M&A in the ADC space over the last three or four years. It\u2019s really remarkable,\u201d Keller said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any big new acquisitions, because there\u2019s nobody left that is big. But I think the science in ADCs continues to move very, very quickly.\u201d\n\nADCs have three components: an antibody, linker and payload. Companies have been tinkering with that formula to create even more efficacious candidates. Keller said the industry has shifted to second generation payloads. Daiichi is looking at bispecifics in ADCs, meaning offering two different payloads to tackle the cancer from multiple angles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the beginning of the science,\u201d Keller said. \u201cUnfortunately, cancer is smart. It evolves.\u201d Even Daiichi\u2019s best offerings will someday be outsmarted by cancer and new options will be needed, he added. \u201cThere will be resistance, and when resistance occurs, you\u2019ll need different ADCs.\u201d\n\nDaiichi itself is evolving, too. When the deal with AstraZeneca was signed in 2020, the Japanese company was just entering oncology. The partnership produced Enhertu and now Datroway. Then Merck signed on for a handful of assets.\n\nKeller said that Daiichi now has the ability to go it alone if the asset fits. \u201cThe bar for doing another partnership gets higher and higher, because since we started this five, six years ago with the [AstraZeneca] alliance, today, we\u2019ve got a full team of people across the globe. So I think the bar does get pretty high.\u201d",

With a median progression-free survival exceeding one year and a response rate of more than 60 percent, trastuzumab deruxtecan offers a potential new standard of care for patients with HR-positive, HER2-low or HER2-ultralow metastatic breast cancer following endocrine therapy.\u201d\n\nDave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Hematology Business Unit, AstraZeneca, said: \u201c Building on the practice-changing previous approvals for ENHERTU, this new approval brings this important medicine to an earlier treatment setting and a broader patient population with HER2-expressing metastatic breast cancer. The approval also highlights the importance of testing metastatic breast cancer tumors for detectable staining with a standard IHC test to identify those who may be eligible for treatment with ENHERTU following endocrine therapy.\u201d\n\nKen Keller, Global Head of Oncology Business, and President and CEO, Daiichi Sankyo, said: \u201c ENHERTU continues to redefine the classification and treatment of HR-positive metastatic breast cancer with important new data across the spectrum of HER2 expression. Today\u2019s approval underscores our ongoing commitment to realizing the full potential of this innovative antibody drug conjugate and represents another paradigm shift in how certain breast cancers can be treated.\u201d\n\nKrissa Smith, Vice President, Education, Susan G. Komen, said: \u201c We are excited to see more treatment options for these patients which enable more personalized care. It is critical for patients to understand the HER2 status of their metastatic breast cancer to help them make informed treatment decisions. Patients with tumors that are HER2-low or HER2-ultralow now have more options to consider with their healthcare team.\u201d\n\nIn the trial, ENHERTU showed a 36% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death versus chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54-0.76; p<0.0001) in the overall trial population of patients with chemotherapy-na\u00efve HER2-low or HER2-ultralow metastatic breast cancer. A median progression-free survival (PFS) of 13.2 months was seen in patients randomized to ENHERTU compared to 8.1 months in those randomized to chemotherapy. The confirmed objective response rate (ORR) in the overall trial population was 62.6% for ENHERTU versus 34.4% for chemotherapy.\n\nIn an exploratory analysis of patients with HER2-ultralow expression, results were seen to be consistent between patients with HER2-low expression and HER2-ultralow expression.\n\nHER2 status in the trial was confirmed by a central laboratory and was performed on a tumor sample obtained at the time of initial metastatic diagnosis or later. Approximately 85-90% of patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer were determined to have actionable levels of HER2-expression.1 Further, nearly two-thirds of patients previously assessed as IHC 0 at a local laboratory were classified as HER2-low or HER2-ultralow upon central analysis of the tumor sample.1\n\nThe safety profile of ENHERTU in DESTINY-Breast06 was consistent with previous clinical trials of ENHERTU in breast cancer with no new safety concerns identified.\n\nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2-directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by Daiichi Sankyo and being jointly developed and commercialized by AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo.\n\nENHERTU is already approved in more than 75 countries, including the US, for patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer who have received a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY-Breast04 trial. Regulatory applications are under review in the EU, Japan and several other countries based on the DESTINY-Breast06 results.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nIndications\n\nENHERTU is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with:\n\nUnresectable or metastatic HER2-positive (IHC 3+ or ISH positive) breast cancer who have received a prior anti-HER2-based regimen either: In the metastatic setting, or In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy\n\n\n\nUnresectable or metastatic: Hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) or HER2-ultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA-approved test, that has progressed on one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy\n\n\n\nUnresectable or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2 (ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy\n\n\n\nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of response.

Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.\n\nExposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.\n\nContraindications\n\nNone.\n\nWarnings and Precautions\n\nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis\n\nSevere, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with apulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in \u226428 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose 1 level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., \u22650.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., \u22651 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.\n\nHER2-Positive, HER2-Low, and HER2-Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2-Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)\n\nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2-mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients.

Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.\n\nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction\n\nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.

Hepatic Impairment: In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).\n\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1-877-437-7763 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.\n\nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication Guide.\n\nNotes\n\nFinancial considerations\n\nFollowing this approval for ENHERTU in the US, an amount of $175m is due from AstraZeneca to Daiichi Sankyo as a milestone payment for the HER2-low and HER2-ultralow chemotherapy-na\u00efve breast cancer indication. The milestone will be capitalized as an addition to the upfront payment made by AstraZeneca to Daiichi Sankyo in 2019 and subsequent capitalized milestones and will be amortized through the profit and loss statement.\n\nSales of ENHERTU in the US are recognized by Daiichi Sankyo. AstraZeneca reports its share of gross profit margin from ENHERTU sales in the US as Alliance Revenue in the Company\u2019s financial statements.\n\nFurther details on the financial arrangements were set out in the March 2019 announcement of the collaboration.\n\nBreast cancer and HER2 expression\n\nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide.2 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022 with more than 665,000 deaths globally.2 In the US, more than 300,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually.3 While survival rates are high for those diagnosed with early breast cancer, only about 30% of patients diagnosed with or who progress to metastatic disease are expected to live five years following diagnosis.4\n\nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors, including breast cancer.5 Patients with high levels of HER2 expression (IHC 3+ or 2+/ISH+) are classified as HER2-positive and treated with HER2-directed therapies, representing approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers.6 Historically, tumors that were not classified as HER2-positive were classified as HER2-negative.7\n\nHR-positive, HER2-negative is the most common breast cancer subtype, accounting for approximately 70% of all breast cancers.4 Endocrine therapies are widely given consecutively in the early lines of treatment for HR-positive metastatic breast cancer. However, after initial treatment, further efficacy from endocrine therapy is often limited.8 The current standard of care following endocrine therapy is chemotherapy, which is associated with poor response rates and outcomes.8-11\n\nDespite being classified as HER2-negative, many of these tumors may still carry some level of HER2 expression.7 Prior to the approvals of ENHERTU in HER2-low or HER2-ultralow metastatic breast cancer based on the DESTINY-Breast04 and DESTINY-Breast06 trials, there were no targeted therapies specifically approved for these patient populations.12,13\n\nDESTINY-Breast06\n\nDESTINY-Breast06 is a global, randomized, open-label, Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU (5.4mg/kg) versus investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel) in patients with HR-positive, HER2-low (IHC 1+ or 2+/ISH-) or HER2-ultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients in the trial had no prior chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease and received at least two lines of prior endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting. Patients were also eligible if they had received one prior line of endocrine therapy combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in the metastatic setting and experienced disease progression within six months of starting 1st-line treatment or received endocrine therapy as an adjuvant treatment and experienced disease recurrence within 24 months.\n\nThe primary endpoint is PFS in the HR-positive, HER2-low patient population as measured by blinded independent central review (BICR). Key secondary endpoints include PFS by BICR in the overall trial population (HER2-low and HER2-ultralow), overall survival (OS) in the HER2-low patient population and OS in the overall trial population. Other secondary endpoints include ORR, duration of response, time to first subsequent treatment or death, time to second subsequent treatment or death and safety.\n\nDESTINY-Breast06 enrolled 866 patients (n=713 for HER2-low and n=153 for HER2-ultralow) in Asia, Europe, Australia, North America and South America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\nENHERTU\n\nENHERTU is a HER2-directed ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo\u2019s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca\u2019s ADC scientific platform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide-based cleavable linkers.\n\nENHERTU (5.4mg/kg) is approved in more than 75 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC 3+ or in-situ hybridization [ISH]+) breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior anti-HER2-based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy based on the results from the DESTINY-Breast03 trial.\n\nENHERTU (5.4mg/kg) is approved in more than 75 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ ISH-) breast cancer who have received a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY-Breast04 trial.\n\nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the US for adult patients with unresectable or metastatic hormone receptor HR-positive, HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) or HER2-ultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA-approved test, that has progressed on one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting based on the results from the DESTINY-Breast06 trial.\n\nENHERTU (5.4mg/kg) is approved in more than 50 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2 (ERBB2) mutations, as detected by a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results from the DESTINY-Lung02 and/or DESTINY-Lung05 trials. Continued approval in China and the US for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\n\nENHERTU (6.4mg/kg) is approved in more than 65 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive (IHC 3+ or 2+/ISH+) gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab-based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY-Gastric01, DESTINY-Gastric02 and/or DESTINY-Gastric06 trials. Continued approval in China for this indication will depend on whether a randomized controlled confirmatory clinical trial can demonstrate clinical benefit in this population.\n\nENHERTU (5.4mg/kg) is approved in the US, Russia, Israel and Brazil for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options based on the results from the DESTINY-PanTumor02, DESTINY-Lung01 and DESTINY-CRC02 trials. Continued approval for this indication in the US may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\n\nENHERTU development program\n\nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2-targetable cancers. Trials in combination with other anti-cancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.\n\nDaiichi Sankyo collaboration\n\nAstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan-dlnk in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan-dlnk.\n\nAstraZeneca in breast cancer\n\nDriven by a growing understanding of breast cancer biology, AstraZeneca is starting to challenge, and redefine, the current clinical paradigm for how breast cancer is classified and treated to deliver even more effective treatments to patients in need \u2013 with the bold ambition to one day eliminate breast cancer as a cause of death.\n\nAstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and promising compounds in development that leverage different mechanisms of action to address the biologically diverse breast cancer tumor environment.\n\nWith ENHERTU, a HER2-directed ADC, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo are aiming to improve outcomes in previously treated HER2-positive and HER2-low metastatic breast cancer and are exploring its potential in earlier lines of treatment and in new breast cancer settings.\n\nIn HR-positive breast cancer, AstraZeneca continues to improve outcomes with foundational medicines fulvestrant and goserelin and aims to reshape the HR-positive space with first-in-class AKT inhibitor, capivasertib, and next-generation SERD and potential new medicine camizestrant. AstraZeneca is also collaborating with Daiichi Sankyo to explore the potential of TROP2-directed ADC, datopotamab deruxtecan-dlnk, in this setting.\n\nPARP inhibitor olaparib is a targeted treatment option that has been studied in early and metastatic breast cancer patients with an inherited BRCA mutation. AstraZeneca with Merck & Co., Inc. (MSD outside the US and Canada) continue to research olaparib in these settings and to explore its potential in earlier disease.\n\nTo bring much-needed treatment options to patients with triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive form of breast cancer, AstraZeneca is evaluating the potential of datopotamab deruxtecan-dlnk alone and in combination with immunotherapy durvalumab, capivasertib in combination with chemotherapy, and durvalumab in combination with other oncology medicines, including olaparib and ENHERTU.\n\nAstraZeneca in oncology\n\nAstraZeneca is leading a revolution in oncology with the ambition to provide cures for cancer in every form, following the science to understand cancer and all its complexities to discover, develop and deliver life-changing medicines to patients.\n\nThe Company's focus is on some of the most challenging cancers. It is through persistent innovation that AstraZeneca has built one of the most diverse portfolios and pipelines in the industry, with the potential to catalyze changes in the practice of medicine and transform the patient experience.\n\nAstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer care and, one day, eliminate cancer as a cause of death.\n\nAstraZeneca\n\nAstraZeneca is a global, science-led biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development and commercialization of prescription medicines in Oncology, Rare Diseases and BioPharmaceuticals, including Cardiovascular, Renal & Metabolism, and Respiratory & Immunology. Based in Cambridge, UK, AstraZeneca operates in over 125 countries, and its innovative medicines are used by millions of patients worldwide.

            "content": "Module 4 of the inquiry is looking at issues relating to the development of Covid-19 vaccines and the implementation of the vaccine rollout programme in the UK.\n\nEstablished under the 1979 Vaccine Damage Payment Act, the VDPS has been under public scrutiny since the pandemic, with lawyers and campaign groups arguing the scheme offers too little support, too late, to too few people.\n\nCurrently, to be eligible for VDPS compensation, capped at \u00a3120,000, applicants must meet a 60 per cent disability threshold, criticised for being based on \u201coutdated\u201d concepts of industrial injury and disablement.\n\nSarah Moore represents a group of 49 claimants who have been seriously injured or bereaved as a result of a side-effect of the AstraZeneca (AZUK) Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nEarlier this month, Kate Scott, whose husband Jamie Scott was left with brain damage after receiving the AZUK vaccine, gave evidence to Module 4 of the inquiry on behalf of Vaccine Injured and Bereaved UK - a group of individuals and families severely injured or bereaved as a result of receiving a Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nRepresented by Sarah Moore, Jamie suffered vaccine-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis and has been left with permanent brain damage and disability after he received the AZUK vaccine in April 2021.\n\nLast year, three women including Kate Scott, whose loved ones lost their lives or suffered life-changing injuries after receiving the vaccine, met with Health Secretary Wes Streeting to make their case for a reform of the VDPS.\n\nThis came after AZUK formally admitted its COVID-19 vaccine can cause a rare side-effect known as Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome.\n\nThe Health Secretary has now written to Kate, saying he has \u201ccommissioned officials to work up a number of options\u201d to reform the current VDPS.\n\nThe issue was the focus of a BBC documentary highlighting the plight of families whose loved ones suffered a severe and life-changing effect after being given the AZUK vaccine.\n\nSarah Moore said:\n\n\u201cIt is a privilege to be invited to provide evidence at the Covid-19 Inquiry on this vital issue. The Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme, as it currently stands, fails to meet the needs of those who have been seriously injured or bereaved due to vaccine side effects. By reforming the VDPS to ensure it is fair, accessible, and adequately resourced, we can address the hardships faced by affected individuals and their families while maintaining public trust in vaccination programmes.\n\n\u201cA VDPS that is fit for purpose has the potential to support and maintain vaccine confidence in the UK by reassuring the public that any rare adverse events are met with timely and adequate responses. This is an opportunity to address longstanding shortcomings in the scheme and set a standard for how we care for those who bear the unintended consequences of public health measures.\u201d",

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than February 21, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWhy Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDetails of the case: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) AstraZeneca engaged in insurance fraud in China; (2) as a result, AstraZeneca faced heightened legal exposure in China, which eventually resulted in the AstraZeneca China President being detained by Chinese law enforcement authorities; (3) as a result, AstraZeneca understated its legal risks; (4) the foregoing, once revealed, could materially harm AstraZeneca's business activities in China; and (5) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the AstraZeneca class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=1331 https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=28116 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

The Mongolian technician had his initial throw attempt thwarted but quickly regrouped for an overpowering win.\n\nKotozakura, who also came into the tournament as a yokozuna promotion candidate after his championship in November, must contest the next meet as a demotion-threatened \"kadoban\" ozeki.\n\nHoshoryu blew away Kinbozan in the first playoff bout, getting an inside position with his opening charge and manhandling the maegashira out of the ring.\n\nThe second playoff match was a trickier affair, with Oho denying Hoshoryu his favored grip and locking into a stalemate before the ozeki wrenched the rank-and-filer off balance and toppled him with a frontal crush out to seal the title.\n\nHoshoryu, who won his previous top-division championship in July 2023, put himself in contention for yokozuna promotion with a 13-2 runner-up performance at the November meet won by Kotozakura.\n\n\"On the last day of the previous tournament, I promised myself that I would really get it done this time at the January tournament,\" said Hoshoryu, whose title bid looked shaky after back-to-back losses on the eighth and ninth days.\n\n\"This was a tournament for getting to yokozuna, but each day I wanted to stay focused and have the results follow. My stablemaster told me to have fun and to enjoy the bouts, and that was really encouraging.\"\n\nThe 27-year-old Kinbozan was aiming to become the first wrestler from Kazakhstan to win an elite makuuchi division championship. His unexpected title challenge included victories against ozeki Kotozakura and Onosato, who went on to finish 10-5 with an easy defeat of No. 4 maegashira Ura (7-8).\n\nOho, the 24-year-old grandson of former yokozuna Taiho, looks certain for his first promotion to the three \"sanyaku\" ranks below yokozuna after narrowly missing out on his maiden Emperor's Cup.\n\n\"Hoshoryu came up with the best performance,\" Japan Sumo Association chief Hakkaku said. \"I'm sure he felt pressure as an ozeki, but his mental strength made the difference.\"\n\n\"Oho did well, too. He's had his feet on the ground since several tournaments ago. He looks really focused.\"\n\nSekiwake Daieisho wrapped up a solid 11-4 performance by thrusting out komusubi Abi, whose 7-8 record will see him back among the rank-and-file at the next meet. Komusubi Wakatakakage (7-8) will also drop from sanyaku after getting slapped down by No. 6 maegashira Ichiyamamoto (8-7).\n\nTen-time Emperor's Cup winner Terunofuji dropped a bombshell by announcing his retirement on the sixth day after the latest tournament withdrawal of his injury-plagued career.\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nSumo: JSA to discuss conditions for Hoshoryu's yokozuna promotion\n\nSumo: Kinbozan moves closer to title as Hoshoryu, Oho stay in hunt\n\nSumo: Hoshoryu slaps down Kinbozan, opens up championship race",

Arlene Foster, Michelle O\u2019Neill, Jeremy Farrar, Robin Swann, Humza Yousef, Nicola Sturgeon, Boris Johnson, Mark Drakeford, Social Media companies YouTube, Google, TikTok, META & Twitter.\n\nBy deliberately narrowing the scope of an inquiry they\u2019ve removed the publics understanding of why they were so heavily censored, yes it was partly about removing vaccine hesitancy but blocking the sharing of very real harms seen and felt by so many proved horrendous for so many more to come over the following year from AstraZeneca and not only it\u2019s changed name to Vaxzevria but from the harms posed by all the vaccines.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the very real harms suffered by the public which so many have refused on many occasions to even engage let alone acknowledge existing from Hancock to Whitty, they all played down risks in Covid so they\u2019d be seen as rare to remove vaccine hesitancy.\n\nMany of those appearing even openly admitted their part in calling for or backing censorship campaigns to \u201cprotect the public\u201d from misinformation and disinformation that was \u201crisking lives\u201d, the goal being to \u201cprotect granny\u201d afterall.\n\nAnd what of us now, it\u2019s such a cruel hellscape we\u2019ve found ourselves thrust into with once strong fit bodies and perfectly functioning minds now so horribly broken and no one in \u201chealthcare\u201d offering us the help we desperately need even 4 years on from the toxic vaccine campaign waged by AstraZeneca and indemnified from prosecution by the government, \u201cthey won\u2019t make any money from providing it\u201d stated Hancock \u201cso it\u2019s only right we do this.\u201d\n\nThis Inquiry hasn\u2019t been designed with fairness in mind to those cruelly affected whether vaccine injured & bereaved, those loved ones murdered by lethal protocols or other harms inflicted by lockdown kerbs.\n\nBlame is clear from far away but indemnity clauses are in place with guided questions designed to restrict the needed answers further, but in the question will our solicitors get us justice finally after it\u2019s concluded is another matter and you have to have hope that they\u2019ve still beyond every obstacle thrown at this that they will. \u202a\n\nThe deceitful actions of a trusted government put the safety of millions in the U.K. in the completely immoral and un-impartial hands of a medicines regulator. \u202c\n\n\u202aSwearing allegiance to a company paying funding of around 80% should\u2019ve been the biggest safety signal ever yet it proved how blind they all were to signs of major harms being committed by their assured products. \u202c\n\nLies seem to be part of their remit in the Inquiry, we know that indemnification from prosecution has been offered to all who require it it now appears after Matt Hancock openly referred to it at the end of module 3, with guided questions also they\u2019re protecting everyone concerned from seeming to act without impartiality.\n\nImagine the depths of evil to firstly construct the plan Howard but then to build such an army of minions willing or otherwise to push such an Orwellian agenda, it\u2019s from the stuff of nightmares but the powers that have brought us to this point but still without a clear way of getting justice were certainly in it for the long haul with many paths to protect them\n\nBearing in mind the first record death from the covid vaccines was Jan 26th 2021 it\u2019s a timely reminder that this is exactly the sort of horror that the Covid inquiry was meant to finally look into but why narrow the margins of investigation to further protect those already with indemnity from prosecution instead of highlighting the British publics already valid causes for concern?\n\nIt\u2019s been a complete failure by \u201chealthcare\u201d to ensure the safety of its public and act on concerns to offer the help they need afterwards, we need a government prepared to take the tough steps needed to restore trust if we are ever to believe them again.",

            "content": "AstraZeneca announced that this week it has received two positive recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for the treatment of lung cancer patients across England and Wales.\n\nTagrisso (osimertinib) received a positive recommendation from NICE for NHS use as an adjuvant treatment option after complete tumor resection in adult patients with stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have epidermal growth factor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations. Following a three-year period within the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF), this recommendation means that osimertinib has successfully exited the CDF, enabling full baseline commissioning within NHS England for this patient population.\n\nImfinzi (durvalumab) was recommended by NICE for NHS use in combination with etoposide plus either carboplatin or cisplatin for adults with untreated extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).\n\nDurvalumab in lung cancer\n\nLung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the UK, accounting for 21% of all cancer deaths . Nearly 50,000 people, more than 130 each day, are diagnosed with lung cancer each year in the UK. SCLC is a highly aggressive and fast-growing form of lung cancer that typically recurs and progresses rapidly. ES-SCLC occurs when the cancer has spread to the second lung or other parts of the body.\n\nDr Meenali Chitnis, Consultant Thoracic Medical Oncologist, Oxford University, said: \u201cExtensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) is a devastating diagnosis with a poor prognosis \u2013 with fewer than 5% of patients surviving beyond two years. Positive data from the CASPIAN Phase III trial marks an important breakthrough, providing clinicians with an effective treatment option of durvalumab with etoposide plus carboplatin or cisplatin.\u201d\n\nThe positive determination from NICE was based on results from the pivotal CASPIAN Phase III trial. Results of a two-year follow-up analysis, published in 2020, showed that first-line treatment with durvalumab plus platinum chemotherapy met the primary endpoint of the trial and demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful improvements in overall survival (OS) in patients with ES-SCLC versus chemotherapy alone (based on a hazard ratio [HR] of 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-0.91; p=0.0047). The safety findings from the trial were consistent with the known safety profiles of durvalumab and chemotherapy.\n\nUpdated results from the CASPIAN Phase III trial presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2021, showed that durvalumab plus platinum chemotherapy reduced the risk of death by 29% compared with chemotherapy alone (HR of 0.71; 95% CI 0.60-0.86; nominal p=0.0003) at three years. The updated median OS was 12.9 months versus 10.5 for chemotherapy.\n\nThis is fantastic news for lung cancer patients. We are proud that these decisions by NICE mean we've had 28 positive recommendations by NICE and the SMC since 2021 across multiple cancer types and stages. This represents another step towards our bold ambition to one day eliminate cancer as a cause of death.\u201d Tom Keith-Roach, President, AstraZeneca UK\n\nOsimertinib in lung cancer\n\nNSCLC is the most common lung cancer, accounting for around 80-85% of cases. Around 12% of patients with NSCLC have tumors with EGFR mutations. Patients with early-stage NSCLC often undergo surgery with curative intent as standard of care \u2013 however, disease recurrence following surgery remains high, and has been reported to occur in 30-50% of patients.\n\nThe positive recommendation from NICE for osimertinib was based on results from the ADAURA Phase III trial. In which, adjuvant treatment (after surgery) with osimertinib in patients with stage II-IIIA EGFRm NSCLC reduced the relative risk of disease recurrence or death (disease-free survival) by 83% compared to placebo (HR = 0.17; 99.06% CI, 0.11 to 0.26; P<0.001). Survival without disease recurrence at two years was 90% (95% CI 84-93) for osimertinib and 44% (95% CI 37-51) for placebo. When looking at the broader group of patients (stage IB-IIIA) \u2013 a secondary endpoint \u2013 the percentage of patients who were alive and disease-free at 24 months was 89% (95% CI, 85 to 92) in the osimertinib group and 52% (95% CI, 46 to 58) in the placebo group. The overall hazard ratio for disease recurrence or death was 0.20 (99.12% CI, 0.14 to 0.30; P<0.001), which equates to an 80% risk reduction.\n\nLung cancer causes more deaths in the UK than any other cancer and more than bladder, pancreatic, and kidney cancers combined. The UK has some of the worst lung cancer diagnosis and survival rates in the developed world. The economic burden is significant, with lung cancer costing the UK economy \u00a3698.9M each year.",

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN), the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant, has seen its stock price tumble 15 percent over the past six months, buffeted by a series of unsettling reports emanating from China. A widening investigation by China regulators into alleged illegal drug imports, data breaches, and potential health insurance fraud has cast a shadow over the company\u2019s prospects in a critical market, triggering a securities class action lawsuit in the United States.\n\nHagens Berman has opened an investigation into the allegations and urges investors in AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 23, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 17, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Feb. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/azn\n\nContact the Firm Now: AZN@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nProbe Into AstraZeneca\u2019s China Operations\n\nThe probe conducted by China regulators, which reportedly centers on allegations that AstraZeneca employees improperly imported cancer medications like Enhertu and Imjudo from Hong Kong into mainland China and mishandled patient data, has been compounded by a broader investigation into a large-scale health insurance fraud case. The confluence of these issues has raised serious concerns among investors about the potential impact on the company\u2019s regional sales and overall financial performance.\n\nThe situation escalated with the arrest of Leon Wang, AstraZeneca\u2019s Executive Vice President International and China President. This development, coupled with internal forecasts predicting a downturn in sales within the Chinese market, has prompted a sharp investor reaction, culminating in the legal action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe AstraZeneca Securities Class Action Suit\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that AstraZeneca issued \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d and withheld crucial information regarding the company\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory risks in China. The complaint specifically accuses AstraZeneca of engaging in insurance fraud, facing heightened legal exposure that led to Mr. Wang\u2019s detention, understating the risks associated with its Chinese operations, and failing to disclose the potential for these issues to significantly harm its business and finances in the region.\n\nThe truth allegedly began to emerge in late October. On October 30, AstraZeneca announced that Mr. Wang was cooperating with a Chinese investigation, offering few details. This initial announcement triggered a 3 percent drop in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nThe situation worsened on November 5, when Yicai, a Chinese business news outlet, reported that dozens of AstraZeneca China executives were implicated in the investigation, with some potentially facing lengthy prison sentences. The report, citing an industry insider, attributed the alleged compliance issues to \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on sales representatives to meet aggressive sales targets. This news sent AstraZeneca\u2019s stock down another 7 percent.\n\nOn November 12, AstraZeneca confirmed Mr. Wang\u2019s detention and disclosed that the Chinese investigation encompassed allegations of medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation, and breaches of personal information.\n\nMore recently, on December 18, The Financial Times reported that AstraZeneca executives anticipate a decline in Chinese revenue due to the arrests of Mr. Wang and other senior executives. The report quoted an AstraZeneca executive who stated that \u201cdoctors are unwilling to interact with our salespeople and prescribe our medicines\u201d following the investigation, precipitating a further nearly 4 percent decline in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nHagens Berman Investigation\n\nThese events have prompted shareholder rights firm to open an investigation in the allegations.\n\n\u201cShould the allegations be confirmed, it suggests AstraZeneca misled investors about the true extent of its exposure in China, a failure with potentially serious consequences,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, an attorney leading the firm's investigation.\n\nIf you invested in AstraZeneca and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the AstraZeneca investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding AstraZeneca should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.

The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that (1) AstraZeneca engaged in insurance fraud in China; (2) as a result, AstraZeneca faced heightened legal exposure in China, which eventually resulted in the AstraZeneca China President being detained by Chinese law enforcement authorities; (3) as a result, AstraZeneca understated its legal risks; (4) the foregoing, once revealed, could materially harm AstraZeneca\u2019s business activities in China; and (5) as a result, Defendants\u2019 statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.\n\nOn October 30, 2024, AstraZeneca announced that Leon Wang, Executive Vice President International and AstraZeneca China President, was \"cooperating with an ongoing investigation by Chinese authorities.\"\n\nOn this news, AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares (\"ADS\") fell 3.1% on October 30, 2024.\n\nThen, on November 5, 2024, Yicai Global published an article entitled \"AstraZeneca Insurance Fraud Involves Dozens of Senior Executives in China, Source Says.\" This article stated that \"[d]ozens of senior executives at AstraZeneca China have been implicated in an ongoing insurance fraud case as of last week, according to a person familiar with the matter.\" Further, it stated that \"[o]ver the past three years, insurance fraud cases involving AstraZeneca have surfaced in Shenzhen as well as the provinces of Fujian and Jiangxi. [. . .] These cases amount to the largest insurance fraud in the nation's pharmaceutical sector for years, a person familiar with the matter pointed out.\"\n\nOn this news, AstraZeneca ADSs fell a further 7.2% on November 5, 2024.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AstraZeneca\u2019s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nTo learn more about the AstraZeneca class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/AZN or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

Credit: Roland Magnusson via Getty Images.\n\nAstraZeneca has received two separate recommendations from England\u2019s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for the use of its lung cancer treatments, Tagrisso (osimertinib) and Imfinzi (durvalumab), within England and Wales\u2019s National Health Service (NHS).\n\nTagrisso has been recommended as an adjuvant therapy following complete surgical resection in adults with stage 1B to 3A non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumours have epidermal growth factor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 substitution mutations.\n\nThe NICE decision was supported by data from the Phase III ADAURA trial (NCT05120349), which demonstrated that post-surgical treatment with Tagrisso reduced the relative risk of disease recurrence or death by 83% compared to placebo in patients with stage 2 to 3A EGFR-mutated NSCLC. At two years, 90% of patients receiving Tagrisso were disease-free, compared to 44% in the placebo group. Among patients with stage 1B to 3A disease, 89% administered with AstraZeneca\u2019s treatment were alive and disease-free at 24 months compared to 52% in the placebo group.\n\nMeanwhile, Imfinzi has been recommended in combination with the chemotherapy etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin for the treatment of adults with untreated extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC).\n\nNICE\u2019s decision was based on results from the Phase III CASPIAN trial (NCT03043872), which demonstrated that adding Imfinzi to standard chemotherapy provided a significant and sustained overall survival (OS) benefit. At three years, the Imfinzi combination reduced the risk of death by 29% compared to chemotherapy alone.\n\nLung cancer remains the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the UK, and accounts for nearly 50,000 new cases annually, according to Cancer Research UK. A 2023 report from Frontier Economics estimated that lung cancer costs the UK economy \u00a3699m each year.\n\nWhile AstraZeneca has established itself as a key player in lung cancer treatment, Tagrisso faces competition. Johnson & Johnson (J&J) announced updated results from its Phase III MARIPOSA trial (NCT04487080) earlier this month, which tested the combination of its lung cancer drugs Lazcluze (lazertinib) and Rybrevant (amivantamab-vmjw). J&J claims the combination demonstrated a statistically significant OS improvement over Tagrisso by more than one year, though detailed data has not yet been disclosed.\n\nDespite the pressure from J&J, AstraZeneca anticipates strong commercial performance from its therapies. Tagrisso and Imfinzi are projected to generate global sales of $8bn and $7bn, respectively, by 2030, according to GlobalData\u2019s Pharma Intelligence Center.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Pharmaceutical Technology.\n\nAstraZeneca UK president Tom Keith-Roach said: \u201cThis is fantastic news for lung cancer patients. We are proud that these decisions by NICE mean we\u2019ve had 28 positive recommendations by NICE and the Scottish Medicines Consortium since 2021 across multiple cancer types and stages.\u201d",

A widening investigation by China regulators into alleged illegal drug imports, data breaches, and potential health insurance fraud has cast a shadow over the company\u2019s prospects in a critical market, triggering a securities class action lawsuit in the United States.\n\nHagens Berman has opened an investigation into the allegations and urges investors in AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 23, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 17, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Feb. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/azn\n\nContact the Firm Now: AZN@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nProbe Into AstraZeneca\u2019s China Operations\n\nThe probe conducted by China regulators, which reportedly centers on allegations that AstraZeneca employees improperly imported cancer medications like Enhertu and Imjudo from Hong Kong into mainland China and mishandled patient data, has been compounded by a broader investigation into a large-scale health insurance fraud case. The confluence of these issues has raised serious concerns among investors about the potential impact on the company\u2019s regional sales and overall financial performance.\n\nThe situation escalated with the arrest of Leon Wang, AstraZeneca\u2019s Executive Vice President International and China President. This development, coupled with internal forecasts predicting a downturn in sales within the Chinese market, has prompted a sharp investor reaction, culminating in the legal action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe AstraZeneca Securities Class Action Suit\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that AstraZeneca issued \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d and withheld crucial information regarding the company\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory risks in China. The complaint specifically accuses AstraZeneca of engaging in insurance fraud, facing heightened legal exposure that led to Mr. Wang\u2019s detention, understating the risks associated with its Chinese operations, and failing to disclose the potential for these issues to significantly harm its business and finances in the region.\n\nThe truth allegedly began to emerge in late October. On October 30, AstraZeneca announced that Mr. Wang was cooperating with a Chinese investigation, offering few details. This initial announcement triggered a 3 percent drop in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nThe situation worsened on November 5, when Yicai, a Chinese business news outlet, reported that dozens of AstraZeneca China executives were implicated in the investigation, with some potentially facing lengthy prison sentences. The report, citing an industry insider, attributed the alleged compliance issues to \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on sales representatives to meet aggressive sales targets. This news sent AstraZeneca\u2019s stock down another 7 percent.\n\nOn November 12, AstraZeneca confirmed Mr. Wang\u2019s detention and disclosed that the Chinese investigation encompassed allegations of medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation, and breaches of personal information.\n\nMore recently, on December 18, The Financial Times reported that AstraZeneca executives anticipate a decline in Chinese revenue due to the arrests of Mr. Wang and other senior executives. The report quoted an AstraZeneca executive who stated that \u201cdoctors are unwilling to interact with our salespeople and prescribe our medicines\u201d following the investigation, precipitating a further nearly 4 percent decline in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nHagens Berman Investigation\n\nThese events have prompted shareholder rights firm to open an investigation in the allegations.\n\n\u201cShould the allegations be confirmed, it suggests AstraZeneca misled investors about the true extent of its exposure in China, a failure with potentially serious consequences,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, an attorney leading the firm's investigation.\n\nIf you invested in AstraZeneca and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the AstraZeneca investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding AstraZeneca should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.

Datroway can be given to those who have undergone prior lines of chemotherapy and endocrine-based therapy.\n\nDatroway will cost nearly $4,900 per vial, Reuters reported. The treatment will hit U.S. shelves in approximately two weeks, according to Daiichi Sankyo\u2019s announcement of the approval.\n\nIn a note to investors on Tuesday morning, analysts at Leerink Partners predicted that with its current indication, Datroway will achieve \u201cmodest peak revenues\u201d of approximately $540 million worldwide. \u201cWe think that Datroway in HR+ breast cancer will be relegated to the third line and beyond as the HR+ breast cancer treatment paradigm evolves,\u201d the analysts continued.\n\nIn this setting, however, Datroway would compete with the partners\u2019 own Enhertu, which is approved for patients with low HER2 expression. In this subpopulation, Datroway would likely be relegated as a fourth- or fifth-line treatment, the Leerink analysts wrote, adding that \u201cwe see greater room for Datroway in HR+/HER2 null\u201d patients.\n\nIn particular, Leerink sees a greater opportunity for Datroway in triple-negative breast cancer, for which AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo are anticipating a readout in the first half of this year.\n\nDatroway\u2019s approval on Friday was based on data from Phase III TROPION-Breast01 study, which in October 2023 found that the ADC elicited significant improvements in median progression-free survival. Compared with the investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy, Datroway cut the risk of death or disease progression by 37% in patients with HR-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer, an efficacy estimate that the pharma partners at the time labeled as \u201cstatistically significant and clinically meaningful.\u201d\n\nHowever, in a follow-up readout posted in September 2024, the companies announced that Datroway failed to significantly improve overall survival in this patient population.\n\nDatroway is an intravenously administered ADC that makes use of an anti-TROP2 antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. TROP2 is a signaling protein that is commonly highly expressed in several cancers, and by specifically seeking out and binding to this target, Datroway brings its toxic payload close to malignant cells.\n\nFor AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo, Datroway is an asset that holds a lot of promise, especially as they try to secure a foothold for the drug in two particularly lucrative cancer niches: breast cancer and lung cancer. According to a report form Evaluate earlier this month, the ADC could be the second-largest drug launch of 2025, with sales potentially hitting $5.9 billion by 2030.\n\nThe road has been rough for the asset, however. In addition to failing to improve overall survival in breast cancer, the companies reported in May 2024 that the ADC was similarly unable to boost overall survival in a Phase III trial in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This late-stage failure forced the partners to pull a regulatory filing for Datroway in non-squamous NSCLC a few months later.\n\nA new Biologics License Application in NSCLC is currently being reviewed by the FDA, with a decision expected in the third quarter of this year.",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo\u2019s Datroway for use in people with a common type of breast cancer that has advanced despite two earlier lines of treatment.\n\nDatroway, previously known as datopotamab deruxtecan or dato dxd, is cleared for people whose breast tumors are HR-positive and HER2-negative, where in testing it was associated with a 37% reduction in the risk of progression or death compared to chemotherapy. Datroway will compete in that setting with Gilead Sciences\u2019 Trodelvy, which gained a similar approval in 2023.\n\nA targeted type of cancer medicine called an antibody-drug conjugate, Datroway has struggled to show a clear benefit in lung cancer and, in breast tumors, hasn\u2019t yet proven it can help people live longer. Nonetheless, AstraZeneca is still optimistic about Datroway\u2019s potential, featuring Datroway among 20 drugs that can help the company achieve $80 billion in annual sales.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nDatroway\u2019s clearance has come in the most common form of breast cancer, which has historically been initially treated with hormone-blocking treatments and chemotherapy but, in recent years, has become a setting for more precise medicines like CDK 4/6 inhibitors and ADCs. Under the FDA approval, Datroway will be used in the third-line setting, following hormone drugs and chemotherapy.\n\nThe drug has a list price of about $4,891 per vial, according to an AstraZeneca spokesperson. It\u2019s administered once every three weeks, though the dose given depends on a patient\u2019s weight.\n\nThe clearance finally enables Datroway to break into the U.S. market, despite questions about its sales potential. Already, mixed study results have led AstraZeneca and Daiichi to narrow their approval plans in lung cancer, one of the most lucrative markets in oncology. Now, the lack of a clear survival benefit in the drug\u2019s prescribing information and the occurrence of a type of treatment-related lung scarring may give Gilead\u2019s Trodelvy a few advantages, wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams.\n\nAdditionally, the evolving treatment landscape in HR-positive breast cancer could relegate Datroway to the \u201cthird line and beyond,\u201d as even the second-line setting is becoming increasingly segmented into tumors with specific genetic alterations, wrote Leerink Partners analyst Andrew Berens. Berens expects the drug to generate about $540 million in peak annual sales through its current indication.\n\nA bigger market opportunity may await in more aggressive \u201ctriple negative\u201d tumors, for which clinical results are expected around the middle of the year. There, Datroway could end up competing with Trodelvy as well.\n\nGilead\u2019s drug generated about $960 million in sales through the first nine months of 2024.",

Completed in just six months, the car shade project supports AstraZeneca's Ambition Zero Carbon program and integrates four electric vehicle charging stations for staff and visitors, further showcasing AstraZeneca's commitment to clean energy innovation.\n\nAnastasi Kotoros, Project Lead from EPC, Smart Commercial Solar, highlighted the importance of choosing the right hardware for commercial installs:\n\n\"With a focus on functional design and efficiency, Trinasolar's bifacial modules allow sunlight to pass through and increase yield from reflected rays. Trinasolar's hardware was a natural choice for this installation. With the cutting-edge, modern glass panelling enabled us to create a practical, user-friendly solar car park that perfectly complements AstraZeneca's sustainability goals.\"\n\nEdison Zhou, Group Director of Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan, Trinasolar Asia Pacific, expressed his enthusiasm for the project and acknowledged the expertise of the Smart Commercial team as a key to the project's success:\n\n\"It's always exciting to see large-scale rooftop car park installations come to life, especially when they deliver on both exceptional performance and sleek aesthetics. This installation not only provides much-needed shade in the hotter months but also contributes to AstraZeneca's ambitious sustainability targets. The collaboration with Smart Commercial Solar has resulted in a high-quality, visually impressive system that will deliver meaningful energy savings for AstraZeneca for years to come.\"\n\nThe project's benefits go beyond energy savings. On a global scale, AstraZeneca aims to reduce its scope one and two energy emissions by 98% by the end of 2025. The Macquarie Park carpark installation is a tangible step towards achieving this target. Additionally, by powering four EV chargers, the project supports AstraZeneca's transition to electric vehicles, offering real savings to our both employees and visitors alike.\n\nThe collaboration exemplifies Trinasolar and Smart Commercial Solar's shared commitment to driving renewable energy adoption in Australia. By combining Trinasolar's high-efficiency solar technology and on-ground support with Smart Commercial Solar's design and installation expertise, the project sets a gold standard for rooftop solar installations, an increasingly popular solution for organisations striving to meet their sustainability goals.",

Credit: Nadezhda Fedrunova via Getty Images.\n\nAstraZeneca has received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, Calquence (acalabrutinib), for first-line use in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).\n\nThis approval makes Calquence the first BTK inhibitor available for adults with untreated MCL who are unsuitable for autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and allows its use in combination with chemoimmunotherapy.\n\nThe FDA granted approval based on data from the Phase III ECHO trial (NCT02972840). The randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 598 patients aged 65 or older with untreated MCL who were unsuitable for HSCT. Patients were randomised to receive Calquence with chemotherapy bendamustine and Biogen and Genentech\u2019s Rituxan (rituximab) or placebo plus bendamustine and Rituxan.\n\nEfficacy was measured by progression-free survival (PFS) and evaluated by an independent review committee. The median PFS was 66.4 months in the Calquence plus BR arm, compared to 49.6 months in the placebo plus bendamustine and Rituxan arm. The trial demonstrated a 27% improvement in PFS for Calquence over placebo.\n\nMCL is a rare and aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, often diagnosed in later stages and characterised by the malignant transformation of B lymphocytes in the lymph node mantle zone. Calquence, a next-generation selective and irreversible BTK inhibitor, binds covalently to the BTK active site to inhibit enzymatic activity, suppressing the proliferation and survival of malignant B cells.\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s Calquence now holds a first-mover advantage in the treatment-naive MCL market, outpacing competitors such as BeiGene\u2019s Brukinsa (zanubrutinib), Eli Lilly\u2019s Jaypirca (pirtobrutinib), InnoCare\u2019s Inokai (orelabrutinib), all of which remain in late-stage clinical trials for this indication. AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s (J&J\u2019s) Imbruvica (ibrutinib) was previously positioned to lead the market but lost its accelerated approval in 2023 after the Phase III SHINE trial (NCT01776840) showed no overall survival benefit and a 7% increase in mortality risk for Imbruvica-treated patients.\n\nGlobalData projects that Calquence could generate up to $4.7bn in sales by 2030. With this FDA approval, AstraZeneca is poised to capitalise on its lead in the competitive BTK inhibitor market.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Pharmaceutical Technology.",

            "content": "A targeted cancer therapy from AstraZeneca\u2019s alliance with Daiichi Sankyo is now FDA approved to treat certain cases of advanced breast cancer, giving the British pharmaceutical giant another product to fill out an oncology portfolio that\u2019s a key part of its revenue growth strategy.\n\nThe regulatory decision announced late Friday covers the treatment of adults with advanced cases of breast cancer that is HR positive and HER2 negative and cannot be removed by surgery. Also, these cancers must have advanced or spread following treatment with an endocrine-based therapy and chemotherapy. The drug, known in development as datopotamab deruxtecan, or Dato-DXd, will be marketed under the brand name Datroway.\n\nDatroway is part of a class of therapies called antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), which are made by linking a toxic chemotherapy payload to a targeting antibody. The target of Datroway is TROP2, a protein abundant on the surface of many types of cancer cells, including breast cancer cells.\n\nThe AstraZeneca/Daiichi Sankyo drug was evaluated in an open-label Phase 3 study that enrolled 732 patients with advanced breast cancer. Study participants were randomly assigned to receive the study drug or chemotherapy. The main goals were measuring progression-free survival and overall survival. Results showed median progression-free survival of 6.9 months in the Datroway arm compared with 4.9 months in the chemotherapy arm, which was enough to be statistically significant. But Datroway fell short of statistical significance on the measure of overall survival, with a median 18.6 months in the study drug arm compared with 18.3 months for those treated with chemo.\n\nAstraZeneca already markets an ADC for breast cancer. Enhertu was initially approved in 2019 as a treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer. The ADC\u2019s approval later expanded to include HER2-low metastatic breast cancer and HER2-positive non-small cell lung cancer. Last year, the FDA approved Enhertu for treating solid tumors regardless of where they\u2019re found in the body as long as they express HER2. AstraZeneca has set a goal bringing to market at least 20 new drugs by 2030, growing annual revenue to $80 billion. The company said Datroway is now the eighth new medicine for its 2030 goal.\n\n\u201cWith this first approval of Datroway in the U.S., we continue to deliver on our ambition for antibody drug conjugates to improve upon and replace conventional chemotherapy for the treatment of multiple cancers,\u201d Dave Fredrickson, executive vice president, oncology hematology business unit, AstraZeneca, said in a prepared statement.\n\nBiopharma information services firm Citeline included Datroway in its report on key potential drug launches for 2025. The drug\u2019s Phase 3 results are comparable to those of Trodelvy, a TROP2-targeting ADC marketed by Gilead Sciences as a second-line treatment for HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, the report said. But Datroway\u2019s results come up short compared with Enhertu.\n\nSponsored Post How to Improve Employee Benefits While Reducing Insurance Costs Balancing healthcare benefits and insurance costs requires research. From becoming a Difference Card member to offering wellness resources, there are many ways to improve healthcare at low cost.\n\nThe Citeline report also noted one treatment-related death in the Datroway trial. Given that patients with advanced breast cancer have other treatment options, the potential safety risks could place the drug lower on a physicians\u2019 lists of available therapies, Citeline said. For those reasons, Datroway is unlikely to stand out as a leader in this setting and is expected to get a small piece of market share, the report said.\n\n[Update: Paragraph added with analyst comments.] Leerink Partners projects Datroway could achieve $540 million in peak sales worldwide. In a research note sent to investors Tuesday, analyst Andrew Berens said the firm thinks the drug will be relegated to third-line use and beyond in HR-positive breast cancer as the treatment paradigm in this type of breast cancer evolves. But Datroway may find a larger role in treating triple negative breast cancer, for which Gilead\u2019s Trodelvy is already approved, Berens said. Though this indication is a smaller market, it drives most of Trodelvy\u2019s revenue. Data for Datroway in triple negative breast cancer are expected in the second quarter of this year.\n\nDatroway won regulatory approval in Japan last month for HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. AstraZeneca said submissions in breast cancer are still under regulatory review in Europe and China, among other markets. The company is also seeking to expand use of the drug to other cancers. Last week, the FDA accepted an application seeking approval of the ADC for EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. A regulatory decision in this indication is expected in the third quarter of this year.\n\nPublic domain image by the National Cancer Institute",

A widening investigation by China regulators into alleged illegal drug imports, data breaches, and potential health insurance fraud has cast a shadow over the company\u2019s prospects in a critical market, triggering a securities class action lawsuit in the United States.\n\nHagens Berman has opened an investigation into the allegations and urges investors in AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 23, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 17, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Feb. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/azn\n\nContact the Firm Now: AZN@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895\n\nProbe Into AstraZeneca\u2019s China Operations\n\nThe probe conducted by China regulators, which reportedly centers on allegations that AstraZeneca employees improperly imported cancer medications like Enhertu and Imjudo from Hong Kong into mainland China and mishandled patient data, has been compounded by a broader investigation into a large-scale health insurance fraud case. The confluence of these issues has raised serious concerns among investors about the potential impact on the company\u2019s regional sales and overall financial performance.\n\nThe situation escalated with the arrest of Leon Wang, AstraZeneca\u2019s Executive Vice President International and China President. This development, coupled with internal forecasts predicting a downturn in sales within the Chinese market, has prompted a sharp investor reaction, culminating in the legal action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe AstraZeneca Securities Class Action Suit\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that AstraZeneca issued \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d and withheld crucial information regarding the company\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory risks in China. The complaint specifically accuses AstraZeneca of engaging in insurance fraud, facing heightened legal exposure that led to Mr. Wang\u2019s detention, understating the risks associated with its Chinese operations, and failing to disclose the potential for these issues to significantly harm its business and finances in the region.\n\nThe truth allegedly began to emerge in late October. On October 30, AstraZeneca announced that Mr. Wang was cooperating with a Chinese investigation, offering few details. This initial announcement triggered a 3 percent drop in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nThe situation worsened on November 5, when Yicai, a Chinese business news outlet, reported that dozens of AstraZeneca China executives were implicated in the investigation, with some potentially facing lengthy prison sentences. The report, citing an industry insider, attributed the alleged compliance issues to \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on sales representatives to meet aggressive sales targets. This news sent AstraZeneca\u2019s stock down another 7 percent.\n\nOn November 12, AstraZeneca confirmed Mr. Wang\u2019s detention and disclosed that the Chinese investigation encompassed allegations of medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation, and breaches of personal information.\n\nMore recently, on December 18, The Financial Times reported that AstraZeneca executives anticipate a decline in Chinese revenue due to the arrests of Mr. Wang and other senior executives. The report quoted an AstraZeneca executive who stated that \u201cdoctors are unwilling to interact with our salespeople and prescribe our medicines\u201d following the investigation, precipitating a further nearly 4 percent decline in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nHagens Berman Investigation\n\nThese events have prompted shareholder rights firm to open an investigation in the allegations.\n\n\u201cShould the allegations be confirmed, it suggests AstraZeneca misled investors about the true extent of its exposure in China, a failure with potentially serious consequences,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, an attorney leading the firm's investigation.\n\nIf you invested in AstraZeneca and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now.\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the AstraZeneca investigation, read more.\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding AstraZeneca should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

Per the terms of the partnership, both companies are jointly responsible for developing and marketing the drugs worldwide, except Japan, where Daiichi maintains exclusive rights for both. Daiichi is also responsible for the manufacturing and supply of both Enhertu and Datroway.\n\nAZN and partner Daiichi are currently evaluating Datroway in an extensive clinical development program as both a monotherapy and in combination with other drugs across multiple cancer indications, including breast and lung cancers. This includes seven late-stage programs across lung cancer indications and five in breast cancer.\n\nLast week, management announced that a regulatory filing was granted priority review by the FDA, seeking approval for Datroway to treat adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A final decision is expected in third-quarter 2025. The drug was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA in this indication last month.\n\nADCs like Enhertu and Datroway are being considered disruptive innovations in the pharmaceutical industry as these will enable better treatment of cancer by harnessing the targeting power of antibodies to deliver cytotoxic molecule drugs to tumors.",

(Credit: David Porter/AstraZeneca)\n\nAstraZeneca has received the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Calquence (acalabrutinib) in combination with chemoimmunotherapy to treat adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).\n\nThe chemoimmunotherapy comprises bendamustine and rituximab.\n\nCalquence is a second-generation, selective inhibitor of Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK), which plays a key role in B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion.\n\nThe BTK-inhibitor plus chemoimmunotherapy is indicated for adults with previously untreated MCL who are not eligible for stem cell transplantation.\n\nThe US health agency approved the Calquence combination based on results from the Phase 3 ECHO trial, after granting Priority Review in October last year.\n\nIn the Phase 3 trial, Calquence plus bendamustine and rituximab reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 27% compared to standard-of-care chemoimmunotherapy.\n\nCalquence plus chemoimmunotherapy combination showed a median PFS of 66.4 months, compared to 49.6 months with chemoimmunotherapy alone.\n\nIn the study, Calquence showed a safety and tolerability profile consistent with its known safety profile, with no new safety signals found.\n\nThe US FDA reviewed the regulatory submission for Calquence plus chemoimmunotherapy under its Project Orbis initiative.\n\nThe combination is also being reviewed by regulatory authorities in Australia, Canada, and Switzerland for the same indication, as part of Project Orbis.\n\nAstraZeneca oncology haematology business unit executive vice-president Dave Fredrickson said: \u201cWith today\u2019s approval, Calquence provides a critical new treatment option to mantle cell lymphoma patients in the US, with Calquence proven to deliver nearly one and a half years of additional time without disease progression.\n\n\u201cThis approval brings a new and effective treatment option to those living with this disease and further reinforces our belief in Calquence as a backbone therapy across multiple blood cancers.\u201d\n\nIn a separate development, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo secured FDA approval for Datroway (datopotamab deruxtecan or Dato-DXd) to treat a type of breast cancer.\n\nDatroway is a specifically engineered TROP2-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by Daiichi Sankyo and jointly developed by AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo.\n\nThe drug was designed using Daiichi Sankyo\u2019s unique DXd ADC Technology and contains a humanised anti-TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody.\n\nDatroway is indicated for adults with unresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who received prior treatment.\n\nFDA approved the drug based on results from the Phase 3 TROPION-Breast01 clinical trial.\n\nIn the Phase 3 trial, Datroway significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 37% compared to the investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy.\n\nThe improvement was assessed by a blinded independent central review (BICR).\n\nDatroway showed a safety profile that was consistent with the known profile of the drug with no new safety concerns identified.\n\nFredrickson said: \u201cWith this first approval of Datroway in the US, we continue to deliver on our ambition for antibody-drug conjugates to improve upon and replace conventional chemotherapy for the treatment of multiple cancers.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to bring Datroway to people living with metastatic HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, and this approval marks the eighth new medicine of the 20 we have set out to deliver across AstraZeneca by 2030.\u201d",

            "content": "AstraZeneca\u2019s Fasenra (benralizumab), with its highly anticipated Phase III data to be showcased at the 2025 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, is set to transform the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment. As the first IL-5-targeting monoclonal antibody in late-stage trials, Fasenra targets eosinophilic inflammation, potentially reshaping treatment standards and reinforcing AstraZeneca\u2019s leadership in respiratory and immunology innovations for this unmet medical need, according to GlobalData, a analytics company.\n\nCOPD, a progressive condition affecting millions globally, has historically relied on inhaled therapies. However, biologics like Dupixent (dupilumab) have paved the way for a new treatment paradigm, targeting specific inflammatory pathways to reduce exacerbations and improve patient outcomes. Fasenra, already approved for severe asthma, builds on this progress with its ability to address eosinophilic inflammation, a key driver in a subset of COPD patients.\n\n\u201cFasenra offers a more targeted approach to treatment. With its innovative mechanism of action and established success in asthma, Fasenra could address critical safety and efficacy gaps, bringing new hope to patients with eosinophilic COPD,\u201d Asiyah Nawab, Healthcare Analyst at GlobalData, said.\n\nAlso Read Sanofi to increase competition in atopic dermatitis market after Dupixent\u2019s success\n\nAccording to GlobalData, the success of Dupixent has demonstrated the viability of biologics in COPD, setting the stage for competitors like Fasenra to expand the treatment landscape. Fasenra\u2019s ability to reduce eosinophilic inflammation positions it to address a previously unmet need for patients who experience more severe symptoms and frequent exacerbations.\n\nNawab continues: \u201cBiologics are a game-changer in COPD. The challenge lies in identifying the right patient phenotypes, but with studies like RESOLUTE focusing on eosinophil counts, the potential for Fasenra to enter clinical practice is substantial. If the Phase III data delivers as expected, it will be a landmark moment in COPD care.\u201d\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s respiratory and immunology portfolio is driving significant growth, with R&I assets forecasted to account for 50% of the company\u2019s total revenue by 2030. Key contributors include Breztri Aerosphere, a triple-combination inhaler, and Fasenra, both of which are undergoing indication expansions to serve broader patient populations.\n\nThe company reported a 20% revenue increase in the US market in 2024, with R&I achieving 39% growth in Q4 alone. These figures underscore AstraZeneca\u2019s leadership in leveraging biologics to address chronic diseases and unmet medical needs.\n\nWhile biologics hold significant promise, hurdles remain, including the need to identify optimal patient subsets and the competitive pricing landscape. With the US capping inhaler prices at $35, competition between biologics and inhaled therapies is likely to intensify. However, biologics offering novel mechanisms of action, reduced dosing schedules, and improved outcomes are expected to capture a significant share of the moderate-to-severe COPD market segment.\n\nAlso Read Gene therapy exempted from GST; duty cuts on critical medicines for cancer and rare diseases expected\n\n\u201cWith Fasenra and Breztri, AstraZeneca is well-positioned to dominate the evolving COPD market. GlobalData projects that, if approved, Fasenra could generate $1.28 billion in US sales by 2033, based on the COPD in Major Markets, Disease Management, Epidemiology, Pipeline Assessment, Unmet Needs and Drug Forecast to 2033 report. The upcoming Phase III data for Fasenra will be pivotal, not only for AstraZeneca\u2019s growth but for advancing treatment options for millions of patients worldwide. As the COPD market continues to evolve, biologics like Fasenra are at the forefront of transforming treatment paradigms. AstraZeneca\u2019s leadership and innovation in this space offer hope for improved outcomes in a disease that remains a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality,\u201d Nawab added.",

A 'walking miracle', in Kate's words.\n\nHe is far from the same man, however. His vision is impaired, he can no longer hold down his high-flying software engineer job, drive a car, or follow complex conversations.\n\nThe toll it has taken on the family has required a huge amount of adjustment. To make matters worse, it has been unfolding against a backdrop in which the Scotts \u2013 and the dozens of others like them who have lost loved ones or watched them battle grievous consequences following an adverse reaction to the Covid vaccine \u2013 feel they have been silenced.\n\n'I have had people stop talking to me and walk away when I describe what happened to Jamie,' Kate says. 'If I said he'd had a bike accident, I think people would always say how sorry they were. But with this, people either question whether it's true or just don't want to talk about it. It's such a taboo subject; our circle of family and friends is much smaller because of it, which has been hard to come to terms with. It's the same for many in our position. We've been made to feel like an uncomfortable truth.'\n\nJamie Scott with his wife Kate. Jamie suffered a catastrophic bleed on the brain after being given the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine\n\nJamie Scott had to fight for his life after receiving the vaccine\n\nA vial of the AstraZeneca/Oxford Covid-19 vaccine is pictured at the Lochee Health Centre in Dundee on January 4, 2021\n\nEqually difficult to navigate, she says, is the Government's compensation scheme (known as the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme, or VDPS), currently limited to a payout of just \u00a3120,000 \u2013 and even then, only when those affected have gone through a draconian process in which they are judged on whether they meet 'the threshold' for payment, a brutally specific figure of '60 per cent or more disabled'.\n\nThe severity of Jamie's condition means that he easily met that criteria \u2013 a bittersweet moment for Kate, who says she 'cried and cried' when receiving the news over the phone.\n\n'Because now it's been confirmed in black and white that the vaccine caused his injury, and he's 60 per cent disabled, and that is our 'win'. But it's not a win, is it? That's our life now. And \u00a3120,000 doesn't touch the sides of what we have lost in terms of income, and will lose over the decades to come.'\n\nIt is one reason that Kate has fought so passionately for the voices of vaccine victims to be heard at the ongoing Covid-19 Inquiry, a desire which was fulfilled last week when, on Wednesday, she gave evidence for half an hour on their behalf.\n\n'It's not even enough time to tell my story, never mind do justice to others, but it's all I have,' she told me as we speak before she enters the witness box, where she went on to talk with dignity about her experience and that of other families.\n\nNaturally intensely private, Kate has struggled to cope with juggling her grief and becoming a campaigner and spokeswoman. Yet she feels she has no choice but to step into the limelight to make the case on behalf of vaccine-damaged families.\n\n'At the inquiry the lead counsel said it is accepted that with any medicine, including vaccines, there's injury and death,' she says. 'But after what we've been through, the question is, how many is unacceptable? Because we know that 13,000 people have applied for the compensation scheme, and we know that 250,000 have reported an adverse reaction. So at what point does it tip over to becoming unacceptable? And if it is acceptable, why is it not accepted that there should be a fair and adequate compensation scheme?'\n\nKate Scott has met with Health Secretary Wes Streeting (pictured), who has since written to Kate informing her he has commissioned officials to look into options to reform the current compensation scheme and 'potential legislative change'\n\nThese are big questions, and ones Kate would never once have expected to ask \u2013 although, as she says, that is partly the point.\n\n'What happened to Jamie could have, and has, happened to anyone,' she says.\n\nKate met Jamie ten years ago when, as a business studies student on a sandwich course year, she moved into the professional house share in Reading where Jamie was living.\n\n'I had the smallest room. He had the room with the en suite, so that was me sold,' she smiles. James was 12 years her senior, but they 'clicked' straight away. 'Friends used to take the mickey out of how happy we were,' she says. 'We were always laughing.'\n\nThey travelled together and lived in Australia before returning to the UK, settling in the West Midlands. Their eldest son was a honeymoon baby. 'We went from a fantastic wedding to a family and our first house together,' Kate says.\n\nAn active, fit 40-something, James was rarely ill.\n\n'He didn't take any medicine, never took any sick days from work. He had a very high stress job, but was just cool as a cucumber and calm with it all the time.'\n\nWhen Covid hit, like many, Jamie's thoughts first turned not to himself but his elderly father and, in April 2021, he went to his local GP clinic for his jab.\n\n'He didn't need it for himself, like most of us he did what he thought was the right thing. He thought it was safe and effective and would protect others,' Kate says.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time, the Government was promoting the AstraZeneca vaccine, developed at the University of Oxford, which earlier that month the European Medicine's Agency had concluded came with the 'rare side effect' of unusual blood clots. 'Jamie had read something about it somewhere and did ask for the Pfizer vaccine, but he was told they didn't have any and he would be fine,' says Kate. 'He didn't get any patient information.'\n\nBusy family and professional life went on as normal \u2013 until ten days later James awoke complaining of tiredness. 'I remember being a bit annoyed with him, as it was meant to be my turn to have a lie-in,' she says.\n\nWithin an hour, however, it was obvious something was deeply wrong: James started retching and could no longer speak. 'The sounds he was making is something I'll never forget,' she says. Kate called an ambulance, and Jamie was taken to a small local hospital where, in an astonishing fluke, medics had been issued with a diagnostic chart for vaccine-related illness, and quickly suspected Vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT).\n\n'It saved his life,' she says. 'I think if he had gone to one of the bigger hospitals he would have been left for a while, but at our local hospital the communication had come through, whoever was on that day had seen it and, within 15 minutes, he was blue lighted to University Hospital Coventry, where he was able to start treatment. By this time he was non-communicative.\n\n'In my opinion, everyone who presented with new injuries in hospital should have been asked: 'Did you have the vaccine recently?' And it was a question that wasn't, in many cases, allowed to be asked. Thank God it was for Jamie.'\n\nWithin hours, Jamie was moved again, this time to Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital, where surgeons battled to save his life from what proved to be a catastrophic bleed on the brain.\n\nThe surgery was a success, but Jamie was still at death's door: on three occasions, Kate was called in to say her goodbyes at his bedside, one of the few times she was actually allowed to see him because of Covid restrictions in place at the time.\n\nHe was in a coma for five weeks, and Kate was warned he might never walk or talk again and that he might have lost his memory.\n\n'The doctors thought he might not remember our youngest because he was only a few months old when it happened, but when Jamie woke up he looked at a photo of him and just cried. He'd remembered us and it was amazing.'\n\nOn returning home four months later after extensive rehabilition, Jamie had to confront the life he had now left behind \u2013 he can no longer work or do most of the things he once took for granted.\n\n'He can't multitask at all which he finds extremely difficult to accept,' says Kate. 'He can't run or ride a bike. Because we live in a nice rural place, that means he can't go anywhere on his own or take our children anywhere independently.'\n\nHer own life has changed enormously too \u2013 Kate has had to give up her job in business to juggle childcare and Jamie's endless medical appointments. She now works a few hours a week for a catering company just to give herself a break.\n\n'I realised the other day, in the last few years, I've not had a single day in the house on my own, because everybody needs me. Our world went from being our oyster, from very big and exciting to very, very small and actually very lonely.'\n\nJamie, certainly, has had to undergo a process of grieving for the man he was.\n\n\n\n\n\nKate says: 'We've been talking a lot about it recently and he told me: 'I feel so unconfident in everything in my life.' His biggest fear is he can't provide for his family now.'\n\nTheir sons, in turn, have had to cope with a father profoundly changed from the one they knew. 'Our eldest watched daddy walk down the stairs three years ago then not come home for 125 days \u2013 and when he did come home, he was different,' she says.\n\n'He is so kind and empathetic, but it confuses him. The youngest was just a baby, but if he's separated from either of us, he's frightened that something's going to happen, and it must be innate from what happened.'\n\nNone of this means Kate isn't incredibly grateful for Jamie's survival \u2013 more than once, she describes them as 'the luckiest of unlucky people'.\n\n'Every day I am filled with profound gratitude that he is alive.'\n\nThat gratitude, however, is matched by her anger at the injustice she feels has been meted out to vaccine victims, so often subject to stigma.\n\n'I've tried to be compassionate about it,' she says of people's discomfort. 'I think it's because Covid touched everyone. But it angers me that even now I have to say we're not anti-vaccine. You can say the vaccine rollout saved lives while also saying lives were damaged, both things can be true. But people seem to struggle to accept that.'\n\nShe hopes the inquiry will help with this disconnect.\n\n'We want a legacy for those who died or have been injured so that, with any vaccine rollout programmes in the future, whatever they are, we know that if someone suffers they won't have to go through this and there will be a fair and adequate compensation scheme.'\n\nTo that end, along with other victims she has also met with Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who has since written to Kate informing her he has commissioned officials to look into options to reform the current compensation scheme and 'potential legislative change'.\n\n'I am grateful that he has done what he has said he will do so far and, in my latest reply to him, we've asked for an update from Easter,' she says.\n\nLast week, it emerged that the payment scheme has cost taxpayers more to run than it has paid out to victims \u2013 a key reminder, says Kate, that urgent reform is needed.\n\n'The fact they are paying more money in administration and rejecting victims than they are in compensation itself tells you how they are putting money in the wrong place,' she says.\n\nNothing is likely to happen quickly, of course, and there are parallels with the Post Office scandal, which saw innocent victims fighting a government machine for compensation but also, perhaps equally crucially, for some official recognition of what they had been through.\n\nIt's a sentiment Kate recognises only too well. 'I think Jamie would like someone in authority to say: 'Sorry this happened to you.' Sorry \u2013 a small word but a very powerful one.'",

The company has consistently beaten aggressive roadmap timelines, secured a major $54.5M Air Force Research Lab contract, and established partnerships with heavyweights like pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca and engineering simulation software leader Ansys.\n\nWhile quantum computing stocks are notoriously speculative, IonQ's manufacturing facility opening and modular multicore architecture as a potential path to scaling suggest the company has a credible shot at capturing a meaningful share of the vast and potentially unparalleled quantum computing market.\n\nSuperconducting quantum pioneer\n\nRigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) takes a distinctive approach to quantum computing, focusing on superconducting technology and vertical integration. Unlike room-temperature trapped-ion systems, Rigetti's architecture leverages established semiconductor manufacturing processes at the company's dedicated Fab-1 quantum foundry, potentially offering advantages in scaling and gate speeds in the years ahead.\n\nWhile qubit count is one progress metric, Rigetti emphasizes gate fidelity as a key performance metric. The company's latest Ankaa-3 system achieves 99% median iSWAP gate fidelity and 99.5% median fidelity for fSim gates -- critical benchmarks that reflect the system's ability to perform reliable quantum operations with minimal errors, which is necessary for practical applications.\n\nBeyond the technical foundations, Rigetti's execution showcases strategic positioning. The company has secured its role as the quantum hardware provider for the U.K.'s National Quantum Computing Centre, established partnerships with financial leaders like HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank, and maintains strong ties with the Air Force Research Lab and Fermilab's SQMS Center.\n\nWhile quantum computing remains an emerging field with significant technological hurdles, including maintaining qubit coherence, Rigetti's full-stack approach and innovative multichip architecture, combined with flexible deployment options through major cloud platforms and the QCS Direct cloud service, suggest the company is well positioned to compete in the evolving quantum computing landscape.\n\nA quantum computing revolution\n\nAs quantum computing advances from research labs toward commercial reality, IonQ and Rigetti demonstrate the potential technological paths that could make quantum computing a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity. Each company combines innovative architectures with strategic partnerships and clear commercialization strategies that could provide paths to capturing market share.\n\nWhile the technology remains highly speculative and faces significant technical hurdles, companies that successfully scale their systems while maintaining high performance could deliver unprecedented returns. As these potential quantum leaders emerge, investors must monitor technical progress, partnership momentum, and execution against stated roadmaps.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in IonQ right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in IonQ, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and IonQ wasn\u2019t one of them.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than February 21, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) AstraZeneca engaged in insurance fraud in China; (2) as a result, AstraZeneca faced heightened legal exposure in China, which eventually resulted in the AstraZeneca China President being detained by Chinese law enforcement authorities; (3) as a result, AstraZeneca understated its legal risks; (4) the foregoing, once revealed, could materially harm AstraZeneca\u2019s business activities in China; and (5) as a result, defendants\u2019 statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the AstraZeneca class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=1331 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

            "content": "Today, a brief rundown of news involving Novo Nordisk and AstraZeneca, as well as updates from Amgen, Atara Biotherapeutics and Boehringer Ingelheim that you may have missed.\n\nA high-dose form of Novo Nordisk\u2019s obesity drug Wegovy, together with lifestyle intervention, led to greater weight loss over 72 weeks than the current approved dose, according to results from a Phase 3b study. Study participants given a 7.2 milligram dose of Wegovy lost, on average, 20.7% of their body weight, versus 17.5% among those on a 2.4 milligram dose and 2.4% for those on placebo. One-third of people on the high dose achieved greater than 25% weight loss. Detailed results will be presented at a scientific meeting in 2025, while data are expected from a second study of high-dose Wegovy within the next few months. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s drug Calquence on Friday won Food and Drug Administration approval for adults with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma who are ineligible for transplant. A rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, MCL is considered aggressive and often leads to relapse. Calquence\u2019s clearance was based on Phase 3 results that showed treatment alongside chemotherapy and Rituxan reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 27% compared to chemoimmunotherapy. Calquence is the first so-called BTK inhibitor approved for first-line treatment of MCL. \u2014 Delilah Alvarado\n\nThe FDA has approved Amgen's KRAS-blocking drug Lumakras for use treating colorectal cancer alongside Vectibix, an older drug sold by the biotechnology company. Use is limited to patients whose tumors express a specific mutation known as KRAS G12C, and who previously received chemotherapy. The FDA based its approval on study data that showed the combination extended progression-free survival by about three-and-a-half months. Lumakras is also approved for non-small cell lung cancer. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nAtara Biotherapeutics on Thursday said it is weighing a broader range of strategic options after the FDA rejected its experimental drug, Ebvallo, for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease associated with Epstein-Barr virus. According to Atara, the agency issued a complete response letter for issues at a third-party facility contracted to make Ebvallo. There were no citations related to Ebvallo\u2019s manufacturing process specifically, or its clinical safety or efficacy, Atara said. Together with partner Pierre Fabre Laboratories, Atara submitted Ebvallo, an allogeneic cell therapy, for use in adults and children two years or older who received at least one prior therapy for their disease. Atara is now working with Redmile Group to obtain up to $15 million to fund addressing the rejection and resubmitting Ebvallo. \u2014 Delilah Alvarado\n\nAn experimental Boehringer Ingelheim drug called iclepertin failed to improve cognition or function in adults with schizophrenia, the company said Thursday. Results from three late-stage trials showed treatment did not meet either the trial\u2019s primary or secondary goals versus placebo after six months. The study program, called CONNEX, enrolled 1,840 people across 41 countries. Full data will be presented at a future medical meeting, Boehringer said. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo",

            "content": "WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AstraZeneca\u2019s CALQUENCE\u00ae (acalabrutinib) in combination with bendamustine and rituximab has been approved in the US for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who are ineligible for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n\nThe approval was granted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after securing Priority Review. It was based on results from the ECHO Phase III trial which were presented at the European Hematology Association 2024 Congress.\n\nMCL is a rare and typically aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), often diagnosed at an advanced stage.1,2 It is estimated that there are more than 21,000 patients diagnosed with MCL in the US, UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Japan and China.3\n\nMichael Wang, MD, Puddin Clarke Endowed Professor, Director of Mantle Cell Lymphoma Program of Excellence and principal investigator in the trial, said: \u201cManaging this aggressive cancer requires maximizing efficacy while maintaining tolerability, especially for elderly patients. Results from the pivotal ECHO trial highlight the promise of the acalabrutinib combination in defining a new standard of care, with today\u2019s approval underscoring the transformative potential of this regimen as a first-line treatment for older patients with mantle cell lymphoma.\u201d\n\nDave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, AstraZeneca, said: \u201cWith today\u2019s approval, CALQUENCE provides a critical new treatment option to mantle cell lymphoma patients in the US, with CALQUENCE proven to deliver nearly one and a half years of additional time without disease progression. This approval brings a new and effective treatment option to those living with this disease and further reinforces our belief in CALQUENCE as a backbone therapy across multiple blood cancers.\u201d\n\nMeghan Gutierrez, Chief Executive Officer, Lymphoma Research Foundation, said: \u201cNew treatment options have long been needed in the first-line treatment of mantle cell lymphoma in the US. Patients with this rare and often aggressive cancer can experience severe symptoms by the time they are diagnosed - having an effective therapy that can significantly improve outcomes for patients early in the treatment process is a much-needed advancement.\u201d\n\nResults from the ECHO trial showed CALQUENCE plus bendamustine and rituximab reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 27% compared to standard-of-care chemoimmunotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-0.94; p=0.016). Median PFS was 66.4 months for patients treated with the CALQUENCE combination versus 49.6 months with chemoimmunotherapy alone.\n\nThis approval additionally converts CALQUENCE\u2019s accelerated approval to a full approval for adult patients with MCL treated with at least one prior therapy, as granted by the FDA in October 2017.\n\nThe ECHO trial enrolled patients throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. After censoring for COVID-19 deaths, PFS was further improved in both arms, with the CALQUENCE combination reducing the risk of disease progression or death by 36% (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.48-0.84). Although OS data were not mature at the time of the analysis, when censored for COVID-19, a favorable trend was seen for OS (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.53-1.04), despite 69% of patients in the chemoimmunotherapy arm receiving treatment with a BTK inhibitor on relapse or disease progression.\n\nThe safety and tolerability of CALQUENCE was consistent with its known safety profile, and no new safety signals were identified.\n\nThe US regulatory submission was reviewed under Project Orbis, which provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology medicines among participating international partners. As part of Project Orbis, CALQUENCE plus chemoimmunotherapy is also under review by regulatory authorities in Australia, Canada, and Switzerland for the same indication. Regulatory applications are also under review in the EU, Japan, and other countries based on the ECHO results.\n\nINDICATIONS AND USAGE\n\nCALQUENCE is a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor indicated in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who are ineligible for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy, and for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION ABOUT CALQUENCE\u00ae (acalabrutinib) tablets\n\nSerious and Opportunistic Infections\n\nFatal and serious infections, including opportunistic infections, have occurred in patients with hematologic malignancies treated with CALQUENCE.\n\nSerious or Grade 3 or higher infections (bacterial, viral, or fungal) occurred in 32% of 1,764 patients exposed to CALQUENCE in clinical trials, most often due to respiratory tract infections (19% of all patients, including pneumonia in 9%). These infections predominantly occurred in the absence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, with neutropenic infection reported in 2.7% of all patients. Opportunistic infections in recipients of CALQUENCE have included, but are not limited to, hepatitis B virus reactivation, fungal pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, Epstein-Barr virus reactivation, cytomegalovirus, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Consider prophylaxis in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat promptly.\n\nHemorrhage\n\nFatal and serious hemorrhagic events have occurred in patients treated with CALQUENCE. Major hemorrhage (serious or Grade 3 or higher bleeding or any central nervous system bleeding) occurred in 4.4% of patients, with fatal hemorrhage occurring in 0.2% of 1,764 patients exposed to CALQUENCE in clinical trials. Bleeding events of any grade, excluding bruising and petechiae, occurred in 40% of patients.\n\nUse of antithrombotic agents concomitantly with CALQUENCE may further increase the risk of hemorrhage. In clinical trials, major hemorrhage occurred in 7% of patients taking CALQUENCE without antithrombotic agents and 4% of patients taking CALQUENCE with antithrombotic agents. Consider the risks and benefits of antithrombotic agents when co-administered with CALQUENCE. Monitor patients for signs of bleeding.\n\nConsider the benefit-risk of withholding CALQUENCE for 3 to 7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.\n\nCytopenias\n\nCALQUENCE can cause Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias. Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias included absolute neutrophil count decreased (26%), platelets decreased (10%), hemoglobin decreased (10%), and absolute lymphocyte count decreased (10%) in patients treated with CALQUENCE alone or in combination with obinutuzumab; Grade 4 neutropenia developed in 14% of patients.\n\nMonitor complete blood counts regularly during treatment. Interrupt treatment, reduce the dose, or discontinue treatment as warranted.\n\nSecond Primary Malignancies\n\nSecond primary malignancies, including skin cancers and other solid tumors, occurred in 18% of 1,764 patients exposed to CALQUENCE in clinical trials. The most frequent second primary malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancer, reported in 10% of patients, followed by other solid tumors in 9% (including melanoma, lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancers, and genitourinary cancers) and hematologic malignancies (1%). Monitor patients for the development of second cancers and advise protection from sun exposure.\n\nCardiac Arrhythmias\n\nFatal and serious cardiac arrhythmias have occurred in patients treated with CALQUENCE. Grade 3 or 4 atrial fibrillation or flutter was reported in 2.6% of 1,764 patients treated with CALQUENCE, with all grades of atrial fibrillation or flutter reported in 7% of all patients. Grade 3 or higher ventricular arrhythmia events were reported in 0.6% of patients, including fatal cases in 0.3% of all patients. The risk of arrhythmias may be increased in patients with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, previous arrhythmias, and acute infection. Monitor for symptoms of arrhythmia (eg, palpitations, dizziness, syncope, dyspnea) and manage as appropriate.\n\nHepatotoxicity, Including Drug-Induced Liver Injury\n\nHepatotoxicity, including severe, life-threatening, and potentially fatal cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), has occurred in patients treated with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including CALQUENCE.\n\nEvaluate bilirubin and transaminases at baseline and throughout treatment with CALQUENCE. For patients who develop abnormal liver tests after CALQUENCE, monitor more frequently for liver test abnormalities and clinical signs and symptoms of hepatic toxicity. If DILI is suspected, withhold CALQUENCE. Upon confirmation of DILI, discontinue CALQUENCE.\n\nADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nPreviously Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u226515%) of any grade in patients with previously untreated MCL who received CALQUENCE plus BR were rash (47%), COVID-19 (38%), fatigue (37%), diarrhea (37%), pneumonia (31%), headache (31%), upper respiratory tract infection (30%), pyrexia (29%), cough (27%), vomiting (26%), constipation (25%), hemorrhage (20%), edema (20%), secondary primary malignancy (19%), dizziness (18%), arthralgia (18%), and dyspnea (17%).\n\nGrade 4 laboratory abnormalities in >15% of patients treated with CALQUENCE plus BR include lymphocytes decreased (26%), absolute neutrophils decreased (36%), and uric acid increased (17%).\n\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 69% of patients who received CALQUENCE plus BR. Serious adverse reactions reported in \u22652% of patients were pneumonia (23%; includes COVID-19 pneumonia), COVID-19 (20%; includes COVID-19 pneumonia), second primary malignancy (7%), pyrexia (6%), rash (3.4%), febrile neutropenia (3.4%), atrial fibrillation (3%), sepsis (2.7%), and anemia (2.4%). Fatal adverse reactions that occurred within 30 days of the last study treatment were reported in 12% who received CALQUENCE plus BR including COVID-19 (6%; includes COVID-19 pneumonia), pneumonia (1%), second primary malignancy (0.7%), sepsis (0.3%), and pneumonitis (0.3%).\n\nAdverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of CALQUENCE in 43%, dosage interruptions in 74%, and dosage reductions in 10% of patients. Adverse reactions that resulted in dosage modification in >10% included infections, cytopenias, rashes, and gastrointestinal toxicity. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of CALQUENCE in \u22654% of patients included COVID-19 (includes COVID-19 pneumonia) and neutropenia.\n\nPreviously Treated Mantle Cell Lymphoma\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) of any grade in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL exposed to CALQUENCE were anemia,* thrombocytopenia,* headache (39%), neutropenia,* diarrhea (31%), fatigue (28%), myalgia (21%), and bruising (21%). The most common Grade \u22653 non-hematological adverse reaction (reported in at least 2% of patients) was diarrhea (3.2%).\n\n*Treatment-emergent decreases (all grades) of hemoglobin (46%), platelets (44%), and neutrophils (36%) were based on laboratory measurements and adverse reactions.\n\nDose reductions or discontinuations due to any adverse reaction were reported in 1.6% and 6.5% of patients, respectively. Increases in creatinine to 1.5 to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 4.8% of patients.\n\nChronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u226530%) of any grade in patients with CLL exposed to CALQUENCE were anemia,* neutropenia,* thrombocytopenia,* headache, upper respiratory tract infection, and diarrhea.\n\n*Treatment-emergent decreases (all grades) of hemoglobin, platelets, and neutrophils were based on laboratory measurements and adverse reactions.\n\nIn patients with previously untreated CLL exposed to CALQUENCE, fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and with onset within 30 days of the last study treatment were reported in 2% for each treatment arm, most often from infection. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 39% of patients in the CALQUENCE plus obinutuzumab arm and 32% in the CALQUENCE monotherapy arm, most often due to events of pneumonia (2.8% to 7%).\n\nAdverse reactions led to CALQUENCE dose reduction in 7% and 4% of patients in the CALQUENCE plus obinutuzumab arm (N=178) and CALQUENCE monotherapy arm (N=179), respectively. Adverse events led to discontinuation in 11% and 10% of patients, respectively. Increases in creatinine to 1.5 to 3 times ULN occurred in 3.9% and 2.8% of patients in the CALQUENCE combination arm and monotherapy arm, respectively.\n\nIn patients with relapsed/refractory CLL exposed to CALQUENCE, serious adverse reactions occurred in 29% of patients. Serious adverse reactions in >5% of patients who received CALQUENCE included lower respiratory tract infection (6%). Fatal adverse reactions within 30 days of the last dose of CALQUENCE occurred in 2.6% of patients, including from second primary malignancies and infection.\n\nAdverse reactions led to CALQUENCE dose reduction in 3.9% of patients (N=154), dose interruptions in 34% of patients, most often due to respiratory tract infections followed by neutropenia, and discontinuation in 10% of patients, most frequently due to second primary malignancies followed by infection. Increases in creatinine to 1.5 to 3 times ULN occurred in 1.3% of patients who received CALQUENCE.\n\nDRUG INTERACTIONS\n\nStrong CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid co-administration of CALQUENCE with a strong CYP3A inhibitor. If these inhibitors will be used short-term, interrupt CALQUENCE. After discontinuation of strong CYP3A inhibitor for at least 24 hours, resume previous dosage of CALQUENCE.\n\nModerate CYP3A Inhibitors: Reduce the dosage of CALQUENCE to 100 mg once daily when co-administered with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor.\n\nStrong CYP3A Inducers: Avoid co-administration of CALQUENCE with a strong CYP3A inducer. If co-administration is unavoidable, increase the dosage of CALQUENCE to 200 mg approximately every 12 hours.\n\nSPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n\nBased on findings in animals, CALQUENCE may cause fetal harm and dystocia when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.\n\nPregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating CALQUENCE therapy. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with CALQUENCE and for 1 week following the last dose of CALQUENCE.\n\nIt is not known if CALQUENCE is present in human milk. Advise lactating women not to breastfeed while taking CALQUENCE and for 2 weeks after the last dose.\n\nAvoid use of CALQUENCE in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). No dosage adjustment of CALQUENCE is recommended in patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment.\n\nPlease see full Prescribing Information, including Patient Information.\n\nNotes\n\nMantle cell lymphoma\n\nWhile MCL patients initially respond to treatment, patients do tend to relapse.4 MCL comprises about 3-6% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, with an annual incidence of 0.5 per 100,000 population in Western countries; in the US, it is estimated that approximately 4,000 new patients are diagnosed with MCL each year.4,5\n\nECHO\n\nECHO is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of CALQUENCE plus bendamustine and rituximab compared to SoC chemoimmunotherapy (bendamustine and rituximab) in adult patients at or over 65 years of age (n=635) with previously untreated MCL.6 Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either CALQUENCE or placebo administered orally twice per day, continuously, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Additionally, all patients received six 28-day cycles of bendamustine on days 1 and 2 and rituximab on day 1 of each cycle, followed by rituximab maintenance for two years if patients achieved a response after induction therapy.6\n\nThe primary endpoint is PFS assessed by an Independent Review Committee; other efficacy endpoints include OS, overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR) and time to response (TTR).6 The trial was conducted in 27 countries across North and South America, Europe, Asia and Oceania.6\n\nThe ECHO trial enrolled patients from May 2017 to March 2023, continuing through the COVID-19 pandemic. Prespecified PFS and OS analyzes censoring for COVID-19 deaths were conducted to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the study outcome in alignment with the FDA. Patients with blood cancer remain at a disproportionately high risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19, including hospitalization and death compared to the general population.6,7\n\nCALQUENCE\n\nCALQUENCE (acalabrutinib) is a second-generation, selective inhibitor of Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK). CALQUENCE binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity.8 In B-cells, BTK signaling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis and adhesion.\n\nCALQUENCE has been used to treat more than 85,000 patients worldwide9 and is approved for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) in the US and Japan, approved for CLL in the EU and many other countries worldwide and approved in China for relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL. CALQUENCE is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated MCL in the US, and in China and several other countries for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy. CALQUENCE is not currently approved for the treatment of MCL in Japan or the EU.\n\nAs part of an extensive clinical development program, CALQUENCE is currently being evaluated as a single treatment and in combination with standard-of-care chemoimmunotherapy for patients with multiple B-cell blood cancers, including CLL, MCL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.\n\nAstraZeneca in hematology\n\nAstraZeneca is pushing the boundaries of science to redefine care in hematology.

            "content": "A blockbuster AstraZeneca drug may now be used as an earlier treatment for mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), making it the first in its class approved as a first-line therapy for this rare and aggressive type of blood cancer.\n\nThe FDA expanded approval of the drug, acalabrutinib, to include previously untreated MCL in adults who are also ineligible for a hematopoietic stem cell transplant that is a treatment option for younger patients. As a first-line therapy, the AstraZeneca drug must be used in combination with bendamustine and rituximab, a drug regimen often used for older MCL patients. The late Thursday regulatory decision also grants traditional approval to the drug as a single-agent treatment for adults whose MCL has received an earlier line of therapy.\n\nMCL is type of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system. Chemotherapy is the standard treatment, but relapse is common. Acalabrutinib, marketed under the brand name Calquence, is a small molecule designed to block Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK), an enzyme that promotes the proliferation and survival of malignant B cells.\n\nSponsored Post Tackling Messy Provider Data with an NPI-Forward Approach Mike Wirth of ProviderTrust shares insights about the company in this interview at the ViVE 2025 conference in Nashville last month.\n\nCalquence, a twice-daily pill, initially won accelerated FDA approval in 2017 as a treatment for adults whose MCL has received at least one prior therapy. In 2019, the AstraZeneca drug\u2019s label expanded to include chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic leukemia. Calquence is one of AstraZeneca\u2019s top oncology products, accounting for $2.5 billion in revenue in 2023, up 25% from the prior year.\n\nThe latest FDA approval for Calquence is based on the results of ECHO, a Phase 3 study that enrolled 598 patients age 65 and older with untreated MCL. These participants were randomly assigned to receive the study drug plus the bendamustine/rituximab regimen, or a placebo and bendamustine/rituximab.\n\nAt a median follow-up of 49.8 months, clinical trial results showed longer progression-free survival that was statistically significant. Median progression-free survival was 66.4 months in the study drug arm versus 49.6 months in the comparator group.

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN), the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant, has seen its stock price tumble 15 percent over the past six months, buffeted by a series of unsettling reports emanating from China. A widening investigation by China regulators into alleged illegal drug imports, data breaches, and potential health insurance fraud has cast a shadow over the company\u2019s prospects in a critical market, triggering a securities class action lawsuit in the United States.\n\nHagens Berman has opened an investigation into the allegations and urges investors in AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 23, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 17, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Feb. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/azn\n\nContact the Firm Now: AZN@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nProbe Into AstraZeneca\u2019s China Operations\n\nThe probe conducted by China regulators, which reportedly centers on allegations that AstraZeneca employees improperly imported cancer medications like Enhertu and Imjudo from Hong Kong into mainland China and mishandled patient data, has been compounded by a broader investigation into a large-scale health insurance fraud case. The confluence of these issues has raised serious concerns among investors about the potential impact on the company\u2019s regional sales and overall financial performance.\n\nThe situation escalated with the arrest of Leon Wang, AstraZeneca\u2019s Executive Vice President International and China President. This development, coupled with internal forecasts predicting a downturn in sales within the Chinese market, has prompted a sharp investor reaction, culminating in the legal action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe AstraZeneca Securities Class Action Suit\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that AstraZeneca issued \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d and withheld crucial information regarding the company\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory risks in China. The complaint specifically accuses AstraZeneca of engaging in insurance fraud, facing heightened legal exposure that led to Mr. Wang\u2019s detention, understating the risks associated with its Chinese operations, and failing to disclose the potential for these issues to significantly harm its business and finances in the region.\n\nThe truth allegedly began to emerge in late October. On October 30, AstraZeneca announced that Mr. Wang was cooperating with a Chinese investigation, offering few details. This initial announcement triggered a 3 percent drop in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nThe situation worsened on November 5, when Yicai, a Chinese business news outlet, reported that dozens of AstraZeneca China executives were implicated in the investigation, with some potentially facing lengthy prison sentences. The report, citing an industry insider, attributed the alleged compliance issues to \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on sales representatives to meet aggressive sales targets. This news sent AstraZeneca\u2019s stock down another 7 percent.\n\nOn November 12, AstraZeneca confirmed Mr. Wang\u2019s detention and disclosed that the Chinese investigation encompassed allegations of medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation, and breaches of personal information.\n\nMore recently, on December 18, The Financial Times reported that AstraZeneca executives anticipate a decline in Chinese revenue due to the arrests of Mr. Wang and other senior executives. The report quoted an AstraZeneca executive who stated that \u201cdoctors are unwilling to interact with our salespeople and prescribe our medicines\u201d following the investigation, precipitating a further nearly 4 percent decline in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nHagens Berman Investigation\n\nThese events have prompted shareholder rights firm to open an investigation in the allegations.\n\n\u201cShould the allegations be confirmed, it suggests AstraZeneca misled investors about the true extent of its exposure in China, a failure with potentially serious consequences,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, an attorney leading the firm's investigation.\n\nIf you invested in AstraZeneca and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the AstraZeneca investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding AstraZeneca should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.

For the past five years, working closely with partners across the organization, he has played a key role in integrating data science and AI into drug discovery and development\u2014from answering specific scientific questions to improving the ways of working for chemists, biologists, and clinicians who are striving to solve them.\n\n\"Biology is still an unsolved problem,\" Weatherall says, \"It's characterized by a lot of uncertainty and a lot of variety\u2014variety between individuals, between cells in the body, variety between what the proteins in those cells do and how they talk to each other.\n\n\"There's still so much we don't understand. However, the good news is that we have extensive historical data from experiments and clinical trials. We're also continuously generating new data, more than ever before, and can use AI to turn it into value for patients at unprecedented speed and scale, in order to deliver much needed biomedical insights.\"\n\nOne of the key ways in which AI has transformed AstraZeneca's research is in the discovery and design of drugs. Historically, medicines have been discovered and designed manually by scientists in the laboratory\u2014this needs to be rigorous and deliberate, but can often be a slow and painstaking process, contributing to the lengthy development process of new medicines.\n\nNow, AstraZeneca chemists are armed with AI tools inspired by \"reinforcement learning.\" This technique is, in part, inspired and borrowed from its success in other tasks\u2014such as applications where computers can exceed human levels of performance in winning at games such as chess and Go.\n\n\"In reinforcement learning, you're asking AI to maximize a score, to find as many different outcomes as possible and choose the best one\u2014which is something that can be applied just as well to the design of a molecule that might one day become a new medicine,\" Weatherall explains.\n\nIt means that instead of synthesizing hundreds of molecules by hand, machine learning tools can quickly sift through thousands of possibilities, highlighting the most promising candidates for further study.\n\nIt also allows researchers to take a more \"zoomed-out perspective,\" Weatherall says, \"to help us make better scientific decisions, so that we can have a higher probability of success, and the potential for medicines to reach patients faster.\"\n\nGoing forward, AstraZeneca researchers are applying that same approach to different classes of medicines, such as antibodies, which are often used to treat diseases.",

Mina shares insights on AstraZeneca\u2019s mission to address unmet needs in cardiovascular care and the future of personalized medicine.\n\nFirstly, please introduce yourself and tell us about your career to date\n\nI hold the role of Senior Vice President, Global Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism (CVRM) in the BioPharmaceuticals Business Unit at AstraZeneca. In this role, I address the unmet needs in four inter-related disease areas: metabolism, heart failure, cardiovascular disease, and renal diseases, helping to drive our ambition to stop, reverse, and cure these chronic, progressive, and often devastating diseases by maximizing our medicines, delivering innovative solutions and advancing our pipeline.\n\nI began my 30-year career in healthcare as a pharmacist and have since helped to bring important medicines to people who have very few or limited options. I\u2019ve joined the CVRM team with deep experience in marketing and sales, payer and access strategies, and leadership and engagement. Recognizing the deep commitment we have in this important therapy area, I look forward to leading AstraZeneca into the future of CVRM care for the millions of people globally living with these conditions.\n\nI\u2019m so proud of the work we are doing to address existing unmet medical needs and set the future of CVRM care. Our collective success is what happens when our work reflects our passion.\n\nImage Credit: sasirin pamai/Shutterstock.com\n\nClick here to read more from AstraZeneca: Early Diagnosis and Intervention in Heart Failure with Prof. Martin Cowie & Dr. Lisa Anderson\n\nTo start, could you give us an overview of AstraZeneca's broader vision of addressing the unmet needs across cardiovascular, renal, and metabolism diseases, as well as how your team\u2019s work aligns with this mission?\n\nAstraZeneca is investing in the broadest and deepest portfolio and pipeline of CVRM medicines to slow and stop disease, protect vital organs and address major risk factors. We are uniquely positioned with a diverse portfolio based on novel and established biology, creating innovative combinations to address multiple risk factors/co-morbid disease in patients.\n\nFor example, by building on the success of Forxiga (dapagliflozin), the first SGLT2 inhibitor to demonstrate a mortality benefit in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure (HF) regardless of ejection fraction (EF), we are now utilizing next wave innovation to assess the use of the drug in novel dual mechanism combinations across five indications, tackling the complex challenges and unmet needs of comorbidities in cardiorenal patients. These programs aim to provide more options for patients who may not benefit from existing treatment guidelines for interconnected CVRM disease.\n\nAstraZeneca has been presenting compelling data on amyloidosis. Next up is the CARDIO-TTRansform trial on transthyretin-mediated amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). Could you explain the significance of this trial and its potential to reshape the treatment landscape for ATTR-CM?\n\nThe phase 3 CARDIO-TTRansform trial is the largest, most comprehensive trial in ATTR-CM to date. With over 1,400 patients enrolled, it is designed to deliver the most robust data in a broad patient population, including those on or na\u00efve to stabilizers, representing the dynamic and evolving ATTR-CM treatment landscape.\n\nThe trial's results, expected in 2026, will provide further insights into the safety and efficacy of eplontersen for treating cardiomyopathy in patients living with hereditary or wild-type amyloidosis. We hope this will help progress the development of a novel RNA-targeted treatment designed to reduce the production of TTR protein at its source in the liver.\n\nThe CARDIO-TTRansform study includes a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) sub-analysis, which is considered the largest CMR study in ATTR-CM patients. How might these findings impact the way we evaluate and treat cardiac amyloid burden in the future?\n\nThe CARDIO-TTRansform phase 3 trial uses cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) with extracellular volume (ECV) imaging to track treatment response in patients with cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CM) by assessing changes in cardiac amyloid burden along with associated changes in structure and function.\n\nThis non-invasive form of imaging navigates the limitations of other similar applications, provides accurate quantitative assessment readouts of key biomarkers, and is a viable option in renal failure, a complication often seen with amyloidosis.\n\nThe use of this method provides an important source of diagnosis, therapeutic and prognostic decision-making in the clinic when assessing cardiac amyloid burden. Therefore, findings from this sub-analysis will not only provide us with more information about the potential of eplontersen in ATTR-CM, but it will also help inform our future programs in other interconnected CVRM diseases, bolstering chances of improving patient outcomes in the area.\n\nWith real-world evidence from the OverTTuRe study indicating that the diverse presentation of ATTR-CM often leads to delayed diagnosis and treatment, what steps are AstraZeneca taking to improve early detection and patient outcomes?\n\nAt AstraZeneca, our ultimate pursuit is to pioneer new therapies in CVRM to slow and stop disease, protect vital organs, and address major risk factors. The latest findings from the OverTTuRe study reinforce the gaps that remain between early clinical manifestations and definitive diagnosis of ATTR-CM that could make a meaningful difference to patients.\n\nTo combat these challenges, we are transforming science and developing innovative screening and detection methods in partnership with healthcare practitioners, patient communities, governments, and policymakers to diagnose patients earlier. This is enabling us to advance our understanding of disease drivers through artificial intelligence and big data analytics while reshaping clinical trials to bring novel medicines to patients faster.\n\nOne of the presentations at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2024 Congress highlighted a 2.9x increase in the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis in the UK between 2004 and 2021. What are the key factors driving this increased awareness, and how can healthcare systems further improve diagnosis rates globally?\n\nWe have already seen significant progress in heart failure research with translational advances resulting in increased therapeutic options for patients. As a result, we are now seeing the emergence of a range of engagement initiatives that are committed to cutting time to diagnosis and treatment intervention, particularly at the community level.\n\nThrough our unique engagement approach with key external partners like academic institutions, we are developing screening and detection methods to diagnose patients early and advance our understanding of disease drivers through AI and big data analytics. For example, Project OPERA investigates the use of AI-assisted echocardiography, while our SYMPHONY program is set to enroll patients in community-based studies to expand operational efficiencies with AI.\n\nWe are also working with the broader healthcare community to transform amyloidosis through our Accelerate Change Together (ACT) on Amyloidosis program. This program aims to halve the time to a heart failure diagnosis by 2028 and double the diagnosis rates of ATTR-CM by 2030.\n\nHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has been a challenging condition to treat. With the growing understanding that ATTR-CM may be a significant underlying cause of HFpEF, how might AstraZeneca\u2019s research influence the development of therapies for this subset of heart failure patients?\n\nThe heart failure landscape has undergone significant transformation in recent times. Scientific advances have led to greater understanding of the disease. We now know that heart failure has many different stages and types, and our knowledge of the disease's genetics and biology has grown. These advances have allowed us to gain further insight into what is driving the disease, providing the possibility of tailoring treatment regimens for subgroups of patients with a specific combination of disease drivers.\n\nThe latest findings from the OverTTuRe study suggest that many patients may have been presenting with early signs of ATTR-CM without being accurately diagnosed. This underscores the need to improve early detection and diagnosis to ensure patients receive appropriate treatment sooner.\n\nAstraZeneca is well-known for its commitment to addressing multiple interrelated risk factors in cardiovascular, renal, and metabolism diseases. How does the integration of research across these disease areas drive innovative solutions that can improve patient outcomes holistically?\n\nCVRM diseases affect 1.4 billion people globally, yet remain undiagnosed, undertreated, and their connections underrecognised. This makes the integration of research across these disease areas particularly important to help drive innovation and improve patient outcomes.\n\nAt AstraZeneca, we understand the importance of integrating research across all areas of CVRM. By using technologies such as AI and big data analytics, we are bolstering clinical trials to help bring novel therapies to patients who need them the most.\n\nWe are excited by our rich phase 2/3 pipeline, which employs next-wave innovation to address CVRM disease and associated comorbidities. Our emerging weight management portfolio is positioned to go beyond short-term weight loss with AZD5004, a potential first-in-class GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), and AZD6234, our long-acting amylin analog (LAA). Likewise, our oral PCSK9 inhibitor, AZD0780, aims to drive reductions in LDL-C levels not achievable by statins alone.\n\nAs someone with extensive experience across multiple therapy areas, what do you find most exciting about the current trajectory of cardiovascular and heart failure research at AstraZeneca?\n\nI am extremely excited by recent developments in our cardiovascular portfolio and we are experiencing great momentum on the Wainua brand through our collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals. The NEURO-TTRansform phase 3 trial has successfully served as the basis for approvals in the US and other markets for ATTRV-PN and is supporting Wainua\u2019s current review for the indication in additional countries worldwide. Simultaneously, our CARDIO-TTRansform phase 3 trial is fully enrolled, making it the largest ATTR-CM trial.\n\nLooking ahead, how do you see AstraZeneca\u2019s advancements in ATTR-CM and the broader CVRM field shaping the future of patient care, especially as the company continues to focus on innovative therapies and personalized medicine?\n\nWith double-digit growth year over year, we are confident in our existing medicines in the mid-term and the rich phase 2 and phase 3 pipeline in our hands today. We continue to strengthen our position in CVRM drug development predominantly through the success of Forxiga, which has established itself globally as the foundational treatment across three disease areas of chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and type 2 diabetes.\n\nThis is important to our future pipeline as we expect that 60 million patients who currently use Forxiga will be eligible for one of our dapagliflozin combination therapies at the time of launch.\n\nWe are taking a leading role in the CVRM field by highlighting the importance of rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatment intervention and expanding the range of innovative and personalized treatment options available to patients based on the success of our established portfolios. By putting these into practice, I believe we will go a long way to improving patient outcomes and reducing the increasing burden associated with this group of diseases.\n\nWhere can readers find more information?\n\nPlease see here for more information regarding AstraZeneca\u2019s work in Heart Failure.\n\nAbout Mina Makar\n\nMina Makar is the Senior Vice President and Commercial Lead of the Global Cardiovascular, Renal, and Metabolism (CVRM), BioPharmaceuticals Business Unit at AstraZeneca.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than February 21, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWhy Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDetails of the case: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) AstraZeneca engaged in insurance fraud in China; (2) as a result, AstraZeneca faced heightened legal exposure in China, which eventually resulted in the AstraZeneca China President being detained by Chinese law enforcement authorities; (3) as a result, AstraZeneca understated its legal risks; (4) the foregoing, once revealed, could materially harm AstraZeneca's business activities in China; and (5) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the AstraZeneca class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=1331 https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=28116call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN), the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant, has seen its stock price tumble 15 percent over the past six months, buffeted by a series of unsettling reports emanating from China. A widening investigation by China regulators into alleged illegal drug imports, data breaches, and potential health insurance fraud has cast a shadow over the company\u2019s prospects in a critical market, triggering a securities class action lawsuit in the United States.\n\nHagens Berman has opened an investigation into the allegations and urges investors in AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 23, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 17, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Feb. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/azn\n\nContact the Firm Now: AZN@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nProbe Into AstraZeneca\u2019s China Operations\n\nThe probe conducted by China regulators, which reportedly centers on allegations that AstraZeneca employees improperly imported cancer medications like Enhertu and Imjudo from Hong Kong into mainland China and mishandled patient data, has been compounded by a broader investigation into a large-scale health insurance fraud case. The confluence of these issues has raised serious concerns among investors about the potential impact on the company\u2019s regional sales and overall financial performance.\n\nThe situation escalated with the arrest of Leon Wang, AstraZeneca\u2019s Executive Vice President International and China President. This development, coupled with internal forecasts predicting a downturn in sales within the Chinese market, has prompted a sharp investor reaction, culminating in the legal action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe AstraZeneca Securities Class Action Suit\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that AstraZeneca issued \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d and withheld crucial information regarding the company\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory risks in China. The complaint specifically accuses AstraZeneca of engaging in insurance fraud, facing heightened legal exposure that led to Mr. Wang\u2019s detention, understating the risks associated with its Chinese operations, and failing to disclose the potential for these issues to significantly harm its business and finances in the region.\n\nThe truth allegedly began to emerge in late October. On October 30, AstraZeneca announced that Mr. Wang was cooperating with a Chinese investigation, offering few details. This initial announcement triggered a 3 percent drop in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nThe situation worsened on November 5, when Yicai, a Chinese business news outlet, reported that dozens of AstraZeneca China executives were implicated in the investigation, with some potentially facing lengthy prison sentences. The report, citing an industry insider, attributed the alleged compliance issues to \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on sales representatives to meet aggressive sales targets. This news sent AstraZeneca\u2019s stock down another 7 percent.\n\nOn November 12, AstraZeneca confirmed Mr. Wang\u2019s detention and disclosed that the Chinese investigation encompassed allegations of medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation, and breaches of personal information.\n\nMore recently, on December 18, The Financial Times reported that AstraZeneca executives anticipate a decline in Chinese revenue due to the arrests of Mr. Wang and other senior executives. The report quoted an AstraZeneca executive who stated that \u201cdoctors are unwilling to interact with our salespeople and prescribe our medicines\u201d following the investigation, precipitating a further nearly 4 percent decline in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nHagens Berman Investigation\n\nThese events have prompted shareholder rights firm to open an investigation in the allegations.\n\n\u201cShould the allegations be confirmed, it suggests AstraZeneca misled investors about the true extent of its exposure in China, a failure with potentially serious consequences,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, an attorney leading the firm's investigation.\n\nIf you invested in AstraZeneca and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the AstraZeneca investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding AstraZeneca should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.

Credit: Bloomberg/ Getty Images\n\nAstraZeneca says a strong 2024 and stacked pipeline spells potential for further growth in 2025 as the company aims to bring in $80bn in revenue by 2030.\n\nCFO Aradhana Sarin outlined AstraZeneca\u2019s plans at the 2025 JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco on 15 January. The company maintains a confident outlook for the new year, said Sarin, despite its share price decline in the latter half of 2024.\n\nDuring her presentation, Sarin focussed on the company\u2019s performance during the first nine months of 2024, during which AstraZeneca increased total revenue by 19% against the same period in 2023 . Additionally, cash flow rose by almost $1bn over the prior year. The company\u2019s growth was largely attributed to its expanded clinical pipeline, which includes late-stage trials that have increased in number from 77 in 2022 to 91 in 2024.\n\nThis year promises to be a \u201ccatalyst-rich\u201d year for AstraZeneca, according to Sarin, with 21 new molecular entities (NMEs) in late-stage development, seven of which are expected to yield Phase III readouts within the next year. Among these are gefurulimab, being trialled in myasthenia gravis (NCT05556096), and efzimfotase alfa, trialled in hypophosphatasia (NCT06079281), the progress of which Sarin attributed to accelerated recruitment rates.\n\nSarin did, however, note negatively impacted revenues in China given ongoing investigations of AstraZeneca\u2019s operations in the country by authorities. On 30 October 2024, AstraZeneca\u2019s Chinese operations president Leon Wang stood down and was detained along with other current and former employees amidst accusations of insurance fraud, data breaches, and import of unlicenced medicines.\n\nRevenues for AstraZeneca in the US, in comparison, increased by 20% in the first nine months of 2024, comprising 43% of total revenue and are expected to account for half of the company\u2019s revenues by 2030 according to Sarin. She identified respiratory and immunology as the company\u2019s foremost sectors, growing by 39% in Q4 of 2024. Additionally, she said assets like Breztri (budesonide + formoterol fumarate + glycopyrrolate) and Fasenra (benralizumab) are positioned for indication expansion into severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), respectively, during 2025.\n\nSarin said AstraZeneca\u2019s capital allocation priorities are unchanged for the coming year and that the company remains focussed on antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies, and cell therapies, in addition to continuing its foray into the metabolic and gene editing space. Like many other companies that rose to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic, AstraZeneca has made concerted efforts to break into the obesity market, and has tried going through the deal rout with its potential acquisition agreement with SixPeaks Bio, announced in May 2024.",

You may also benefit from a rising share price in the future should their valuations recover.\n\nThree dividend stocks that are cheap buys today, offer high yields, and could be good long-term plays include AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN), ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), and Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE: TD). Here's a closer look at these three stocks and why you might want to consider adding them to your portfolio.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\n1. AstraZeneca\n\nHealthcare company AstraZeneca provides investors with a dividend that yields 2.2%. That's higher than the S&P 500 average of 1.3%.\n\nWhile the business possesses a diverse, robust portfolio with excellent long-term growth prospects, investors have been discounting it. The stock is trading near its 52-week low of $60.47, and its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple (which is based on analyst expectations) is just over 14. That's cheap when you consider the average stock in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund trades at a multiple of 20 times next year's earnings.\n\nFor a company such as AstraZeneca, which has generated more than $51 billion in sales over the trailing 12 months while averaging a profit margin of around 13%, this is not just a good dividend stock but also a solid growth stock to hang on to for the long haul. The company has been building up its drug portfolio over the years through acquisitions and in-house development. There are around 200 projects in the pipeline for this growth beast in therapeutic areas, such as oncology, cardiovascular, respiratory and immunology, and others.\n\nAstraZeneca is a stock that can be suitable for any type of investor because it checks off a lot of boxes. It's a top healthcare stock you can buy and hold for years.\n\n2. ExxonMobil\n\nInvestors can collect a higher yield with ExxonMobil, which currently pays 3.7%. The oil and gas giant has been known for decades to be a top dividend stock. The company's annual dividend has risen annually for 42 straight years, which is an impressive feat, given the volatility that often comes with commodity prices.\n\nEarnings will fluctuate, but this can be a great way for investors to hedge against inflation and diversify their portfolios with a top oil and gas stock. Exxon got bigger and more efficient with its acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources last year, which doubled its overall footprint in the Permian.\n\nExxon's stock is cheap, given its vast operations. In the trailing 12 months, the company has posted a profit of $33.7 billion on sales totaling $339.9 billion. The stock trades at a forward P/E multiple of 12 and can give investors good value for their money.\n\n3. Toronto-Dominion Bank\n\nCanadian-based Toronto-Dominion Bank, also known as TD Bank, is a top dividend stock investors can buy and hold for years and even decades. At 5.2%, it provides investors with a mouthwatering yield and doesn't come with much risk, either. It has been paying a dividend since 1857.\n\nThe company faced some adversity of late as it was hit with a $3 billion charge last year in relation to lax policies relating to money laundering in the U.S., where it's a top-10 bank. As a result, it now faces restrictions on growth in the U.S. market in the near term. While that isn't great news for investors, if you're planning on holding the stock for the long term, now can be an ideal time to do so -- when the market is feeling bearish on it.\n\nTD is still a top bank stock and will likely remain that way for the foreseeable future. It's trading at a forward P/E of 10 and is just a few dollars away from its 52-week low. While it is facing some near-term headwinds, long-term investors could benefit from buying the stock now while its valuation is low.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

            "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire George Soros Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) stands against other top stock picks in Billionaire George Soros\u2019 portfolio.\n\nThe Man Who Broke the Bank of England\n\nWhen it comes to financial lore, you\u2019d struggle to find an investor who is as controversial as George Soros. With a net worth of $7.2 billion, Soros has made a name for himself by correctly spotting market trends, which has led to millions, if not billions, of dollars in strategic savings or profits. He cemented his reputation in financial legend, for instance, when he famously shorted the British pound in 1992 and made off with $1 billion profit in a single day. Soros is also known for overseeing the Quantum Fund, which from 1970 to 2000 produced an outstanding average yearly return of 30%.\n\nHaving founded his hedge fund, Soros Fund Management, back in the 1970s, Soros\u2019 investment philosophy is centered around his concept of \u201creflexivity\u201d. Soros believes that players in the market can influence the market themselves, causing feedback loops that can cause price deviations. The investor makes use of this idea to single out mispricings in the market to create returns. The best application for this concept is during economic bubbles. According to Soros, \u201cWhen I see a bubble forming, I rush in to buy, adding fuel to the fire\u201d. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean one can always hit the bullseye; we saw this during the dot-com era almost 25 years ago where Soros admitted to being beaten by billions of dollars in losses.\n\nSoros Fund Management\u2019s 13F portfolio contained $6.92 billion in securities as of September 30, up from $5.56 billion a quarter earlier. About 9.8% and 7.4% of those securities were in the technology and services sectors, respectively, down from 11.7% and 10.6% from the quarter prior. Healthcare, basic materials, and financials also constituted a sizable portion of the fund\u2019s portfolio as of the third quarter of 2024.\n\nSoros\u2019 Opposition to AI\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise to anyone who has followed George Soros over the years that the billionaire has a certain disdain for artificial intelligence. Soros claims that the technology poses a significant threat, especially to what he calls \u201copen societies\u201d, simply because AI can not only produce instruments of surveillance, but it can also be liable in its misuse. In Soros\u2019 ideal world, AI regulations would have to be globally enforceable, though he admits that such a dream might not be realized because of the dynamics of governance across the globe. In a MarketWatch article from 2023, Soros outlined some of his thoughts regarding the technology. Here\u2019s what he wrote:\n\n\u201cWe, human beings, are both participants and observers in the world in which we live. As participants we want to change the world in our favor; as observers we want to understand reality as it is. These two objectives interfere with each other. I regard this as an important insight which allows me to distinguish between right and wrong. AI destroyed this simple schema because it has absolutely nothing to do with reality. AI creates its own reality and when that artificial reality fails to correspond to the real world \u2013which happens quite often \u2014 it is discarded as hallucination. This made me almost instinctively opposed to AI and I wholeheartedly agree with the experts who argue that it needs to be regulated. But AI regulations have to be globally enforceable, because the incentive to cheat is too great; those who evade the regulations gain an unfair advantage.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article we scanned Soros Fund Management\u2019s Q3 portfolio and chose its top 10 stock picks. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the fund\u2019s stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN)\n\nSoros Fund Management\u2019s stake as of Q3: $206.67 million\n\nAstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) stands out as a pharmaceutical industry leader, particularly known for its work in cancer therapies and treatments for rare conditions. The company\u2019s track record of medical breakthroughs has cemented its position in healthcare.\n\nA minor uptick in Leerink Partners\u2019 price target to $87 followed AstraZeneca\u2019s strong third-quarter performance, with revenue reaching $13.565 billion \u2013 exceeding projections by 4%. While their cancer drug portfolio showed mixed results, with Tagrisso, Calquence, and Lynparza beating expectations but Imfinzi/Imjudo falling short, their respiratory drug Symbicort posted impressive 21% growth, complemented by Ultomiris\u2019s 7% gain.\n\nThe company is now making a significant push into the American market, allocating $3.5 billion for expanded manufacturing and research operations. Despite increased net debt of $3.8 billion from this expansion, acquisitions, and shareholder dividends, AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) remains confident in its future. The company maintains its strategic objectives of achieving an operating margin above 35% by 2026 and generating $80 billion in annual revenue by 2030.\n\nOverall, AZN ranks 2nd on our list of top stock picks in Billionaire George Soros\u2019 portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential of AZN, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

The Prescription Drug User Fee Act date, the FDA action date for its regulatory decision, is anticipated during the third quarter of 2025.\n\nDatopotamab deruxtecan was previously granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the FDA for this patient population.\n\nThe BLA and BTD are based on data from the TROPION-Lung05 Phase II trial and supported by data from the TROPION-Lung01 Phase III trial. In addition, the BLA is supported by data from the TROPION-PanTumor01 Phase I trial.\n\nIn a pooled analysis of patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC in the TROPION-Lung05 and TROPION-Lung01 trials presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Asia 2024 Congress, datopotamab deruxtecan demonstrated a confirmed objective response rate (ORR) of 42.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 33.6-52.2) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) and a median duration of response (DoR) of 7.0 months (95% CI 4.2-9.8).

If approved, datopotamab deruxtecan could become the first TROP2-directed antibody drug conjugate for lung cancer, providing a promising option for patients.\u201d\n\nDatopotamab deruxtecan is a specifically engineered TROP2-directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by Daiichi Sankyo and being jointly developed by AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo.\n\nAstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo are evaluating datopotamab deruxtecan alone and in novel combinations as treatment for patients with NSCLC in seven Phase III trials including the TROPION-Lung14 and TROPION-Lung15 trials of datopotamab deruxtecan alone and with Tagrisso (osimertinib) as treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic EGFRm nonsquamous NSCLC.",

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN), the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant, has seen its stock price tumble 15 percent over the past six months, buffeted by a series of unsettling reports emanating from China. A widening investigation by China regulators into alleged illegal drug imports, data breaches, and potential health insurance fraud has cast a shadow over the company\u2019s prospects in a critical market, triggering a securities class action lawsuit in the United States.\n\nHagens Berman has opened an investigation into the allegations and urges investors in AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 23, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 17, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Feb. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/azn\n\nContact the Firm Now: AZN@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nProbe Into AstraZeneca\u2019s China Operations\n\nThe probe conducted by China regulators, which reportedly centers on allegations that AstraZeneca employees improperly imported cancer medications like Enhertu and Imjudo from Hong Kong into mainland China and mishandled patient data, has been compounded by a broader investigation into a large-scale health insurance fraud case. The confluence of these issues has raised serious concerns among investors about the potential impact on the company\u2019s regional sales and overall financial performance.\n\nThe situation escalated with the arrest of Leon Wang, AstraZeneca\u2019s Executive Vice President International and China President. This development, coupled with internal forecasts predicting a downturn in sales within the Chinese market, has prompted a sharp investor reaction, culminating in the legal action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe AstraZeneca Securities Class Action Suit\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that AstraZeneca issued \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d and withheld crucial information regarding the company\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory risks in China. The complaint specifically accuses AstraZeneca of engaging in insurance fraud, facing heightened legal exposure that led to Mr. Wang\u2019s detention, understating the risks associated with its Chinese operations, and failing to disclose the potential for these issues to significantly harm its business and finances in the region.\n\nThe truth allegedly began to emerge in late October. On October 30, AstraZeneca announced that Mr. Wang was cooperating with a Chinese investigation, offering few details. This initial announcement triggered a 3 percent drop in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nThe situation worsened on November 5, when Yicai, a Chinese business news outlet, reported that dozens of AstraZeneca China executives were implicated in the investigation, with some potentially facing lengthy prison sentences. The report, citing an industry insider, attributed the alleged compliance issues to \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on sales representatives to meet aggressive sales targets. This news sent AstraZeneca\u2019s stock down another 7 percent.\n\nOn November 12, AstraZeneca confirmed Mr. Wang\u2019s detention and disclosed that the Chinese investigation encompassed allegations of medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation, and breaches of personal information.\n\nMore recently, on December 18, The Financial Times reported that AstraZeneca executives anticipate a decline in Chinese revenue due to the arrests of Mr. Wang and other senior executives. The report quoted an AstraZeneca executive who stated that \u201cdoctors are unwilling to interact with our salespeople and prescribe our medicines\u201d following the investigation, precipitating a further nearly 4 percent decline in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nHagens Berman Investigation\n\nThese events have prompted shareholder rights firm to open an investigation in the allegations.\n\n\u201cShould the allegations be confirmed, it suggests AstraZeneca misled investors about the true extent of its exposure in China, a failure with potentially serious consequences,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, an attorney leading the firm's investigation.\n\nIf you invested in AstraZeneca and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the AstraZeneca investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding AstraZeneca should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.

The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date, the FDA action date for its regulatory decision, is July 12, 2025. Datopotamab deruxtecan was previously granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the FDA for this patient population.\n\nThe BLA and BTD are based on data from the TROPION-Lung05 phase 2 trial and supported by data from the TROPION-Lung01 phase 3 trial. In addition, the BLA is supported by the TROPION-PanTumor01 phase 1 trial. In a pooled analysis of patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC in the TROPION-Lung05 and TROPION-Lung01 trials presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Asia 2024 Congress, datopotamab deruxtecan demonstrated clinically meaningful tumor response. The safety profile of datopotamab deruxtecan was consistent with previous reports from the TROPION-Lung05 and TROPION-Lung01 trials, with no new safety concerns identified.\n\n\u201c Treating advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer presents a significant challenge due to the limited efficacy of available treatments once the disease has progressed following front-line therapies, including the use of an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor,\u201d said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. \u201c If approved, datopotamab deruxtecan could become the first TROP2 directed antibody drug conjugate for lung cancer, providing a promising option for patients.\u201d\n\n\u201c Acquired resistance to front-line therapies and, ultimately, disease progression are unfortunate realities for most patients with advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer,\u201d said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. \u201c This Priority Review, and the previously granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation, recognize the potential for datopotamab deruxtecan to provide a much-needed option to patients whose disease has become resistant to current treatments.\u201d\n\nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca are evaluating datopotamab deruxtecan alone and in novel combinations as treatment for patients with NSCLC in seven phase 3 trials including the TROPION-Lung14 and TROPION-Lung15 trials of datopotamab deruxtecan alone and with osimertinib, AstraZeneca\u2019s EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), as treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated nonsquamous NSCLC.\n\nAbout TROPION-Lung05\n\nTROPION-Lung05 is a global, multicenter, single-arm, open-label phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with actionable genomic alterations who have progressed on at least one TKI (with or without other systemic therapies) and on or after one regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients receiving up to four prior lines of treatment with tumors with one or more genomic alterations including EGFR, ALK, ROS1, NTRK, BRAF, RET or MET were eligible for the trial.\n\nThe primary trial endpoint of TROPION-Lung05 is objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary efficacy endpoints include duration of response (DoR), disease control rate (DCR), clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival (PFS), time to response (TTR), overall survival (OS) and safety.\n\nTROPION-Lung05 enrolled 137 patients globally in Asia, Europe and North America. For more information visit ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\nPrimary results from TROPION-Lung05 were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in January 2025.\n\nAbout TROPION-Lung01\n\nTROPION-Lung01 is a global, randomized, multicenter, open-label phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan versus docetaxel in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with and without actionable genomic alterations who require systemic therapy following prior treatment. Patients with actionable genomic alterations were previously treated with an approved targeted therapy and platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients without known actionable genomic alterations were previously treated, concurrently or sequentially, with platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor.\n\nThe dual primary endpoints of TROPION-Lung01 are PFS as assessed by BICR and OS. Key secondary endpoints include investigator-assessed PFS, ORR, DoR, TTR, and DCR as assessed by both BICR and investigator, and safety.\n\nTROPION-Lung01 enrolled approximately 600 patients in Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and South America. For more information visit ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\nPrimary PFS results and interim OS results from TROPION-Lung01 were presented at the 2023 ESMO (#ESMO23) Congress. Final OS results were presented at IASLC 2024 World Conference on Lung Cancer hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (#WCLC24) and simultaneously published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in September 2024.\n\nAbout TROPION-PanTumor01\n\nTROPION-PanTumor01 is a first-in-human, open-label, two-part, multicenter phase 1 trial evaluating the safety and preliminary efficacy of datopotamab deruxtecan in patients with advanced solid tumors that have relapsed or are refractory to standard treatment or for which no standard treatment is available. The dose escalation portion of the trial enrolled patients with NSCLC to assess the safety and tolerability of datopotamab deruxtecan to determine the recommended dose for expansion (6 mg/kg). The dose expansion part of TROPION-PanTumor01 enrolled several different cohorts including patients with NSCLC, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), HR positive, HER2 low or negative breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, urothelial, gastric, pancreatic, castration resistant prostate and esophageal cancer.\n\nSafety endpoints include dose-limiting toxicities and serious adverse events. Efficacy endpoints include ORR, DoR, TTR, PFS and OS. Pharmacokinetic, biomarker and immunogenicity endpoints also are being evaluated.\n\nTROPION-PanTumor01 enrolled approximately 900 patients in Asia and North America. For more information visit ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\nAbout Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\n\nNearly 2.5 million lung cancer cases were diagnosed globally in 2022.1 Lung cancer is broadly split into small or non-small cell lung cancer, the latter accounting for about 80% of cases.2 Approximately 10% to 15% of patients with NSCLC in the U.S. and Europe, and 30% to 40% of patients in Asia have an EGFR mutation.3,4 The majority of EGFR mutations occur in tumors of nonsquamous histology.5\n\nFor patients with tumors that have an EGFR mutation, the established first-line treatment in the metastatic setting is an EGFR TKI.6 While EGFR TKIs have improved outcomes in the first-line setting, most patients eventually experience disease progression and receive subsequent therapies, such as chemotherapy.7,8,9,10\n\nTROP2 is a protein broadly expressed in the majority of NSCLC tumors.11 There is currently no TROP2 directed ADC approved for the treatment of lung cancer.6,12\n\nAbout Datopotamab Deruxtecan (Dato-DXd)\n\nDatopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is an investigational TROP2 directed ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo\u2019s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, datopotamab deruxtecan is one of six DXd ADCs in the oncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo, and one of the most advanced programs in AstraZeneca\u2019s ADC scientific platform. Datopotamab deruxtecan is comprised of a humanized anti-TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, developed in collaboration with Sapporo Medical University, attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide-based cleavable linkers.\n\nDatopotamab deruxtecan is approved in Japan under the brand name DATROWAY\u00ae for the treatment of adult patients with HR positive, HER2 negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) unresectable or recurrent breast cancer after prior chemotherapy based on the results of the TROPION-Breast01 trial. Datopotamab deruxtecan is an investigational medicine in all countries outside of Japan.\n\nAbout the Datopotamab Deruxtecan Clinical Development Program\n\nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway with more than 20 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan across multiple cancers, including NSCLC, TNBC and HR positive, HER2 low or negative breast cancer. The program includes seven phase 3 trials in lung cancer and five phase 3 trials in breast cancer evaluating datopotamab deruxtecan as a monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer treatments in various settings.\n\nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration\n\nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU\u00ae in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.\n\nAbout the ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo\n\nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven ADCs in clinical development crafted from two distinct ADC technology platforms discovered in-house by Daiichi Sankyo.\n\nThe ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo\u2019s DXd ADC Technology where each ADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide-based cleavable linkers. The DXd ADC portfolio currently consists of ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), a TROP2 directed ADC, which are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca.\n\nPatritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd), a HER3 directed ADC, ifinatamab deruxtecan (I-DXd), a B7-H3 directed ADC, and raludotatug deruxtecan (R-DXd), a CDH6 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with Merck & Co., Inc, Rahway, NJ, USA. DS-3939, a TA-MUC1 directed ADC, is being developed by Daiichi Sankyo.\n\nThe second Daiichi Sankyo ADC platform consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a modified pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) payload. DS-9606, a CLDN6 directed PBD ADC, is the first of several planned ADCs in clinical development utilizing this platform.\n\nIfinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan, raludotatug deruxtecan, DS-3939 and DS-9606 are investigational medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\nAbout Daiichi Sankyo\n\nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of society that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the world. With more than 120 years of experience, Daiichi Sankyo leverages its world-class science and technology to create new modalities and innovative medicines for people with cancer, cardiovascular and other diseases with high unmet medical need.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than February 21, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) AstraZeneca engaged in insurance fraud in China; (2) as a result, AstraZeneca faced heightened legal exposure in China, which eventually resulted in the AstraZeneca China President being detained by Chinese law enforcement authorities; (3) as a result, AstraZeneca understated its legal risks; (4) the foregoing, once revealed, could materially harm AstraZeneca\u2019s business activities in China; and (5) as a result, defendants\u2019 statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the AstraZeneca class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=1331 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

Here researchers test tablets for impurities and the ability to withstand exposure to light, extreme temperatures and humidity during storage, as well as their durability, with the goal of achieving a shelf life of three years.\n\nDr Clare Rawlinson-Malone, incoming Moreton site leader, says: \u201cConnecting with local universities is immensely beneficial for scientific collaboration and nurturing our talent pipeline. The life sciences and medicine development sectors are incredibly dynamic and there is growing enthusiasm for a regional approach.\u201d\n\nIn a drive for better sustainability, scientists in Moreton use enzymes to help synthesise drugs, avoiding the need to employ oil-based solvents and heavy metals during drug development.\n\nBack in the 1960s, staff at Moreton provided the first ever human clinical trial supplies of an ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitor \u2013 a class of drugs used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure \u2013 and later created technologies for the delivery of diabetes treatments.\n\nView image in fullscreen Some fear that AstraZeneca\u2019s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, will turn from the UK market to targeting the US. Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer\n\nThe hope in the Leasowe area is that, as more biotech and pharma companies invest around Liverpool, they will create jobs for local people and provide a boost to the local economy.\n\nThere are 167 life science companies in the Liverpool city region, employing more than 6,000 people, out of 354 such firms in the north-west, employing 28,000 people.\n\nA designated life science investment zone, the Liverpool city region expects to attract up to \u00a3800m in investment over the next 10 years, including \u00a3160m from the government, and create 8,000 more jobs.\n\nThe AstraZeneca investment, if it goes ahead, would provide a further big boost. The company is in talks with the UK government about \u201cincentives\u201d to support the expansion of its childhood-vaccine factory in Speke in order to turn it into a bigger research and development (R&D) and manufacturing centre across about six hectares (15 acres) where several vaccines could be produced at once.\n\nIt has constructed a new 7,710 sq metre (83,000 sq ft) building that stands empty and would be kitted out with bioreactors, in a move from current egg-based technology to cell-culture-based vaccines.\n\nThe current facility, near the Mersey and Liverpool John Lennon airport, manufactures the drug substance for the children\u2019s nasal flu vaccine that is used in the annual vaccination programmes in the UK and the US.\n\nIt can make more than 20m doses a year, which are shipped to Philadelphia to be \u201cfilled and finished\u201d as Fluenz or FluMist nasal spray. The new Speke plant would be able to produce vaccines from start to finish \u2013 important to the UK\u2019s pandemic readiness planning.\n\nThe Office for Life Sciences \u2013 part of the Department of Health and Social Care and the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology \u2013 is leading negotiations, together with the Treasury, to work out the mechanisms of the funding, which could come from the government\u2019s \u00a3520m Life Sciences Innovative Manufacturing Fund.\n\nAs part of the package, the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority could fund training and apprenticeships to attract new staff to the site and upskill current employees.\n\nView image in fullscreen AstraZeneca has put plans for a \u00a3450m investment in Speke on hold as it tries to secure state funding. Photograph: AstraZeneca\n\nThe Conservative government trumpeted the planned AstraZeneca investment of \u00a3450m in March and pledged an undisclosed subsidy, which the new chancellor, Rachel Reeves, reportedly wanted to cut. Government grants tend to be 15%-25% of capital costs, according to industry insiders, which would equate to \u00a367.5m at the lower end. AstraZeneca has also been investing in other countries, most recently the US.\n\n\u201cThese companies are multinational, so they will go where the expertise is \u2013 they will go where they can get the best value, so we need to be able to compete and work with them closely where we can,\u201d says Prof Janet Hemingway, former president of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.\n\nShe was also director of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) for nearly two decades, and in 2020 set up the Infection Innovation Consortium (iiCon), which brings together industry, academia and NHS clinicians.\n\nSoriot and other executives flew to New York in mid-November to present AstraZeneca\u2019s latest financial results, which showed a 24% rise in third-quarter pre-tax profits to $1.8bn. There, they unveiled plans to spend $3.5bn on new labs that will bring together all its researchers in the Boston area, along with manufacturing sites for new cell therapy and biologics (drugs that are derived from biological sources such as cells, tissue or blood).\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t escape anyone\u2019s attention the US economy is expected to grow and there\u2019s lots of innovation there,\u201d Soriot has said. While the US is the business\u2019s largest market, accounting for 43% of its revenues, he added that \u201cwe are in the top three companies in most markets \u2013 not in the US\u201d.\n\nAt the same time, AstraZeneca has been rocked by a crisis in China, where the president of its China business and other senior executives were detained over allegations of illegally importing cancer medicines.\n\nThis has weighed on the drug maker and sent its share price sharply downwards when the news broke. AstraZeneca\u2019s market value has dropped from a peak of more than \u00a3200bn in mid-August to about \u00a3170bn.\n\nReferring to the Speke expansion, Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, says: \u201cAstraZeneca will be looking to get the best support possible [from the UK government] so it can compete effectively on the global stage and get the best returns for its shareholders.\n\nFrom a UK perspective, it\u2019s pretty important that we support this sort of investment and harness the opportunities for growth Geoff Davison, Bionow\n\n\u201cThe government will be looking to help to provide the right conditions for investment, job creation and growth, even as it minds its own fragile finances and contrasts those with AstraZeneca\u2019s $6bn in global after-tax profits in 2023 and how the company\u2019s management felt comfortable returning $4.5bn to shareholders in dividends last year.\u201d\n\nProf Tom Solomon, director of the UK\u2019s emerging infections research unit since 2014 and head of the Pandemic Institute in Liverpool, which was set up in 2021, says: \u201cIt also sends a signal to other potential investors. Here\u2019s a company that wants to invest. They obviously need government partnership and support, and if we want more of this kind of thing, we can\u2019t renege on the deals that have been made, even if the deal was made by the previous government.\u201d\n\nA Treasury spokesperson says: \u201cWe are committed to making the UK one of the best places in the world to develop and manufacture new and innovative medicines, and we are in active discussions with AstraZeneca to support the delivery of this planned investment in Speke.\u201d\n\nAstraZeneca says: \u201cThe discussions with the UK government are ongoing. We are reviewing the incentives for investment in the UK.\u201d\n\nThe UK\u2019s \u00a3108bn life sciences sector provides more than 300,000 jobs across the country, and the autumn budget promised up to \u00a3520m backing for the Life Sciences Innovative Manufacturing Fund, set up to support businesses investing in UK projects.\n\nLiverpool is the only place in the UK with officially designated \u201chigh potential opportunity\u201d status for vaccines, and LSTM, the world\u2019s first tropical disease research institute, was founded there in 1898. Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool city region, says: \u201cWe are a genuine global leader in understanding and tackling infectious diseases, and we\u2019re continually striving to innovate and future-proof the world against the viruses and pandemics of the future.\u201d\n\nSpeke is where the Distillers Company, a Scotch whisky maker, became one of the first factories in Europe to manufacture penicillin, in 1945, and where US company Eli Lilly made biosynthetic insulin and human growth hormone in the 1980s.\n\nThe area is reliant on a handful of big companies that have their subsidiaries here, while GlaxoSmithKline shut its factory in 2004 with the loss of 500 jobs.\n\nAdjacent to AstraZeneca in Speke is the UK\u2019s largest vaccine factory, run by Australia\u2019s CSL Seqirus, which has been manufacturing flu vaccines since 1943 (previously under Novartis) and employs 750 people. It makes 56m doses a year from start to finish, but could ramp this up to 200m in the event of a flu pandemic.\n\nThe nearby TriRx factory, initially built by Eli Lilly, has just been saved from closure by the US company Elanco Animal Health, in a \u00a320m buyout saving 300 jobs. The site makes monoclonal antibodies, targeted therapies that can treat cancer and other diseases.\n\nChina\u2019s Pharmaron runs a gene therapy and vaccine manufacturing site in Speke, originally the National Biomanufacturing Centre, built in 2003 with government funding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unusual to have so many big companies in the small area of Speke but it\u2019s really important to Liverpool and the UK that we maintain this infrastructure and capability,\u201d says Geoff Davison of Bionow, which represents 330 life sciences organisations across northern England.\n\n\u201cAstraZeneca and other global players can easily go elsewhere in the world. From a UK perspective, it\u2019s pretty important that we support this sort of investment and harness the opportunities for growth.\u201d\n\nTogether with neighbouring Cheshire and Warrington, the Liverpool city region delivers \u00a32bn of infectious disease research and development each year.\n\nAs a major port, Liverpool has a long history of infectious diseases and public health initiatives, and in November 2020 became the first place in the world to do voluntary mass testing for Covid-19, with nearly half the city\u2019s population coming forward.\n\nMore recently, researchers from Liverpool University developed the first vaccine for the Zika virus, which is spread by mosquitoes and can cause serious birth defects. The vaccine is being tested in about 20 volunteers in initial clinical studies.\n\nHemingway\u2019s iiCon organisation \u2013 backed by the Wellcome Trust and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \u2013 is building new robotic labs powered by AI and capable of handling dangerous pathogens in a \u00a310m project at LSTM.\n\nFounded with a \u00a318.6m government grant, the consortium has an infectious disease R&D programme worth \u00a3260m four years later. It has helped 36 new products enter the market, including diagnostic devices, vaccines and next-generation mosquito nets against malaria, treated with a more effective insecticide that is also safe for babies.\n\nHowever, there are challenges. The distinctive Spine building \u2013 home to the Pandemic Institute and the Royal College of Physicians \u2013 at Paddington Village has been half-empty since opening in May 2021.\n\nA Liverpool city council cabinet report said last year that it suffered from \u201ca lack of investment\u201d. Paddington Village is a key part of the \u201cknowledge quarter\u201d that includes Liverpool University and the Royal hospital, and the council is pushing ahead with its expansion undaunted.\n\n\u201cThe UK\u2019s prowess in science must never be underestimated,\u201d says Mould. \u201cThe University of Cambridge has more Nobel laureates on its own than the whole of France. Britain therefore offers deep pools of knowledge and talent, combined with a cheap currency [which is helpful for exports], so it can be a terrific base from which to operate, as AstraZeneca can already attest.\u201d",

In other words, passive income, which can flow in even when one is sleeping.\n\nHere\u2019s my simple plan geared towards achieving this goal.\n\nFocus on the long term\n\nRome wasn\u2019t built in a day, as the old clich\u00e9 goes. It\u2019s going to take time to construct a portfolio large enough to generate sizeable passive income.\n\nTo me, then, 2025 is just another year of building up my portfolio. This Foolish perspective helps me avoid taking unnecessary investing risks.\n\nThe opposite to this approach is to try and make as much money as quickly as possible. But this might lead me towards meme stocks, pre-revenue penny shares, and other high-risk/high-reward ideas.\n\nIronically though, following this get-rich-quick strategy means I could end up with far less than I started with. As Buffett also famously said, \u201cRule number one: never lose money. Rule number two: Never forget rule number one\u201c.\n\nDiageo on the rocks\n\nThe \u2018Sage of Omaha\u2019 invests in dividend-paying companies with strong brands, healthy profit margins, and pricing power. One FTSE 100 stock that I think ticks these boxes is Diageo (LSE: DGE).\n\nA global leader in premium spirits, the company owns timeless brands like Tanqueray, Johnnie Walker, Gordon\u2019s, and Guinness. Diageo has been able to steadily raise the price of these drinks over many years, supporting its healthy profit margins.\n\nHowever, the firm has been impacted by a slowdown in the global spirits market, with many consumers cutting back on restaurants and nights out (thereby drinking less). There\u2019s also been some downtrading to cheaper brands in its Latin American markets.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how long this will last and things could get worse before they get better.\n\nMeanwhile, weight-loss drugs have been shown to supress the desire for alcohol. Veteran fund manager Terry Smith (aka \u2018Britain\u2019s Warren Buffett\u2019) dumped his Diageo shares last year partly because of this fear.\n\nOver three years, the Diageo share price has dropped 39% due to this unpleasant cocktail of issues.\n\nBuying the fear\n\nBe fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful. Warren Buffett\n\nRecently, there\u2019s been above-average share price volatility when companies report some operational or earnings setbacks. I\u2019ve seen this with the stocks in my own portfolio.\n\nFor example, Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy and Ozempic, suffered a 28% share price plunge in December after disappointing late-stage trial results for its next-generation weight-loss treatment. This was Novo stock\u2019s sharpest drop ever! The month before, AstraZeneca stock fell 13% in a couple of days.\n\nHowever, I still view these companies as high quality, including Diageo. The spirits supremo is now offering a 3.6% forward yield and I think the long-term income growth prospects remain strong (though dividends are never nailed on). The concern about weight-loss drugs looks a tad overblown to me.\n\nMy plan this year is to buy the fear whenever my favourite dividend-paying stocks suffer big share price pullbacks. By doing so, I hope to maximise passive income over the long run.",

            "content": "To elevate Vietnam\u2019s pharmaceutical industry to regional standards while ensuring affordable access to quality medicines, the government has approved the National Strategy for Developing the Pharmaceutical Industry to 2030 and Vision to 2045. The ambitious roadmap targets transforming Vietnam into a hub for pharmaceutical production and technology transfer in ASEAN, enhancing domestic supply while boosting exports and integrating deeply into global value chains.\n\nBy 2030, the strategy envisions domestically-produced drugs accounting for 80 per cent of the market by volume and 70 per cent by value. It also aims for technology transfer of at least 100 original pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and biological products. These advancements will enable the development of high-quality, effective treatments and vaccines for disease prevention and management.\n\nThe critical question is: How can Vietnam achieve these targets? What steps are required to secure technology transfer agreements, develop coordinated production processes, and ensure the capacity to manufacture original and biosimilar products at global standards?\n\nLack of coordination\n\nAt a recent policy dialogue workshop entitled \u201cFostering technology transfer in pharmaceutical and vaccine manufacturing in Vietnam: International experience and recommendations\u201d, hosted by the Health Strategy and Policy Institute at the Ministry of Health (MoH) with support from AstraZeneca Vietnam, Mr. Ta Manh Hung, Deputy Director of the Drug Administration of Vietnam, highlighted the impressive growth in Vietnam\u2019s pharmaceutical market, from $3.4 billion in 2015 to $7.46 billion in 2022, for an annual growth rate of 12-15 per cent.\n\nVietnam currently boasts 238 GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice)-certified pharmaceutical factories under World Health Organization (WHO) standards, including 17 meeting GMP-EU standards. The country has successfully produced 15 vaccines, fully meeting the demand for the national Expanded Program on Immunization and covering 10 per cent of service-based immunization needs.\n\nHowever, challenges persist. Vietnam\u2019s pharmaceutical production technology ranks just below Level 3 out of 4 on the WHO scale, and domestic drug production meets only 70 per cent of market volume and 46.3 per cent of market value; well short of the 2030 targets. Dependence on imported raw materials, a focus on generic drugs over innovative and high-tech medicines, and limitations in vaccine research further underscore the industry\u2019s hurdles. Current technology transfer efforts have primarily involved conventional biologicals, with advanced technologies like mRNA and recombinant techniques largely absent.\n\nWhile numerous incentive policies have been introduced, including on investment, tax benefits, loan access, and human resources development, progress remains limited. As of 2024, only 20 innovative drugs have been transferred to Vietnam, primarily by companies like AstraZeneca, Servier, and Viatris, with just three receiving marketing authorization.\n\nMr. Hung identified key barriers as including insufficient capital, fragmented infrastructure, and a lack of skilled professionals in research and production. To overcome such challenges, Vietnam must implement bold and targeted policies to accelerate technology transfer and strengthen its domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities, unlocking the industry\u2019s full potential.\n\nUnlocking potential through technology transfer\n\nExperts at the workshop highlight the transformative potential of technology transfer in strengthening Vietnam\u2019s pharmaceutical industry. By leveraging this, Vietnam can swiftly adopt cutting-edge technologies, reduce research and development (R&D) costs, and produce high-tech medicines that ensure medical security and a stable supply chain. Beyond production, these advancements will enhance the industry\u2019s global competitiveness, attract foreign investment, and open doors for expanded exports, solidifying Vietnam\u2019s position in the regional pharmaceutical market.\n\nMs. Vu Nu Anh, Deputy Director of the Department of Health Insurance at the MoH, emphasized the synergy between health insurance and the domestic production of original drugs. Local manufacturing not only makes high-quality medicines more accessible but also lowers costs for patients. She urged policymakers to introduce targeted incentives to accelerate the adoption of technology-transferred medicines.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Nguyen Khanh Phuong, Director of MoH\u2019s Health Strategy and Policy Institute, underscored the critical role of government support in successful technology transfer. Drawing from international experience, she pointed out the importance of favorable policies, including investment incentives, intellectual property protections, and infrastructure enhancements, to attract multinational corporations to Vietnam\u2019s pharmaceutical landscape.\n\nExperts further stressed the need for comprehensive, end-to-end incentive policies throughout the technology transfer process. Addressing practical challenges, such as negotiating fair price reductions and ensuring timely drug registration approvals, will be pivotal in achieving meaningful outcomes.\n\nAssociate Professor Le Van Truyen, a senior pharmaceutical expert and former Deputy Minister of Health, outlined a bold vision for Vietnam\u2019s pharmaceutical sector. He called for robust domestic investments to upgrade existing facilities and build new factories, particularly for producing biological drugs and biosimilars. These efforts would enable Vietnam to meet rising global standards and diversify its product offerings.\n\nWith advantages such as a growing market, skilled workforce, and a strategic focus on pharmaceutical development, Vietnam is well-positioned to lead regional advancements. The establishment of a large-scale pharmaceutical-biological industrial park in northern Thai Binh province, with total investment of VND3.8 trillion ($149.5 million), offers a unique opportunity to adopt breakthrough biotechnologies, including cancer drug production. This would provide innovative treatment options that chemical drugs alone cannot address, empowering doctors and patients with cutting-edge solutions to tackle complex health challenges.\n\nLong-term benefits\n\nMr. Hung shared insights on recent updates to the Law on Pharmacy, highlighting key changes that introduce preferential policies designed to streamline the process of granting marketing authorizations for critical medicines. This includes new drugs, originator drugs, rare medicines, vaccines, and high-tech drugs. These policies are aimed at encouraging the production of generic drugs, biosimilars, and domestically-manufactured medicines, particularly those that have undergone clinical trials in Vietnam.\n\nAdditionally, there are initiatives to regulate pricing and offer discounts for new medicines, originator drugs, high-tech therapies, vaccines, and rare medicines produced under technology transfer agreements. These efforts prioritize the procurement of locally-produced originator drugs, generic medicines, and biosimilars.\n\nHe also emphasized the importance of prioritizing biologics and advanced therapies. The National Strategy for Developing the Pharmaceutical Industry to 2030 and Vision to 2045 underlines the strategic need for significant investment in biologics manufacturing, including vaccines, recombinant products, and cutting-edge treatments such as cell and gene therapies. \u201cThis emphasis demonstrates Vietnam\u2019s strong commitment to embracing advanced pharmaceutical technologies,\u201d he explained.\n\nSuccessful technology transfer in drug and vaccine production requires rigorous quality control, intricate processes, substantial investment (ranging from $5 million to $20 million for chemical drugs), extended timelines, often spanning over five years, and a high demand for skilled workers, Dr. Phuong pointed out. However, she continued, the rewards are clear: long-term, sustainable growth, improved technological capabilities, a robust ability to produce high-value medicines, enhanced competitiveness for domestic firms, and a significant contribution to national economic and social development.\n\n\u201cGlobal experience reveals that the key to successful technology transfer lies in robust government support,\u201d she added. \u201cThis includes issuing favorable policies, providing investment incentives, safeguarding intellectual property, and enhancing infrastructure to create an environment that attracts multinational companies to invest in technology transfer projects.\u201d\n\nMr. Atul Tandon, Country President of AstraZeneca Vietnam, said the Vietnamese Government\u2019s strategy is ambitious, not just focusing on domestic pharmaceutical consumption but also on positioning Vietnam as an innovation leader capable of producing breakthrough medicines for the region. With the recent changes to the Law on Pharmacy, technology transfer in Vietnam\u2019s pharmaceutical sector is gaining significant momentum.\n\n\u201cAstraZeneca has been actively pursuing technology transfer since 2022, and while the legal framework is now in place, we still need clear guidelines to ensure smooth implementation,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnology transfer should be seen as a long-term investment.\u201d He also expressed AstraZeneca\u2019s eagerness to continue collaborating with the Vietnamese Government and key stakeholders to achieve common goals in cross-border technology transfer, confident that cooperation across all sectors will overcome any challenges and ultimately benefit the people of Vietnam.",

NICE\u2019s final draft guidance on the poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor was based on positive results from the pivotal OlympiAD Phase III trial.\n\nThe study findings showed that the targeted cancer therapy enabled median progression-free survival 7.0 months, compared to 4.2 months with just standard chemotherapy.\n\nFurthermore, the clinical trial reported that patients treated with olaparib had a 42 percent reduction in risk of their breast cancer worsening or death compared to chemotherapy, AstraZeneca shared.\n\nOlaparib\u2019s potential in breast cancer with germline BRCA-mutations\n\n\u201cthe OlympiAD Phase III trial demonstrated how olaparib \u2013 a PARP inhibitor that targets the mutated BRCA genes in cancer cells \u2013 can significantly delay cancer progression or death compared to standard chemotherapies\u201d\n\n\u201cthe OlympiAD Phase III trial demonstrated how olaparib \u2013 a PARP inhibitor that targets the mutated BRCA genes in cancer cells \u2013 can significantly delay cancer progression or death compared to standard chemotherapies\u2026. [the NICE guidance] provides another important oral targeted therapy option,\u201d stated Professor Andrew Tutt, Director of the Toby Robins Breast Cancer Now Research Centre at The Institute of Cancer Research, London and King\u2019s College London, part of the team who developed olaparib for breast cancer with BRCA-mutations.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted that NICE has recommended olaparib to treat patients with HER2-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with germline BRCA-mutations. This decision is AstraZeneca\u2019s 26th cancer medicine recommendation from NICE and the [Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC)] since 2021,\u201d commented Tom Keith-Roach, President, AstraZeneca UK.\n\nIn early 2023, NICE recommended the small molecule precision medicine for early breast cancer. The organisation\u2019s recent decision therefore expands the indications that this medicine can be used to treat, supporting more patients with the disease.",

Yet, fewer than 10 patients are receiving the treatment they need.\u201d\n\nAt a press conference hosted by AstraZeneca Korea on Friday, Professor Kim Jin-seok of the Division of Hematology at Yonsei University\u2019s Severance Hospital addressed the critical gap in the diagnosis and care of aHUS.\n\nProfessor Kim Jin-seok of Severance Hospital emphasized during a press conference hosted by AstraZeneca Korea at JW Marriott Dongdaemun Square Seoul that strict reimbursement criteria are limiting access to necessary treatment for many aHUS patients in Korea.\n\nThe press conference marked the announcement of expanded reimbursement coverage for AstraZeneca\u2019s Ultomiris (ravulizumab), which will now be covered for treating aHUS as of January.\n\nThis coverage marks a breakthrough for patients suffering from the ultra-rare condition, which causes blood clots to form in small blood vessels, potentially leading to kidney failure, stroke, and even death.\n\nUltomiris will now be reimbursed for patients with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and kidney damage. However, strict pre-approval requirements and low reimbursement rates continue to limit access.\n\nIn 2024, only 15 percent of the 31 aHUS treatment applications submitted were approved, according to Professor Kim.\n\nWhile aHUS is rare in Korea\u2014affecting around 0.67 people per million\u2014it is often misdiagnosed, leaving patients without necessary treatment. The condition is less common in Asian populations compared to Western countries, where the incidence is 1\u20132 per million.\n\nUltomiris (ravulizumab), a C5 complement inhibitor, is now reimbursed in Korea for the treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS).\n\nThe complexity of diagnosing aHUS\u2014marked by fluctuating complement activity levels\u2014further complicates the approval process, says Professor Kim. \"For diseases with clear diagnoses, the reimbursement process is already challenging. But for rare, ambiguous conditions like aHUS, the pre-approval system only amplifies these difficulties,\" he explained.\n\nThe reimbursement criteria for Ultomiris are stringent, requiring active thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) with all four specified conditions, kidney damage with two key indicators, ADAMTS-13 activity above 10 percent, and negative results for Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC).\n\n\u201cThese standards are excessively strict,\u201d Professor Kim said. \u201cThey fail to account for the fluctuating nature of these conditions. Physicians\u2019 input should carry more weight in this process. The current criteria remain the most significant barrier to treatment access.\u201d\n\nUltomiris, a next-generation C5 complement inhibitor, offers an advantage over its predecessor, Soliris (eculizumab), by enabling dosing every eight weeks, compared to the biweekly schedule of Soliris. This extended dosing schedule improves patient access to treatment and helps prevent progression to end-stage renal disease.\n\nClinical trials, including the global phase 3 ULTOMIRIS aHUS-311 Study, demonstrated significant improvements in TMA markers, with 53.6 percent of adult patients achieving improvements after 26 weeks of treatment. In pediatric patients, the phase 3 Study 312 revealed that 94.4 percent achieved complete TMA resolution after 50 weeks of treatment.\n\nSince the first reimbursement for Soliris in 2018, the approval rate for aHUS-related treatment requests has been low. Between July 2018 and October 2024, only 56 out of 321 pre-approval requests were granted.",

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN), the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant, has seen its stock price tumble 15 percent over the past six months, buffeted by a series of unsettling reports emanating from China. A widening investigation by China regulators into alleged illegal drug imports, data breaches, and potential health insurance fraud has cast a shadow over the company\u2019s prospects in a critical market, triggering a securities class action lawsuit in the United States.\n\nHagens Berman has opened an investigation into the allegations and urges investors in AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 23, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 17, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Feb. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/azn\n\nContact the Firm Now: AZN@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nProbe Into AstraZeneca\u2019s China Operations\n\nThe probe conducted by China regulators, which reportedly centers on allegations that AstraZeneca employees improperly imported cancer medications like Enhertu and Imjudo from Hong Kong into mainland China and mishandled patient data, has been compounded by a broader investigation into a large-scale health insurance fraud case. The confluence of these issues has raised serious concerns among investors about the potential impact on the company\u2019s regional sales and overall financial performance.\n\nThe situation escalated with the arrest of Leon Wang, AstraZeneca\u2019s Executive Vice President International and China President. This development, coupled with internal forecasts predicting a downturn in sales within the Chinese market, has prompted a sharp investor reaction, culminating in the legal action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe AstraZeneca Securities Class Action Suit\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that AstraZeneca issued \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d and withheld crucial information regarding the company\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory risks in China. The complaint specifically accuses AstraZeneca of engaging in insurance fraud, facing heightened legal exposure that led to Mr. Wang\u2019s detention, understating the risks associated with its Chinese operations, and failing to disclose the potential for these issues to significantly harm its business and finances in the region.\n\nThe truth allegedly began to emerge in late October. On October 30, AstraZeneca announced that Mr. Wang was cooperating with a Chinese investigation, offering few details. This initial announcement triggered a 3 percent drop in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nThe situation worsened on November 5, when Yicai, a Chinese business news outlet, reported that dozens of AstraZeneca China executives were implicated in the investigation, with some potentially facing lengthy prison sentences. The report, citing an industry insider, attributed the alleged compliance issues to \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on sales representatives to meet aggressive sales targets. This news sent AstraZeneca\u2019s stock down another 7 percent.\n\nOn November 12, AstraZeneca confirmed Mr. Wang\u2019s detention and disclosed that the Chinese investigation encompassed allegations of medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation, and breaches of personal information.\n\nMore recently, on December 18, The Financial Times reported that AstraZeneca executives anticipate a decline in Chinese revenue due to the arrests of Mr. Wang and other senior executives. The report quoted an AstraZeneca executive who stated that \u201cdoctors are unwilling to interact with our salespeople and prescribe our medicines\u201d following the investigation, precipitating a further nearly 4 percent decline in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nHagens Berman Investigation\n\nThese events have prompted shareholder rights firm to open an investigation in the allegations.\n\n\u201cShould the allegations be confirmed, it suggests AstraZeneca misled investors about the true extent of its exposure in China, a failure with potentially serious consequences,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, an attorney leading the firm's investigation.\n\nIf you invested in AstraZeneca and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the AstraZeneca investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding AstraZeneca should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than February 21, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) AstraZeneca engaged in insurance fraud in China; (2) as a result, AstraZeneca faced heightened legal exposure in China, which eventually resulted in the AstraZeneca China President being detained by Chinese law enforcement authorities; (3) as a result, AstraZeneca understated its legal risks; (4) the foregoing, once revealed, could materially harm AstraZeneca\u2019s business activities in China; and (5) as a result, defendants\u2019 statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the AstraZeneca class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=1331 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

A widening investigation by China regulators into alleged illegal drug imports, data breaches, and potential health insurance fraud has cast a shadow over the company's prospects in a critical market, triggering a securities class action lawsuit in the United States.\n\nHagens Berman has opened an investigation into the allegations and urges investors in AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 23, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 17, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Feb. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/azn\n\nContact the Firm Now: [email protected]\n\n844-916-0895\n\nProbe Into AstraZeneca's China Operations\n\nThe probe conducted by China regulators, which reportedly centers on allegations that AstraZeneca employees improperly imported cancer medications like Enhertu and Imjudo from Hong Kong into mainland China and mishandled patient data, has been compounded by a broader investigation into a large-scale health insurance fraud case. The confluence of these issues has raised serious concerns among investors about the potential impact on the company's regional sales and overall financial performance.\n\nThe situation escalated with the arrest of Leon Wang, AstraZeneca's Executive Vice President International and China President. This development, coupled with internal forecasts predicting a downturn in sales within the Chinese market, has prompted a sharp investor reaction, culminating in the legal action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe AstraZeneca Securities Class Action Suit\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that AstraZeneca issued \"false and misleading statements\" and withheld crucial information regarding the company's exposure to legal and regulatory risks in China. The complaint specifically accuses AstraZeneca of engaging in insurance fraud, facing heightened legal exposure that led to Mr. Wang's detention, understating the risks associated with its Chinese operations, and failing to disclose the potential for these issues to significantly harm its business and finances in the region.\n\nThe truth allegedly began to emerge in late October. On October 30, AstraZeneca announced that Mr. Wang was cooperating with a Chinese investigation, offering few details. This initial announcement triggered a 3 percent drop in the company's share price.\n\nThe situation worsened on November 5, when Yicai, a Chinese business news outlet, reported that dozens of AstraZeneca China executives were implicated in the investigation, with some potentially facing lengthy prison sentences. The report, citing an industry insider, attributed the alleged compliance issues to \"extreme pressure\" on sales representatives to meet aggressive sales targets. This news sent AstraZeneca's stock down another 7 percent.\n\nOn November 12, AstraZeneca confirmed Mr. Wang's detention and disclosed that the Chinese investigation encompassed allegations of medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation, and breaches of personal information.\n\nMore recently, on December 18, The Financial Times reported that AstraZeneca executives anticipate a decline in Chinese revenue due to the arrests of Mr. Wang and other senior executives. The report quoted an AstraZeneca executive who stated that \"doctors are unwilling to interact with our salespeople and prescribe our medicines\" following the investigation, precipitating a further nearly 4 percent decline in the company's share price.\n\nHagens Berman Investigation\n\nThese events have prompted shareholder rights firm to open an investigation in the allegations.\n\n\"Should the allegations be confirmed, it suggests AstraZeneca misled investors about the true extent of its exposure in China, a failure with potentially serious consequences,\" said Reed Kathrein, an attorney leading the firm's investigation.\n\nIf you invested in AstraZeneca and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm's investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you'd like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the AstraZeneca investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding AstraZeneca should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

By blocking this enzyme, PARP inhibitors prevent the DNA of cancer cells being repaired, preventing them from growing and spreading.\n\nThe drug has been available on the NHS in England and Wales to treat patients with early-stage, high-risk breast cancer with inherited mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 since April 2023.\n\nNICE\u2019s latest decision was supported by positive results from the late-stage OlympiAD trial, which compared Lynparza against standard therapy in patients with a germline BRCA mutation and HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who had received no more than two previous chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease.\n\nAlongside meeting its primary endpoint of median progression-free survival, the study demonstrated that Lynparza-treated patients had a 42% reduction in risk of their disease worsening or death compared to those randomised to receive chemotherapy.\n\nAndrew Tutt, director of the Toby Robins Breast Cancer Now Research Centre at the Institute of Cancer Research and King\u2019s College London, who was part of the team that developed Lynparza for patients for BRCA-mutations, said: \u201cThese results underpinned this positive NICE recommendation, which now provides another important oral targeted therapy option for our patients with this challenging diagnosis.\n\n\u201cThis emphasises the importance of accessing genetic testing, so that these targeted drugs can reach the patients who will benefit from them.\u201d\n\nTom Keith-Roach, president, AZ UK, said the company was \u201cdelighted\u201d with NICE\u2019s latest recommendation of the drug.",

            "content": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\n\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like AstraZeneca ( ). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\n\nAstraZeneca's Earnings Per Share Are Growing\n\nGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. AstraZeneca's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 57%. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors.\n\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. EBIT margins for AstraZeneca remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 14% to US$51b. That's encouraging news for the company!\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.\n\nThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check 100% free.\n\nAre AstraZeneca Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nInsider interest in a company always sparks a bit of intrigue and many investors are on the lookout for companies where insiders are putting their money where their mouth is. This view is based on the possibility that stock purchases signal bullishness on behalf of the buyer. Of course, we can never be sure what insiders are thinking, we can only judge their actions.\n\nIt's pleasing to note that insiders spent US$2.6m buying AstraZeneca shares, over the last year, without reporting any share sales whatsoever. Buying like that is a fantastic look for the company and should rouse the market in anticipation for the future. Zooming in, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by CEO & Executive Director Pascal Soriot for UK\u00a32.0m worth of shares, at about UK\u00a3102 per share.\n\nOn top of the insider buying, it's good to see that AstraZeneca insiders have a valuable investment in the business. Given insiders own a significant chunk of shares, currently valued at US$49m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.\n\nIs AstraZeneca Worth Keeping An Eye On?\n\nAstraZeneca's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. Just as heartening; insiders both own and are buying more stock. These factors seem to indicate the company's potential and that it has reached an inflection point. We'd suggest AstraZeneca belongs near the top of your watchlist. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted you should know about.\n\nThe good news is that AstraZeneca is not the only stock with insider buying.

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Doctors may change how they treat liver cancer after drugs from AstraZeneca Plc and Merck & Co. helped some patients, marking the first treatment progress for them in decades.\n\nTwo late-stage studies published Wednesday in The Lancet show that Astra\u2019s Imfinzi and Merck\u2019s Keytruda delayed the progress of liver cancer when combined with other drugs and a local treatment.\n\nPatients whose tumors can\u2019t be treated with surgery lived several months longer without the disease advancing when treated with the Astra and Merck immunotherapies called checkpoint inhibitors.\n\nThe data \u201crepresents a breakthrough after 20 years,\u201d said Josep Llovet, director of Mount Sinai\u2019s Liver Cancer Program and the co-lead researcher for the Keytruda study. The findings will likely pave the way for new treatment guidelines, he said, a viewpoint echoed by the scientists who carried out the Imfinzi trial and a separate article in the Lancet.\n\nThe Keytruda study found that patients lived 14.6 months on average without the cancer progressing when they got the Merck drug, Eisai Co.\u2019s Lenvima and a local therapy known transarterial chemoembolisation. The period was 10 months for the control group.\n\nChemoembolisation is a procedure that involves injecting chemotherapy drugs and an embolic agent into the tumor to cut off its blood supply.\n\nIn the other study, patients who got the same procedure and took Astra\u2019s Imfinzi as well as the Roche Holding AG drug Avastin took 15 months before their cancer got worse. That compares with 10 months for patients taking Imfinzi alone and 8.2 months for those who got a placebo.\n\nRoughly a quarter of patients with liver cancer can\u2019t be treated with surgery or other therapies that would completely remove the tumor, said Mount Sinai\u2019s Llovet.\n\nThe last major advance for those patients was in the early 2000s when several trials, including one that Llovet was involved in, showed that chemoembolisation helped patients.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com",

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"PARP Inhibitor Biomarkers Market by Product, Service, Application, End User, and Region\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This comprehensive research report focuses on the global and regional market size and forecasts from 2024 to 2035.\n\n\n\nThe global PARP inhibitor biomarkers market was estimated to be USD 0.985 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 2.43 billion by 2035, with a CAGR of 8.57% during the forecast period 2025-2035. The market will grow due to rising cancer rates, growing precision medicine use, advances in genomic research, more FDA approvals and expanding indications, partnerships and collaborations, and government funding and initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe transition towards precision medicine, which involves customizing treatments based on individual genetic profiles, has catalyzed greater reliance on biomarkers for patient stratification, particularly those related to PARP (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase) inhibitors. These biomarkers are crucial for identifying patients who are more likely to benefit from PARP inhibitor therapies, thereby enhancing treatment outcomes. A notable example is the introduction of the PARP Activity Screening and Inhibitor Testing Assay (PASTA) in January 2023, this innovative method is designed for semi-high-throughput in vitro analysis using a 96-well plate configuration to evaluate the selectivity of PARP inhibitors. The primary objective of the PASTA assay is to measure the relative selectivity of various PARP inhibitors while assessing ADP-ribosylation levels facilitated by individual PARPs under diverse conditions. Overall, this assay advances the understanding of PARP-related therapies and improves the precision of treatment modalities tailored to individual patient needs.\n\n\n\nBy product, the kits segment accounted for the highest revenue-grossing segment in the global PARP inhibitor biomarkers market in 2024 owing to the widespread adoption of ready-to-use diagnostic kits in clinical settings for ease of use and rapid detection of biomarkers. For instance, Myriad Genetics, Inc., a manufacturer of precision medicine and genetic testing, declared in January 2024 that it supports the criteria for germline testing for patients with breast cancer set forth by the Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). The company views the ASCO-SSO's update to its guidelines as a major step forward in incorporating genetics into patient clinical treatment. Additionally, the assays segment is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the increasing demand for high-precision testing methods and advancements in assay technologies, particularly in research and drug development settings.\n\n\n\nBy service, the BRCA 1 & 2 testing segment accounted for the highest revenue-grossing segment in the global PARP inhibitor biomarkers market in 2024 owing to the high prevalence of BRCA mutations in breast and ovarian cancers and the critical role of BRCA testing in determining patient eligibility for PARP inhibitor treatments. For instance, the Intermountain Precision Genomics (IPG) laboratory business of Intermountain Health sold some assets to Myriad Genetics, Inc., a company that specializes in genetic testing and precision medicine, in February 2024. Precision Fluid Testing, Precision Oncology Testing, and his CLIA-certified laboratory in St. George, Utah, are all part of the deal. Additionally, the HRD testing segment is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the rising focus on identifying broader patient populations, beyond BRCA mutations, who may benefit from PARP inhibitor therapies.\n\n\n\nBy application, the breast cancer segment accounted for the highest revenue-grossing segment in the global PARP inhibitor biomarkers market in 2024 owing to the high incidence of breast cancer and the growing adoption of PARP inhibitors as a targeted therapy for BRCA-mutated breast cancer patients. For instance, Myriad Genetics, Inc., a precision medicine and genetic testing firm, will expand its portfolio of Precise Oncology Solutions and present new research at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in June 2023. Additionally, the ovarian cancer segment is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the expanding use of PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer treatments and increasing research into biomarkers for improved patient stratification.\n\n\n\nBy end-user, the hospitals and clinics segment accounted for the highest revenue-grossing segment in the global PARP inhibitor biomarkers market in 2024 owing to the high patient volume and preference for hospitals for cancer diagnosis and treatment services, including biomarker testing for therapy selection. For instance, in March 2023, the biotechnology company F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (Roche), which creates medications and diagnostics to treat serious illnesses, said that it has partnered with Eli Lilly and Company to support the development of Roche's Elecsys PARP Inhibitor Biomarkers. One cutting-edge blood test designed to help with early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis is the PARP. Additionally, the diagnostic laboratories segment is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the growing outsourcing of specialized biomarker testing services to laboratories and the increasing demand for high-throughput and sophisticated diagnostic capabilities.\n\n\n\nNorth America is anticipated to have the highest revenue share during the forecast period owing to the well-established healthcare infrastructure, high adoption of precision medicine, the presence of leading pharmaceutical companies, and increasing prevalence of cancer, particularly breast and ovarian cancers, where PARP inhibitors are commonly used. Additionally, the Asia Pacific region is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the rapidly expanding healthcare infrastructure, increasing awareness of cancer diagnostics and treatment options, rising healthcare spending, and growing patient population, particularly in countries like China and India. For instance, in January 2023, technology played a significant role in identifying novel markers of prostate cancer resistance to PARP inhibitors. Researchers have investigated how various genetic variants affect the effectiveness of PARP medicines using genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens. The identification of MMS22L, a gene that, when deleted, dramatically improves the susceptibility to PARP inhibitor, is a noteworthy finding from these investigations.\n\n\n\nReport Scope\n\nBase Year: 2024\n\nForecast Period: 2025-2035\n\nStudy Coverage\n\nMarket Forecast by Product, Service, Application, and End-User\n\nMarket Forecast for 5 Regions and 17+ Countries North America (U.S. and Canada) Europe (Germany, France, UK, Spain, Italy, Russia, Rest of Europe) Asia Pacific (China, Japan, India, Australia, South Korea, Rest of APAC) Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Rest of LATAM) MEA (South Africa, GCC, Rest of MEA)\n\nExhaustive Company Profiles of the Top 10+ Market Players AstraZeneca GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Pfizer, Inc.

            "content": "Understanding the human genome is a massive undertaking. The compute power and tools needed alone are staggering, but could be worth untold discoveries. AstraZeneca\u2019s Centre for Genomics Research (CGR) leads the company\u2019s Genomic Initiative on a global scale, with the ambitious goal of analyzing up to two million genomes by 2026.\n\nThrough this integrated analysis of enriched genomic and clinical data, they strive to:\n\nEnable a deeper understanding of the biology of disease\n\nIdentify novel genetic targets for medicines\n\nSupport patient selection in clinical trials\n\nEnable patients to be matched with treatments more likely to benefit them\n\nTo support these goals, and enable robust clinical insights, AstraZeneca\u2019s CGR is delivering a scalable analysis platform with an arsenal of advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) tools to enable discoveries of novel genetic targets, such as JARVIS, MILTON and Mantis-ML.\n\nOne crucial objective of some of these tools is to assist in understanding which amongst the billions of genetic variations in humans are likely driving disease mechanisms. These variations are called pathogenic. Undertaking this task on a large scale, involving whole genome sequencing data encompassing around three billion nucleotides, is a daunting challenge and a well-suited use case for machine learning.\n\nWe\u2019ll demonstrate one of the recent pathogenicity prediction tools developed by AstraZeneca to analyze human genetic variation. Specifically, we are interested in regions of the DNA that are not translated into proteins, namely, the \u201cnon-coding\u201d genome. The non-coding genome represents 98 percent of the human DNA and this is where the majority of human variation resides.\n\nWe\u2019ll showcase how Amazon SageMaker was used to fine-tune HyenaDNA, a powerful genomic foundational model, allowing AstraZeneca to analyze sequences of up to one million tokens at a single nucleotide level. This is a significant improvement compared with prior models for pathogenicity prediction that could only process context up to a few thousand nucleotides around each variant of interest. The finetuned HyenaDNA embeddings outperformed a well-known baseline score (CADD) in four out of five test datasets for pathogenicity prediction by 20.9 percent on average.\n\nThis model had no additional prior knowledge of genomic functionality and low development effort with potential for further gains with knowledge augmentation. Establishing better models for pathogenicity prediction enables accurate prioritizing of findings from large scale genomic association studies and will greatly shorten the path to novel target discovery.\n\nOpportunity overview\n\nPredicting pathogenicity of genomic variants\n\nTo understand genetic variation, geneticists have collected the most commonly occurring nucleotides in each position of the human genome by observing large populations.\n\nThey used these observations to construct the reference genome, which is a template genome incorporating the most up-to-date information we have on human genomics. Each individual genome can then be represented as a collection of deviations from the reference\u2014which we call variants.\n\nFigure 1. What are variants?\n\nThe significance of each variant is unknown. What AstraZeneca really wants to know is which of them are likely to cause disease, specifically, which are pathogenic. This can help them understand what drives disease and reveal opportunities for novel drug targets. By harnessing large datasets of well-known annotated pathogenic and benign variants, it becomes possible to build ML models capable of predicting pathogenicity for new variants of unknown significance across the whole human genome.\n\nFor variants that fall into protein-coding regions, AstraZeneca CGR has already published several tools to predict whether they are likely pathogenic or not, such as RVIS, MTR and OncMTR.\n\nOn the other hand, predicting the effect of variants in the non-coding genome is an arduous task. As this part of the genome is not translated into proteins, variants in this region have no clear effect, such as the loss of function of a protein, and often have unknown functional importance. Prior work by the team led to the development of JARVIS, a deep learning-based predictor of pathogenicity in non-coding variants, which amongst other features used the raw DNA sequence context around a variant within a window of three thousand nucleotides.\n\nGenomic foundational models\n\nGenomic foundation models represent a new approach in the field of genomics, offering a way to understand the language of DNA. DNA sequences are extremely long (up to billions of nucleotides), and the sensitivity required to fully understand the effects of evolutionary, environmental or other pressures makes them a particularly challenging domain for large-scale pretraining.\n\nTwo recent genomic foundation models that can integrate information over long genomic sequences, while retaining sensitivity to single-nucleotide changes, are:\n\n1. HyenaDNA uses the transformer architecture, like other genomic models, except that it replaces each self-attention layer with a Hyena operator. This widens the context window to allow processing of up to one million tokens, substantially more than prior models, allowing it to learn longer-range interactions in DNA.\n\n2. Evo is trained at a single-nucleotide (byte) resolution, on a large corpus of prokaryotic and phage genomic sequences. Evo is a seven billion parameter model trained to generate DNA sequences using a context length of 131 kilobases at single-nucleotide resolution. It is based on StripedHyena, a deep signal processing architecture designed to improve efficiency and quality over the prevailing Transformer architecture.\n\nUsing genomic foundational models for pathogenicity prediction\n\nGenomic foundational models, such as HyenaDNA allow extracting very long context windows around each variant of interest. This enables capturing interactions with elements that are further away, even by tens of thousands of nucleotides. Such interactions are relevant and occur often in the human genome. As an example, the rare genetic condition aniridia (lack of iris in the eye) can be caused by a variant located 133 kilobases downstream of the relevant PAX6 gene.\n\nThe team at AstraZeneca CGR was able to harness this property of genomic large foundational models to produce a novel pathogenicity predictor. It was able to examine a long sequence context of 32,000 nucleotides around each variant to determine whether it\u2019s likely pathogenic or not. This model had no additional prior knowledge of genomic functionality and relied solely on pretrained foundational model embeddings and the raw genomic sequence context around each variant.\n\nBy fine-tuning a lightweight classifier on top of HyenaDNA, this large foundational model was re-purposed and achieved remarkable performance for variants in the non-coding genome.\n\nSolution overview\n\nAmazon SageMaker Model Training reduces the time and cost to train and tune machine learning (ML) models at scale without the need to manage infrastructure. You can take advantage of the highest-performing ML compute infrastructure currently available. SageMaker can automatically scale infrastructure up or down, from one to thousands of GPUs.\n\nSageMaker provides distributed training libraries that can run highly-scalable and cost-effective, custom data-parallel and model-parallel deep learning training jobs. You can start an ephemeral job on-demand that runs a program, with a container image, using the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK without self-managing any compute infrastructure. Specifically, Amazon SageMaker provides flexibility when it comes to the choice of container image, run script, and instance configuration, and supports a wide variety of storage options.\n\nThe team opted for a JupyterLab space setup within Amazon SageMaker Studio, which was a familiar environment to transition into.\n\nThe training data were stored on an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS), shared across all SageMaker users and training job instances. Using Amazon EFS was beneficial to facilitate collaborative workloads, distribute training, and assist in minimizing start-up time for new training jobs. The data were instantly mounted and available on each new training job, eliminating the need to wait for data transfers from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Amazon EFS provided a managed, scalable file storage service and allowed the team to define infrequent access policies and automatically move infrequently accessed files to low-cost cold storage.\n\nFigure 2. Using JupyterLab on Amazon SageMaker\n\nThe adapted HyenaDNA was fine-tuned using a ml.g4dn.2xlarge training instance, which offered a good balance of cost and GPU performance, with a prebuilt SageMaker PyTorch container. Additional dependencies were pip installed from a requirements.txt file (as described in using third-party libraries) or provided as pre-built binaries to the training jobs, directly mounted from Amazon EFS.\n\nAmazon SageMaker offers a fully managed MLflow capability. You can compare model performance, parameters, and metrics across experiments in the MLflow UI, keep track of your best models in the MLflow Model Registry, automatically register them as a SageMaker AI model, and deploy registered models to SageMaker AI endpoints.\n\nModel architecture and training\n\nHyenaDNA uses the transformer architecture with an implicit global convolution layer injected into the attention block that allows scaling to very long input token sequences. It was pre-trained on the reference genome to receive a nucleotide sequence input and predict the next nucleotide following that sequence.\n\nFine-tuning HyenaDNA for pathogenicity prediction involved adding a couple of fully connected layers (FC) on top of the HyenaDNA pooled frozen embeddings and training these to predict whether each variant was pathogenic or benign. As input to the model, the sequence context around each variant was extracted from the reference genome.\n\nFigure 3. Model architecture for fine-tuning HyenaDNA\n\nThe training script used the Adam Optimizer with a binary cross entropy loss. Group-K-fold cross validation was employed to make sure variants from different chromosomes were sampled for training and validation. Early stopping was applied to halt training if the validation loss reached a plateau.\n\nAfter defining the training script in python, a SageMaker training job was configured and submitted. First, specifying the hyperparameters, for example:\n\nPython code:\n\n``` hyperparameters = { \"batch\": 15, \"lr\": 6e-4, \"weight_decay\": 0.1 } ```\n\nThen defining some metrics to be captured in Amazon CloudWatch logs, such as:\n\nPython code:\n\n``` metric_definitions=[ {'Name': 'val:auc', 'Regex': 'val_auc=(.*?);'} ] ```\n\nFinally, defining a PyTorch SageMaker estimator and type of instance required for training:\n\nPython code:\n\n``` from sagemaker.pytorch import PyTorch from sagemaker import get_execution_role from sagemaker.inputs import FileSystemInput from Sagemaker import Session estimator = PyTorch( base_job_name=\"tune_hyenaDNA\", entry_point=\"train.py\", source_dir=\"/efs/path/to/dataset\", instance_type=\"ml.g4dn.xlarge\", instance_count=1, image_uri=<PYTORCH_IMAGE_URI>, role= get_execution_role(), hyperparameters=hyperparameters, metric_definitions=metric_definitions, sagemaker_session= Session(), subnets=[\"<subnet ID to launch training instances>\"], security_group_ids=[\"<security group ids to attach>\"], max_run=48*60*60, ) file_system_input = FileSystemInput( file_system_id=\"<EFS ID>\", file_system_type=\"EFS\", directory_path=\"efs/relative/path/to/dataset\", file_system_access_mode=\"rw\" ) estimator.fit(file_system_input) ```\n\nIn this configuration, appropriate private subnets and security groups were configured for the training job instances to enable mounting the Amazon EFS.\n\nData, experiments, and results\n\nThe dataset for training comprises of examples of known pathogenic variants from ClinVar and benign variants from denovoDB, sampled with a ratio of 1:1. Variants are represented by their position in the reference genome. Testing used an independent set of benchmarks with pathogenic non-coding variants and benign controls from denovoDB.\n\nThe following table provides information about training and testing datasets.\n\nFigure 4. Dataset description\n\nVarious hyperparameters for the training script, such as the batch size, learning rate (lr) and optimizer weight decay were optimized by observing the validation ROC AUC and using the built-in SageMaker hyperparameter tuning.\n\nAmazon SageMaker AI automatic model tuning (AMT) finds the best version of a model by running many training jobs on your dataset. Amazon SageMaker AI AMT is also known as hyperparameter tuning. To do this, Amazon SageMaker AI AMT uses the algorithm and ranges of hyperparameters that you specify. It then chooses the hyperparameter values, which creates a model that performs the best, as measured by a metric you choose.\n\nResults are presented in Figure 5 for the best set of hyperparameters across the five testing benchmarks. For comparison, the performance of the well-established CADD score is provided as a baseline. The finetuned HyenaDNA embeddings achieved competitive performance in the tested benchmarks and outperformed CADD in four out of five datasets.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CGR team at AstraZeneca, with the help of Amazon SageMaker, could efficiently and with minimal effort fine-tune a large genomic foundation model (HyenaDNA) for a downstream task of interest. This experiment demonstrated that HyenaDNA embeddings alone could achieve good performance in identifying which new variants in the human genome are likely to cause disease.\n\nAdding these powerful embeddings can help further improve on existing variant effect predictors, providing improved evidence to help prioritize which variants to investigate further.\n\nContact an AWS Representative to know how we can help accelerate your business.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nAbout AstraZeneca:\n\nAstraZeneca is a global, science-led, patient-focused pharmaceutical company, dedicated to transforming the future of healthcare by seeking to unlock the power of what science can do.",

            "content": "For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals. Zacks Premium provides lots of different ways to do both.\n\nThe research service features daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, all of which will help you become a smarter, more confident investor.\n\nZacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nThe Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nEach stock is given an alphabetic rating of A, B, C, D or F based on their value, growth, and momentum qualities. With this system, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on, meaning the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nValue Score\n\nFinding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nGrowth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.\n\nVGM Score\n\nIf you like to use all three kinds of investing, then the VGM Score is for you. It's a combination of all Style Scores, and is an important indicator to use with the Zacks Rank. The VGM Score rates each stock on their shared weighted styles, narrowing down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.\n\n#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame. However, the Zacks Rank examines a ton of stocks, and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nWith more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nYou want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.\n\nThe direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.\n\nFor instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: Astrazeneca (AZN)\n\nAstraZeneca plc, headquartered in London, UK, is one of the largest biopharmaceutical companies in the world. AstraZeneca was formed on Apr 6, 1999, through the merger of Sweden\u2019s Astra AB and UK\u2019s Zeneca Group plc. AstraZeneca\u2019s business can be broken down into separate lines based on therapeutic classes. These include cardiovascular, respiratory, immunology, oncology, rare diseases, vaccines and other.\n\nAZN is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A.\n\nAdditionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. AZN has a Growth Style Score of B, forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 13.2% for the current fiscal year.\n\nFour analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.05 to $4.11 per share. AZN boasts an average earnings surprise of 3.3%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, AZN should be on investors' short list.\n\n7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days\n\nJust released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys.

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson's recently approved combination of Rybrevant and Lazcluze has improved overall survival compared to AstraZeneca's Tagrisso in a head-to-head trial, claiming what could be a key edge in the EGFR-mutated lung cancer market.\n\nThe new data comes from the MARIPOSA trial, which underpinned the FDA clearance of EGFRxMET bispecific antibody Rybrevant (amivantamab) with third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor Lazcluze (lazertinib) as a first-line therapy for locally advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitutions.\n\nRybrevant and Lazcluze also topped market-leading EGFR inhibitor Tagrisso (osimertinib) on progression-free survival (PFS) in the trial, and the new OS result will ramp up pressure on AZ's drug, which made $4.9 billion in sales in the first nine months of 2024 and is the company's second-biggest seller.\n\nWhat will please J&J \u2013 and worry AZ \u2013 is the reported size of the OS benefit with Rybrevant/Lazcluze, with J&J suggesting that its combination extends median survival by more than a year. However, the full dataset isn't available yet, so oncologists will be eager to get a proper look at the results at a medical congress later this year.\n\nIn a statement, J&J said that, unlike PFS \u2013 which tracks the time a treatment keeps a patient's cancer from progressing \u2013 OS \"helps patients understand the impact therapy could have on the ability to live longer from the start of treatment.\"\n\nTagrisso has been approved as a first-line monotherapy for this type of cancer since 2018 and earlier this year was also cleared by the FDA for use in combination with chemotherapy. A combination of Rybrevant and chemo also got the go-ahead in the US last September, based on results from the MARIPOSA-2 trial.\n\nAZ's drug is firmly entrenched in the first-line setting, so J&J will need strong data to displace it \u2013 particularly as Rybrevant needs to be given as an infusion every two weeks after a lead-in period, while Tagrisso is given orally. The bispecific antibody has also been linked to clotting side effects, which could factor into treatment decisions.\n\nSome analysts have suggested that the tipping point for Rybrevant take-up will come if and when a newer subcutaneous version of the drug \u2013 which outperformed the IV version in the PALOMA-3 trial and has a reduced risk of clotting \u2013 reaches the market.\n\nThat said, another year of life will no doubt be highly meaningful for patients, while cancer specialists will also be keen to drill down into patient subgroup data to help guide their treatment decisions.\n\n\"The combination of these two agents previously demonstrated an improvement in progression-free survival, but this does not always capture the impact on the entire treatment course,\" commented MARIPOSA investigator Stephen Liu, of Georgetown University School of Medicine.\n\n\"Evaluation of overall survival can better demonstrate the benefit of a first-line treatment regimen,\" he added.\n\nPhoto by Jon Tyson on Unsplash",

            "content": "Justin Trudeau, who said on Monday he would resign as Liberal prime minister once the party names a new leader, led Canada for more than nine years before former allies turned against him.Trudeau, 53, the son of long-time former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, was born into the public eye and inherited his father\u2019s sense of style and showmanship. He is one of the few Canadian leaders to win three consecutive terms in office. During his time in power, Canada overcame two major crises: the pandemic and then-US president Donald Trump\u2019s demand to renegotiate the trilateral trade deal with Mexico. Trudeau is an avowed feminist committed to gender parity in his cabinets who was ultimately brought down by an ugly breakup with former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, the most powerful woman in his political life.Trudeau took over as Liberal leader in 2013 when the party was in deep trouble and had been reduced to third place in the House of Commons for the first time.Yet by pushing an upbeat message of \u201csunny ways\u201d, and taking advantage of voter fatigue with the Conservative government, Trudeau propelled his party into power in the 2015 election.Trudeau was a media sensation and found his face - not to mention his sharp suits and colourful socks - splashed across magazines around the world. On his first foreign trip in November 2015, he was mobbed in a Manila conference centre and had to be whisked away by his security team.There was also substance. The highlight of his first term proved to be the successful renegotiation of the trilateral trade treaty with the United States and Mexico.The Canadian side, led by then-foreign minister Freeland, managed to preserve an agreement that was crucial for the economy.\u201cTrudeau handled that with aplomb and great strategy and was able to get a new deal. So I think that\u2019s going to serve him well in the history books,\u201d said historian JDM Stewart, author of two books on Canadian prime ministers.Trudeau also spent heavily on social programmes, including a commitment to ensure the availability of affordable child care.Trudeau\u2019s initial popularity helped him survive calamities that could have sunk other Canadian politicians. In 2017, the ethics commissioner ruled Trudeau had broken conflict-of-interest rules by accepting a vacation, gifts and flights from the Aga Khan. It was the first time a prime minister had been found to have committed such a transgression. During the 2019 election campaign, it emerged that he had posed in blackface when younger.He apologised repeatedly, blaming his privileged background. The Liberals retained power, albeit with a minority government that left them reliant on other parties to stay in power.Within months, the pandemic struck and Trudeau appeared every day on television for months to reassure Canadians. Yet legislators knocking on doors reported he was starting to put voters off. His approval ratings never recovered.\u201cOne of the reasons why he\u2019s very unpopular right now is that he\u2019s been over-exposed,\u201d said Stewart, speaking shortly before Trudeau announced his resignation.\u201cWhen you have a big personality... you\u2019re going to probably end up rubbing a few people the wrong way after nine years. They\u2019ve just had enough of you.\u201dTrudeau called a snap election in 2021, hoping to be rewarded for his handling of the pandemic. The gambit backfired and the result was another minority government.The prime minister remained as upbeat and talkative as ever, yet few people realised the effort it took him.\u201cI always understood that I\u2019m an introvert who learned how to be an extrovert to succeed in politics,\u201d he told the Toronto Star in 2021.One aide told Reuters that Trudeau is so shy he found it difficult to look people in the eye, even those closest to him.Trudeau\u2019s discomfort with people he did not know well started to cause issues within the party. In books written after they left government, three ministers complained how hard it had been to get past his inner circle.One reason for Trudeau\u2019s caution could be tied to his upbringing as the son of Pierre Trudeau.\u201cThe younger Trudeau has constantly lived with the reality that he is extraordinarily famous and thus most people have always wanted something from him,\u201d journalist and author Steve Paikin said in July 2024.Pierre Trudeau also courted the limelight and his love of fast cars, flashy clothes and romantic interests sparked a late-1960s phenomenon known as \u201cTrudeaumania\u201d, a term also used to describe the son\u2019s early impact on the media. There were other, more complex, similarities between the men.\u201cWhat he inherited from his father, in my opinion, was stubbornness, like not seeing the writing on the wall here,\u201d said University of Toronto politics professor Nelson Wiseman, referring to Trudeau\u2019s insistence until the end that he was the right man to lead the Liberals.Trudeau spun his background as a positive, saying those who grew up in fortunate circumstances were obliged to help their community. He worked as a teacher before entering politics.\u201cIt was my way of doing things, my way of having an impact. And it turns out I was pretty good at it, and I am pretty good at it,\u201d he told US late-night television host Stephen Colbert in September 2024. But even those close to Trudeau say he had problems managing personal relationships. In February 2019, former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould accused Trudeau and other officials of inappropriately pressuring her to help construction company SNC-Lavalin avoid a corruption trial.She resigned and Treasury Board President Jane Philpott also quit, citing a loss of confidence in Trudeau. The incident was damaging for a prime minister who described himself as a feminist.The strains of being prime minister also spread into Trudeau\u2019s personal life. In August 2023, he announced he and wife Sophie were separating after 18 years of marriage. The couple, who have three children, had talked frankly about difficulties in their relationship and in recent years were seen together less often in public. The fateful moment in Trudeau\u2019s downfall turned out to be a clash in December with Freeland, who was then finance minister and his main cabinet ally. She quit on December 16 after Trudeau tried to demote her, a move that aides said shocked him.The resignation set off new calls for Trudeau to step aside as opposition parties called for a no-confidence vote in parliament that Trudeau would not have survived. - Reuters",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Doctors may change how they treat liver cancer after drugs from AstraZeneca Plc and Merck & Co. helped some patients, marking the first treatment progress for them in decades.\n\nTwo late-stage studies published Wednesday in The Lancet show that Astra\u2019s Imfinzi and Merck\u2019s Keytruda delayed the progress of liver cancer when combined with other drugs and a local treatment.\n\nPatients whose tumors can\u2019t be treated with surgery lived several months longer without the disease advancing when treated with the Astra and Merck immunotherapies called checkpoint inhibitors.\n\nThe data \u201crepresents a breakthrough after 20 years,\u201d said Josep Llovet, director of Mount Sinai\u2019s Liver Cancer Program and the co-lead researcher for the Keytruda study. The findings will likely pave the way for new treatment guidelines, he said, a viewpoint echoed by the scientists who carried out the Imfinzi trial and a separate article in the Lancet.\n\nThe Keytruda study found that patients lived 14.6 months on average without the cancer progressing when they got the Merck drug, Eisai Co.\u2019s Lenvima and a local therapy known transarterial chemoembolisation. The period was 10 months for the control group.\n\nChemoembolisation is a procedure that involves injecting chemotherapy drugs and an embolic agent into the tumor to cut off its blood supply.\n\nIn the other study, patients who got the same procedure and took Astra\u2019s Imfinzi as well as the Roche Holding AG drug Avastin took 15 months before their cancer got worse. That compares with 10 months for patients taking Imfinzi alone and 8.2 months for those who got a placebo.\n\nRoughly a quarter of patients with liver cancer can\u2019t be treated with surgery or other therapies that would completely remove the tumor, said Mount Sinai\u2019s Llovet.\n\nThe last major advance for those patients was in the early 2000s when several trials, including one that Llovet was involved in, showed that chemoembolisation helped patients.\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nA combination of two Johnson & Johnson drugs helped people with a common type of advanced lung cancer live longer than Tagrisso, a widely used medicine from AstraZeneca that\u2019s considered standard of care in certain cases.\n\nJ&J didn\u2019t disclose specific survival data from its Phase 3 study, dubbed Mariposa. But the company said Tuesday it expects its drugs Rybrevant and Lazcluze to have improved median overall survival over Tagrisso by more than one year, a notable finding that could spur wider adoption of the J&J regimen.\n\nRybrevant and Lazcluze were approved in the U.S. late last summer based on earlier data from Mariposa that showed the combination kept lung tumors in check for longer than Tagrisso. The trial involved nearly 1,100 people with previously untreated non-small cell lung cancer that had metastasized or advanced locally.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nTuesday\u2019s disclosure from J&J is a summary; full results won\u2019t be available until an \u201cupcoming medical meeting.\u201d The company also plans to share them with health regulators.\n\nStill, the finding J&J has claimed is notable. Tagrisso has become a top-selling cancer drug due to its extensive use treating non-small cell lung tumors harboring mutations in a gene known as EGFR. In a study called FLAURA, AstraZeneca showed Tagrisso treatment led to median overall survival of nearly 39 months.\n\nJ&J described the survival improvement it observed in Mariposa as \u201cclinically meaningful and statistically significant,\u201d meeting the study\u2019s final pre-specified secondary goal.\n\nWhile Rybrevant and Lazcluze are already approved for use in non-small cell lung cancer, the overall survival benefit J&J is reporting may convince more physicians to use the regimen over Tagrisso. Prior data showed the combination reduced the risk of cancer progression or death by 30% versus Tagrisso alone, but extending survival is considered more definitive evidence for a new cancer drug.\n\nStill, physicians will have to weigh the treatments\u2019 relative safety profiles. In Mariposa, 10% of people given Rybrevant and Lazcluze stopped therapy due to side effects, compared to 3% of those on Tagrisso. The combination was also associated with a type of blood clot that forms in veins, prompting the FDA to require preventive anticoagulation during the first months using J&J\u2019s regimen.\n\nAstraZeneca has also shown in further testing that adding chemotherapy to Tagrisso can improve on the benefit offered by Tagrisso alone. That addition comes with additional safety concerns of its own, however, and hasn\u2019t yet been proven to extend survival.\n\nRybrevant is a bispecific antibody that binds to two different types of proteins, called EGFR and MET. Lazcluze is an oral drug aimed at EGFR, and works by inhibiting an enzyme that can transform normal cells into cancerous ones.\n\nThey\u2019re approved in the U.S. and Europe for use together as first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with certain mutations in which pieces of DNA have been deleted or substituted.",

Now, scientists at Johnson & Johnson think they have a drug combination that can take survival for these patients even further.\n\nThe combination is a duo of two drugs from J&J and Janssen, Rybrevant and Lazcluze. In a Phase 3 clinical trial, patients who received the combo had longer overall survival than those who received Tagrisso alone, J&J announced in a press release on Tuesday. The full data from the study, called the MARIPOSA trial, are not yet published, but J&J officials told STAT it would soon be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBeating Tagrisso in overall survival means the combo could have the potential to be a blockbuster drug and extend the lives of hundreds of thousands of patients. \u201cWe think this is going to be an absolute game changer and the future of the standard of care for patients with non-small cell lung cancer,\u201d said Biljana Naumovic, president of U.S. oncology solid tumors at J&J.",

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than February 21, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) AstraZeneca engaged in insurance fraud in China; (2) as a result, AstraZeneca faced heightened legal exposure in China, which eventually resulted in the AstraZeneca China President being detained by Chinese law enforcement authorities; (3) as a result, AstraZeneca understated its legal risks; (4) the foregoing, once revealed, could materially harm AstraZeneca\u2019s business activities in China; and (5) as a result, defendants\u2019 statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the AstraZeneca class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=1331 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

            "content": "AstraZeneca AZN stock has declined 14% in the past three months. A lot of this price decline is due to ongoing investigations at its China subsidiary. However, the overall drug and biotech sector has also done poorly in the past three months after Trump announced the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, as the head of Health and Human Services, the agency that oversees the FDA.\n\nThis, coupled with disappointing third-quarter sales and profits, guidance cuts and pipeline setbacks took a toll on the overall drug and biotech industry\u2019s performance.\n\nThe decline in AstraZeneca\u2019s stock price and the drug/biotech sector\u2019s downturn have left investors wondering if they should sell AZN stock. Let\u2019s understand the company\u2019s strengths and weaknesses to better analyze how to play AstraZeneca\u2019s stock amid the recent price decrease.\n\nAZN\u2019s Strong Portfolio of Blockbuster Drugs\n\nAstraZeneca boasts a diversified geographical footprint as well as a product portfolio with several blockbuster medicines. AstraZeneca now has 12 blockbuster medicines in its portfolio, with sales exceeding $1 billion, including Tagrisso, Fasenra, Farxiga, Imfinzi, Lynparza, Soliris and Ultomiris. These drugs are driving the company\u2019s top line backed by increasing demand trends. The company is confident that the growth will continue in 2025.\n\nBy 2030, AstraZeneca expects to have 25 blockbuster medicines in its portfolio, which is almost double the number of blockbusters it has now. Almost every new product it has launched in recent years has done well.\n\nAZN Enjoys Strong Position in the Oncology Space\n\nOncology is AstraZeneca\u2019s biggest segment. AstraZeneca is working on strengthening its oncology product portfolio through label expansions of existing products and progressing oncology pipeline candidates. Oncology sales now comprise around 40% of AstraZeneca\u2018s total revenues and rose 22% in the first nine months of 2024. The strong oncology performance was driven by medicines such as Tagrisso, Lynparza Imfinzi, Calquence and Enhertu (in partnership with Daiichi Sankyo).\n\nA key new cancer drug approval was Truqap for HR-positive, HER2-negative (HR+ HER2-) breast cancer. The drug has seen a robust launch, recording sales of $267 million in the first nine months of 2024. AstraZeneca also has some important oncology candidates in its pipeline, including datopotamab deruxtecan in partnership with Daichi Sankyo, which is under review in the United States for EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer and HR+ HER2- breast cancer.\n\nAZN\u2019s Non-Cancer Pipeline Progress\n\nAstraZeneca has been making significant progress with its pipeline in areas other than oncology, like cardiovascular health, immunology and rare diseases. Some key new drug approvals include Voydeya to treat extravascular hemolysis in adults with the rare disease paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, Wainua (in partnership with Ionis [IONS]) for hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, commonly referred to as ATTRv-PN and respiratory syncytial virus antibody Beyfortus (in partnership with Sanofi [SNY]). A key pipeline candidate is ALXN-2220, which is being developed for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy.",

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN), the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant, has seen its stock price tumble 15 percent over the past six months, buffeted by a series of unsettling reports emanating from China. A widening investigation by China regulators into alleged illegal drug imports, data breaches, and potential health insurance fraud has cast a shadow over the company\u2019s prospects in a critical market, triggering a securities class action lawsuit in the United States.\n\nHagens Berman has opened an investigation into the allegations and urges investors in AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 23, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 17, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Feb. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/azn\n\nContact the Firm Now: AZN@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895\n\n\n\nProbe Into AstraZeneca\u2019s China Operations\n\nThe probe conducted by China regulators, which reportedly centers on allegations that AstraZeneca employees improperly imported cancer medications like Enhertu and Imjudo from Hong Kong into mainland China and mishandled patient data, has been compounded by a broader investigation into a large-scale health insurance fraud case. The confluence of these issues has raised serious concerns among investors about the potential impact on the company\u2019s regional sales and overall financial performance.\n\nThe situation escalated with the arrest of Leon Wang, AstraZeneca\u2019s Executive Vice President International and China President. This development, coupled with internal forecasts predicting a downturn in sales within the Chinese market, has prompted a sharp investor reaction, culminating in the legal action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe AstraZeneca Securities Class Action Suit\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that AstraZeneca issued \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d and withheld crucial information regarding the company\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory risks in China. The complaint specifically accuses AstraZeneca of engaging in insurance fraud, facing heightened legal exposure that led to Mr. Wang\u2019s detention, understating the risks associated with its Chinese operations, and failing to disclose the potential for these issues to significantly harm its business and finances in the region.\n\nThe truth allegedly began to emerge in late October. On October 30, AstraZeneca announced that Mr. Wang was cooperating with a Chinese investigation, offering few details. This initial announcement triggered a 3 percent drop in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nThe situation worsened on November 5, when Yicai, a Chinese business news outlet, reported that dozens of AstraZeneca China executives were implicated in the investigation, with some potentially facing lengthy prison sentences. The report, citing an industry insider, attributed the alleged compliance issues to \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on sales representatives to meet aggressive sales targets. This news sent AstraZeneca\u2019s stock down another 7 percent.\n\nOn November 12, AstraZeneca confirmed Mr. Wang\u2019s detention and disclosed that the Chinese investigation encompassed allegations of medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation, and breaches of personal information.\n\nMore recently, on December 18, The Financial Times reported that AstraZeneca executives anticipate a decline in Chinese revenue due to the arrests of Mr. Wang and other senior executives. The report quoted an AstraZeneca executive who stated that \u201cdoctors are unwilling to interact with our salespeople and prescribe our medicines\u201d following the investigation, precipitating a further nearly 4 percent decline in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nHagens Berman Investigation\n\nThese events have prompted shareholder rights firm to open an investigation in the allegations.\n\n\u201cShould the allegations be confirmed, it suggests AstraZeneca misled investors about the true extent of its exposure in China, a failure with potentially serious consequences,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, an attorney leading the firm's investigation.\n\nIf you invested in AstraZeneca and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the AstraZeneca investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding AstraZeneca should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best FTSE Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) stands against the other FTSE dividend stocks.\n\nGoldman Sachs Research predicts moderate growth for the UK economy in 2025, with GDP rising 1.2%. That is slightly below the Bank of England's (BoE) 1.5% projection and the 1.3% consensus among economists. Moreover, growth is expected to slow as the year goes on, driven by trade uncertainties, tighter budgets, and changes in housing policies. However, inflation is likely to ease through 2025, which could lead to bigger interest rate cuts than the market expects. While most think the BoE will stop cutting rates at 4%, Goldman Sachs sees rates dropping further to 3.25% by mid-2026.\n\nBuilding on this cautious economic outlook, fiscal policies are also expected to play a significant role in shaping growth. The UK\u2019s autumn budget provided a near-term boost to demand but points to a consolidation in 2025, likely slowing growth later in the year. Inflationary pressures from public sector pay deals and higher taxes on services are expected to persist in the short term but should ease as wage growth slows and labor market tightness lessens.\n\nAmid these broader economic challenges, UK investors may find some optimism in corporate dividends. AJ Bell's latest Dividend Dashboard paints a positive picture for FTSE 100 dividends. Analysts expect payouts to grow by 1% in 2024 to \u00a378.6 billion, followed by a 7% bump in 2025 to \u00a383.9 billion, though still just shy of the 2018 record of \u00a385.2 billion. This strong performance in dividends highlights a contrast to the broader economic challenges, offering a silver lining for investors. Share buybacks remain strong, with \u00a349.9 billion already planned for 2024, on top of \u00a352 billion last year. Combined with \u00a311 billion in expected dividends from the FTSE 250 and \u00a347.2 billion in takeovers, the FTSE 350 is set to deliver a whopping \u00a3189.7 billion in total cash returns. That works out to a cash yield of 7.7%, comfortably beating the Bank of England\u2019s 5% base rate, the 3.92% 10-year gilt yield, and the 2.2% inflation rate.\n\nNevertheless, domestic companies are still grappling with significant headwinds, such as rising costs like National Insurance and minimum wage, all while operating in a sluggish economy. Investors are still favoring the US market, but falling interest rates could nudge some back toward UK stocks. Meanwhile, rising bond yields and pension plans shifting to UK equities might help stocks but could drive up government borrowing costs by reducing demand for gilts.",

Scientists are now urging the UK to add a Black Death vaccine to its stockpile as the risk of superbug strains increases. A trial of the new vaccine on 40 healthy adults, which began in 2021, has shown promising results, demonstrating both safety and the ability to produce an immune response.\n\nThe Oxford/AstraZeneca team are developing a jab Getty/PA\n\nProf Sir Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said the trial results will be submitted for peer review within weeks. \"There are no licensed plague vaccines in the UK. Antibiotics are the only treatment. There are some licensed vaccines in Russia,\" he told The Telegraph. Government military scientists have called for the vaccine to be manufactured in bulk, warning that plague still exists globally with \"potential for pandemic spread\". The disease can manifest in three forms: bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic plague. Bubonic plague, characterised by swollen lymph nodes around flea bites, is 30 per cent fatal without treatment. Pneumonic plague, which affects the lungs, is 100 per cent fatal if not treated within 24 hours and can spread between humans through droplets.

The Black Death outbreak in the 1300s decimated Europe. Medical historians believe roughly half of the population was killed as a result of the disease. Scientists at Porton Down's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) warn there is a \"demonstrable\" risk of superbug plague evolving. Antibiotic-resistant strains have already been discovered in Madagascar and Peru. The growing threat of antimicrobial resistance is expected to claim 39 million lives globally by 2050.

but does not believe the long-term use of steroid creams would have a 'positive prognosis'.\n\nThe tribunal heard Mr Kalmans conditions were 'negatively impacted' by the Covid vaccine, and by contracting the virus at various points, and he underwent a series of alternative treatments in his home country, Hungary.\n\nThis included acupuncture and therapy from supplements and nutrition.\n\nHe listed how the conditions affect his day to day activities and these include bathing taking longer, having to apply a moisturising balm after his shower, house chores exacerbating his symptoms and his sleep being affected.\n\nMr Kalman said he also has to spend more time shopping and preparing food, finds sporting activities painful because sweat causes inflammation of his skin, and his symptoms flaring up during periods of exam stress.\n\nAt a preliminary hearing, EJ Sarah Moore has now ruled that his eczema is a disability therefore he is allowed to progress with a discrimination claim.\n\n'In the present case there is no dispute that [Mr Kalman] has eczema, and that eczema has the effect of causing skin dryness, discomfort and itching,' the judge said.\n\n'As regards the impact that would have on [his] ability to carry out normal day to day activities, [he] gave evidence that his eczema affects his sleep, and further that if left untreated his eczema would significantly impair his ability to fall and stay asleep and would make basic activities like showering and wearing clothes painful.\n\n'He also stated that it would be likely to have an adverse impact on his desire to socialise and generally be seen in public, particularly since he suffers from eczema on exposed areas such as his face and neck.\n\n'I am satisfied this would be the case.\n\n'For that reason I am therefore satisfied that [Mr Kalman] satisfies the definition of being a disabled person within the meaning of s.6 EqA.'\n\nThe judge ruled that Mr Kalman would not be allowed to bring forward a claim of disability discrimination in relation to his allergies because while uncomfortable - they are 'not life threatening'.\n\n'I consider [Mr Kalman] can reasonably be expected to modify his diet and generally behave in such a way as to prevent those impairments having a substantial adverse effect,' EJ Moore said.\n\nThe tribunal heard that AstraZeneca accepts he suffers from these conditions but 'it does not accept that they have a substantial adverse impact on the Claimant's ability to carry out normal day to day activities'.\n\nThe full hearing into his complaints will take place at a later date.",

his wife Kam has criticised the after-care given to sufferers and their families\n\nKam Miller, 58, from Leicester, described how her 'fit and healthy' husband Neil Miller, 50, collapsed and died not long after receiving his first jab in March 2021.\n\nHis causes of death were initially officially recorded as ischaemic heart disease and rheumatoid arthritis - but, after an inquest, this was corrected to Vaccine-induced Immune Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (VITT).\n\nShe said: 'For other people, Covid is something in the past \u2013 they don\u2019t want to talk about it, but we\u2019re still living with it.'\n\nShe is among many campaigners who are hoping to not only raise awareness of potential risks but secure improvement to the follow-up care and support casualties are given.\n\nVaccines are monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which states that having the jab is the most effective way to reduce deaths and severe illness from Covid.\n\nThe worst side effects for most people are said to include tenderness in the arm where the injection took place, feeling tired, having a headache and general flu-like symptoms.\n\nBut a support group for people who say they have suffered much worse includes many who tell of life-changing, career-ending consequences.\n\nMs Crichton, 45, can no longer run the sports therapy clinic she operated before falling ill not long after receiving her Covid injections.\n\nCharlet Crichton (centre) is pictured with fellow UKCVFamily charity campaigners at Dorland House in Paddington, central London - others seen include solicitor Terry Wilcox and barristers Anna Morris KC, Christian Weaver KC and Mark Bradley KC\n\nBut she has devoted herself to a charity she founded, UKCVFamily, which provides a support group as well as a campaigning drive for people suffering adverse reactions to Covid vaccines and those bereaved.\n\nShe said: \u2018I set up the charity in November 2021 as a kind of safe place for people to be able to talk and advocate for each other and find support from politicians, doctors and health professionals and take part in research.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re campaigning for change not just the vaccine but also to the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme which is failing most people miserably.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re campaigning for change not just the vaccine but also to the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme which is failing most people miserably.\n\n'There should also be better care pathways, a change in culture to reduce stigma and improve the way medics react.'\n\nMother-of-two Mrs Miller is among those to successfully apply for the maximum payment available under VDPS, \u00a3120,000 - although she believes many people are unfairly missing out and the awards should be worth more to help families left in dire need.\n\nHer husband Neil had been classified as a key worker at the start of lockdown in March 2020, working in IT and looking after phonelines for water utility Severn Trent.\n\nWhen the first Covid vaccines were rolled out, he had his first one - an AstraZeneca jab on March 23 2021, with his wife recalling: 'He was telling me to get mine booked in.\n\nNeil and Kam Miller are pictured - she has spoken out about the delivery of Covid-19 vaccinations and follow-up treatment after he died aged 50 not long after receiving one in 2021\n\n'At that time everyone believe the vaccines were the way for everything to get back to normal.\n\n'When he went for his injection, there had been some talk of blood clots and a few countries banning the AstraZeneca one. He told me, \u201cThey say it\u2019s a really minimal chance\u201d, so he went ahead with it.\n\n'Afterwards he said he felt like he was getting a bit of a cold, his body was aching and eventually he went to hospital before coming home and saying, \"I\u2019ve got the worst headache ever\".\n\n\u2018He was one of these men who didn\u2019t take time off work but after he\u2019d had a shower, he said, \"I feel like I\u2019m having a heart attack\" and then, \"Go and drop me off at A&E\".'\n\nMr Miller spent three days in hospital before being discharged but remained in a poor condition and collapsed again three days later.\n\nThis time a haemotologist diagnosed blood clots on his kidneys, lungs and legs and he underwent five days of plasma exchange therapy.\n\nMrs Miller has kept his medical notes from the time, in which one doctor suggested the low levels of his blood platelets might have been neglected when first admitted to hospital.\n\nHe was returned home pending further treatment, only to collapse and die after going to take a shower on the morning of May 1 2021.\n\nNeil Miller's first death certificate said he died of ischaemic heart disease and rheumatoid arthritis but a second cited Vaccine-induced Immune Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (VITT)\n\nHis wife remembered: 'That morning he was feeling a bit better and said he\u2019d have a shower.\n\n'I was talking to my daughter, looking forward to the start of May and how his birthday was coming up and we\u2019d celebrated. The year before, in lockdown, it had been his 50th but we\u2019d have a party for his 51st.\n\n\u2018I was planning a party for him \u2013 he\u2019d be around his family, surrounded by people.\n\n\u2018Then I heard a thud and knew it was him. I couldn\u2019t open the bathroom door, he was lying in front of it \u2013 I don\u2019t know how I managed to get in, while my daughter rang 999 then came up too.\n\n\u2018We were both trying to give him CPR \u2013 my daughter\u2019s arms were bruised in the end. She would later say, \u201cMaybe I did something wrong\u201d. That mark has been left on my daughter, always thinking she couldn\u2019t save her dad.\n\n\u2018My son was playing football at the time. He said later his dad had rung him beforehand, saying: \"Have a good match, son.\" When he came home and saw the ambulances, he started shouting: \"They killed him, mum.\" Everything is so vivid in my mind.'\n\nWhen Mrs Miller received the first death certificate, she thought 'That's so wrong' when a Covid vaccine link was not mentioned as the cause of death - and was backed by her GP and other medics who had treated Mr Miller.\n\nShe said: 'I had to get Neil\u2019s medical records and it took about a year to get a second death certificate, this one mentioning the Covid vaccine.'\n\nKam Miller, pictured with late husband Neil, says too many families are having to endure similar lengthy battles for sufficient help, whether from health officials or the payments programme\n\nMrs Miller says too many families are having to endure similar lengthy battles for sufficient help, whether from health officials or the payments programme.\n\nShe said: 'We understand, with any new medication there\u2019s always a risk, but as long as there's support for those people adversely affected \u2013 it\u2019s like they don\u2019t want to know. It feels like we\u2019re forgotten people now.\n\nData acquired under the Freedom of Information Act at the end of November showed 188 people in Britain had received payouts for severe side effects from the vaccine, potentially adding up to \u00a322.56million if all receiving the full \u00a3120,000 payouts.\n\nThe awards were granted after applications to the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme (VDPS) which is operated by the NHS Business Services Authority.\n\nAlmost all of these payments were related to the AstraZeneca vaccine Vaxrevia which triggered a blood clotting complication so rare it was missed in original clinical trials.\n\nThat vaccine was once heralded as a 'triumph for British science' but came under increasing scrutiny for a very rare complication that causes blood clots and low blood platelet counts.\n\nThe jab, developed with Oxford University, can no longer be used in the European Union after AstraZeneca voluntarily withdrew its 'marketing authorisation' in May this year.\n\nAstraZeneca's withdrawal comes months after admitting in legal documents its jab can cause thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), also known as VITT.\n\nThese two death certificates, a year apart, show differing causes of death for Neil Miller, 50, from Leicester - his wife Kam pushed for his reaction to a Covid-19 vaccine to be highlighted\n\nThis is a medical condition where a person suffers blood clots along with a low platelet count, as Neil Miller did.\n\nThe latest figures show that of the 16,824 VDPS claims officially made so far, 8,018 were still awaiting an outcome - though the vast majority of the rest have been turned down.\n\nWhile some were rejected due to victims being unable to be prove their injuries were caused by a vaccine, at least 406 applicants were told it was because their injury did not meet a 60 per cent severe disability threshold.\n\nThe 60 per cent threshold, which covers injuries such as losing a limb, a sense like your sight, or complete paralysis, is one of many criticisms of the scheme.\n\nMrs Miller added: 'The Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme has never changed since the 1970s \u2013 it\u2019s a one-off payment of up to \u00a3120,000. That much for life, for a man who could have worked another 15 years at least. It\u2019s not sufficient.'\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just a one-off payment, it doesn\u2019t take anything else into account. And this judgment of disability \u2013 if you\u2019re deemed 60 per cent disabled you get something, if only 59 per cent then you don\u2019t.\n\n'Some people have given up. They haven\u2019t got the energy or strength to keep pushing, because they\u2019re already in and out of hospitals.\n\n'You really just want people to listen and see. You can\u2019t change what\u2019s happened, but we want a bit of humanity and thought for all these people.'\n\nCharlet Crichton (third from left), who founded the charity UKCVFamily for those affected by Covid vaccines, is pictured with fellow campaigners during a visit to talk to MPs in Westminster\n\nMs Crichton is currently working on her group's submissions to the next phase of the Covid public inquiry due to open in mid-January.\n\nShe said: 'People should be able to get help sooner if something like this happens again. We all know that things had to be done quickly but what we don\u2019t accept is that people who were injured or suffered haven\u2019t received adequate help or care.'\n\nShe had actually volunteered to work in a vaccination centre in Folkestone, Kent, during the initial rollout of Covid jabs and was training to be able to provide them herself.\n\nWhile helping steward people around the centre, she was told one day that if any supplies were still there that evening she could receive her first injection.\n\nMs Crichton recalled: 'I had a few symptoms in response \u2013 they weren\u2019t acute and life-changing at this point but I did feel extreme fatigue.\u2019\n\nBut it was after her second jab, again AstraZeneca, that she says her health deteriorated much more seriously.\n\nShe said: 'The week after that vaccine, I had a numbness that progressed up the body, I became incontinent, I had tremors. I would sleep all day.\n\n'There are all kinds of adverse reactions to AstraZeneca which have since been suggested to me \u2013 scarring on the heart, arrythmia, I\u2019ve had neuropathy diagnosed and sudden onset ME.\n\nData acquired under the Freedom of Information Act showed 188 people have been told they are eligible for the Vaccine Damage Payment, a \u00a3120,000 tax-free sum, due to Covid jab injuries\n\n'It\u2019s been severe enough to have ended my career. I have to take about 20 different tablets a day. It\u2019s been life-changing but many people have had conditions which are more severe.'\n\nHer NHS medical notes record how she suffered 'Adverse reaction to SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2) vaccine' and she was granted exemption from receiving any further Covid vaccines.\n\nHer UKCVFamily organisation is among those being backed by law firm Hudgells at the Covid inquiry, with Terry Wilcox from the firm saying: 'These are groups of people who had a Covid-19 vaccine to protect themselves during the pandemic and who unfortunately have suffered serious ill health since.\n\n'Some people have sadly died due to complications, deaths which have been recognised by medical professionals and the courts, to have been caused by the complications linked to the vaccines.\n\n'The development and roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines was of course crucial in helping the world emerge from the pandemic and to return to the normality we again enjoy today, but it is only right and proper that this inquiry fully explores the cases where vaccine damage has led to life-changing situations.'\n\nAnother of the patients to receive support from the group is Jennifer Furno, who received a bone marrow transplant earlier this year after being diagnosed with a form of blood cancer.\n\nShe believes her suffering began after receiving Covid vaccines back in 2021 - and that for too long her concerns about her declining health were not taken seriously enough.\n\nMs Furno, 38 and from Morpeth in Northumberland, had been working as a fraud investigator for a bank when she received her first AstraZeneca vaccine jab in March 2021 and a second four months later.\n\nBlood cancer sufferer Jennifer Furno is pictured having her head shave on the day she received a bone marrow transplant in July this year after finding a donor through the Anthony Nolan Trust\n\nShe said she began experiencing a tingling and numbness in her legs immediately after the the second, as well as gastric problems and mild rashes - before doctors then diagnosed a blood clot on her lung.\n\nShe said: 'At the time, they were very much that it was a coincidence. I thought, something\u2019s changed. I had trouble walking. I\u2019d been fit and healthy before and I was only 34 at the time.\u2019\n\nShe went ahead with a booster injection in November that year, however - this time a Moderna vaccine - and then that same month developed a pulmonary embolism on her left lung as well as severe rashes across her body.\n\nMs Furno said: 'I went to the GP and they said it was an over-active immune response.'\n\nShe was referred to a rheumatologist, as she continued to suffering swelling to her knees, joints, arms and neck.\n\nA series of blood tests and a skin biopsis showed features of vasculitis, a group of disorders which inflame and can destroy blood vessels.\n\nAmong the treatments she was given were immune suppressants but she says \u2018the skin rash got worse and worse', adding: 'I was convinced it was some sort of cancer. I felt so unwell.'\n\nAfter she had been diagnosed with vasculitis, a disorder involving the inflammation of blood vessels, one of the rheumatologists treating her wrote in December 2022: 'There does appear to be a temporal link between the onset of her symptoms and her first COVID-19 vaccine dose.'\n\nJennifer Furno, pictured in October this year, has urged people to sign up to the blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan Trust's stem cell register\n\n'I will complete a Yellow Card report regarding the possible link between the onset of her vasculitis and the COVID-19 vaccine.\u2019\n\nThe Yellow Card system is run by the MHRA and allows people to report not only vaccines but medicines, medical devices, blood products and e-cigarettes over concerns.\n\nEventually Ms Furno went to the private London Clinic after developing a rash all over her body in July 2023, using a work insurance scheme, and a skin biopsy there revealed she had cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, a form of blood cancer.\n\nMs Furno says rheumatologists told her it was \u2018aggressive\u2019 and that 'the vaccine is likely the causative thing, something like this it can trigger'.\n\nAfter an appeal through the Anthony Nolan Trust charity for people with blood cancer and blood disorders, an anonymous bone marrow donor was found in Belgium earlier this year and she had the transplant five months ago.\n\nShe said: 'I'm now cancer-free, vaccine-free \u2013 when you have a bone marrow transplant, it removes any vaccine you\u2019ve ever had.\n\n'At the moment I\u2019m still pretty fatigued. The recovery takes about 12 months. The new immune system has to grow. I\u2019m quite severely compromised.'\n\nMs Furno applied for compensation through the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme 18 months ago but has not yet had a decision.\n\nPictured: A syringe is filled with the Pfizer Covid vaccine in October 2021\n\nShe added: 'Whether or not I\u2019m going to be successful is anyone\u2019s guess. But I do want to raise people\u2019s awareness, of how frightening the situation is.\n\n\u2018Certainly hospitals and doctors are not believing young people who were fit and healthy before.\n\n\u2018Young people need to be listened to, and not judged as being health anxious. There needs to be less of a stigma about vaccine injuries and that it is recognised condition that needs treatment.\n\n\u2018Vaccine injuries can lead to other conditions including serious blood cancers and this needs to be recognised without judgement or prejudice by medical professionals.'\n\nShe also urged people to sign up to the Anthony Nolan Trust's stem cell register.\n\nAmong those who has been unsuccessful with a VDPS claim - and then had an appeal rejected - is former delivery driver Phil Wilson, 54, from Sheffield.\n\nThe VDPS medical assessment ruled but he was 'not severely disabled as a result of vaccination' but he remains convinced that having the vaccine has helped wreck his health.\n\nThe father-of-one, married for 19 years, began suffering problems after getting his third, booster jab - a Moderna vaccine - to enable him to go on a family skiing holiday in Andorra.\n\nPhil Wilson, 54, from Sheffield, regrets having a Covid booster jab to ensure he was able to go on a family holiday skiing trip to Andorra - he is seen here enjoying a previous break\n\nHe says he felt ill for 36 hours afterwards and then, after returning home from the trip, collapsed while coaching his son's football team three months later.\n\nHe suffered a bleed on the brain which led to a massive stroke, now leaving him disabled and unable to work.\n\nMr Wilson said: 'I had been driving a seven-and-a-half ton truck with 120 deliveries a day. I was playing football still, at the age of 52. I was a very fit bloke for my age before this.\n\n'When we got to half-time, I was feeling really strange, pins and needles down my right hand side.\n\n\u2018Before I knew it, I was in the back of an ambulance to hospital \u2013 they told me I had blood on the brain which led to a massive stroke.\n\n'That was two years ago and it\u2019s changed our lives massively. I firmly believe that the booster jab contributed to the blood on the brain.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m now unable to do what I could previously \u2013 I can\u2019t actually run. I hated running before bit now it\u2019s the one thing I want to be able to do. I have limited use of my right arm and right hand. I walk with a limp.'\n\nHe praised the NHS for their treatment, while recalling how he asked a surgeon whether the Covid jab might have been responsible.\n\nHe has told of now being left paralysed down his right-hand side after suffering a stroke as well as a bleed on his brain, being treated at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield\n\nMr Wilson said: 'He said there\u2019s no evidence either way but said it could be - they can\u2019t say either way, their hands are tired by the people above them.\n\n'I said, I\u2019ve had every test known to man \u2013 like an MOT on my body. Everything has come back spot-on, no underlying issues and no previous medical history.\n\n'The thing that frustrates me, the Covid jab we now know is dangerous has contributed to making me disabled \u2013 and many people worldwide. We just want some answers.'\n\nThose raising concerns about the impact they have suffered after receiving Covid vaccines have received backing from academics and health specialists.\n\nProf Beverley Hunt, an NHS consultant in thrombosis and haemostasis and chair of trustees of the charity Thrombosis UK, told MailOnline: 'As a country we did really well and saved many lives, but unfortunately people have been left with disabilities.\n\n'Many have suffered stroke-like symptoms, fatigue, not feeling right, and other conditions.'\n\nShe also expressed concerns about the damages scheme and how it only offers payments for people deemed to have 60 per cent disabilities as a result of a Covid vaccine.\n\nProf Hunt added: 'I really feel for these people who voluntarily had the vaccine to protect themselves and their families but now have these consequences.\n\n'They have physical suffering and a lot of them are clearly having psychological problems as well. They're in a horrid position.'\n\nAn AstraZeneca spokesperson said: 'Patient safety is our highest priority. From the body of evidence in clinical trials and real-world data, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has continuously been shown to have an acceptable safety profile and regulators around the world consistently state that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of extremely rare potential side effects.\n\n'We are incredibly proud of the role Vaxzevria played in ending the global pandemic. According to independent estimates, over 6.5million lives were saved in the first year of use alone and over 3billion doses were supplied globally.\n\n'Our efforts have been recognised by governments around the world and are widely regarded as being a critical component of ending the global pandemic.'\n\nMeanwhile, Oxford University's Dr Sonia Macleod, a senior research fellow in civil justice systems, said that reforms to how the Vaccine Damages Payment Scheme was operated were 'long overdue'.\n\nShe said: 'There needs to be an open discussion about what we as a society think this is for.\n\n'So many people don't feel it's open, they don't feel it's transparent - they fill in a form and it feels like it just disappears into a void.\n\n'The Covid pandemic had such a big impact on society and everyone wants to move on, but for some people it remains ongoing - the damage is still there.'\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: 'Our deepest sympathies are with all those affected.\n\n'The Health and Social Care Secretary has met with families of those who have suffered harm following Covid-19 vaccination and who have concerns with the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme, and agreed that the government will look closely at these concerns.'\n\nA spokesperson for the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said: 'Over 90 per cent of people aged 12 years and over in the UK have received a Covid-19 vaccine.\n\n'Vaccines are the best way to protect people from COVID-19 and have already saved millions of lives.\n\n'As part of our ongoing rigorous safety monitoring of Covid-19 vaccines, we closely review the Yellow Card reports submitted to us in the UK alongside safety data from other sources from the UK and internationally.\n\n'We also work closely with our UK public health partners to evaluate data on the safety and effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccines.\n\n'As with all vaccines and medicines, the safety of Covid-19 vaccines is continuously monitored, and we continue to keep emerging information under review.'\n\nMailOnline has also contacted for comment pharmaceutical firms Pfizer and Moderna, as well as the NHS Business Services Authority.",

            "content": "Novo Nordisk (NVO 1.98%) and AstraZeneca (AZN 1.55%) are among the largest companies in the pharmaceutical industry. Both have generally produced strong financial results in 2024, but one wouldn't know it by looking at their stock market performances. AstraZeneca's shares are down by 2% over the trailing-12-month period, while Novo Nordisk's shares are in the red by 14%.\n\nIt just so happens that these drugmakers have encountered issues in recent months that sank their stock prices, although there is a good chance they will recover and still deliver strong returns to patient investors. But which one is likely to perform better than the other? Let's find out.\n\nThe case for Novo Nordisk\n\nNovo Nordisk has been making breakthroughs in diabetes care for about 100 years. The company is still at it. As of August 2024, it had a 33.9% share of the diabetes care market, up from the 33.3% it held a year before. Novo Nordisk also boasted a 55.6% share of the GLP-1 drug space, compared to 54.4% as of August 2023. The company's most famous brands, Wegovy and Ozempic, are both GLP-1s. They have helped Novo Nordisk's financial results grow rapidly in recent years.\n\nNVO Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nThe weight loss market is projected to grow rapidly through the end of the decade. Few (if any) companies have a more attractive pipeline in this field than Novo Nordisk. True, one of the drugmaker's leading candidates, CagriSema, recently failed to impress investors in a phase 3 study. Upon closer inspection, though, Novo Nordisk's \"disappointing\" late-stage results for CagriSema weren't bad at all.\n\nIn fact, it could be the most effective weight loss treatment yet since it performed better than Wegovy in the trial against which it went head-to-head. CagriSema's 22.7% average weight loss by the end of the 68-week study was also better than what Eli Lilly's Zepbound accomplished in a similar trial. The market reacted the way it did because Novo Nordisk's management had promised a 25% average weight loss, but this miss means little to Novo Nordisk's long-term prospects.\n\nFurther, the company has several exciting candidates in other areas, including rare diseases and neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. So, despite its recent dip, Novo Nordisk remains an excellent pharmaceutical stock to buy and hold.\n\nThe case for AstraZeneca\n\nAstraZeneca's strategy is different from Novo Nordisk's. Whereas the latter derives most of its revenue from a few diabetes or obesity drugs, AstraZeneca has a large and diversified pipeline of medicines. The company's products span the field of oncology -- its most important and lucrative -- rare diseases; cardiovascular, renal, and metabolism; respiratory and immunology; and vaccine and immune therapies.\n\nThough the sale of COVID-19 products has somewhat disrupted AstraZeneca's revenue growth in recent years, it has generally been strong.\n\nAZN Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nFurther, AstraZeneca has plenty of exciting pipeline candidates. The company is also going after the weight loss area, with several promising candidates, though they are still in the early stages of development. Beyond that, AstraZeneca's pipeline is as diversified as its lineup with 199 programs. With strong financial results and a robust pipeline, why is AstraZeneca's stock not performing well? The company has been the subject of an insurance fraud investigation in China, one of its most important international markets.\n\nAlso, AstraZeneca's president in China, Leon Wang, was recently arrested by Chinese authorities for charges unrelated to the insurance fraud, or so the company believes. While this issue will affect AstraZeneca's sales in China and introduces some uncertainty in its short- to mid-term prospects, if it can get around this headwind, it could deliver excellent returns to long-term investors.\n\nThe verdict\n\nDespite higher quarterly revenue, AstraZeneca's earnings per share are lower.\n\nNVO Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nAlso, with Novo Nordisk's high-flying GLP-1 medicines -- and AstraZeneca's potentially lower sales in China in the coming quarters -- Novo Nordisk's revenue could grow faster than AstraZeneca's in the short to mid-term. Finally, Novo Nordisk's recent issue is less damaging to its prospects than AstraZeneca's. For all those reasons, the former looks like a far better buy than the latter right now.",

Pastrnak has recorded 30-32\u201462 in 51 career games against the Maple Leafs (regular season & playoffs combined), which is his most goals and points against any franchise. Meanwhile, Nylander has 12-16\u201428 in 45 regular-season and playoff games against the Bruins, tied for his fourth-most goals and points against one franchise.\n\n* Leon Draisaitl (5-18\u201423 in 10 GP) and Connor McDavid (7-11\u201418 in 11 GP) take to Hockey Night in Canada with the most and second-most career points against the Kraken among all players, respectively. The Oilers captain, however, has played in all 11 all-time meetings between Edmonton and Seattle, with the former holding a 9-2-0 advantage in those contests.

Hellebuyck (536 GP entering Saturday) can best the current mark set by Ryan Miller (566 GP on Oct. 28, 2014) and become the League\u2019s third-fastest netminder overall behind Andrei Vasilevskiy (490 GP on Nov. 14, 2024) and Jacques Plante (521 GP on Dec. 25, 1962).\n\n* The Avalanche (24-15-0, 48 points) put the NHL\u2019s longest active win streak on the line (6-0-0 since Dec. 19, 2024) when the club hosts the Canadiens (17-18-3, 37 points) \u2013 a team that finds itself within three points of a Wild Card position in the Eastern Conference. Colorado\u2019s string of success has benefited from at least five goals in each of its past four home games and they can extend the streak to five for the fifth time in franchise history (6 GP in 2021-22, 1985-86, 1983-84 & 5 GP in 1981-82).\n\n* Dustin Wolf (12-5-2, .914 SV%, 2.61 GAA, 2 SO) has been a key piece in Calgary\u2019s chase of a playoff position and has posted a 4-0-1 mark in his past five appearances. A seventh-round pick in the 2019 NHL Draft (No. 214), Wolf can become the first rookie goaltender in Flames franchise history to register 13 wins through his first 20 games of a season.",

A widening investigation by China regulators into alleged illegal drug imports, data breaches, and potential health insurance fraud has cast a shadow over the company\u2019s prospects in a critical market, triggering a securities class action lawsuit in the United States.\n\nHagens Berman has opened an investigation into the allegations and urges investors in AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 23, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 17, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Feb. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/azn\n\nContact the Firm Now: AZN@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nProbe Into AstraZeneca\u2019s China Operations\n\nThe probe conducted by China regulators, which reportedly centers on allegations that AstraZeneca employees improperly imported cancer medications like Enhertu and Imjudo from Hong Kong into mainland China and mishandled patient data, has been compounded by a broader investigation into a large-scale health insurance fraud case. The confluence of these issues has raised serious concerns among investors about the potential impact on the company\u2019s regional sales and overall financial performance.\n\nThe situation escalated with the arrest of Leon Wang, AstraZeneca\u2019s Executive Vice President International and China President. This development, coupled with internal forecasts predicting a downturn in sales within the Chinese market, has prompted a sharp investor reaction, culminating in the legal action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe AstraZeneca Securities Class Action Suit\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that AstraZeneca issued \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d and withheld crucial information regarding the company\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory risks in China. The complaint specifically accuses AstraZeneca of engaging in insurance fraud, facing heightened legal exposure that led to Mr. Wang\u2019s detention, understating the risks associated with its Chinese operations, and failing to disclose the potential for these issues to significantly harm its business and finances in the region.\n\nThe truth allegedly began to emerge in late October. On October 30, AstraZeneca announced that Mr. Wang was cooperating with a Chinese investigation, offering few details. This initial announcement triggered a 3 percent drop in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nThe situation worsened on November 5, when Yicai, a Chinese business news outlet, reported that dozens of AstraZeneca China executives were implicated in the investigation, with some potentially facing lengthy prison sentences. The report, citing an industry insider, attributed the alleged compliance issues to \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on sales representatives to meet aggressive sales targets. This news sent AstraZeneca\u2019s stock down another 7 percent.\n\nOn November 12, AstraZeneca confirmed Mr. Wang\u2019s detention and disclosed that the Chinese investigation encompassed allegations of medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation, and breaches of personal information.\n\nMore recently, on December 18, The Financial Times reported that AstraZeneca executives anticipate a decline in Chinese revenue due to the arrests of Mr. Wang and other senior executives. The report quoted an AstraZeneca executive who stated that \u201cdoctors are unwilling to interact with our salespeople and prescribe our medicines\u201d following the investigation, precipitating a further nearly 4 percent decline in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nHagens Berman Investigation\n\nThese events have prompted shareholder rights firm to open an investigation in the allegations.\n\n\u201cShould the allegations be confirmed, it suggests AstraZeneca misled investors about the true extent of its exposure in China, a failure with potentially serious consequences,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, an attorney leading the firm's investigation.\n\nIf you invested in AstraZeneca and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the AstraZeneca investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding AstraZeneca should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

Captioned Saleh v. AstraZeneca PLC, No. 24-cv-11021 (C.D. Cal.), the AstraZeneca class action lawsuit charges AstraZeneca and certain of AstraZeneca\u2019s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nIf you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the AstraZeneca class action lawsuit, please provide your information here:\n\nhttps://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-astrazeneca-plc-class-action-lawsuit-azn.html\n\nYou can also contact attorneys J.C.

            "content": "Innovation and Pipeline Success: For big drugmakers, an innovative pipeline is a competitive necessity and key to top-line growth. Pharma companies are constantly striving to ramp up innovation and spend a significantly high portion of their revenues on R&D. Successful innovation and product line extensions in important therapeutic areas, and strong clinical study results may act as important catalysts for these stocks.\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry comprises some of the largest global companies that developmulti-million dollar drugs for a broad range of therapeutic areas like neuroscience, cardiovascular and metabolism, rare diseases, immunology and oncology. Some of these companies also make vaccines, animal health products, medical devices and consumer-related healthcare products. These players invest millions of dollars in their product pipelines and line extensions of their already-marketed drugs. Continuous innovation is a defining characteristic of pharma companies, and these large drugmakers are constantly investing in drug development and the discovery of new medicines. Regular mergers and acquisitions and collaboration deals are other key features of large drug companies.\n\nThe drug and biotech industry had a tough time in the past couple of months after Trump announced the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, as the head of Health and Human Services, the agency that oversees the FDA. This, coupled with disappointing third-quarter sales and profits, guidance cuts, and pipeline setbacks took a toll on the overall drug and biotech industry\u2019s performance. However, the industry is expected to recover in 2025. Innovation is at its peak for the industry, with key spaces like rare diseases, next-generation oncology treatments, obesity, immunology and neuroscience attracting investor attention. R&D innovation is likely to remain a major focus area in 2025 as well. M&A activity is also expected to remain strong, particularly with Trump\u2019s return to the White House. Regular pipeline setbacks, slow ramp-up of newer drugs, patent cliffs, regulatory risks and macroeconomic pressure are some of the headwinds for the sector. Nonetheless, large drugmakers have several robust revenue streams and are mostly profitable companies, which makes them safe havens for investments. Among the large drugmakers, Eli Lilly LLY, J&J JNJ, AbbVie ABBV, AstraZeneca AZN and Pfizer PFE are worth retaining in one\u2019s portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAggressive M&A & Collaboration Activity: The sector is characterized by aggressive M&A activity. Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies, sitting on huge piles of cash, regularly buy innovative small/mid-cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines. Also, sloppy sales of mature drugs, dwindling in-house pipelines, government scrutiny of drug prices and the growing use of AI for drug discovery whet the M&A appetite of large drugmakers. Moreover, collaborations and partnerships with smaller companies are in full swing. Fast-growing and lucrative markets such as oncology, rare disease and cell and gene therapy are likely to remain focus areas for M&A activities. Of late, areas like obesity and inflammatory bowel disease are attracting buyout interest. Some of the larger M&A deals of 2024 were Eli Lilly\u2019s buyout of Morphic, Vertex\u2019s buyout of Alpine Immune Sciences and Novo Nordisk\u2019s acquisition of Catalent. M&A activity is expected to remain rampant in 2025.\n\nPipeline Setbacks & Other Headwinds: The failure of key pipeline candidates in pivotal studies and regulatory and pipeline delays can be setbacks for large drug companies and significantly hurt their share prices. Other headwinds for the industry include pricing and competitive pressure, generic competition for blockbuster treatments, a slowdown in sales of some of the most high-profile older drugs, Medicare drug price negotiations and increasing FTC scrutiny of M&A deals.\n\nMacroeconomic Uncertainty: Escalating geopolitical tensions in various parts of the world and their impact on global economic growth and macroeconomic uncertainty have increased broader economic woes.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates a Dim Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is a 12-stock group within the broader Medical sector. The group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks.\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #146, which places it in the bottom 41% of 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nBefore we present a few large drug stocks that are well-positioned to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook, let\u2019s take a look at the industry\u2019s performance and its current valuation.\n\nIndustry Versus S&P 500 & Sector\n\nThe industry has outpaced the Zacks Medical Sector but significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in the past year.\n\nStocks in this industry have collectively declined 1.2% in the past year compared with the Zacks Medical Sector\u2019s decrease of 6.1% in the said time frame. In contrast, the Zacks S&P 500 composite has risen 26.2%.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nBased on the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), a commonly used multiple for valuing large pharma companies, the industry is currently trading at 18.64X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 25.08X and the Zacks Medical Sector's 25.47X.\n\nOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 20.70X, as low as 13.31X and at a median of 15.31X, as the chart below shows.\n\nForward 12-Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio\n\n5 Large Drugmakers to Watch\n\nJ&J: Its biggest strength is its diversified business model. J&J\u2019s Innovative Medicines segment is showing a growth trend. J&J\u2019s outlook for 2025 looks positive. In 2025, the company expects sales in its Innovative Medicine unit to be more than its guidance of $57 billion. In its Innovative Medicine segment, growth is expected to be driven by its key products such as Darzalex, Tremfya, Erleada and others, as well as new drugs and new indications for Tremfya and Rybrevant.\n\nSales in J&J\u2019s MedTech unit slowed in 2024 on continued headwinds in Asia Pacific, specifically in China. Sales in China are being hurt by the impact of the volume-based procurement program and the anti-corruption campaign. However, in 2025, in MedTech, J&J expects operational sales growth to be at the upper end of its long-term (2022-2027) guided range of 5-7%, driven by the launch of new products and contributions from Abiomed and Shockwave acquisitions.\n\nThe company also has an interesting R&D pipeline that can generate innovative products and drive its growth further. Importantly, the visibility of potential resolutions to talc lawsuits has improved.\n\nJ&J is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 EPS has risen from $10.54 to $10.55 per share over the past 60 days. The stock has declined 10.2% in the past year.\n\nPrice and Consensus: JNJ\n\nPfizer: It is one of the largest and most successful drugmakers in the field of oncology. Its position in oncology was strengthened with the addition of Seagen in December 2023. After a couple of tough years, it seems that Pfizer\u2019s worst slowdown is over now, and the company is gradually making a comeback. Though COVID revenues are declining, Pfizer\u2019s non-COVID operational revenues improved in the first three quarters of 2024, driven by its key in-line products like Vyndaqel and Eliquis, new launches like Abrysvo, newly acquired products from Seagen.\n\nPfizer faces its share of challenges, the key being declining sales of its COVID-19 products. Pfizer also expects a significant impact from the loss of patent exclusivity in the 2026-2030 period, as several of its key products will face patent expirations. However, Pfizer\u2019s new products/late-stage pipeline candidates and newly acquired products, including those acquired from Seagen, position it strongly for operational growth in 2025 and beyond.\n\nAlso, Pfizer expects cost cuts and internal restructuring to deliver savings of at least $5.5 billion. Huge profits from its COVID products strengthened its cash position. The funds are being used to make acquisitions, increase dividends, buy back shares and reduce debt.\n\nPfizer has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 EPS has remained stable at $2.92 per share over the past 60 days. The stock has declined 10.8% in the past year.\n\nPrice and Consensus: PFE\n\nAbbVie: Sales of AbbVie\u2019s blockbuster drug, Humira, are declining due to loss of exclusivity and biosimilar erosion. However, AbbVie has successfully navigated Humira's loss of exclusivity by launching two other successful new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are performing extremely well, bolstered by approvals for new indications.\n\nStrong sales performance of drugs like Rinvoq, Skyrizi, Venclexta and Vraylar, coupled with significant contributions from newer drugs like Ubrelvy, Elahere, Epkinly and Qulipta, should keep driving the company\u2019s top line in 2025. However, AbbVie is seeing declining sales of Juvederm fillers in the United States and China, which will be a headwind in 2025.\n\nBoosted by its new product launches, AbbVie expects to return to robust mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR through the end of the decade.\n\nAbbVie has also been on an acquisition spree in the past couple of years, which is strengthening its pipeline. It has signed several M&A deals in the immunology space, its core area, while also signing some early-stage deals in oncology and neuroscience areas.\n\nAbbVie has a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nIn the past year, the stock has risen 10.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has risen from $12.17 to $12.27 per share over the past 60 days.\n\nPrice and Consensus: ABBV\n\nEli Lilly: It has seen stupendous success with its tirzepatide medicines, Mounjaro for type II diabetesand Zepbound for obesity. Despite a short time on the market, Mounjaro and Zepbound became key top-line drivers for Lilly in 2024, with demand rising rapidly. Though demand for the two drugs remains massive, Mounjaro and Zepbound\u2019s sales were hurt due to inventory issues in the third quarter. This led the shares of the company to drop after third-quarter results following a powerful first-half performance.\n\nNonetheless, the company is balancing the demand and supply of Mounjaro and Zepbound and the launch of the drugs in international markets. Lilly\u2019s efforts to increase demand activities for Mounjaro and Zepbound in the fourth quarter should benefit sales in 2025. The launch of Mounjaro in new international markets is expected to contribute to the drug\u2019s sales in the fourth quarter and in 2025.\n\nLilly\u2019s revenue growth is expected to continue to be driven by higher demand for Mounjaro, Zepbound, Verzenio and others, making up for the decline in sales from Trulicity. Other new drugs like Omvoh for ulcerative colitis, Jaypirca for mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Kisunla (donanemab) for early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease should support Lilly\u2019s top-line growth in 2025. Also, Lilly looks well placed to get approval for several new drugs and label expansions for marketed drugs, including Mounjaro and Zepbound, in the next few years.\n\nLilly is a #3 Ranked stock. Estimates for Lilly\u2019s 2025 earnings have risen from $23.78 to $24.05 per share over the past 60 days. Lilly\u2019s stock has risen 25% in the past year.\n\nPrice and Consensus: LLY\n\nAstraZeneca: It boasts a diversified geographical footprint as well as a product portfolio with several blockbuster medicines. AstraZeneca now has 12 blockbuster medicines in its portfolio, with sales exceeding $1 billion, including Tagrisso, Fasenra, Farxiga, Imfinzi, Lynparza, Soliris and Ultomiris. These drugs are driving the company\u2019s top line with AstraZeneca launching them in more markets and an increased number of indications.\n\nAstraZeneca has been making significant progress with its pipeline in areas like oncology, cardiovascular health, immunology and rare diseases. In 2024, it acquired small biotechs like Gracell, Fusion Pharmaceuticals and Amolyt to strengthen its pipeline.\n\nBacked by its new products and pipeline drugs, AstraZeneca believes it can post industry-leading top-line growth in the 2025-2030 period. AstraZeneca expects to generate$80 billion in total revenues by 2030. By the said time frame, AstraZeneca plans to launch 20 new medicines, with six new medicines already launched. It believes that many of these new medicines will have the potential to generate more than $5 billion in peak-year revenues. The company is also on target to achieve a mid-30s percentage core operating margin by 2026.\n\nAstraZeneca has a Zacks Rank #3 currently. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AstraZeneca\u2019s 2025 EPS has remained stable at $4.69 over the past 60 days. The stock has declined 4.1% in the past year.\n\nPrice and Consensus: AZN\n\n\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "AstraZeneca (AZN), John Wood (WG.), Revolution Beauty (REVB) and UK house prices\n\nInvestors puzzled by a share price decline for AstraZeneca (AZN) in the available trading days over Christmas, will not be surprised to learn that the answer was buried in a Christmas Eve press release. This revealed the drug giant, along with its development partner Daiichi Sankyo (JP:4568), had voluntarily withdrawn the EU marketing application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Deruxetan, an experimental precision drug for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nAstraZeneca decided to voluntarily withdraw the drug from consideration after the EMA reviewed the data and found that the results from the TROPION-Lung01 Phase III trial did not indicate significantly improved overall survival rates for patients. JH\n\nJohn Wood completes Ethos Energy sale\n\nJohn Wood (WG.) has completed the sale of its stake in Ethos Energy Group to One Equity Partners for a net consideration of $138mn (\u00a3110mn). The deal, which was first announced back in August 2024, is part of a divestment strategy aimed at hiving off non-core assets.\n\nWood owned 51 per cent of the Ethos Energy joint venture with its partner, Siemens Energy (DE:ENR). The company, a producer of rotating equipment such as turbines, contributed around $34mn to Wood Group\u2019s adjusted cash profits in 2023. MR\n\nRevolution settles with Chrysalis Revolution Beauty (REVB) has reached a settlement with fund manager Chrysalis Investments (CHRY) that staves off the threat of legal action. Chrysalis had begun proceedings against Revolution last year, blaming \u201cmisstatements and material omissions\u201d in Revolution\u2019s accounts for a loss it incurred through investing in the company\u2019s shares. It paid \u00a345mn for a stake in Revolution in July 2021 and sold the shares for \u00a35.7mn in late 2022 after auditor BDO revealed \u201cserious concerns\u201d around the company\u2019s revenue recognition and bad debt provision, which led to it incurring significant losses. Chrysalis said in April last year that it was seeking around \u00a345mn from Revolution Beauty. Although the terms of the settlement are confidential, Revolution is paying a \u201cnon-material sum\u201d to Chrysalis, which the latter said is \u201cless than 1 per cent\u201d of its current market capitalisation (of \u00a3600mn).

We don\u2019t listen to women\u2019s symptoms or take them as seriously and it can be challenging,\u201d Erin D. Michos, MD, MHS, FAHA, FACC, FASE, FASPC, professor of medicine and director of Women\u2019s Cardiovascular Health at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said during a presentation at the World Congress on Insulin Resistance, Diabetes & Cardiovascular Disease.\n\nData derived from Michos E. Session 3: HFpEF in women: Sex specific differences and response to therapies. Presented at: World Congress on Insulin Resistance, Diabetes & Cardiovascular Disease; Dec. 12-14, 2024; Los Angeles.\n\nSex-specific differences in presentation, diagnosis\n\nHFpEF incidence is rising relative to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, Michos said, but HFpEF prevalence is higher among women. About 24% of women will develop heart failure with a higher prevalence of preserved ejection vs. reduced ejection fraction, according to Michos, whereas men have similar risk for heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction. In addition, Michos noted, women have a steeper increase in HFpEF prevalence as they age compared with men.\n\nBoth obesity and diabetes have greater population attributable risk for HFpEF for women vs. men, Michos said. Approximately two-thirds of the population attributable risk is tied to hypertension and obesity while one-fourth is tied to diabetes and coronary heart disease.\n\nIn addition to traditional risk factors, preeclampsia and infertility are female-specific risk factors for incident HFpEF, Michos said.\n\nIn a pooled analysis published in Circulation: Heart Failure, researchers observed a higher likelihood of being older, having hypertension and obesity, having poorer quality of life and more evidence of congestion for women compared with men.\n\n\u201c[Women also] have sex-specific echo findings, more concentric remodeling and more impaired diastolic dysfunction,\u201d Michos said. \u201cWhen we talk about these measures for diastolic dysfunction, we don\u2019t have sex-specific thresholds and maybe we should.\u201d\n\nSex-specific treatment responses\n\nCurrent treatments for HFpEF for women include angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.\n\nResults of the PARAGON-HF trial, published in Circulation, demonstrated that women treated with the angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto, Novartis) had lower risk for heart failure hospitalization vs. men with similar adverse events.\n\nFor mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, an analysis from TOPCAT found that women with HFpEF treated with spironolactone had lower all-cause mortality vs. men. In addition, in FINEARTS-HF, finerenone (Kerendia, Bayer) resulted in reduced worsening heart failure events similarly for both men and women with additional similar tolerability and quality of life improvements.\n\nSGLT2 inhibitors were the first therapy to conclusively show benefit for people with HFpEF. The EMPEROR-Preserved study demonstrated that women treated with empagliflozin (Jardiance, Boehringer Ingelheim/Eli Lilly) had the lowest incident of heart failure events, but there was no sex interaction. Both men and women benefited equally from empagliflozin treatment with similar quality of life and psychologic variable improvements. Similar results were observed with treatment with dapagliflozin (Farxiga, AstraZeneca) in the DELIVER trial. A pooled analysis of all SGLT2 inhibitor data also showed that women benefited similarly across cardiometabolic indications, suggesting that this treatment should be considered for those at high CV risk, irrespective of sex.\n\n\u201cIn women with HFpEF, obesity is more prevalent compared with men,\u201d Michos said. \u201cIndividuals with the obesity phenotype have increased plasma volume, increased stress volume, more concentric remodeling, a higher prevalence of hypertension, more right ventricle dysfunction, more epicardial fat thickness and they are more diuretic resistant. With this obesity phenotype of HFpEF, they have more symptoms and poor quality of life, and we think obesity is playing a direct pathological role in the genesis and progression of HFpEF.\u201d\n\nIn the STEP-HFpEF trials of semaglutide (Wegovy, Novo Nordisk), researchers observed a higher body weight reduction among women vs. men (mean difference, 9.6% vs. 7.2%; P = .006), but similar improvements in quality of life scores, suggesting that semaglutide may have a weight-independent effect on disease. These results were supported by a pooled analysis of SELECT, FLOW and STEP-HFpEF trials in which semaglutide reduced CV death or heart failure events by 31% overall with no sex interactions. Treatment with tirzepatide (Zepbound, Eli Lilly) in the SUMMIT trial also resulted in similar results with a 38% reduction in CV death or worsening heart failure with no sex interaction, Michos said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical and important to diagnose HFpEF and initiate guideline-directed medical therapy equitably across both sexes,\u201d Michos said. \u201cA lot of HFpEF is underdiagnosed, and with all these therapies we have now to help HFpEF, we really need to be diagnosing HFpEF better.\u201d\n\nReferences:",

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AstraZeneca, the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant, has seen its stock price tumble 15 percent over the past six months, buffeted by a series of unsettling reports emanating from China. A widening investigation by China regulators into alleged illegal drug imports, data breaches, and potential health insurance fraud has cast a shadow over the company\u2019s prospects in a critical market, triggering a securities class action lawsuit in the United States.\n\nHagens Berman has opened an investigation into the allegations and urges investors in AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 23, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 17, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Feb. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/azn\n\nContact the Firm Now: AZN@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nProbe Into AstraZeneca\u2019s China Operations\n\nThe probe conducted by China regulators, which reportedly centers on allegations that AstraZeneca employees improperly imported cancer medications like Enhertu and Imjudo from Hong Kong into mainland China and mishandled patient data, has been compounded by a broader investigation into a large-scale health insurance fraud case. The confluence of these issues has raised serious concerns among investors about the potential impact on the company\u2019s regional sales and overall financial performance.\n\nThe situation escalated with the arrest of Leon Wang, AstraZeneca\u2019s Executive Vice President International and China President. This development, coupled with internal forecasts predicting a downturn in sales within the Chinese market, has prompted a sharp investor reaction, culminating in the legal action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe AstraZeneca Securities Class Action Suit\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that AstraZeneca issued \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d and withheld crucial information regarding the company\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory risks in China. The complaint specifically accuses AstraZeneca of engaging in insurance fraud, facing heightened legal exposure that led to Mr. Wang\u2019s detention, understating the risks associated with its Chinese operations, and failing to disclose the potential for these issues to significantly harm its business and finances in the region.\n\nThe truth allegedly began to emerge in late October. On October 30, AstraZeneca announced that Mr. Wang was cooperating with a Chinese investigation, offering few details. This initial announcement triggered a 3 percent drop in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nThe situation worsened on November 5, when Yicai, a Chinese business news outlet, reported that dozens of AstraZeneca China executives were implicated in the investigation, with some potentially facing lengthy prison sentences. The report, citing an industry insider, attributed the alleged compliance issues to \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on sales representatives to meet aggressive sales targets. This news sent AstraZeneca\u2019s stock down another 7 percent.\n\nOn November 12, AstraZeneca confirmed Mr. Wang\u2019s detention and disclosed that the Chinese investigation encompassed allegations of medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation, and breaches of personal information.\n\nMore recently, on December 18, The Financial Times reported that AstraZeneca executives anticipate a decline in Chinese revenue due to the arrests of Mr. Wang and other senior executives. The report quoted an AstraZeneca executive who stated that \u201cdoctors are unwilling to interact with our salespeople and prescribe our medicines\u201d following the investigation, precipitating a further nearly 4 percent decline in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nHagens Berman Investigation\n\nThese events have prompted shareholder rights firm to open an investigation in the allegations.\n\n\u201cShould the allegations be confirmed, it suggests AstraZeneca misled investors about the true extent of its exposure in China, a failure with potentially serious consequences,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, an attorney leading the firm's investigation.\n\nIf you invested in AstraZeneca and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the AstraZeneca investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding AstraZeneca should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.

This acceptance also triggers a milestone payment from AstraZeneca.\n\nThe NDA is supported by data from SACHI, a multi-center, open-label, randomized, controlled, Phase III trial which evaluated the efficacy and safety of a combination of ORPATHYS\u00ae and TAGRISSO\u00ae compared to platinum-based doublet-chemotherapy (pemetrexed plus cisplatin or carboplatin), the standard-of-care treatment option in this setting. The primary endpoint of the study was progression free survival (\u201cPFS\u201d) as assessed by investigators. Other endpoints include PFS assessed by an independent review committee, overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), disease control rate (DCR), time to response (TTR), and safety. The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (\u201cIDMC\u201d) of SACHI has considered that the study has met the pre-defined primary endpoint of PFS in a planned interim analysis and as a result, enrollment into the study has concluded. Results from SACHI will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific conference (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT05015608).\n\n\u201cThis marks the first regulatory filing for the ORPATHYS\u00ae and TAGRISSO\u00ae combination. The combination has demonstrated clear evidence to address MET-driven EGFR-inhibitor resistance and offers a continued path for oral treatment,\u201d said Dr Michael Shi, Head of R&D and Chief Medical Officer of HUTCHMED. \u201cWith our biomarker-specific approach, we are hopeful to enhance treatment continuity and quality of life for NSCLC patients navigating this challenging journey. We and our partner AstraZeneca have been exploring this combination globally, through an array of late-stage clinical trials including the TATTON, SAVANNAH, SAFFRON and ORCHARD studies, and we hope to bring this all-oral, chemotherapy-free treatment option to patients with MET-driven lung cancer in the near future.\u201d\n\nThe NMPA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to the combination of ORPATHYS\u00ae and TAGRISSO\u00ae for this potential indication in December 2024. The NMPA granted this designation to this combination as a new treatment that could target a serious condition where clinical evidence demonstrates substantial advantages over existing therapies.\n\nAbout NSCLC and MET aberrations\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, accounting for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.1 Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and small cell lung cancer, with 80-85% classified as NSCLC.2 The majority of NSCLC patients (approximately 75%) are diagnosed with advanced disease, and approximately 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and Europe and 30-40% of patients in Asia have EGFR-mutated (\u201cEGFRm\u201d) NSCLC.3,4,5,6\n\nMET is a tyrosine kinase receptor that has an essential role in normal cell development.7 MET overexpression and/or amplification can lead to tumor growth and the metastatic progression of cancer cells, and is one of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKI for metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC.7,8 Approximately 2-3% of NSCLC patients have tumors with MET exon 14 skipping alterations, a targetable mutation in the MET gene.9 MET aberration is a major mechanism for acquired resistance to both first/second-generation EGFR TKIs as well as third-generation EGFR TKIs like osimertinib. Among patients who experience disease progression post-osimertinib treatment, approximately 15-50% present with MET aberration.10,11,12,13,14 The prevalence of MET aberration depends on the sample type, detection method and assay thresholds used.15\n\nAbout ORPATHYS\u00ae and TAGRISSO\u00ae Combination Development in EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC\n\nThe combination of ORPATHYS\u00ae and TAGRISSO\u00ae has been studied extensively in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC, including the TATTON (NCT02143466) and SAVANNAH (NCT03778229) studies. The encouraging results from these studies led to the initiation of three Phase III trials with this combination: SACHI (NCT05015608) and SANOVO (NCT05009836) were initiated in China in 2021, and the global, pivotal Phase III SAFFRON (NCT05261399) study started enrollment in 2022. In comparison to other treatment options, this combination treatment is chemotherapy-free, biomarker-specific and orally administered, aiming for a balanced efficacy, safety and quality-of-life profile for lung cancer patients.\n\nSAVANNAH is a global Phase II study in patients who have progressed following osimertinib due to MET amplification or overexpression, and recruitment completed earlier in 2024. The evaluation of savolitinib in combination with osimertinib was designated as a Fast Track development program by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2023.\n\nSAFFRON is a multi-center, randomized, controlled, open-label, global Phase III trial in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC with MET overexpression and/or amplification after disease progression on osimertinib.\n\nSACHI is a multi-center, randomized, controlled, open-label, China Phase III trial in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC with MET amplification after disease progression on any EGFR inhibitor therapy, including third-generation EGFR-TKIs such as osimertinib.\n\nSANOVO is a multi-center, randomized, controlled, blinded, China Phase III trial in treatment-na\u00efve patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC with MET-positive tumors.\n\nAbout ORPATHYS\u00ae Approval in China\n\nORPATHYS\u00ae was granted conditional approval in China for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with MET exon 14 skipping alterations who have progressed following prior systemic therapy or are unable to receive chemotherapy. ORPATHYS\u00ae is the first selective MET inhibitor approved in China. It has been included in the National Reimbursement Drug List of China (NRDL) since March 2023. A supplementary NDA is under review which, if approved, could expand this indication to include treatment-na\u00efve adult patients in China. More than a third of the world\u2019s lung cancer patients are in China and, among those with NSCLC globally, approximately 2-3% have tumors with MET exon 14 skipping alterations.\n\nAbout ORPATHYS\u00ae (savolitinib)\n\nORPATHYS\u00ae is an oral, potent and highly selective MET TKI that has demonstrated clinical activity in advanced solid tumors. It blocks atypical activation of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase pathway that occurs because of mutations (such as exon 14 skipping alterations or other point mutations), gene amplification or protein overexpression.\n\nORPATHYS\u00ae is marketed in China and is currently under clinical development for multiple tumor types, including lung, kidney and gastric cancers, as a single treatment and in combination with other medicines.\n\nIn 2011, AstraZeneca and HUTCHMED entered a global licensing and collaboration agreement to jointly develop and commercialize ORPATHYS\u00ae. Joint development of ORPATHYS\u00ae in China is led by HUTCHMED, while AstraZeneca leads development outside of China. HUTCHMED is responsible for the marketing authorization, manufacturing and supply of ORPATHYS\u00ae in China. AstraZeneca is responsible for the commercialization of ORPATHYS\u00ae in China and worldwide. Sales of ORPATHYS\u00ae are recognized by AstraZeneca.\n\nAbout TAGRISSO\u00ae\n\nTAGRISSO\u00ae (osimertinib) is a third-generation, irreversible EGFR-TKI with proven clinical activity in NSCLC, including against central nervous system (CNS) metastases. TAGRISSO\u00ae (40mg and 80mg once-daily oral tablets) has been used to treat nearly 800,000 patients across its indications worldwide and AstraZeneca continues to explore TAGRISSO\u00ae as a treatment for patients across multiple stages of EGFRm NSCLC.\n\nThere is an extensive body of evidence supporting the use of TAGRISSO\u00ae as standard of care in EGFRm NSCLC. TAGRISSO\u00ae improved patient outcomes in early-stage disease in the ADAURA Phase III trial, locally advanced disease in the LAURA Phase III trial, late-stage disease in the FLAURA Phase III trial, and with chemotherapy in the FLAURA2 Phase III trial.\n\nAbout HUTCHMED\n\nHUTCHMED (Nasdaq/AIM:\u200bHCM; HKEX:\u200b13) is an innovative, commercial-stage, biopharmaceutical company. It is committed to the discovery, global development and commercialization of targeted therapies and immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer and immunological diseases.

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Biopharmaceutical firm Hutchmed China Ltd., backed by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, saw its shares rally on Thursday morning after announcing it will divest shares in a joint venture for about $608 million to sharpen focus on its core business of developing novel cancer therapies.\n\nHutchmed, whose biggest shareholder is Li\u2019s flagship conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd., will sell a combined 45% interest in Shanghai Hutchison Pharmaceuticals Ltd. to Chinese companies GP Health Service Capital Co. and Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co., according to stock exchange filings Wednesday.\n\nShares jumped as much as 12% Thursday morning, the most since March 13, before paring gains.\n\nShanghai Pharma, which already owns 50% of shares in the target company, will hold 60% interest in the target company after the transaction, according to the filings. Hutchmed is required to pay compensation to the buyers if the target company doesn\u2019t meet certain profit thresholds.\n\nFacing a challenging capital market, Hutchmed has sought to balance investments in innovative technologies with its stated goal of becoming profitable in 2025. With three internally-discovered medicines marketed in China, it is building on momentum around Fruzaqla, its first cancer drug that broke into developed markets like the US, Europe and Japan via a partnership with Japanese pharmaceutical giant Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.\n\nFruzaqla, which treats colorectal cancer, delivered $203 million in net sales in the first nine months of 2024, triggering a $20 million milestone payment to Hutchmed in October.\n\nShanghai Hutchison Pharmaceuticals was established in 2001 to manufacture and sell branded prescription drugs, predominantly for cardiovascular diseases.\n\nHutchmed expects to record a gain of about $477 million before tax from the deal, which will be reinvested into developing its core businesses including targeted therapies for treating cancer and immunological diseases, the company said in its statement.\n\nLike many other Chinese drugmakers, Hutchmed is developing antibody-drug conjugates, a powerful and selective type of cancer treatment that global leaders from AstraZeneca Plc to Pfizer Inc have bet heavily on. The gold rush has led to a cadre of biopharma companies sourcing assets from China, the latest being Roche\u2019s licensing deal with Innovent Biologics Inc.\n\nHutchmed is planning clinical trials for the first of its antibody-targeted therapy conjugates in the second half of 2025.\n\n(Updated with share move and additional information throughout.)\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "content": "Here are some of the key statistics and trends for migrants who arrived in the UK in 2024 after crossing the English Channel in small boats.\n\n\u2013 How many migrants arrived in 2024?\n\nA total of 36,816 people were detected crossing the Channel in small boats during 2024, according to provisional figures from the Home Office.\n\nThis is 25% higher than the 29,437 people who arrived in 2023, but 20% lower than the 45,774 arrivals in 2022, which was the highest for a calendar year since data on Channel crossings began in 2018.\n\n\u2013 How has the number of arrivals changed over time?\n\nThe total was lower in 2018 (299) and 2019 (1,843), before climbing to 8,466 in 2020, 28,526 in 2021 and a record 45,774 in 2022.\n\nIt then fell in 2023 to 29,437, before rising in 2024 to 36,816.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\u2013 Is there any clear trend in the number of arrivals before and after the 2024 general election?\n\nSome 13,574 migrants arrived in the UK between the start of 2024 and the general election on July 5, according to analysis of Home Office data by the PA news agency.\n\nIt was a record number for this period of the year and was 19% higher than the 11,433 who arrived between January 1 and July 5 in 2023, as well as being 5% higher than the 12.900 who arrived in the equivalent period in 2022.\n\nThe number of arrivals between the general election and the end of 2024 was also higher than the equivalent period in 2023, but lower than the figure for 2022.\n\nSome 23,242 migrants arrived between July 5 and December 31 2024, up 29% on the 18,004 arrivals in this period in 2023 and down 29% on the 32,855 in 2022.\n\n\u2013 How many people made the crossing per boat?\n\nAn average of 53 migrants arrived per boat in 2024, up from 49 in 2023.\n\nThe figure has been on a steady upwards trend since data was first recorded in 2018, when the average for the year was seven.\n\nIt rose to 11 per boat in 2019, 13 in 2020, 28 in 2021 and 41 in 2022.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\u2013 Where have the people come from?\n\nAfghan migrants accounted for the single largest group of arrivals in the first nine months of 2024, making up 17% of the total.\n\nThis was followed by people from Vietnam (13%), Iran (12%) and Syria (12%).\n\nThese are the latest figures available for the nationality of arrivals.\n\nThe breakdown of nationalities for 2024 is different to that for 2023.\n\nVietnamese migrants accounted for only 5% of arrivals across the whole of 2023, well below the January-September 2024 figure of 13%.\n\nAfghan was the leading nationality in 2023, responsible for 19% of all arrivals, slightly higher than the 2024 figure of 17%.\n\nIn 2022, Vietnam accounted for just 1% of arrivals and Afghanistan was responsible for 20%, while the main nationality was Albanian, which accounted for 28% of the total.\n\nBy contrast, only 2% of arrivals in January to September 2024 were Albanian.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\u2013 Why has the mix of nationalities changed?\n\nFollowing the spike in summer 2022 in the number of Albanians arriving in the UK on small boats, the governments of both countries struck an agreement to work together to prevent people from making the journey.\n\nThis included placing UK Border Force staff in Tirana airport in the capital of Albania, an exchange of senior police officers and the creation of a joint migration task force.\n\nIt is likely this contributed to the large drop in Albanians arriving by small boats, down from 12,658 in 2022 to 927 in 2023: a fall of 93%.\n\nIn response to the jump in 2024 in arrivals of Vietnamese nationals, in April the then Conservative government signed an agreement with Vietnam to step up efforts to discourage illegal travel to the UK.\n\nThe two countries committed to develop a joint action plan to tackle human trafficking, as well as increase intelligence-sharing and raise awareness of legal routes for migration.\n\nThe mix of nationalities of people arriving on small boats has varied from year to year.\n\nFor example, Iranians and Iraqis together accounted for more than half of arrivals in 2021 (30% and 22% respectively).\n\nBut since then the proportion of arrivals who are from Iran has dropped sharply, to 13% in 2022 and 2023 and 12% in January to September 2024.\n\nThe proportion of arrivals from Iraq has fallen even lower, dropping to 10% in 2022, 9% in 2023 and 7% in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nAll figures are based on the total number of arrivals where nationality has been recorded by the Home Office.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\u2013 How many have applied for asylum?\n\nThe latest available Home Office data for asylum claims by small boat arrivals runs to September 2024.\n\nIt shows that in the year to September 30 2024, almost all arrivals (99%) made an asylum claim, either as a main applicant or dependant.\n\nSmall boat arrivals accounted for nearly three in 10 (28%) of the total number of people claiming asylum in the UK in this period.\n\nThere were 128,503 asylum applications from small boat arrivals between January 2018 and June 2024, of which 48% (62,313) had received an initial decision as of October 11 2024.\n\nOf these, 43,464 had been granted asylum or some other protection status, while 18,849 were refused.\n\nThe asylum grant rate for the year to September 2024 varied considerably for different nationalities.\n\nAmong the top 10 most common nationalities, the grant rate was highest for applications from Syrians and Sudanese (both 99%) and Eritreans (93%), and lowest for Albanians (2%) and Turks (23%).\n\n\u2013 How many have been returned to their country of origin?\n\nSome 4,420 migrants who arrived by small boat were returned between January 2018 and September 2024, 3% of the total number of arrivals.\n\nIn the year to September 2024, 2,376 arrivals were returned, up from 1,551 in the previous 12 months.\n\nNearly nine in 10 (87%) of small boat returns in the year to September were Albanian nationals.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\u2013 How many migrants died while trying to cross the Channel?\n\nSome 53 deaths were recorded in 2024 by French coastguard authorities.\n\nThese are people who are believed to have died while attempting to cross the Channel in a small boat.",

            "content": "Dublin, Dec. 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Oncology Pharmaceuticals Market\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe global market for oncology pharmaceuticals was valued at $196.4 billion in 2023. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.7% to reach $401.4 billion by the end of 2029.\n\nThis report seeks to deliver an in-depth analysis of the worldwide oncology pharmaceuticals (cancer medications) market. It includes a thorough overview of various types of oncology drugs, such as targeted therapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy, and an examination of current and historical market revenues.\n\nSeveral factors make the oncology pharmaceutical industry a prime candidate for growth. The oncology pharmaceuticals market is a dynamic and quickly changing sector within the global pharmaceuticals industry. The main priorities of this market are the development, manufacture, and marketing of medications used to treat cancer. It is anticipated to keep expanding due to continuous scientific and technological breakthroughs. Novel immunotherapies and CAR-T cell therapy are emerging treatments that can completely transform how cancer is treated. However, to ensure that new therapies help a wide range of patients, it will be imperative to address issues about drug affordability and accessibility.\n\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry's pipeline and portfolio in oncology is among the most diverse due to its strong emphasis on research. Over time, improved methods of screening, diagnosis, surgery, and radiation therapy, along with rapidly growing options for systemic treatment, have improved the prognosis for many cancers.\n\n\n\nGlobal funding for cancer research has increased dramatically over the past 20 years, and the rate at which new drugs are being developed has not slowed. The FDA approved 161 new cancer therapeutics between 2017 and 2022 for various solid tumor malignancies and indications. The arsenal of cancer treatments is growing at a very rapid pace, which has led to a significant increase in treatment and regulatory complexity. Cancer treatment is now far more expensive for patients and healthcare systems due to the high cost of many new medications. These difficulties and expenses go beyond solid adult cancers to the pediatric and hematology/oncology fields.\n\n\n\nTargeted therapy holds a significant market share regarding medication class, and new precision medicine techniques are emerging from an improved molecular understanding of cancer. As the incidence of breast cancer rises worldwide, pharmaceutical companies are focusing more and more on early diagnosis and treatment options.\n\n\n\nReport Scope\n\n\n\nThe oncology pharmaceuticals market is further categorized by indication, including lung cancer, multiple myeloma, breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and other types of cancer. Additionally, the report presents the market revenue for each geographic region, including North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Rest of the World (RoW).\n\n\n\nIn order to provide an in-depth understanding of the market, this report also includes profiles of market participants, the competitive landscape, key competitors, and respective market share/ranking. This report includes an oncology pharmaceuticals pipeline analysis, patent analysis, and a detailed discussion of key marketed products. This report outlines the driving and restraining factors of the oncology pharmaceuticals market.\n\n\n\nBy geography, the market in this report is segmented into four regions: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Rest of the World (RoW).

            "content": "As we look ahead to 2025, Barclays is feeling positive about the stock market. Despite a few bumps on the horizon, they believe global shares are still a better bet than bonds or cash. If you\u2019re looking to grow your money in the year ahead, Barclays has picked out three stocks they think are worth buying \u2014 all with big potential for growth according to CNBC.\n\nBarclays\u2019 picks for 2025 are a mix of energy, pharma, and tech stocks \u2014 each with solid potential for growth. Whether you\u2019re into big names like Shell, looking for pharma breakthroughs with AstraZeneca, or eyeing the booming tech sector with Besi, these stocks could help your portfolio grow next year or start it if you are looking to get into investing. If you\u2019re thinking about where to invest, these three could be worth a closer look.\n\nImage: PA Wire/PA Images) PA Wire/PA Images)\n\nShell\n\nInstead of forking out money for oil and gas, there\u2019s a chance to make a big win in the energy sector with Shell, the oil and gas giant. Barclays is confident in the stock, with a target price of \u00a336 ($45.60), meaning they think it could rise by around 40%. The reason? Shell is doing well on the operational side, making plenty of cash, and rewarding shareholders with dividends and buybacks.\n\nExperts at Barclays say Shell is undervalued at the moment and is offering solid growth potential for 2025. They expect Shell to generate around $23 billion in free cash flow, which gives the company plenty of room to pay out dividends to investors and buy back shares. If you\u2019re looking for a safe bet with some decent growth potential, Shell could be a good pick.\n\nAstraZeneca\n\nYes, you probably know this company's name from the pandemic, AstraZeneca, the pharmaceutical company has been making waves in the healthcare world. Barclays believes the company is set to have a breakthrough year in 2025. AstraZeneca has set an ambitious target of $80 billion in revenue by 2030 \u2014 $10 billion more than previously expected. Shares are currently trading at a discount compared to the last five years, which Barclays sees as a great opportunity for investors.\n\nBE Semiconductor Industries\n\nThe final pick is BE Semiconductor Industries (Besi), a tech company that supplies equipment for making semiconductors (the little chips that power everything from smartphones to cars). Barclays sees Besi as a stock with strong growth potential, especially as the industry pushes for new technology to improve chip performance.\n\nWhile Besi\u2019s stock is priced higher than some of its competitors, Barclays believes the company\u2019s leadership in advanced packaging and other cutting-edge tech justifies the price. They\u2019ve set a target price of 160 euros ($169.50), giving it around 44% growth potential.\n\nBefore you dive in, it\u2019s crucial to think about how much you're prepared to lose \u2014 because all investments come with risks. If you're just starting out, it\u2019s a good idea to chat with a financial advisor to make sure you're making the right moves for your money. Please invest responsibly.",

In both the placebo group and treatment group, adverse events occurred in 24% of patients.\n\nThe Latest\n\nThe ADRIATIC trial, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind phase 3 study, investigated the effects of AstraZeneca\u2019s PD-L1 inhibitor Imfinzi (durvalumab) in patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer and prior chemotherapy treatment. Results from the ADRIATIC trial demonstrate that Imfinzi met its primary outcomes of prolonging progression-free survival and overall survival compared to placebo-controlled patients. 46% of patients receiving Imfinzi had no disease progression after two years, compared to only 34% of patients in the placebo group. Patients receiving Imfinzi had estimated survival of 55.9 months compared to 33.4 months for placebo patients. The occurrence of adverse events was similar between patients receiving Imfinzi (24.4%) and placebo (24.2%). 16.4% of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse effects. Death was reported in 2.7% of patients compared to 1.9% in the placebo group.\n\nPhysician\u2019s Perspective\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. It is classified into two histological categories: non-small cell lung cancer or small cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer is further divided into limited or extensive stages, which indicate the extent to which the cancer has spread in the lungs, lymph nodes, and rest of the body. Limited-stage small cell lung cancer is an aggressive cancer with a survival rate between 15% and 30%. Despite existing treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation, small cell lung cancer has high relapse and mortality rates. Novel immunotherapies, like Imfinzi, are targeted to attack specific proteins found in the cancer cells. By inhibiting proteins that give cancer cells survival advantages, these drugs improve the immune system\u2019s ability to attack the cancer cells and therefore slow tumor progression.\n\nMolecular Targets\n\nImfinzi is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, an immune system protein that is programmed to bind the PD-L1 protein found in lung cancer cells. Once bound, it prevents PD-L1 from interacting with other proteins that enable the cancer cells to evade the immune system. Inhibiting these functions allows the body\u2019s immune cells, known as T cells, to kill the cancer cells. Imfinzi is classified as an immune checkpoint inhibitor because it blocks PD-L1, the checkpoint protein, from avoiding immune attack.\n\nCompany History\n\nImfinzi was developed by AstraZeneca, a multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology company. AstraZeneca has manufactured other lung cancer immunotherapies, including Imjudo (tremelimumab), a monoclonal antibody against CTLA-4. Imjudo is already approved in combination with Imfinzi for certain lung and liver cancers, with ongoing trials investigating their use in other cancer subtypes. AstraZeneca researches, develops, and manufactures drugs for many diseases, including other cancers, rare disorders, and vaccines for influenza and COVID-19.\n\nFurther reading: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2404873\n\n\u00a92024 2 Minute Medicine, Inc.

The downsizing has affected employees across the board and includes those having put in 15 years in the company, they said.AstraZeneca India confirmed that the headcount has changed but did not say how many jobs have been cut.\"In the biopharmaceutical business unit, we are furthering efforts to deliver the next generation of therapeutics in our pipeline, focusing on specialists, science and innovation, while improving access of our existing portfolio in specialist disease areas,\" a company spokesperson said in an email response to ET's query.The company statement said, \"This has led to strategic restructuring of our biopharmaceutical team impacting certain roles. We are fully cognizant of the impact this has caused, and our first responsibility remains towards our employees and meeting the needs of patients.\"The biopharmaceutical business unit, also known internally as CVRM (cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic) comprised 250 to 300 jobs, of which nearly half have been cut. The unit sold some of the old, legacy brands such as anti-cholesterol brand Crestor, clot buster Brilinta and Forxiga, one of the best prescribed brands for the treatment of diabetes. Along with a few other brands, the annual sales from the biopharma unit were around \u20b9400 crore, according to an industry source. However, the loss of patent exclusivity of these brands in India resulted in a deluge of generic drugs in the market.\"When dapagliflozin (Forxiga) lost its patent rights four years ago, at least 250 generic substitutes came in. It gets tough for MNCs to compete on pricing,\" the source said.However, AstraZeneca's ambitions for India remain. A significant traction is seen in its new wave of patented drugs like Tagrisso for lung cancer, Koselugo for a rare genetic disorder, Breztri (drug to treat COPD) and Enhertu used in the treatment of breast and gastric cancer.In that direction, AstraZeneca said in the statement, \"Our aspiration to be pioneers in science has increased our focus on specialist disease areas where we can make the most meaningful difference in helping people with cancer, other chronic and rare diseases.\"Over the last few years, AstraZeneca has seen a series of job cuts in its core India operations, while it has continued to invest and ramped up capacity at its global capability centres at Bengaluru and Chennai to support research and innovation efforts.",

However, Mr Kalman considered his condition \u201crequired him to remain working from home\u201d.\n\nThe hearing at Bury St Edmunds was told that Mr Kalman started working as an IT apprentice for AstraZeneca in September 2019.\n\nExacerbating his symptoms\n\nHe was hired on a four-year contract that ended in September last year.\n\nIn 2022, the company introduced a policy which said all employees should work for three days a week from the office following the Covid pandemic.\n\nBut, Mr Kalman, who has suffered with eczema since early childhood, said that the condition meant he should continue working from his home.\n\nHe said the condition often affected daily activities, such as bathing taking longer, having to apply a moisturising balm after his shower, household chores exacerbating his symptoms and his sleep being affected.\n\nMr Kalman said he also has to spend more time shopping and preparing food, and that his symptoms flared up during periods of stress.\n\nThe tribunal heard Mr Kalman\u2019s conditions were negatively impacted by the Covid vaccine, and by contracting the virus, and that he underwent a series of alternative treatments in his home country, including acupuncture.\n\nEmployment Judge Sarah Moore ruled that his eczema is a disability and he is therefore allowed to progress with a discrimination claim.\n\n\u2018Adverse impact\u2019\n\nShe said: \u201cAs regards the impact that would have on [his] ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities, [he] gave evidence that his eczema affects his sleep, and further that if left untreated his eczema would significantly impair his ability to fall and stay asleep and would make basic activities like showering and wearing clothes painful.\n\n\u201cHe also stated that it would be likely to have an adverse impact on his desire to socialise and generally be seen in public.\n\n\u201cFor that reason I am therefore satisfied that [Mr Kalman] satisfies the definition of being a disabled person.\u201d\n\nAnother claim of disability discrimination in relation to the allergies that Mr Kalman suffers from was dismissed by the judge.\n\nThe preliminary hearing also heard that he alleges unfair dismissal and whistleblowing amongst other complaints.
