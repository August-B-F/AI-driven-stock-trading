Though then-candidate Donald Trump made clear he would impose reciprocal tariffs during his campaign for the White House, executives and investors on Wall Street have complained that the tariffs have changed too rapidly and have been too unpredictable, making it difficult for companies to plan ahead.\n\nHowever, U.S. markets soared early Monday as investors cheered less widespread tariffs than first feared. Though the price swings have been wide recently, Monday\u2019s market showed unusual power, with the S&P 500 Index registering its most robust Monday morning opening gap since October 2022.\n\nShort Interest Unusually High\n\nThis morning, ZeroHedge (@zerohedge) reported that U.S equities have their highest market-wide short interest since COVID-19. Monday\u2019s robust price action means that many of these shorts are offsides on their positions, potentially adding fuel to the bull\u2019s fire.

Nevertheless, shares rallied late last week after an \u201call-hands\u201d meeting where Elon Musk Reiterated How Tesla\u2019s Long-Term Vision Remain Intact Despite Challenges. In addition, late Sunday, news reports broke that the refreshed Model Y SUV, the best-selling car for two years running, is sold out of inventory in 29 states. Meanwhile, reports also suggest that Tesla service centers are struggling to keep up with surging demand.\n\nIn other news, defense giant Lockheed Martin was downgraded at Bank of America after the company lost a massive fighter jet contract to its biggest competitor, Boeing. The analyst said, \u201cWhile it is our expectation that defense budgets will rise, we remain wary of Lockheed Martin\u2019s recent quality of earnings, the loss of all 6th Gen manned tactical aircraft programs and lack of company-specific catalysts in the near-term.\u201d Meanwhile, Super Micro Computer largely shook off a downgrade \u2013 a bullish sign.",

            "content": "By Alexander Jones, International Banker\n\nOn January 7, JPMorgan Chase announced that it would leave the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). In so doing, it became one of the latest in a growing line of major lenders\u2014mainly from the United States and Canada\u2014to vacate their positions in the global banking sector\u2019s biggest climate coalition, just as the new US presidential administration has taken office. As such, it delivers a clear signal to the world that North American banking\u2019s collective commitment towards climate action and sustainability will decisively fade during the Trump 2.0 era.\n\nLaunched in April 2021 by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), the NZBA is a bank-led, UN-convened alliance of leading global banks that are committed to aligning their lending, investment and capital-markets activities with the goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. At present, UNEP FI records 135 banks from 44 countries as members of the NZBA, with a combined $56 trillion of total assets.\n\n\u201cNZBA\u2019s framework, guidance, and learning opportunities support members to design, set, and achieve credible science-based net-zero targets for 2030 or sooner that deliver value for their investors and clients,\u201d according to the UN agency, which has been connecting the UN with financial institutions worldwide to shape the sustainable-finance agenda for more than 30 years. \u201cMembers are making important progress. Well over 100 NZBA banks have now set individual and independent science-based sectoral 2030 targets for their financed emissions using 1.5\u00b0C scenarios.\u201d\n\nHowever, with the commencement of Donald Trump\u2019s second presidential term, times are now dramatically changing. Indeed, JPMorgan\u2019s withdrawal from the NZBA comes hot on the heels of the exits of fellow banking giants Citigroup, Bank of America (BofA), Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs\u2014all in the space of less than one month. The six banks collectively account for around $15 trillion in assets\u2014or 62 percent of the US banking industry\u2014underlining the scale of the loss that the NZBA has experienced.\n\nAnd despite the coalition managing to gather a serious head of steam throughout the previous administration of US President Joe Biden\u2014during which membership numbers ballooned from 43 banks at its founding in April 2021 to more than 140 banks at its peak last year\u2014the changing of the guard in the White House has prompted a major exodus among the US\u2019 biggest banks, a trend reversal that is almost entirely reflective of the Trump Administration\u2019s pro-fossil-fuel, pro-business agenda.\n\nIndeed, Republican politicians have escalated their condemnations of the ESG (environmental, social and governance) movement over recent years, with US banks often on the receiving end. In his first week in office, moreover, Trump signed a flurry of executive orders that could have profoundly adverse consequences for the environment and the battle against the climate crisis. Once again, Trump has pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement, as he did during his first term, with Biden later reinstating the US\u2019 membership.\n\nMoreover, the US president has also declared a \u201cnational energy emergency\u201d and promoted oil and gas expansion through eminent domain\u2014whereby the government can acquire private property for public use\u2014and the Defense Production Act, which enables the government to use private land for production that is deemed a national necessity. Trump also infamously applied the \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d slogan to characterise his energy policy during his election campaign, clearly indicating that fossil-fuel production is high on the Trump agenda and that the US\u2019 commitment to sustainability is likely to fall by the wayside.\n\nWith lending restrictions on the world\u2019s biggest industrial polluters likely to be lifted as a result of their departures from the NZBA, banks are only too happy to oblige. \u201cThe sudden exodus of these big US banks out of the NZBA is a lily-livered effort to avoid criticism from Trump and his climate denialist cronies,\u201d Paddy (Patrick) McCully, a senior analyst at the campaign group Reclaim Finance, told The Guardian shortly after JPMorgan\u2019s exit announcement. \u201cA few years ago, when climate change was at the front of the political agenda, the banks were keen to boast of their commitments to act on climate. Now that the political pendulum has swung in the other direction, suddenly acting on climate does not seem so important for the Wall Street lenders.\u201d\n\nThat pendulum swing certainly appears to be a decisive one, with a slew of financial institutions retreating from their environmental commitments in recent weeks amid the increasingly hostile environment for climate advocacy, with the NZBA suffering perhaps the most acutely from this sea change. Indeed, the departures of banks have not just been confined to the United States. On January 17, four Canadian lenders also confirmed their withdrawals from the banking alliance, just four days prior to Trump\u2019s official inauguration as the US president.\n\nTD Canada Trust Bank, Bank of Montreal (BMO), National Bank of Canada (NBC) and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) explained in separate statements that they were equipped to work outside the Alliance and develop their own climate strategies. \u201cThe NZBA was formed at a time when the global industry was scaling up efforts to take action on climate and served a valuable role in galvanizing these efforts and establishing momentum,\u201d CIBC asserted in a statement. \u201cAs this space has evolved and matured, and having made significant progress alongside our clients in these areas, we are now well-positioned to further this work outside of the formal structure of the NZBA.\u201d\n\nThese exits were then followed by the significant departure of Canada\u2019s biggest bank, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), on January 31. \u201cWe have informed the NZBA that we will be departing the organization, as we now have the tools and capabilities to help implement our climate strategy and measure our performance,\u201d an RBC spokesman confirmed. \u201cWe will continue to focus our efforts on supporting our clients to help them address climate change and succeed in the transition to a low-carbon and resilient economy.\u201d RBC\u2019s chief executive, David McKay, has since contended that the withdrawal does not necessarily indicate a non-commitment to net-zero goals. \u201cIt just means that mechanism, that organization that fostered oversight and policies and rules around what you can and can\u2019t do and how you report, is maybe not the right mechanism to do it,\u201d McKay insisted.\n\nThe \u201cbuy side\u201d of the industry, meanwhile, has seen asset managers previously bound to similar climate initiatives also heading for the exits. Early January saw BlackRock confirm that it would leave the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative. Launched in December 2020, NZAM \u201caims to support the asset management industry to commit to a goal of net zero emissions in order to mitigate financial risk and to maximise [the] long-term value of assets\u201d and is a formal partner of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\u2019s (UNFCCC\u2019s) Race to Zero campaign. However, according to the world\u2019s largest asset manager, membership in the initiative \u201ccaused confusion regarding BlackRock\u2019s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials\u201d.\n\nAs for US participation in the NZBA today, just three American banks remain part of the 135-member strong coalition\u2014Amalgamated Bank, Areti Bank and Climate First Bank\u2014none of which have anywhere near the financial clout or global influence commanded by the six recently departed banks. \u201cThese exits reveal the inadequacy of voluntary commitments and underscore the urgent need for state-level leadership and regulation to protect state and national climate progress and economic stability,\u201d Vanessa Fajans-Turner, executive director of Environmental Advocates NY, recently explained to sustainability-focused publication ESG Dive.\n\nNonetheless, those remaining few US banks stand defiant amid the departures. \u201cClimate change is real, and we will continue to work closely with Net Zero Banking Alliance as well as other banks, businesses, communities and individuals to finance a more resilient, renewable future,\u201d Climate First Bank\u2019s chief executive officer, Ken LaRoe, recently confirmed to climate-focused digital media outlet Trellis. \u201cSimply put, siloed action without accountability\u2014even if real\u2014isn\u2019t enough. This is nothing more than GOP political games that will cost investors, public pensioners, taxpayers\u2014and the world\u2014dearly.\u201d\n\nToby Kwan, a senior manager at the UK-based business-decarbonisation consultancy Carbon Trust, meanwhile, insists that the US banks\u2019 exits from the NZBA will not prove fatal for the Alliance. \u201cWhile these major financial institutions leaving the alliance raises a question mark on the future of climate action in the financial sector, the remaining NZBA members represent a significant portion of the global banking sector, controlling approximately 40% of global banking assets, or $64 trillion,\u201d Kwan told The Guardian. \u201cThis substantial influence cannot be understated, and NZBA members can drive the transition to a net zero economy.\u201d",

            "content": "Bank of America has announced the closure of multiple branches during the first week of March 2025. This decision reflects a growing trend among major financial institutions to reduce physical locations and focus on digital services. According to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), more shutdowns are expected in the coming weeks as part of a broader strategy to strengthen online operations.\n\nWhile digital banking offers convenience and efficiency, the shift concerns customers who still rely on in-person services. Evolving customer habits primarily drive the change. Most banking tasks can now be completed in seconds using a mobile app or computer, prompting banks to reconsider the necessity of maintaining a large physical presence.\n\nBranch closures reflect the digital shift\n\nA 2024 report by Self Financial revealed that since 2018, an average of 1,650 bank branches have closed each year in the United States. Experts predict that if this trend continues, physical banking locations could disappear entirely by 2041.\n\nBetween March 2 and March 8, 2025, Bank of America shut down branches in four different states:\n\n\u2013 702 Mission Ave., Oceanside\n\n\u2013 8181 West Broward Boulevard, Plantation\n\n\u2013 16686 SW 88th Street, Miami\n\n\u2013 14400 SW Allen Boulevard, Beaverton\n\n\u2013 3741 Winchester Road, Memphis\n\nSince this closure process began in 2022, the bank has permanently closed approximately 200 locations nationwide. These closures pose challenges, especially for older adults or individuals without reliable access to technology, who may find it challenging to adapt to fully digital banking services. Local economies also have concerns, as branch closures often result in job losses that impact entire communities.\n\nWhile bank branches are not disappearing entirely, the trend clearly points toward a future where fewer, smaller offices focus on specialized services while fully digital banking continues to grow. Bank of America has already made significant investments in technology and cybersecurity to ensure that customers can manage their finances from anywhere, at any time.\n\nPhoto by Yucel Moran; Unsplash",

Discover why before your portfolio feels the trade war pinch.\n\nOver the past five years, Bank of America has produced a total return of 118.19%, a figure showing significant long-term growth when compared to some peer performances. This period has been marked by strategic shifts, including robust investments in digital capabilities and wealth management that enhanced efficiencies and generated cross-selling opportunities. The bank's investment banking segment saw a resurgence, with a strong increase in fees driven by growth in mergers and acquisitions.\n\nA continuous expansion of deposits over six consecutive quarters, alongside strategic asset repricing, has supported revenue growth and bolstered net interest margins. However, challenges like regulatory costs, highlighted by a recent $2.1 billion FDIC special assessment, pose ongoing risks. Despite these obstacles, Bank of America\u2019s recent stock buybacks, totaling $3.5 billion between October and December 2024, signal a commitment to enhancing shareholder value.

It is organized into four major segments: consumer banking, global wealth and investment management, global banking, and global markets. Bank of America's consumer-facing lines of business include its network of branches and deposit-gathering operations, retail lending products, credit and debit cards, and small-business services. The company's Merrill Lynch operations provide brokerage and wealth-management services, as does its private bank. Wholesale lines of business include investment banking, corporate and commercial real estate lending, and capital markets operations. Bank of America has operations in several countries but is primarily US-focused.\n\nBank of America: Delving into Financials\n\nMarket Capitalization: Exceeding industry standards, the company's market capitalization places it above industry average in size relative to peers. This emphasizes its significant scale and robust market position.\n\nRevenue Growth: Bank of America's revenue growth over a period of 3 months has been noteworthy. As of 31 December, 2024, the company achieved a revenue growth rate of approximately 15.43%. This indicates a substantial increase in the company's top-line earnings. As compared to competitors, the company surpassed expectations with a growth rate higher than the average among peers in the Financials sector.\n\nNet Margin: Bank of America's net margin is impressive, surpassing industry averages. With a net margin of 25.25%, the company demonstrates strong profitability and effective cost management.\n\nReturn on Equity (ROE): Bank of America's ROE lags behind industry averages, suggesting challenges in maximizing returns on equity capital. With an ROE of 2.35%, the company may face hurdles in achieving optimal financial performance.\n\nReturn on Assets (ROA): Bank of America's ROA is below industry averages, indicating potential challenges in efficiently utilizing assets. With an ROA of 0.19%, the company may face hurdles in achieving optimal financial returns.\n\nDebt Management: Bank of America's debt-to-equity ratio is below the industry average. With a ratio of 1.2, the company relies less on debt financing, maintaining a healthier balance between debt and equity, which can be viewed positively by investors.\n\nUnderstanding the Relevance of Analyst Ratings\n\nAnalyst ratings serve as essential indicators of stock performance, provided by experts in banking and financial systems. These specialists diligently analyze company financial statements, participate in conference calls, and engage with insiders to generate quarterly ratings for individual stocks.\n\nSome analysts publish their predictions for metrics such as growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide additional guidance with their ratings.

The financial institutions informed the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) about their intended closures scheduled from February 7 to March 14.\n\nFlagstar Bank leads the list of banks scheduled for closure, with 44 branches, while TD Bank follows with 38 locations. Bank of America, which experienced the highest number of branch closures in 2024, totaling 168, announced plans to shut down nine locations from February 7 to March 14.\n\nChase also filed a notice for nine closures during the same five-week period. Closures followed shutdowns from January 12 to February 6, during which US Bank, Wells Fargo, and PNC informed the OCC of 107 planned closures.\n\nThe wave of closures is anticipated to escalate in 2025, resulting in an additional 4.11% decrease by the end of the year.\n\n\"Retail bank closures in the US aren't slowing, and our research shows that the last time this many people relied on a local bank branch was in 1995,\" said digital marketing expert Darren Kingman.\n\nThe ongoing trend of bank branches shutting down nationwide has worsened due to the pandemic. According to The Sun, in 2023, the US saw the highest number of bank failures since the 2008 recession.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, US bank branch closures hit their highest quarterly level since the first quarter of 2022, totaling 439 net closures. In the first nine months of 2024, 944 net branches were closed.\n\nExperts have warned that the significant decrease in bank branch numbers could have far-reaching effects on those who depend on physical bank locations.\n\nThe closure of these branches can particularly affect elderly customers, who may have greater difficulty using online and mobile banking services. Research also shows that the mass shutdowns disproportionately affect banking customers with low incomes, disabilities, or racially diverse backgrounds.\n\nAccording to Self Financial, physical banks may become obsolete, with the last brick-and-mortar bank potentially closing as early as 2041.",

However, Zelle has established limits on how much money you can transfer, which varies depending on the bank you are using it in conjunction with.

However, Zelle may impose additional restrictions depending on the type of account you have, your available balance, and your payment history. That can include weekly restrictions, in some cases.\n\nIf in doubt, check with your bank before making the transfer.\n\nCan I increase my Zelle transfer limit?\n\nSome banks may allow you to increase your limit if you can demonstrate a consistent transaction history, particularly involving the same contacts. In that case, you may be permitted to transfer higher amounts to certain people, although your overall limit for other contacts will remain unchanged.\n\nAgain, if you need to transfer an amount higher than the limit you have been set, get in touch with your bank directly.\n\nHow safe is it to send money with Zelle?\n\nIn general, Zelle is considered a secure way to send money because transactions don\u2019t require you to share confidential financial information. Even so, it\u2019s a good idea to enable authentication and monitoring features to help ensure all payments are properly authorized.\n\nThat said, Zelle is best used for sending money to people you know and trust.\n\nGet your game on!

He\u2019s been tapped by the chief executive of Bank of America to step back from his day-to-day role as national head of business banking, one of eight major lines of business for the bank, to focus all of his energy on utilizing his banking expertise and network to spur a recovery from the devastating Southern California wildfires.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm, and great leaders are coming together. It\u2019s going to take a public-private partnership with business, philanthropy, city, county, state and federal government to make sure that the entrepreneurial spirit of Los Angeles continues,\u201d said Anaya. A banker by trade, Anaya has been at the center of Southern California business growth stories and major transactions for 20 years.\n\nHe has worked with companies that have scaled from small regional operations to global powerhouses such as Vizio and Panda Restaurant Group. Along the way, he helped Anschutz Entertainment Group with its financing for downtown\u2019s L.A. Live development, and he represented the Clippers when the team was sold in a $2 billion transaction to Steve Ballmer.\n\nBut this newest venture can\u2019t be described as sought-after. As a longtime resident of Pasadena, he saw the devastation from the Eaton fire firsthand. As the leader of the Los Angeles market for Bank of America, Anaya made sure to support the bank\u2019s employees and clients and then turned his attention to the greater Los Angeles community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the wildfires, he assembled a team of 20 executives from every line of business. The group is working through short-term issues such as the immediate needs of those employees and customers. Branches in Altadena and Pacific Palisades that were destroyed by the fires were temporarily replaced by a mobile branch in Altadena and mobile ATM in Pacific Palisades to ensure that access to banking was not lost. Bank of America also provided support through an aggregate of $2 million in contributions to the Red Cross, Los Angeles Food Bank and Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce.\n\nLonger term, it is thinking about ways to create construction loan products and flexible mortgages as homeowners rebuild. There\u2019s concern that people have access to capital and are susceptible to fraudulent or predatory activity. Some of the bank\u2019s experts, who helped with recovery efforts for other disasters such as hurricanes, flew to Southern California in the aftermath of the wildfires to lend support.\n\nShortly after the wildfires, he traveled to Bank of America\u2019s Charlotte headquarters for an earnings presentation and provided an update on the tragic situation that was unfolding in Los Angeles to Brian Moynihan, chief executive of the bank. Anaya had already met with many local business leaders through his service on various nonprofit and business association boards, in addition to meeting with county supervisors and the Los Angeles Mayor\u2019s office to provide support.\n\nShortly thereafter, Moynihan reached out to Anaya and suggested that he transition away from his business banking role to focus on the rebuilding effort, where he could utilize both the bank\u2019s resources and his longstanding tenure as a community supporter.\n\n\u201cHe reminded me of the history that we have as a bank going back to the 1906 earthquake and how we helped San Francisco recover by making capital available,\u201d said Anaya about his conversation with Moynihan. \u201cHe brought that parallel to life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, Bank of America is the oldest bank in Southern California, dating back to early 1900s Downtown Los Angeles, where it had branches located at 2684 W. Pico in Pico Heights and at the intersection of 7th Street and Broadway.\n\nIt has steadily grown into one of the country\u2019s largest banks, with $83.1 billion in deposits for its Los Angeles County branches as of June 30, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That equates to a market share of 16.5% of total deposits countywide. The bank has around 6,000 local employees.\n\nAnaya\u2019s history in Southern California dates to 2005, when he moved to Pasadena to run commercial banking for the Los Angeles market. He carried personal experience with him that shaped his view of the banking industry as the son of immigrants from Mexico. His father owned an auto body shop in Brownsville, Texas, and needed capital but didn\u2019t understand the rules and regulations around lending.\n\n\u201cMy father was intimidated because he didn\u2019t know what it took to get a loan,\u201d said Anaya. \u201cIt shaped my view on how to support businesses. We need to do it in a way that makes it easy.\u201d His first job was as a grocery store bagger at H-E-B, a local grocery chain in town. He moved up to a cashier role where he had an opportunity to meet and interact with customers. That experience helped him transition to banking, where he utilized those interpersonal skills to make connections with bank customers. His professional growth continued in Southern California as the head of the local market. Eventually, he was elevated to run commercial banking for the West Coast and then became head of business banking nationally six years ago.\n\nUnder his leadership, Bank of America expanded the contributions made by executives to nonprofits throughout the region with professional expertise and funding. Local executives sit on more than 100 boards of nonprofits in Southern California. Additionally, it contributes $10 million annually to local charitable organizations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe bring our experience and view of the overall local economy to the nonprofits by being active and civically involved,\u201d Anaya said.\n\nPrior to the fires, Anaya\u2019s typical week involved travelling across the country to meet with clients in 200 different cities. With his new role, which is slated to last through the year or potentially much longer, the same energy has been laser focused on coalescing a group of banking and finance executives to leverage their expertise and experience for recovery efforts. He estimates it could take five to seven years or more to rebuild the destroyed areas.\n\nIn the aftermath of the fires, Mayor Karen Bass also asked Anaya to help organize local banks and serve as a sounding board on behalf of the industry. The goal was for the mayor to assemble a group of eight experts across different industries who could leverage their sector\u2019s collective knowledge on the myriad of issues surrounding this unprecedented disaster. Anaya contacted heads of several local banks and then went a step further to engage with asset management firms such as Capital Group, TCW and Oaktree Capital Management who have all shown tremendous willingness to help. He has also been in regular contact with Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger.\n\n\u201cNow my typical week is meeting for breakfast, lunch and dinner with business leaders and sharing my perspective and hearing their perspective,\u201d he said. Another area where he engaged was with the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. He serves on its board of directors and co-leads its CEO Council, a group of 100 chief executives launched in November 2021. In response to the wildfires, the group is assembling subject matter experts around insurance, construction and design services and other sectors.\n\nSeparately, the chamber established a small business recovery fund with a donation from Bank of America and other companies. The goal is to raise $10 million that can fund grants of $25,000 to help businesses that have been impacted by the fires directly or indirectly, such as by a loss of customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRaul is an exceptional leader and has been instrumental in helping the chamber launch the Small Business Disaster Recovery Fund,\u201d said Maria Salinas, chief executive of the chamber. \u201cAside from Bank of America\u2019s financial commitment, Raul helped us think through our recovery and relief work to maximize support to small businesses impacted by the wildfires. I value his thought leadership and commitment to drive for impact as we plan our recovery efforts,\u201d she said.\n\nLooking ahead, Anaya is searching for creative ways to help the community. For example, Bank of America is the official bank of FIFA and the 2026 World Cup that is coming to North America. In the lead up to the event, there are various games and soccer events, such as a club championship where well-known international teams will compete at venues including SoFi Stadium in Inglewood and the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. Bank of America plans to leverage its sponsorship by inviting small businesses impacted by the fires to utilize its corporate sponsorship spaces at these matches.\n\n\u201cI love to bring our connections and clients together,\u201d Anaya said.",

            "content": "The digital transformation of the banking industry continues to move forward, and Bank of America has taken another step in that direction by confirming the closure of multiple branches during the first week of March 2025. This decision reflects a growing trend among major financial institutions: reducing physical locations to strengthen digital services.\n\nAccording to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), these closures are not isolated incidents. In fact, more shutdowns are expected in the coming weeks as part of a broader strategy to focus on online operations. While digital banking offers convenience and efficiency, the shift also raises concerns, particularly for customers who still rely on in-person services.\n\nWhy is Bank of America closing branches?\n\nThe change is largely driven by evolving customer habits. Today, most banking tasks\u2014transfers, payments, investments, even balance inquiries\u2014can be completed in seconds using a mobile app or computer. The need to visit a branch has diminished significantly, prompting banks to reconsider the necessity of maintaining a large physical presence.\n\nA 2024 report by Self Financial revealed that since 2018, an average of 1,650 bank branches have closed each year in the United States. If this trend continues, experts predict that physical banking locations could disappear entirely by 2041.\n\nBranches that closed in March 2025\n\nBetween March 2 and March 8, 2025, Bank of America shut down branches in four different states:\n\nCalifornia : 702 Mission Ave., Oceanside\n\n: 702 Mission Ave., Oceanside Florida : 8181 West Broward Boulevard, Plantation and 16686 SW 88th Street, Miami\n\n: 8181 West Broward Boulevard, Plantation and 16686 SW 88th Street, Miami Oregon : 14400 SW Allen Boulevard, Beaverton\n\n: 14400 SW Allen Boulevard, Beaverton Tennessee: 3741 Winchester Road, Memphis\n\nSince this closure process began in 2022, the bank has permanently closed approximately 200 locations nationwide.\n\nThese closures pose challenges, especially for older adults or individuals without reliable access to technology, who may find it difficult to adapt to fully digital banking services. There are also concerns for local economies, as branch closures often result in job losses that impact entire communities.\n\nWhile bank branches are not disappearing entirely\u2014at least for now\u2014the trend clearly points toward a future where fewer, smaller offices focus on specialized services, while fully digital banking continues to grow. Bank of America has already made significant investments in technology and cybersecurity to ensure that customers can manage their finances from anywhere, at any time.",

            "content": "When you buy and hold a stock for the long term, you definitely want it to provide a positive return. But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) share price is up 97% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Zooming in, the stock is up a respectable 15% in the last year.\n\nThe past week has proven to be lucrative for Bank of America investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance.\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nOver half a decade, Bank of America managed to grow its earnings per share at 3.9% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 14% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\n\nNYSE:BAC Earnings Per Share Growth March 22nd 2025\n\nBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Bank of America the TSR over the last 5 years was 123%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's good to see that Bank of America has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 17% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 17%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. If you would like to research Bank of America in more detail then you might want to take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in the company.",

Although Bank of America has been a protagonist of this strategy, it is not the only one.\n\nTD Bank, one of the country's main financial entities, has also announced the closure of 38 branches in 10 states and Washington D.C., following the path of other financial institutions.\n\nReasons for TD Bank's Closures: Following Bank of America's Path\n\nTD Bank's decision to close these 38 offices is due to several factors. More and more customers are opting to conduct transactions online, reducing the need to visit physical branches. The preference for digital banking has led financial institutions to invest in online platforms and mobile applications, decreasing the relevance of traditional offices.\n\n| Bank of America, Google Maps\n\nMaintaining a physical branch involves significant costs. By closing offices with lower foot traffic, banks can reallocate resources to improve other services.\n\nStates Affected by TD Bank's 38 Closures\n\nThe TD Bank branches that will close before June 5 are located in Connecticut: Fairfield and Fort Kent or Maine: Gorham and Houlton. In Massachusetts: Bradford, East Longmeadow, Framingham, Holyoke, Methuen, and Tewksbury, in New Hampshire: Bristol, Contoocook, Hampton, and Wilton. Several locations in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina are also affected.\n\nBank of America's Situation: There Have Also Been Closures\n\nMeanwhile, BofA has also implemented branch closures in various states. Including California, Georgia, New Jersey, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.\n\nThis measure is part of a strategy to adapt to the growing digitalization and the decrease in visits to physical offices. The closure of branches has several implications:\n\nAffected Customers: Those who prefer personalized attention will have to adapt to digital channels or travel to more distant branches.\n\n| Bank of America, Getty Images\n\nEmployees: The closures may result in relocations or, in some cases, layoffs.\n\nLocal Communities: The absence of a bank branch can affect the local economy. Especially in areas where the branch was a central point of financial activity.\n\nSolutions and Adaptations\n\nTo mitigate the consequences of these closures, banks are implementing several strategies. For example, strengthening digital channels. Improvements in mobile applications and online platforms to offer more efficient and secure services.\n\nThey focus on programs to teach customers how to use digital tools and adapt to online banking. Collaborations with retail stores or other entities to offer basic banking services in alternative locations are also valuable.\n\nOverall, the closure of branches by TD Bank and Bank of America reflects a transformation in the banking industry. Driven by digitalization and changes in consumer preferences.",

            "content": "Bank of America says investors should buy the dip in a slew of tech stocks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has fallen into correction territory, down 12% from its all-time high from December. Year-to-date, the benchmark has dropped about 8%, worse than the S & P 500's 3.6% loss. But the firm is saying for some key stocks in the sector, the selling has gone too far. They include buy-rated stocks such as: Analog Devices, Nvidia, Broadcom , Marvell and AppLovin. Analog Devices Investors should take advantage of the sell-off in the semis manufacturer, the firm said earlier this week. Analyst Vivek Arya says the stock is best positioned for growth after a series of meetings with management. \"ADI remains optimistic on the expected 2H25 automotive and industrial market recovery, saying they have hit the bottom, but remain uncertain on the shape of growth coming out of it,\" he wrote, Still, the firm says the stock remains a best idea and the \"trendline suggests [more] upside.\" Further, Arya says Analog has only a very minimal impact to the tariff uncertainty. \"We reiterate Buy and top analog pick and note ADI's defensiveness...,\" he went on to say. Analog Devices shares are down 4.6% this year. Marvell Technology Arya also sees a slew of positive catalysts for Marvell. The firm hosted CEO Matt Murphy for a series of meetings and came away with a \"reassuring tone in [the] near & longer-term growth outlook.\" Marvell's data center opportunity also remains large, according to Arya. \"We expect the overall data center TAM [total addressable market] to be raised towards ~$100bn with continued targeting of 20% share over time,\" he added. In addition, Marvell has a much anticipated analyst day in June where it could raise its growth forecast, the firm says. Meanwhile, shares of the company are down 37% this year and remain attractive, Arya wrote. AppLovin The mobile app publishing tech company is just too attractive to ignore right now, according to the firm. Analyst Omar Dessouky also recently participated in a series of meetings with AppLovin concluding that the bullish thesis is becoming clearer. Dessouky says AppLovin has a first mover advantage and is well positioned to benefit from an increase in digital spending. The company was the subject of several recent short seller reports, but Dessouky says he believes its hardly shaken investors. \"The market's recent momentum unwind, and multiple short seller reports have in our view resulted in an opportunity to acquire a secular grower, early in its inflection, at a steep discount to GOOGL & META, profitable high growth software stocks, and AI beneficiaries...\" he wrote. The stock is down almost 5% this year. Marvell \"Confident tone in AI opportunity, capability, execution. ... .Reassuring tone in near & longer-term growth outlook. ... .MRVL could raise growth opportunity at next analyst day. ... .We expect the overall data center TAM to be raised towards ~$100bn (20% of $500bn long-term AI opportunity) with continued targeting of 20% share over time.\" Broadcom \"We rate Broadcom Buy due to its high-quality diversified exposure to secular product cycles in the smartphone, cloud data center, telecom and enterprise storage markets. Additionally, with 45%+ EBITDA/FCF margins, Broadcom is among the most profitable semiconductor companies, which is likely to continue to drive strong cash returns.\" AppLovin \"In our opinion, management's articulation of the secular bull thesis becomes more effective with each investor meeting - we think investors will soon connect the dots. ... .The market's recent momentum unwind & multiple short seller reports have in our view resulted in an opportunity to acquire a secular grower, early in its inflection, at a steep discount to GOOGL & META, profitable high growth software stocks, & AI beneficiaries...\" Analog Devices \"We reiterate Buy and top analog pick and note ADI's defensiveness with the stock outperforming the SOX in 23 of the 29 times the index declined 10%+ since 2010. ... .Shape uncertain but trendline suggests upside. ADI remain optimistic on the expected 2H25 automotive and industrial market recovery, saying they have hit the bottom, but remain uncertain on the shape of growth coming out of it.\" Nvidia \"We maintain Buy, $200 PO following slate of product/partner announcements at flagship GTC conference in addition to post keynote meeting with CFO that demonstrate NVDA continuing to deepen its competitive moat in a $1T+ infrastructure/services TAM. ... .Overall, NVDA continues to dominate the AI value chain with its full-stack turnkey (hardware, software, systems, services, developers) model.\"",

            "content": "More and more companies are choosing to offer digital services and to close their physical stores, offices, or branches. This is what is also happening in the financial sector, and Bank of America is one of the companies that is going to adopt this business model after informing and confirming that it has closed five new branches during the first week of March. And the worst part is that, according to The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, this trend is far from decreasing because they have many more closures planned for the coming weeks.\n\nThis decision seems to respond to a search for online expansion, an option that is used more and more around the world (and in all sectors) after the COVID-19 pandemic happened, and although digital operations are very convenient and have often made life easier, they are also leaving behind branches where in-person service used to take place.\n\nWhy are branches closing?\n\nMainly because today\u2019s customers have also changed, many people who do banking prefer to do it from their phone or computer without needing to step into an office. Now, with our bank apps we can do anything: transfers, payments, investments, and even balance checks, and they are resolved in a second, you don\u2019t have to spend hours and hours in line at the office.\n\nA 2024 study conducted by Self Financial reveals that, since 2018, around 1,650 bank branches are closing per year in the U.S., a trend that, if it continues, could lead to physical banking disappearing completely by 2041. And it\u2019s because, as we said, now it\u2019s much more convenient to do any transaction without leaving home.\n\nWhich branches closed this month?\n\nAccording to the weekly bulletin published by the OCC, between March 2 and 8, 2025, branches were closed in four different states:\n\nCalifornia: 702 Mission Ave., Oceanside\n\nFlorida: 8181 West Broward Boulevard, Plantation and 16686 SW 88th Street, Miami\n\nOregon: 14400 SW Allen Boulevard, Beaverton\n\nTennessee: 3741 Winchester Road, Memphis\n\nThe branch closure process began in 2022 and around 200 bank offices have already been closed since then.\n\nWhat do these closures imply?\n\nWell, as offices disappear, we have to adapt to digital channels. For those of us who are younger, clearly this doesn\u2019t represent any problem, but for those adults or elderly people who have a lot more difficulty with technology, this can turn into a technological barrier that is quite big and that may cause many of them to feel excluded from society. The same happens for people who don\u2019t have access to reliable internet or who don\u2019t even have a laptop or latest-generation phone to do these transactions.\n\nAlso, on many occasions, like opening bank accounts or making large transfers, it\u2019s still much more comfortable to go to an office than to do it with a computer.\n\nAnd the workers?\n\nThat is another point to discuss, because the closure of branches doesn\u2019t only affect customers and their routine, but there will be hundreds of workers who will lose their local jobs and it will end up impacting the economic cycle of the cities.\n\nThe end of bank branches?\n\nFor now, no, but the process seems unstoppable. For now, the trend is toward smaller branches and maybe fewer of them in very specific areas, focused on advice and other types of problems instead of the big offices we\u2019ve always known.\n\nAt the same time, they are betting on 100% digital banks, which offer all their products without needing a physical network. Bank of America, for example, has invested in technology and digital security so that its users can operate from anywhere in the world.\n\nThe financial system, like the world, is heading and moving toward total digitalization. While traditional banking reduces its physical presence, the future seems to be tied to our screens. Our banks are changing forever, and it seems to be an unstoppable change.",

            "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are about to witness a stark shift in who holds economic power. A recent Report , from Bank of America sheds light on how women's increasing financial power is reshaping economies and industries.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pay Gap\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a capitalist society, spending choices are a powerful expression, purchases signal our values and shape markets. As demand drives supply, the products and services that attract the most consumer interest continue to thrive. Consequently, those with the greatest purchasing power, in theory, wield the most influence over the economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen still get paid less than men. Despite growing awareness and corporate pledges to address wage inequality, the gender pay gap remains unchanged at 9.4% over the past five years. Career breaks for family caregiving, often referred to as the \"motherhood penalty\" and \"good daughter penalty\", further hinder women's earning potential, career progression, and pension savings.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch indicates that closing gender employment and pay gaps could generate significant economic benefits. One study from the OECD suggests that increasing women's workforce participation and leadership roles in these countries could add $7 trillion to the global economy. A separate study by McKinsey & Company found that achieving full gender parity in employment and pay could boost global GDP per capita by up to 20%.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wealth Gap\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditionally and today, men hold a significantly higher percentage of global wealth. In the UK, men have, on average, \u00a392,762 more in total wealth than women, reflecting a 35% wealth gap. While this gap is minimal among individuals aged 25 to 34, it widens with age, reaching 28% for those aged 35 to 44 and expanding to 42% by age 64.\n\n\n\n\n\nA similar disparity exists in the United States , where women own just 32 cents for every dollar owned by men. This gap is even more pronounced for women of color, Black and Latina women own only one penny for every dollar owned by white men.\n\nFinancial inequality extends into retirement and in the UK, state pensions are among the lowest in the OECD. Women face significant disparities in pension wealth. Women aged 65-74 have a median private pension wealth of just \u00a317,300, compared to \u00a3164,700 for men. Across the population, the gap remains stark, with women\u2019s median pension wealth at only \u00a34,300\u2014less than a quarter of men\u2019s \u00a319,800. One key factor contributing to this disparity is that auto-enrolled pension schemes fail to account for unpaid caregiving periods, disproportionately affecting women and limiting their long-term financial security.\n\n\n\n\n\nBank of America Reports Progress in Workforce Participation and Earnings\n\n\n\n\n\nEncouragingly, gender gaps in labor force participation and employment are narrowing. According to Bank of America's internal data, the difference in median annual income growth between men and women has fallen from 6.5% in 2022 to approximately 4% at the end of 2024. This shift suggests that, while wage disparities persist, women's earnings are rising at a faster rate than before.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, women remain significantly underrepresented in the workforce, particularly in lower-income countries. Since 2010, the employment rate for working-age women has been, on average, 14 percentage points lower than for men in high-income countries and 27 percentage points lower in low-income nations. These gaps highlight structural barriers such as workplace discrimination, unpaid caregiving responsibilities, and limited access to senior positions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Great Wealth Transfer\" and Women's Growing Economic Influence\n\n\n\n\n\nThe financial landscape is poised for a significant transformation, driven by the \"Great Wealth Transfer.\" An estimated $124 trillion in U.S. wealth is expected to be transferred through 2048, a sum exceeding the total global GDP for 2023. Of this, $54 trillion will go to surviving spouses, 95% of whom are women, while an additional $47 trillion is expected to be inherited by younger generations of women. Half of all US wealth is held by Baby Boomers and these inheritances are already being passed down.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 2030, women are projected to control two-thirds of all private wealth in the U.S., positioning them as key economic drivers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shift represents the most significant wealth transfer by gender in history. By 2030, women are projected to control two-thirds of all private wealth in the U.S., positioning them as key economic drivers. Their increasing financial power is expected to influence industries such as healthcare, travel, and professional sports, altering market dynamics and consumer trends.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to academic research ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c As younger generations inherit wealth, they may increase their spending on goods and services, boosting economic growth. This could lead to increased demand for luxury goods, travel, and other discretionary spending. Younger generations may have different investment preferences than their predecessors. They may be more interested in sustainable and impact investing, focusing on companies with strong environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWealth Management implications\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to research from Mckinsey & Company women approach wealth management differently than men. They are more likely to seek professional advice, yet less confident in their financial decision-making. Female investors tend to be more risk-averse, focusing on capital preservation and long-term life goals rather than high-risk, high-reward investment strategies .Retirement planning is a key financial concern, with women being 10 percentage points more likely than men to worry about outliving their savings, highlighting their cautious and long-term approach to financial security.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, recent research suggests that women's financial behavior differences may not necessarily stem from a lack of confidence. Find an analysis here.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Call for Systemic Change\n\n\n\n\n\nAs McKinsey conclude,\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTo attract and retain female customers and capture some of the trillions up for grabs, wealth-management firms must diversify their offerings and commit to a more systematic approach. \u201c\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile progress is being made, wealth inequality remains a pressing issue that requires systemic solutions. Addressing gender disparities in pay, career advancement, and retirement savings will not only benefit women but also lead to broader economic growth and stability. As wealth shifts into the hands of women, their financial decisions will shape industries, influence policies, and potentially close the economic gender gap but only if systemic barriers are dismantled along the way.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe evolving financial landscape presents significant opportunities for startups and wealth managers to better understand these trends and tailor their services to meet the needs of this growing economic powerhouse.\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Community Corner Beautiful Horizons: Running Helps DuPage County Man Stay Sober Jonny Moore is set to race in the Bank of America Shamrock Shuffle on March 23, an achievement he never imagined before he got sober.\n\nWhen Jonny Moore runs Bank of America Shamrock Shuffle, it will mark his 13th race since he started walking and running to help him stay sober. (Erika Mikottis)\n\nDOWNERS GROVE, IL \u2014 Last February, Downers Grove native Jonny Moore checked himself into a rehab facility in California to get sober from alcohol. Though he was enchanted by the Pacific's crashing waves, Moore was unable to leave the rehab facility. Instead, he set up a treadmill on the balcony of his room and began walking, gazing out at the horizon as it met the ocean, with no exact destination in mind.\n\nFast-forward to March 2025 and Moore is preparing to run the Bank of America Shamrock Shuffle. It'll be his 13th race since he took the first step to get sober, a path that changed the course of his life. \u201cI was sick and tired of living a subpar life,\" Moore told Patch. \"Waking up hung over and waking up feeling like total garbage. I wanted to make a change.\"\n\nWhat started as daily walks on the treadmill became daily runs. As soon as Moore returned to his current home in Lombard, he bought a treadmill and continued his practice of running daily. He bought a TV, set it up in front of the treadmill and watched YouTube videos of the ocean to keep himself motivated. When the weather broke, Moore started to venture outside. At first, he jogged a block. Then, he jogged a mile. He told Patch he kept jogging further and further, admiring his natural surroundings as he did so.\n\n\"I regained a whole new sense of wonder,\" Moore said. Then, he got fitted for custom running shoes and started to participate in 5K races all over the U.S. His first race was a 5K at the Morton Arboretum last May.\n\n\u201cIt was really pretty running through the woods,\" he said. Soon, Moore's girlfriend of two-and-a-half years, Erica Mikottis, got into the act. The couple bought a second treadmill, and they jogged side by side.\n\n\"She's been very supportive the whole time,\" Moore told Patch. Last June was the first time Moore celebrated his birthday as a sober person, relishing each moment of dinner with Mikottis and his parents. \u201cIt was great just being able to appreciate the dinner,\" he said. \"That was a really big milestone in my life right there.\" The very next day, instead of waking up with a hangover like he would have in the past, Moore ran his first 10K race. He admits that it was \"really hard\" to get to that point, but told Patch running \"really cleared my mind, and it kept me on track and helped me focus on something positive.\u201d\n\nOn Valentine's Day, 2025, Moore achieved one year of sobriety. To celebrate this milestone, he wanted to back to California, a trip he had dreamed of as a reward to himself for staying sober. Moore and Mikottis flew out to Los Angeles, where he ran a half-marathon on the beach. When he reached the finish line, Moore was welcomed by Mikottis, holding a sign congratulating him on his sober anniversary. The upcoming Shamrock Shuffle marks another milestone for Moore, one that puts his past in stark relief. He told Patch St. Patrick's Day used to be a trigger for him because it often involved a lot of drinking. Now, he's looking forward to \"doing something really healthy and hard on the same day I would really do something completely different.\u201d And he won't be doing it alone. Mikottis, who has been training with Moore, will be running right there with him.\n\nMoore said it will be the first Shamrock Shuffle for both of them, and the longest race Mikottis has yet to run. After the Shamrock Shuffle, Moore wants to bring to life another dream: that of starting a fitness program for other people in recovery. He told Patch that after quitting his job in bartending, he enrolled in a personal trainer program at College of DuPage. He's set to take the test to complete his certification in about a week. For other people who are struggling with substance use disorder, Moore says it's important not to \"beat yourself up.\" He said, \"Don\u2019t give up and really focus on why you want to make the change.\"",

            "content": "As the banking industry braces for these shifts, billionaires are paying close attention. Over the past ten years, billionaires have gotten much richer, growing their wealth faster than the stock market. From 2015 to 2024, their total fortune more than doubled, going from $6.3 trillion to $14 trillion. In comparison, the MSCI World Index only grew by 73%. The number of billionaires also increased, from 1,757 in 2015 to 2,682 in 2024. However, since 2020, this growth has slowed to just 1% per year, mainly because wealthy people in China have been losing money. Meanwhile, billionaires in the US, Europe, and India are still seeing their wealth grow. Tech billionaires have gained the most, with their total wealth tripling from $789 billion to $2.4 trillion.\n\nAccording to Morningstar DBRS, the US banking sector is expected to remain stable in 2025, with banks benefiting from a better operating environment, an improved yield curve, and steady economic growth. Loan demand should pick up, and banks have managed to maintain strong liquidity, capital levels, and profitability, putting them in a good position for the year ahead. While credit ratings for banks are not expected to change significantly, some could see positive adjustments if current trends continue. However, if interest rates stay high for longer than expected, it could put pressure on consumers and businesses. Trade conflicts or geopolitical tensions could also slow down economic growth. On the bright side, higher loan demand and a steeper yield curve could boost banks\u2019 earnings, with many predicting record net interest income (NII) in 2025.\n\nFor banks, a big challenge will be maintaining growth despite these economic headwinds. With interest rates dropping, net interest income is expected to decline, and deposit costs may stay high as banks compete to retain customers. Mortgage loan demand is likely to pick up, but credit card and auto loans could see slower growth as consumers tighten their wallets. Meanwhile, corporate borrowing should remain steady, with potential growth in debt issuance and M&A if economic and political uncertainty settles down.\n\nAs 2025 kicks off, bank executives are facing a mix of optimism and uncertainty. Inflation is easing, and interest rates are coming down, but challenges like slow economic growth, geopolitical instability, and shifting regulations are keeping industry leaders on edge. According to Deloitte, while the US economy outperformed expectations in 2024 with a 2.7% GDP growth rate, things are expected to slow in 2025, with projections around 1.5%. Rising unemployment, weaker business investment, and high consumer debt, which now stands at a record $17.7 trillion, could put additional pressure on the financial system.\n\nWe recently published a list of 15 Best Bank Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stands against other best bank stocks to invest in.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn Europe, billionaire investors are making their presence felt in the banking sector. Italy\u2019s banking sector is going through a major change, and two billionaire families, Del Vecchio and Caltagirone, are making big moves to stay in control. They have built up significant stakes in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (Paschi), positioning themselves to influence the mergers and acquisitions wave that is picking up speed. The government wants to turn Paschi into the country\u2019s third major bank, while other lenders are scrambling to strike their own deals. Caltagirone and Del Vecchio have only tightened their grip, buying more Paschi shares to ensure a say in its future. While they are focused on financial gains, they also align with the government\u2019s vision for a stronger banking system. Caltagirone, who\u2019s close to the Meloni administration, sees Paschi as the foundation for Italy\u2019s next banking giant.\n\nMeanwhile, in the US, Warren Buffett remains a dominant force in the financial sector. Known for his long-term investment strategy, Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway has a history of outperforming the market, delivering an average annual return of 12.1% over the past two decades, slightly ahead of the broader market\u2019s 11.5%. He has long favored financial stocks for their steady profits and reliable dividends, particularly those with strong management teams. However, his recent decision to sell nearly $1 billion in shares of a major US bank, along with stakes in other financial institutions, signals a potential shift in strategy. This move could reflect concerns about the banking sector or a search for better opportunities elsewhere. Despite the sell-off, Buffett remains deeply invested in the bank he trimmed his position in, still holding a massive $30 billion stake.\n\nIs Bank of America Corporation (BAC) Among The Best Bank Stocks To Buy According To Billionaires?\n\nA professional banker providing consultation to a customer in the security of his office.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe analyzed Insider Monkey\u2019s exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings to compile our list of the best bank stocks to invest in according to billionaires. We picked 15 best bank stocks to buy based on the highest number of billionaire investors, updated as of Q4 2024. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world\u2019s leading hedge funds and companies.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 18\n\nBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) ranks 3rd on our list of the best bank stocks. It offers financial services to individuals, businesses, and governments through four key divisions. Consumer Banking manages accounts, credit cards, loans, and mortgages. Global Wealth & Investment Management provides investment, brokerage, and retirement solutions. Global Banking includes commercial lending, treasury management, and advisory services, while Global Markets specializes in trading and risk management.\n\nBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)\u2019s digital banking hit a record 26 billion interactions last year, reflecting an increase of 12%. More than 58 million clients used tools like proactive alerts, which grew 7% to nearly 12 billion updates. Account logins reached 14.3 billion, with a record 3.9 billion in Q4, up 16% year-over-year. Meanwhile, BAC\u2019s AI assistant Erica handled 676 million interactions, surpassing 2.5 billion total since launch.\n\nOn January 29, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per common share, set to be distributed on March 28, 2025, to shareholders on record as of March 7. Additionally, a $1.75 per share dividend was announced for the 7% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series B, to be paid on April 25, to shareholders on record by April 11.\n\nIn Q4 2024, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)\u2019s net income reached $6.7 billion, which was more than double the $3.1 billion from a year ago. Revenue grew 15% to $25.3 billion, due to higher asset management and investment banking fees, as well as strong trading performance. Similarly, net interest income rose 3% to $14.4 billion, driven by solid market activity, loan growth, and asset repricing, though lower interest rates offset some gains. In total, the bank returned $5.5 billion to shareholders during Q4, including $2 billion in dividends and $3.5 billion in stock buybacks.\n\nOverall, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) ranks 3rd on our list of the best bank stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of BAC to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BAC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Buying stocks with a history of outperforming in previous sell-offs could be a good strategy to weather volatility, according to Bank of America. President Donald Trump' s new trade policies have roiled markets in recent weeks, with investors abandoning riskier assets and scrambling to safe havens. Indeed, the S & P 500 is down about 7% over the past month, and the index briefly slipped into correction territory last week. Recent data has also suggested a softening in consumer sentiment , and the Federal Reserve this week said it sees higher inflation and slowing economic growth. Against this highly uncertain economic backdrop, analysts at Bank of America screened for the companies that have a history of performing well during pullbacks. \"With increasing uncertainty over the macro, stocks with a history of weathering prior downturns with low crowding risk and low earnings volatility may make sense,\" Savita Subramanian, equity and quant strategist, wrote in a Thursday report. To be included in the table below, stocks had to meet the following criteria: Be a member of the Russell 1000 Outperformed in at least 80% of prior market pullbacks of at least 10% since 1983 Have a high-quality rating (B+ or better S & P quality rank) Be underweight by long-only active fund managers (relative weight in holdings < 1.0) The \"hit rate\" column describes the percentage of times the stock has outperformed in pullbacks of at least 10% since 1983. Two names on the list were household product names Church & Dwight and Clorox , which respectively have hit rates of 90% and 81%. Both stocks are also dividend payers, with Church & Dwight having a dividend yield of 1.1%, while Clorox has a dividend yield of 3.4%. Shares of Church & Dwight have added 4% over the past 12 months. Clorox stock is down more than 3% over the past year. Bank of America analyst Bryan Spillane recently highlighted the names as two that could weather risks associated with Trump's trade policies. \"We see companies with more domestic exposure as better positioned (CHD, CLX) vs. multi-national peers, which face greater pressure and volatility from a changing tariff and FX environment,\" he wrote. Spillane's $112 price objective is nearly 4% above where shares of Church & Dwight closed on Wednesday afternoon. His $172 price target for Clorox implies a potential upside of 18%. Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson has risen 4% over the past 12 months. The stock has outperformed in previous corrections 88% of the time, Bank of America found. Johnson & Johnson has a dividend yield of 3%. Earlier this month, the bank's analyst Tim Anderson raised his price target on the stock to $171 from $159. His updated forecast is nearly 5% above where shares closed on Wednesday. \"Upside risks to our PO are better-than-expected launch of new products, pipeline success greater than we model, quick resolution of talc litigation, and constructive M & A that adds to topline growth,\" he wrote. Other names on the list included PepsiCo , with a hit rate of 88%, and NextEra Energy , with a hit rate of 91%.",

Some of the slowdown will come from President Donald Trump's tariffs, which Moynihan estimated will cut about 0.4 percentage point off growth in the near term before the economy adjusts.\n\nHowever, he called the 2% level \"trend growth. That's what we've all been trying to get to for 10 or 15 years after the financial crisis.\"\n\n\"We see the consumer continue to be solid, and that should bode well for the economy,\" Moynihan added. \"There's a lot of questions out there, and I think that will sort through.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stands against other incredibly cheap dividend stocks to buy now.\n\nValue investing has long been a preferred strategy among investors, largely influenced by Warren Buffett, who continues to seek out stocks he believes are trading below their intrinsic value. While growth stocks have recently captured more market attention, value stocks have demonstrated strong long-term performance.\n\nInvestment experts such as Josef Lakonishok and David Dreman have emphasized the importance of patience and a disciplined approach, arguing that steady, well-researched investments often yield better results than chasing rapid growth. Their research suggests that value investing outperforms growth strategies about 70% of the time, regardless of a company\u2019s size. Examining businesses across different market capitalizations, they found that, over extended periods, value stocks consistently delivered average annual returns exceeding 7%, outperforming their growth counterparts.\n\nREAD ALSO: Dividend Contenders List: Top 15\n\nLowell Miller\u2019s book, Single Best Investment, explored the principles of value investing, drawing on the research of Fama and French published in the Journal of Finance. The book explained that when a growth stock fails to meet investors\u2019 high expectations, its price often experiences a steep drop as the market reassesses its true worth. On the other hand, value stocks, which typically start with lower expectations, have the potential to surpass forecasts, leading to upward price adjustments. However, the book also underscored the importance of diversification, cautioning against concentrating too much capital on a single investment. Historically, a well-diversified portfolio has proven to be a safer strategy for investors.\n\nA report by BlackRock highlighted that value stocks can provide stability in volatile market conditions. This was evident during the 2022 market downturn when growth stocks suffered heavy losses, while value stocks experienced comparatively smaller declines. By nature, value stocks tend to trade at lower price levels than growth stocks, though the size of this discount has fluctuated over time.\n\nMarket analysis suggests that value stock valuations would need to rise by over 40% to return to their historical median, signaling potential upside if they regain investor favor. With growth stocks trading at high valuations, investors may increasingly shift their focus toward value stocks, particularly as the market broadens beyond mega-cap companies. While past performance does not guarantee future outcomes, history provides some perspective. BlackRock noted that the last time the valuation gap between the Russell Growth and Russell Value indexes was as wide as it is today\u2014back in December 2000\u2014value stocks went on to outperform growth stocks over the subsequent one-, three-, and five-year periods.",

            "content": "Dividend investing comes in many flavors, but the general goal of the strategy is to own shares of high-quality companies that will grow over time, providing a combination of share price appreciation and a growing dividend income. Dividends are almost always a cash expense for companies, so it's a badge of merit when a company can regularly increase its payouts.\n\nVisa (V -0.58%) and Bank of America (BAC -0.87%) are financial sector juggernauts. One company operates the world's second-largest payments network (just behind China's UnionPay), while the other is America's second-largest bank, with over $3.2 trillion in assets. Both companies pay dividends, and have raised them for at least 10 consecutive years.\n\nBut which is the better dividend stock to buy now?\n\nMeet the contenders\n\nVisa and Bank of America are massive, consumer-facing businesses, so you've almost certainly heard of both.\n\nOpen your wallet, and you'll probably find a Visa-branded credit or debit card. It operates the world's largest payment processing network (when excluding China). When you use a Visa-branded payment card or digital wallet, its network securely communicates between the merchant and your financial institution, verifying the funds and authorizing the transaction. Visa charges a small fee to the merchant for this service. The company's network processes trillions of dollars in transactions annually, resulting in more than $36 billion in revenue and $20 billion in free cash flow over the past four quarters.\n\nIf you drive through any notable town or city in much of the U.S., you'll likely find a Bank of America branch, or at least one of its ATMs. However, the bank's business roots go far deeper. As one of the world's largest banks, it has its fingers in the financial markets, retail and commercial banking, residential and commercial real estate, and more. Bank of America has thrived as consumers and businesses borrow more. The company generated over $101 billion in revenue and $27 billion in net income over the past year.\n\nHere is how these dividend stocks stack up\n\nDividend stocks must deliver in a few key areas. Investors tend to prefer reliable and growing payouts. Additionally, many are focused on the longer term since those who own dividend stocks benefit heavily when they hold them for long periods that allow compound growth to work its magic. Therefore, it's a strong positive for such companies to have opportunities to foster growth that will allow them to keep paying and increasing their dividends.\n\nAt first glance, Visa and Bank of America seem to have comparable dividend metrics.\n\nMetric Visa Bank of America Current dividend yield 0.7% 2.5% Five-year compound annual dividend growth rate 15.4% 8.7% Dividend payout ratio 20.8% 28.2%\n\nBoth companies have conservative dividend payout ratios (as a percentage of their 2025 earnings estimates). Visa has been growing its payout faster, but Bank of America offers a far higher starting yield and has raised its dividend faster than inflation over the past five years. Based on the numbers alone, one could make a sound argument for investing in either stock, depending on whether they preferred a higher initial yield or a higher growth rate.\n\nLastly, analysts are similarly optimistic about each company's growth prospects, estimating that both companies will grow their earnings at annualized rates of around 12% over the long term.\n\nWhich is the better dividend stock?\n\nI'll admit, this was a far closer contest than I initially expected. However, Visa's business model gives it the edge.\n\nYou see, Visa doesn't take on any credit risk. It's a financial toll booth, collecting fees as the global economy uses its network. Meanwhile, Bank of America is in the lending business. That can be lucrative when credit markets are healthy, but costly when conditions go south.\n\nVisa's business may slow during a downturn or recession if consumer spending drops, but Bank of America is far more vulnerable to economic slowdowns. Bank of America's stock has delivered total returns of about 2,730% since the early 1970s, and as the chart below suggests, a big reason those returns were not higher is because it can take the company years to recover from the impacts of recessions and financial crises.\n\nVisa didn't go public until 2008, but it has generated nearly the same total returns in 17 years that it took Bank of America over five decades to produce, and the payment processor did it without as much volatility.\n\nUltimately, investing in the global transition from cash to payment cards and digital wallets is a more attractive growth trend than lending. Visa's track record and lack of credit exposure make it the better dividend stock for your money.",

            "content": "Bakkt's share price fell nearly 30% on Tuesday after the news was made public that Bank of America and Webull Pay LLC opted not to renew their commercial agreements with the digital asset and payment fintech, the company revealed in an SEC filing Monday.\n\nThe development was a big blow. BKKT stock shares ended the day down 27.28% to $9.33, according to data from Yahoo Finance . The stock further slipped after closing and opened Wednesday morning at just over $9.\n\nBank of America's commercial agreement accounted for nearly 17% of Bakkt's loyalty services revenue through September of last year, according to the filing . Webull was Bakkt's largest crypto partner. The Form 8-K reported Webull made up nearly three-quarters, or 74%, of Bakkt's crypto services revenue in 2023 and 2024.\n\nBank of America's commercial agreement is set to end on April 22 and crypto brokerage Webull's is slated to end on June 14. None of the parties involved responded to requests for comment from American Banker.\n\nThe decision by Bank of America to pull out in particular is illustrative of the uncertainty traditional financial institutions continue to feel toward crypto markets . Despite renewed interest by the Trump administration to construct clearer regulations around cryptocurrencies and stablecoins in particular, the debate is ongoing.\n\nFurther economic uncertainty driven by political decisions amid the White House's trade war, mass firings of federal workers by the Department of Government Efficiency and continued consumer concerns over high prices on essentials, has caused many large banks to shift their focus back to core banking products.\n\nBanks are stepping back, but not fully ruling digital assets out. Speaking at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., last month , Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan said a Bank of America stablecoin could be in the bank's future if the current regulatory talks continue. \"It's pretty clear there's going to be a stablecoin, which is going to be a fully dollar-backed type of thing, which is no different than a money market fund or check access through a bank account, really,\" Moynihan said. \"If they make that legal, we will go into that business. We will have a BAC \u2014 a Bank of America coin U.S. dollar deposit \u2014 and it'll be able to move back and forth because now it's legal for us to do it. The question of what it's going to be useful for is going to be interesting.\"\n\nThe news is only the latest hit to Bakkt, which has had a tumultuous 2025 so far. There had been reports in November of last year that then-President-elect Donald Trump's social media company Truth Social was in talks to acquire Bakkt. The deal was never finalized. Bakkt pushed its 2024 earnings call back twice amid the setbacks.\n\nBakkt was founded by former Republican U.S. Senator from Georgia and Trump ally Kelly Loeffler . Upon taking office, Trump appointed Loeffler to serve as administrator of the Small Business Administration.",

Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor)\n\nTariff tensions put the stock market under pressure, but as the old saying goes, volatility brings opportunity. It's not every day that investors get to pounce on must-buy stocks at depressed prices, so you definitely don't want to miss out on this unusually favorable risk-to-reward scenario.\n\nAt the same time, there's no need to buy everything under the sun. Sticking to well-known names with large market capitalizations can add a layer of safety when you go bargain shopping.\n\nWith that in mind, let's delve into three easy, high-profile stock picks that you can buy right now to build wealth for the long term.\n\nBank of America\n\nReady to try a Warren Buffett holding that you can (literally) bank on? Financial stocks might not be in favor at the moment, but Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) offers two things that should appeal to Buffett and any opportunistic investor: decent dividends and a good value.\n\nOn Jan. 29, Bank of America's board declared a quarterly cash dividend distribution of $0.26 per share. BAC stock closed at $41.44 on March 17, and if we annualize the dividend to $1.04 per share, then Bank of America's forward annual dividend yield will be $1.04/$41.44 or 2.5% -- a nice bonus for income-focused investors.\n\nOf course, you shouldn't just chase yield during these tumultuous times. Currently trading at around 13 times its trailing earnings, Bank of America is a recent sales grower with revenue (net of interest expense) of $25.3 billion, up 15% year over year (YOY). A primary driver of this revenue growth, no doubt, is the company's 22% increase in consumer investment assets to $518 billion.\n\nThese are reassuring stats amid a volatile market backdrop. Better yet, Bank of America more than doubled its Q4 2024 to $6.7 billion, or $0.82 per diluted share, from just $3.1 billion, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the year-earlier quarter. Hence, it looks like Bank of America is a rock-solid, Buffett-backed bank that's unafraid to reward its loyal shareholders in 2025.\n\nGeneral Motors\n\nNext up is General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock, which should be an easy wealth builder as long as gasoline prices remain fairly low. Barring unexpected events, the current presidential administration's philosophy of \"drill, baby, drill\" ought to promote a favorable market environment for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle producers like General Motors.\n\nGeneral Motors' board approved a 25% quarterly dividend increase (from $0.12 to $0.15 per share per quarter) not long ago, and the automaker's 0.98% forward annual dividend yield is respectable if not necessarily life-changing. There's more than one way to return capital to the shareholders, though.\n\nIn particular, General Motors has approved an \"accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program\" that includes a $2 billion share buyback authorization. This aggressive share-repurchase activity could, at least in theory, put a floor on the GM stock price for a while.\n\nMeanwhile, General Motors' trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 7.7x suggests that the shares are a good value. After all, the sector median P/E ratio is 18.23x.\n\nAnd if General Motors' fourth-quarter 2024 net loss attributable to shareholders of $3 billion bothers you, it shouldn't. Bear in mind that this figure includes $5 billion worth of \"special charges\" that aren't likely to be repeated. Thus, when all is said and done, General Motors should be considered a profitable business with wealth-sharing propensities.\n\nAlphabet\n\nHow often do Magnificent Seven members have P/E ratios below 20x? Not very often, so Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is now a value pick as the company's trailing P/E ratio stands at 19.96x.\n\nFurthermore, GOOG/GOOGL stock belongs in the must-buy wealth-builders category because investors ought to have at least some exposure to artificial intelligence (AI) technology and cybersecurity in the 2020s. Alphabet is heavily invested in AI, and the firm just announced an agreement to acquire cybersecurity firm Wiz Inc.\n\nGranted, Alphabet's annual dividend yield of around half a percent probably won't make you fabulously wealthy overnight. That said, at least you'll have the reassurance of owning a piece of a search engine behemoth that's still growing.\n\nTo put some figures to this contention, Alphabet grew its revenue 12% YOY to $96.5 billion and its earnings per share (EPS) 31% to $2.15 in last year's fourth quarter. Particularly impressive was Alphabet's growth in Google Cloud revenue, which surged 30% to $12 billion.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai mentioned AI repeatedly in Alphabet's quarterly press release -- but then, that's to be expected nowadays. All in all, investors should consider adding an easy, compelling value-and-growth mix to their portfolios today with GOOG/GOOGL stock.",

The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.08%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.92%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 1.41%.\n\nThe nation's second-largest bank's shares have seen a decrease of 10.49% over the last month, not keeping up with the Finance sector's loss of 4.3% and the S&P 500's loss of 8.26%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Bank of America will be of great interest to investors. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $0.80, showcasing a 3.61% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $26.71 billion, indicating a 3.47% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $3.68 per share and revenue of $108.36 billion, indicating changes of +12.2% and +6.36%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Bank of America. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.47% downward. Bank of America is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\n\nDigging into valuation, Bank of America currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 11.33. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 14.46, which means Bank of America is trading at a discount to the group.\n\nMeanwhile, BAC's PEG ratio is currently 1.13. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Financial - Investment Bank industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.05 as of yesterday's close.",

            "content": "Investors' uber bullish sentiment for US stocks came to a screeching halt over the past month.\n\nBank of America's latest Global Fund Manager Survey of 171 participants conducted in March showed the biggest monthly drop in investors' allocation to US equities on record, with the allocation falling 40% month-over-month. As recently as December, investors' allocation to US stocks had been at an all-time high.\n\nA team of Bank of America strategists led by Michael Hartnett described the move in the March survey as a \"bull crash,\" with investor appetite for US stocks tumbling amid the 10% drawdown in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) over the past month. The rotation went into cash, per Bank of America's survey, not bonds.\n\nThe swift nature of the correction in the S&P 500 could be seen as a buy sign. But as Hartnett's team points out, the recent market moves are more a flushing out of uber bullishness rather than an obvious catalyst for a contrarian trade. For instance, investors' portfolio allocation to cash rose from 3.5% to 4.1%, the largest one month rise since December 2021. But still cash levels remain well below the more than 6% level seen in October 2022 when Wall Street's consensus call projected an incoming recession.\n\nHartnett wrote the current sentiment levels are nowhere near \"close-your-eyes-and-buy levels.\"\n\nAnd as Wall Street strategists have pointed out recently, part of the reason right now might not be an obvious \"buy the dip\" moment comes back to what sent stocks down in the first place.\n\nA chart in BofA's survey shows 55% of respondents believe the biggest risk to markets is that the \"trade war triggers global recession.\" This marked the highest conviction in a risk since the pandemic topped the list in April 2020.\n\nBut despite a roughly 3% pop in stocks over the past two sessions, not much has changed in the trade war or growth scare story over the past week.\n\nMorgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson told clients on Sunday that \"a tradable rally\" is possible in markets. But Wilson doesn't see a sustainable rally to new record highs \"until the numerous growth headwinds are reversed\" or the Fed resumes interest rate cuts.\n\nThe next major test for the markets is set for Wednesday with the Federal Reserve's latest policy decision. With markets widely expecting the central bank to hold interest rates steady, investors will focus on any clues about when the central bank could cut rates again. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference is slated for 2:30 p.m. ET Wednesday.",

            "content": "As shown by a number of high-profile hires, the private banking arm of Bank of America continues to pursue opportunities in the US South and Southeast regions. We talk to one of its senior figures.\n\nMigration of wealth in the US \u2013 and from overseas \u2013 to the Southeast region, and not just to Florida, is a growth engine that Bank of America Private Bank is harnessing.\n\nA report in August 2024 by CNBC (citing a SmartAsset study) noted that Florida had the biggest net gain of affluent households. Using $200,000 of adjusted gross income as a threshold, the study, based on the 2021-21 tax year, crunched data about net inflows. Texas came second in the rankings, followed by North and South Carolina and Arizona.\n\nHong Ogle (pictured), Southeast/Southwest division executive at Bank of America Private Bank, considers such forces, and others, and is understandably optimistic. BoA\u2019s private banking clients are mostly domestic US, falling into the category of \u201cdeca-millionaires\u201d and up to the UHNW classification, leading to billionaires.\n\n\u201cWe see wealth migration to everywhere in the southeast,\u201d Ogle told Family Wealth Report in a recent interview, \u201cas an example of our investment in the region. We recently hired Luke Palacio from Citi to lead our South Florida market.\u201d (Palacio joined in October 2024.)\n\nIn February, the private bank appointed Mike Marino as Georgia market executiive. Previously, he worked at JP Morgan Private Bank, where he was vice chairman of its South Atlantic region. In November 2024, former Citi Private Bank figures overseeing a total of $7 billion of client money joined the private bank in Palm Beach.\n\nThere is a lot of territory that Ogle oversees. She is responsible for Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Texas. Ogle has overseen this region for three years.\n\n\u201cWe accommodate families who are based in the US but have businesses and families globally as part of a large, global bank,\u201d she continued.\n\nBoA obviously comes up against plenty of competitors, with the likes of Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management; Citi Private Bank, JP Morgan Private Bank and Wells Fargo Private Bank, among others. And there are medium-sized boutiques, single- and multi-family offices, and other wealth management organizations, in the region. (Editor's note: This news service is planning features about the Miami/Florida market in coming days; in January, it held its second Miami Family Wealth Report Awards incorporating Latin America and the Caribbean. Stay tuned for more details.)\n\nWarmth of the sun\n\n\u201cThey are seeking a warmer climate and have a second home there and they want to go there permanently. There are more people moving their business to the South,\u201d Ogle continued. \u201cA lot of younger people are moving to the South to start their business here.\u201d She gave examples such as young adults getting tech-related businesses off the ground in Houston, Texas.\n\nAn important focus is connecting with the \u201ccenters of influence\u201d such as lawyers, accountants, tax advisors, various businesses, art gallery owners, etc.\n\nAdded to that, Ogle said she and colleagues on the private banking side interact constantly with peers in other parts of BoA, such as commercial banking, investment banking, etc. \u201cWe know our partners across the hall, and we do a lot together,\u201d she said.\n\nAbout a third of referrals to the private bank are internal, she said.\n\nFinancial results appear to bear out Ogle\u2019s upbeat mood. The private banking arm\u2019s asset under management balances stood at $404 billion; and total client balances were $674 billion, with 720 net new relationships added in Q4 2024. In January, Bank of America said its global wealth and investment management arm logged a year-on-year gain in net income at $1.171 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by a rise in net revenue of $6 billion from $5.23 billion a year earlier.\n\nCulture fit\n\nOgle spoke about the importance of a culture fit for new private bankers. For example, a person working in southern Florida would be advantaged in speaking Spanish. Many advisors, trust officers, etc, do so, she said.\n\nThe private bank's advisors have a mix of ages to ensure a breadth of experience and comfort with different clients.\n\nThe bank is moving to more use of digital tech, such as AI.\n\n\u201cWe are moving towards more digital technology and AI is going to come into play\u2026we are looking to hire the best, who can use technology capabilities to work with clients, as well as grow market share,\u201d Ogle said.\n\nFor example, BoA spends $12 billion annually on technology, including $4 billion on new initiatives each year. Within the private bank, it has increased investment in new technology by 300 per cent since 2020.\n\n\u201cThis investment has created convenience and efficiency for both our clients and employees. For example, clients can now be onboarded digitally, and our advisor teams use a virtual assistant to quickly look up information. This gives them time back in their day to invest in new and existing clients,\u201d she said.\n\nOnboarding, for example, is an important \u201cpain point\u201d that banks want to ease as much as possible, as this recent Fenergo study demonstrates, based on data from a number of nations.\n\nFor all the talk about tech, that most traditional of banking roles, providing credit mustn\u2019t be overlooked. \u201cMost clients have some sort of borrowing needs \u2013 real estate, aviation, even sports teams,\u201d Ogle said.",

BofA\u2019s decision follows a broader trend among traditional financial institutions reassessing their crypto and digital asset strategies amid regulatory uncertainties and shifting consumer demand.\n\nThe potentially more damaging loss, however, comes from Webull, a popular trading platform that has been Bakkt\u2019s largest crypto partner. Webull\u2019s exit, set for June 14, directly threatens Bakkt\u2019s crypto services revenue stream, which depended on Webull for nearly three-quarters of its income in 2023 and 2024.\n\nThe terminations create material revenue uncertainty for Bakkt at a time when the company is already struggling to scale its crypto segment and loyalty business model.\n\nBakkt, which went public via a SPAC merger in 2021, has seen its share price decline more than 90% from its post-merger highs, reflecting continued skepticism over its growth prospects.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s Trump Media & Technology (TMTG) was reportedly in advanced talks to buy Bakkt in November, but those talks stalled out. The company also went through a restructuring during 2024. In February 2024, the company had said in an SEC filing that it might not be able to continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d\n\nSee also: OCC Says Banks Can Hold Crypto, but Should They?\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for the Institutional Crypto Ecosystem?\n\nAs Bakkt stumbles, the institutional crypto landscape is warming up and competition becoming more fierce as finTech companies, including Visa, PayPal, Revolut and Stripe, are exploring stablecoin integrations.\n\nLast month, BofA CEO Brian Moynihan said in an interview that the bank would \u201cgo into\u201d stablecoins if regulation were passed in the U.S., and regulatory compliance remains a key concern for financial stakeholders. The SEC on Monday said that the agency is reconsidering its proposed rule that would extend investment advisers\u2019 custodial requirements to crypto.\n\nThe PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cBlockchain\u2019s Benefits for Regulated Industries\u201d found that blockchain technology has numerous potential benefits to serve the unique needs of regulated industries, including finance.\n\n\u201cAs more banks integrate blockchain capabilities, customers will have greater choice in transferring value,\u201d FV Bank CEO Miles Paschini told PYMNTS this month. \u201cWe\u2019re blazing the trail for a future where blockchain is just another payment rail.\u201d",

According to Indeed, the average salary for an investment banker at Bank of America is $255,074 per year. Junior bankers are analysts or associates, making anywhere from $160,00 to $475,000 a year in total compensation.\n\nWorking 80 hours per week means clocking in at around 7 a.m. and leaving the office around 8:30 p.m., six days a week. In comparison, the average American works 34 hours a week.\n\nWorking long hours is the norm in investment banking. According to a 2023 survey from the finance community site Wall Street Oasis, first-year investment bankers reported working an average of 77.12 hours a week and sleeping 5.98 hours every night. Meanwhile, some people have claimed businesses can demand as much as 120 hours per week.\n\nRelated: Big Wall Street Banks Are Limiting Workweek Hours \u2014 to 80\n\nA WSJ investigation in August uncovered that Bank of America supervisors pressured junior bankers to underreport how many hours they worked. Following the article, Bank of America told junior bankers to report managers who overworked them. In September 2024, the bank released a time reporting tool that required junior bankers to log their daily activities in greater detail, instead of merely logging their weekly tasks, to keep track of hours worked.\n\n\"We want all of our junior bankers to have the best experience possible, learning from the teammates they work with and further benefiting from the career growth and development this role brings,\" a Bank of America spokesperson told the WSJ.\n\nNow, select senior bankers will be responsible for supervising and managing junior banker workloads. A source told the WSJ that executives are looking into other ways to save employees time, including using AI tools to help prepare pitch decks and financial forecasts.\n\nBank of America laid off 150 junior investment bankers based on low performance last week, the company said.\n\nBank of America employed 213,000 people globally, as of January.\n\nRelated: Bank of America Is Raising Its Minimum Wage.

It\u2019s a joint journey toward building out our capabilities and enhancing or even redesigning our infrastructures \u2026 to get out of the thought process of \u20189 to 5\u2019 and to operate on a 24/7 wavelength.\u201d\n\nLooking at the Long Term\n\nOver the long term, he said, real-time payments will become commonplace, reflecting the ways in which we exchange information \u2014 and the ever speedier ways in which we live.\n\nFor enterprises working with Bank of America, said Stanton, the benefits of real-time payments lie in greater control over when their beneficiary is paid \u2014 and how they\u2019re paid, which in turn means that the sender can better manage their working capital.\n\nAlong with the growth in pay-to-card and pay-by-bank use cases, Stanton was quick to note that \u201cRTP is not a solution looking for a problem,\u201d which is a mindset the bank seeks to bring to its clients, especially when they examine the ways and means that they are going to have to reconfigure their workflows and back-end processes, with artificial intelligence (AI) in the mix to provide additional lines of defense in anti-money laundering (AML) and transaction monitoring.\n\n\u201cThe workflow,\u201d he said, \u201cis going to need to be modified not only to transact and to send information simultaneously, but also to receive and digest the information that is being provided in order to truly benefit from RTP\u2019s transparency and speed.\u201d\n\nChoosing Among the Use Cases\n\nThere must also be the recognition that not all transactions need to be real time, he said, and partnering with a financial institution \u2014 such as Bank of America \u2014 can help firms determine the applicability of real-time payments for some use cases, but not others. Pay by bank, to name but one \u201ctype\u201d of real-time payment, can be embedded at the point of sale or within an eCommerce experience, said Stanton, and pay to card can improve B2C interactions such as with the gig economy.\n\n\u201cFrom a cross-border standpoint,\u201d he said, payments \u201care inundated with friction. What we\u2019re seeing in the global economy is that the user experience is paramount, and the RTP paves the way for additional value.\u201d The same is true for cross-border commercial payments, where costs are streamlined and all parties know exactly where and when payments have been sent \u2014 and when they\u2019ll arrive and settle.\n\nThat level of transparency fosters loyalty between buyers and suppliers and helps them navigate foreign exchange (FX) volatility, said Stanton. Bank of America, for its part, has integrated its FX solutions into the real-time payments value chain to help improve supply chain dynamics. Real-time payments are already transforming tech, media and telecom companies, remittance providers and eCommerce as they digitize payouts.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a level of instant gratification,\u201d he said, that is desired by the bank\u2019s clients and their own end customers, \u201cand so we have to be there to meet that demand.\u201d",

            "content": "Bank of America is reinventing the role of the investment banking \"staffer.\"\n\nStaffers are traditionally midlevel employees tasked with doling out jobs to junior bankers.\n\nBofA is elevating the role by making it permanent and giving it to higher ranking staff.\n\nBank of America is shaking up a long-standing investment banking tradition in its latest effort to prevent young bankers from burnout, Business Insider has learned.\n\nOn Wall Street, the job of doling out tasks to entry-level bankers has traditionally rested with a handful of midlevel bankers widely referred to as \"staffers.\" A criticism of the staffer role is that the midlevel bankers assigned to the job have little incentive or power to protect young bankers who might be overworked.\n\nBank of America is now giving the responsibility for junior banker workloads exclusively to members of its highest ranks: directors and above, according to a person with knowledge of the switch. The role will also be permanent. (Traditionally, the staffer role is filled by senior associates or vice presidents on a rotating basis.)\n\n\"The change here is that they will focus solely on this job,\" the person said, adding: \"These are senior bankers with strong leadership skills who either have raised their hands or have been tapped.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal was the first to report the change on Monday. It comes less than a year after a Bank of America associate died following his team's closing of a $2 billion deal, igniting a series of initatives geared toward protecting junior bankers from overwork.\n\nAt Bank of America, \"staffers\" are given the title CRO for chief resource officer, this person said.\n\nIn the past, bankers were designated to the CRO role temporarily \u2014 handling staffing for managing directors in need of a team to close a deal. By making the role permanent and filling it with senior leaders, the hope is that the incentive will shift from getting a deal done to building the next generation of talent, the BofA insider said.\n\n\"By working with these teams day in and day out, they'll have a better sense of leadership, strengths, work assignments, and developmental opportunities \u2014 how do you get this person to the next level?\" this person said.\n\nThe new CROs will be under the leadership of Andrew Karp, a Bank of America veteran who will retain his role as head of sustainable banking solutions, according to the person familiar.\n\nIn May, Bank of America associate Leo Lukenas died of what was determined to be acute coronary artery thrombus, which causes blood to clot in the heart. His death sparked a series of reports about 100-plus hour workweeks by current and former BofA bankers, as well as concerns, first reported by BI, about the bank's tool for flagging excessive work hours.\n\nBank of America in September said it would implement a new time-tracking tool. Around the same time, JPMorgan promised to cap hours at 80 per week, unless bankers were on live deals, and created a new junior banker protector role.",

            "content": "Shares of Bank of America (BAC 1.42%) are down approximately 14% from their 52-week high amid the broader stock market sell-off. Concern over the U.S. economy and the impact of trade tariffs being implemented by the Trump administration have marked a decisive shift in investor sentiment.\n\nNevertheless, you might not want to withdraw your interest in this banking titan just yet. The company remains highly profitable and is well positioned to create shareholder value over the long run.\n\nIs now the time to buy the dip, or cash out? Let's discuss what to do with Bank of America stock now.\n\nThe case to buy and hold Bank of America\n\nMixed economic signals from key indicators have compelled investors to reassess some of their loftiest expectations from the start of the year. The headlines surrounding trade policy, with mixed messaging about the extent and duration of tariffs, haven't helped. Historically, markets dislike this type of unpredictability, which helps explain why the S&P 500 index has declined about 8% from its recent peak.\n\nStill, it's crucial to keep the bigger picture in mind. Beyond some lower stock prices, little has changed in the real economy, and it's business as usual for most companies.\n\nThere are also some positive developments. The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for February showed a lower-than-expected annual rate of inflation: 2.8%, down from January's 3% pace. This is encouraging because cooling inflation could provide the Federal Reserve with the flexibility to cut interest rates, which in turn could support economic activity and boost demand for loans.\n\nBecause Bank of America is one of the largest financial institutions in the United States, its stock price is closely tied to how these conditions unfold.\n\nThe bank had a record year in 2024, surpassing $100 billion in net revenue for the first time, highlighted by strong fee income across all business segments and a 4% increase in earnings per share (EPS) from 2023. Key themes from last year include the bank's digital innovation, where the increasing adoption of mobile banking and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities have helped improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance client engagement.\n\nDuring the fourth-quarter earnings report (for the period ended Dec. 31), CEO Brian Moynihan expressed confidence in the outlook, suggesting the bank's foundation was stronger than ever:\n\nWe finished 2024 with a strong fourth quarter. Every source of revenue increased, and we achieved better-than-industry growth in deposits and loans. We believe this broad momentum positions Bank of America very well for 2025.\n\nInvestors convinced that the U.S. economy will push through this latest iteration of the proverbial \"wall of worry\" have ample reasons to buy and hold Bank of America stock.\n\nThe case to sell Bank of America\n\nDespite room for optimism that the recent stock market weakness may be temporary, the possibility that economic conditions could deteriorate cannot be dismissed. A scenario in which consumer spending weakens, leading to rising unemployment and diminished corporate earnings, would directly impact Bank of America. We're not there yet, but it's a risk investors need to weigh.\n\nAnother challenge warranting caution is that the stock doesn't necessarily scream that it's a bargain, even after the pullback. Valuation metrics -- including a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 12.5 and a price-to-book value (P/B) of 1.1 -- are both near their five-year running averages, suggesting the stock is neither significantly overvalued nor undervalued, but could still fall further.\n\nInvestors who believe 2025 will prove challenging for the bank might consider selling the stock or at least avoiding it for now.\n\nDecision time: A wait-and-see approach\n\nRecognizing the near-term uncertainties, Bank of America stock offers a 2.6% dividend yield and enough tailwinds in its outlook to justify continuing to hold it. That said, for investors still on the sidelines, there's likely no need to rush out and load up on shares, as a bit of patience could provide a more attractive buying opportunity at a lower price if volatility persists.\n\nEither way, Bank of America remains a bellwether for the economy that all investors should keep on their radar.",

REUTERS\n\nThe shift in oversight comes on the heels of the bank\u2019s decision to eliminate approximately 150 junior investment banking positions last week, primarily targeting employees deemed lower-performing, sources familiar with the situation told the Journal.\n\nThe layoffs stoked concerns over possible increased workloads for those remaining on affected teams, the Journal reported.\n\nA Wall Street Journal investigation last year revealed that young bankers at major firms often faced extreme hours \u2014 with some working up to 120 hours per week and being pressured to downplay their actual workload.\n\nLukenas, who had been assisting on a $2 billion deal, had reportedly endured consecutive weeks of 100-hour workloads before his death.\n\n4 Lukenas, seen with his wife and two young children, reportedly logged 100-hour weeks in the period leading up to his death. Linkedin / Leo Lukenas\n\nAn autopsy later determined that his death was caused by a blood clot in his heart.\n\nFollowing Lukenas\u2019 death, further investigations revealed that junior bankers were frequently encouraged to misrepresent their hours to avoid breaching company-imposed limits designed to regulate excessive workloads.\n\nThose restrictions had been established after the 2013 death of another young employee who had worked through multiple all-nighters.\n\nIn response to these revelations, several financial institutions, including JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, imposed caps on weekly working hours.\n\nJPMorgan said that it would cap junior bankers\u2019 work hours at 80 per week \u2014 with exceptions to be made in certain cases such as a live deal.\n\nGoldman Sachs, which has long been dogged by employee complaints of burnout, declined to offer a formal cap on weekly hours. Instead, it offers a \u201cprotected Saturday\u201d policy, allowing junior bankers time off from 9 p.m. Friday to 9 a.m. Sunday \u2014 with certain exceptions.\n\n4 Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan is pictured above.

            "content": "Equity markets have not performed well so far in 2025, with macroeconomic tensions, including President Donald Trump's trade wars, playing a role. On the bright side, the ongoing volatility could create excellent opportunities to buy shares of great companies on the dip.\n\nTake Amazon (AMZN) and Bank of America (BAC), two leaders in their respective industries that feature in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. After significant pullbacks for both stocks since the year started, they boast substantial upside, according to analysts.\n\nWall Street's average price target of $264.71 for Amazon (per Yahoo! Finance) implies an upside of 37% from its current levels, while Bank of America's price target of $52.83 says it could jump by 33%. The street thinks these stocks are buys, but what should investors do given the current state of the market? Let's find out.\n\nSome reasons to be pessimistic\n\nIt might be tempting to speculate which way the market will go next. You could maximize your gains if you can time the bottom of this ongoing downturn. Further, with fears of a recession mounting, investors might also think avoiding certain industries altogether is best.\n\nAmazon is an e-commerce specialist that also offers a range of other products and services. Most of the company's operating profits don't come from the sale of goods. The tech giant won't perform nearly as well during a recession.\n\nThe same goes for Bank of America. Though it is one of the largest companies in this vital industry, bank stocks face significant challenges during poor economic times. The U.S. Federal Reserve might choose to lower interest rates if a recession hits (that's what it usually does) -- that's bad for banks since it means lower interest income. Also, consumers face more financial troubles during bad times, which can lead to higher defaults on loans, which is also bad for banks.\n\nSo, Bank of America might not perform well if a recession hits. One could conjure more bearish arguments in favor of avoiding Amazon and Bank of America right now despite Wall Street's price target. However, my view is that both stocks are still worth investing in today.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture\n\nPrecisely timing the market is impossible, making it a strategy not worth trying. The formula to earn substantial returns remains the same regardless of what broader equities are doing: Buy shares of great companies and hold on to them for a long time, ideally forever, even through market downturns.\n\nAnd when bad times hit, it's usually a great time to pick up more shares of these robust businesses. Amazon and Bank of America fit the bill.\n\nStarting with Amazon, it boasts the leading position in several major industries where it does business, significant growth opportunities, and a wide moat. Amazon has the largest market share in the U.S. e-commerce space. It also leads the fast-growing cloud computing industry. It has two especially promising growth opportunities: advertising and cloud computing. The latter is growing even faster thanks to artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmazon's advertising business now boasts an annual run rate of $69 billion. It has more than doubled from the $29 billion it had four years ago. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud computing arm, has a run rate of $115 billion.\n\nWhat about Amazon's moat? The company benefits from the network effect within its e-commerce business, while its cloud computing offerings have high switching costs. That's to say nothing of Amazon's brand name, one of the most valuable in the world.\n\nBank of America's prospects look promising, too. The company is one of the largest banks in the U.S., with a wide range of products and services for all the needs of individuals and businesses of all shapes and sizes. Bank of America's business is diversified across several segments, including consumer banking and investment management.\n\nThanks to switching costs, Bank of America benefits from a moat, as consumers plugged into its ecosystem can find it challenging to jump ship and leave the convenience and benefits they have built over the years doing business with the company.\n\nLastly, Bank of America should continue growing its revenue and earnings over the long run as the economy expands, thanks to its entrenched position in the market. Long-term investors can safely add this stock to their portfolios.\n\nHere's the bottom line for both of these stocks. Bank of America and Amazon may or may not hit their price targets in the next 12 months. If I were a betting man, my money would be on they won't.\n\nBut that should mean little to those with an investment horizon that spans the next decade. Despite recent volatility, these companies look attractive.",

Then USAID cuts came.\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Fired USAID employees applauded leaving DC office for last time Demonstrators outside the USAID offices in Washington, D.C., broke into applause as fired employees returned to pick up their belongings.\n\nPlan International received approximately $25 million a year from USAID for programs in places like Guatemala, Nepal and Ethiopia.\n\nA dozen years ago, Plan shifted their main global focus to the needs of girls, who are often left behind in developing countries.\n\nPlan had a major initiative in Nepal with a $20 million USAID grant over four years to track a million kids into education and skills training, which can protect girls from child marriage.\n\nShanna Marzilli was in her office in Providence's Foundry building when she began to get worrisome messages from the federal government \u2013 they were pausing USAID programs immediately.\n\nAs president of Plan International, a global humanitarian group headquartered here, she knew she could be a target.\n\n\u201cPlan,\u201d as it\u2019s called, is mostly under the radar locally but has been a major force for 90 years, with a $1 billion annual budget helping tens of millions of needy souls in over 50 nations. It\u2019s an underappreciated Rhode Island-based icon with a worldwide footprint.\n\nShanna knew that Plan gets $25 million a year from USAID for programs in places like Guatemala, Nepal and Ethiopia. Now, she was told, those were being halted. Indeed, Shanna checked Plan\u2019s Bank of America account and saw that expected USAID money was no longer coming through.\n\nShanna, 51, has headed Plan\u2019s USA headquarters in Providence for 11 years. Around 35 people work here in town, but the agency\u2019s global staff numbers an astonishing 6,000. Most are village locals, which is part of Plan\u2019s mission, employing people where they live.\n\nOne of Shanna\u2019s biggest concerns at the USAID news was a Plan project in Ethiopia helping refugees in the Tigray province displaced by an ugly war the world mostly ignored.\n\nPlan, she knew, had a warehouse there stocked with food and medicine for exiles in nearby camps. But the D.C. directives were clear \u2013 even that effort had to be paused. Shanna saw it as a tragedy \u2013 the supplies had already been purchased and were sitting there.\n\nThey had to fight this.\n\nShe and her staff tried to reach USAID folks they knew in Washington but found that many had already been laid off. So they contacted Rhode Island\u2019s congressional delegation, as well as USAID staffers in Ethiopia. Finally, after days of appeals, they got good news on Feb. 12 \u2013 their Ethiopia warehouse, deemed a lifesaving mission, received a waiver to get back to work.\n\nBut two weeks later, Shanna was in her North Kingstown home when Plan\u2019s general counsel, James Peters, called to say that Washington had reversed course \u2013 the Ethiopia project was now being terminated.\n\n\u201cIt was shocking and sad,\u201d Shanna told me.\n\nThey had no choice but to shut the warehouse doors.\n\nBut Shanna and her staff kept pushing. The Tigray situation remains a crisis. There had to be a way.\n\nI\u2019ll get to the warehouse project\u2019s current status in a moment, but first, some background.\n\nAlthough I have not been in touch with Plan in years, I have long been a fan of the group.\n\nMy first foreign trip as a journalist was to Africa during a 1980s famine, and Plan\u2019s Rhode Island staff, then in Warwick, helped point me to stories. I ended up spending a day in Sudan with a Plan staffer named Jim Geenen who was coaxing a dry field to grow crops to help people there survive. I remember Jim longing for two things \u2013 a cold beer in a Muslim country where alcohol was banned, and seeing the desert bloom.\n\nAt one point, my own family also sponsored a young African girl named Fariel through a Plan program, our monthly payments supporting her and her family. Fariel occasionally wrote us letters.\n\nThat program \u2013 now at $39 a month \u2013 is still a big part of Plan, and Shanna herself supports one of 41,000 sponsored kids, in her case a young girl in Guatemala. What makes the sponsor program effective is that the monthly donations support community projects like schools and health centers that benefit the kids \u2013 and their villages \u2013 more broadly than direct payments to families.\n\nA dozen years ago, Plan shifted their main global focus to the needs of girls, who are often left behind in developing countries.\n\nWhen I asked for examples, Shanna said there are hundreds of millions of girls left out of schooling. Culturally, said Shanna, many girls in poverty are tracked instead toward household chores like gathering water. There\u2019s also a belief that girls should focus on being taken care of through marriage instead of their own careers.\n\nAnother barrier, said Shanna, is that schools are far from many villages. So, for example, in Zimbabwe, Plan created a dorm for girls at a school site, including staff for health support and job training.\n\nShanna was recently in Guatemala to see similar Plan programs, including one encouraging older females to go back to classes. One 53-year-old mother there told Shanna, \u201cHow can I expect my children to do better if they don\u2019t see me finish school?\u201d\n\nOn that trip, Shanna also met her own sponsored child, 6-year-old Liliana. Shanna\u2019s $39 monthly payments to her go in part to a Plan agricultural program helping Liliana\u2019s family improve their farm yields.\n\nChatting with Shanna was a reminder to me of how complex it is to help folks in developing countries out of poverty. For example, countless kids are in villages lacking electricity, preventing them from doing homework at night. So Plan has projects to address that, too.\n\nPlan also has a big corporate program with Kimberly Clark, stocking schools in 10 countries with feminine hygiene products \u2013 the lack of them is another reason girls don\u2019t go to school and are left behind.\n\nShanna told me about a Guatemala program called \u201cConnections to Success\u201d offering skill training and $100 to $500 in seed money to younger folks between ages 16 and 21 to start careers. One woman created a seamstress business while another opened a convenience store in a village.\n\nThose opportunities, said Shanna, give people in that region a path to stay in their communities instead of trying to migrate to Mexico or America.\n\nThat Guatemala program, said Shanna, will survive because it\u2019s funded by private donors.\n\nBut others have been shut down by the USAID cuts. One example: Plan had a major initiative in Nepal with a $20 million USAID grant over four years to track a million kids into education and skills training, which can protect girls from child marriage. That program, said Shanna, was terminated.\n\nWith its $1 billion budget and strong donor base, Plan will remain a global humanitarian force. But of its 13 projects supported by USAID, said Shanna, 12 have now been closed, including one protecting girls in Burkina Faso from being trafficked and another offering child daycare to 45,000 women factory workers in Ethiopia to help them keep their jobs.\n\nAnd the 13th?\n\nThat would be the warehouse in Tigray.\n\nShanna and her team kept up appeals for that one. It finally worked. A week ago, they were told the warehouse project was \u201cunterminated,\u201d a rare case of a USAID project continuing.\n\nThe victory reminded Shanna of an essential philosophy for those in the humanitarian business: With so many barriers, you have to be an optimist.\n\nBut from her office in Providence, Plan International's Shanna Marzilli now has one more barrier she didn\u2019t expect.\n\nmpatinki@providencejournal.com",

            "content": "Deutsche Bank warns that European investors are facing significant investment losses as the traditional negative correlation between the dollar and the U.S. stock market is breaking down.\n\nThis year, the dollar has failed to provide a safe haven during declines in the U.S. stock market as it has in the past, prompting a reassessment of unhedged dollar assets. UBS points out that doubts about \"American exceptionalism\" are shaking global investors' confidence in U.S. assets, potentially leading to large-scale dollar sell-offs. This means that investors need to reassess the risk exposure of their portfolios and be wary of the potential risks of dollar depreciation.\n\nThe Dollar is No Longer a \"Safe Haven\": A Painful Reality\n\nGeorge Saravelos, the global head of foreign exchange research at Deutsche Bank, describes the current market conditions as \"some painful things are happening.\"\n\nDeutsche Bank has found that European investors' losses on their S&P 500 holdings have reached levels seen during the 30% sell-off triggered by inflation in 2022 (Figure 1). However, unlike in the past, the dollar has failed to rebound even when the U.S. stock market declines. Instead, the dollar's weakness this year has exacerbated potential asset losses rather than providing a hedge.\n\nDeutsche Bank notes that the dollar's safe-haven properties have played a key role in portfolio allocation over the past decade. When \"bad things\" happen, the dollar tends to rise, making unhedged U.S. risk assets a very attractive portfolio diversification tool. But now, this pattern is changing.\n\nThe Decline of American Exceptionalism and the Dollar's Vulnerability\n\nUBS's previous report has sounded the alarm. The bank points out that the \"American exceptionalism\" that once supported the dollar's hegemony is facing severe challenges.\n\nChina's rise in technology and artificial intelligence, declining expectations for U.S. economic growth (affected by trade frictions and tightening fiscal policies), and hopes for accelerated fiscal spending and growth driven by Europe's ambitious security policies are all challenging the \"overweight\" status of U.S. assets. These factors are shaking the excessive allocation to U.S. assets that has been built over the past decade.\n\nUBS warns that approximately $14 trillion of unhedged U.S. assets are at risk. If foreign investors reduce their holdings by 5%, it could trigger $700 billion in dollar sell-offs. The dollar may face depreciation pressure due to declining confidence among foreign investors in U.S. assets, especially against the backdrop of European investors significantly increasing their holdings of U.S. stocks, with the euro potentially becoming the main rival currency to the dollar.\n\nA report from Bank of America also shows that the gap between bearish sentiment on the dollar and investors' dollar exposure has reached levels seen in 2020, indicating that the dollar may decline further. Dollar sentiment has sharply reversed to the most pessimistic since 2021. Analyst Adarsh Sinha stated, \"While positions have turned bearish, they are severely lagging behind the dramatic change in sentiment.\"\n\nWhy is the US dollar depreciating?\n\nDeutsche Bank believes that the weakening of the dollar can be attributed, on one hand, to the downward repricing of expectations regarding US fiscal policy, economic growth, and the Federal Reserve (Fed). On the other hand, the Trump administration's numerous challenges to the existing international order may also be undermining the dollar's safe-haven status.\n\nIf the correlation between the US stock market and the dollar continues to break down, it will prompt European (and global) asset managers to engage in deeper discussions about diversifying returns on unhedged risk assets exposed to the dollar. Some news reports suggest that this situation may have already begun. This means that the likelihood of significantly reducing dollar exposure is increasing.\n\nIt is noteworthy that while the \"Mar-a-Lago Agreement,\" which is currently a hot topic on Wall Street, may weaken the dollar, Deutsche Bank believes that policies that undermine the dollar's economic foundation will achieve the same effect.\n\nFunds may flow back to Europe and emerging markets\n\nEuropean investors are the largest holders of US stocks, holding about $4.6 trillion, followed by Canada ($2 trillion), the UK ($1.9 trillion), and Japan ($1.1 trillion). (UBS) If the European economic recovery and fiscal policy support can be sustained, these funds may pose a \"potential threat\" to the dollar.\n\nCurrently, foreign investors have a foreign exchange hedging ratio of only 20% for US stocks and 50% for fixed income. This means that most US assets are exposed and unhedged. Once market sentiment reverses, these unhedged assets may quickly trigger a dollar sell-off.\n\nAs the \"American exceptionalism\" narrative weakens, the pattern of global capital flows is changing. European investors' holdings of US stocks have significantly increased in recent years, but with the improvement in the European economic outlook and fiscal policy support, some funds may flow back to Europe. Additionally, emerging market investors are also reassessing their portfolios, with some funds potentially flowing into Asia and other emerging economies.\n\nRisk Warning and Disclaimer\n\nThe market has risks, and investment requires caution.

            "probability": null,
            "content": "Headwinds appear to be mounting for the U.S. economy and stock market.\n\nFor the better part of the last two and a half years, the bulls have been in firm control on Wall Street. The mature stock-powered Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI 1.65%), benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC 2.13%), and growth-oriented Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 2.61%) all achieved numerous record-closing highs during the current bull market rally.\n\nThe catalysts behind this rally have been abundant and include stock-split euphoria, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, President Donald Trump's November victory, and the resilience of the U.S. economy. Unfortunately, the foundation of the U.S. economy may not be as strong as advertised.\n\nThis recession-forecasting tool was last wrong in 1966\n\nAt any given moment, there's bound to be one or more data points, events, or correlative statistics that spell trouble for the U.S. economy and/or stock market. For example, in 2023 we witnessed the first sizable decline in U.S. M2 money supply since the Great Depression. The very few times M2 has dropped by 2% on a year-over-basis, when back-tested more than 150 years, correlate with periods of depression and double-digit unemployment in the U.S.\n\nBut M2 money supply doesn't appear to be signaling imminent trouble for the U.S. economy. The same can't necessarily be said for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's recession probability tool.\n\nThe New York Fed's recession-forecasting tool takes into account the difference in yield (known as spread) between the 10-year Treasury bond and three-month Treasury bill to decipher how likely it is that the U.S. economy will fall into a recession over the next 12 months.\n\nTypically, the Treasury yield curve, which is a depiction of various bond and bill maturity dates mapped out by yield over time, slopes up and to the right. This is to say, bonds set to mature in 10, 20 or 30 years are going to bear higher yields than Treasury bills maturing in a year or less. Ideally, the longer your money is tied up in an interest-bearing investment vehicle, the higher the yield should be.\n\nWhere things get wonky is when the Treasury yield curve inverts. This is where the yield on short-term T-bills is higher than for long-term bonds. Yield-curve inversions typically occur when investors are concerned about the outlook for the U.S. economy. Although not every yield-curve inversion has been followed by a recession, it's worth pointing out that every recession since World War II has been preceded by a yield-curve inversion.\n\nAs you'll note from the chart, one of the steepest (and lengthiest) inversions of the 10-year/three-month yield curve in history led to a recession probability that peaked at north of 70% in 2023. Since October 1966, there hasn't been a single instance where the probability of a U.S. recession has surpassed 32% and an official downturn failed to materialize.\n\nBut this is just one-half of an important data set that's helped to accurately forecast U.S. recessions over the last 59 years. Additionally, recessions have almost always manifested when the yield curve has begun recovering. In other words, economic downturns have often taken shape as, or very shortly after, the yield curve uninverts (i.e., returns to normal) -- and that's where we are right now.\n\nPerhaps it's no coincidence that the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's March 6 GDPNow forecast called for a 2.4% contraction in U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter. Putting aside the wild GDP fluctuations during the COVID-19 pandemic, a 2.4% decline in GDP would mark the biggest decline since the Great Recession in 2009.\n\nSince recessions tend to adversely impact corporate earnings, the implication is that the recent sell-off in the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite might accelerate. According to an analysis from Bank of America Global Research, approximately two-thirds of the S&P 500's peak-to-trough drawdowns from 1927 through March 2023 have occurred after a U.S. recession was declared.\n\nEconomic cycles aren't linear, and that's music to the ears of investors\n\nBased solely on historic precedent, the U.S. economy and stock market appear to be headed for a challenging couple of quarters. But that's the great thing about history -- there are two sides to every coin.\n\nAs much as working Americans and investors might dislike downturns in the U.S. economy, no amount of fiscal or monetary policy changes can prevent them from happening. Recessions are a normal part of the economic cycle.\n\nBut here's the key point about recessions that investors should home in on: The average downturn over the last 80 years has lasted roughly 10 months. Three-quarters of the 12 recessions that have occurred since the end of World War II were resolved in less than a year.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, the average economic expansion has endured for around five years. Over the last eight decades, there have been two growth periods that surpassed the 10-year mark. While recessions may be perfectly normal, they take a clear back seat to economic expansions, in terms of sheer length.\n\nThis nonlinear disparity is something investors can find on Wall Street, as well.\n\nIt's official. A new bull market is confirmed.\n\n\n\nThe S&P 500 is now up 20% from its 10/12/22 closing low. The prior bear market saw the index fall 25.4% over 282 days.\n\n\n\nRead more at https://t.co/H4p1RcpfIn. pic.twitter.com/tnRz1wdonp -- Bespoke (@bespokeinvest) June 8, 2023\n\nEven though the data set is 21 months old, an analysis published on social media platform X in June 2023 by Bespoke Investment Group perfectly lays out the advantages of perspective, time, and optimism when investing in the stock market.\n\nBespoke compared the calendar-day length of every S&P 500 bull and bear market, dating back to the start of the Great Depression in September 1929. This worked out to 27 separate bear and bull markets.\n\nOn one hand, the average bear market resolved in 286 calendar days, or roughly 9.5 months. Data also showed that no bear market surpassed 630 calendar days. On the other, the average S&P 500 bull market lasted for 1,011 calendar days over a 94-year period, with approximately half of all bull markets enduring for more than 630 calendar days.\n\nWhile there's no guaranteed method for predicting recessions and stock market downturns, the closest thing you'll get to a guarantee on Wall Street is that the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite will increase in value over long periods. That's music to the ears of long-term investors, even if a possible recession is around the corner.",

            "content": "Listen to article\n\nWall Street faced another turbulent week as US stocks entered correction territory, with the Nasdaq 100 shedding $1 trillion in market value on Monday, marking its steepest one-day decline since October 2022.\n\nThe S&P 500 also suffered its worst fortnight in two years, posting back-to-back weekly losses exceeding 3%.\n\nInvestor sentiment soured amid growing recession fears, compounded by former President Donald Trump\u2019s comments that the economy was in a \"period of transition\" and the administration\u2019s warning of short-term economic pain before an anticipated recovery.\n\nThe so-called \"Trump bump\" has now turned into a slump, with the S&P 500 erasing all gains made since the 2024 election. The \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks have also entered bear market territory, plunging more than 20% since the start of the year.\n\nDespite lower-than-expected consumer and producer price data, 10-year US Treasury yields remained stubbornly high, failing to provide a safe haven for investors.\n\nTesla crashes as sales slump, Musk\u2019s influence questioned\n\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has now erased all post-election gains despite vocal support from Trump, as investors grow wary of declining sales and CEO Elon Musk\u2019s controversial role in the administration.\n\nShares plunged to their lowest level in nearly five years on Monday, with JP Morgan slashing its first-quarter delivery forecast by 20% to 335,000 units, well below the consensus estimate of 430,000. If realized, this would mark an 8% year-on-year decline and Tesla\u2019s weakest quarterly delivery figure since Q3 2022.\n\nThe company has also raised concerns about US trade policy. In a letter to US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Tesla warned that the White House\u2019s stance could expose American businesses to retaliatory tariffs and urged policymakers to ensure US companies are not inadvertently harmed.\n\nDelta Air Lines plunges on profit warning\n\nDelta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) was among the hardest-hit stocks, tumbling 14% on Monday after slashing its first-quarter profit forecast by more than half. The airline now expects earnings of $0.30 to $0.50 per share, down from its earlier projection of $0.70 to $1.00.\n\nBank of America analysts said the downgrade was anticipated, but its severity took the market by surprise. They warned that more airlines could follow suit as economic uncertainty unfolds.\n\nDelta CEO Ed Bastian told CNBC that corporate travel demand had weakened due to economic concerns, with businesses cutting back on spending. The airline now expects first-quarter revenue growth of 3% to 4% year-on-year, down from a previous forecast of 7% to 9%.\n\nRetailers feel consumer strain\n\nUS retailers are also showing signs of strain as higher interest rates and lingering inflation weigh on consumer spending.\n\nDollar General CEO Todd Vasos said many low-income shoppers, who make up a significant portion of the chain\u2019s customer base, are struggling to afford even basic necessities.\n\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon echoed these concerns, noting that some US shoppers were running out of money before the end of the month and opting for smaller pack sizes due to high food prices.\n\nConsumer confidence has weakened, with a growing number of households pessimistic about their financial prospects. Analysts warn that rising unemployment concerns tied to President Trump\u2019s economic policies could further dampen spending.\n\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters also issued a warning, saying 2025 revenue would likely miss expectations due to slowing demand for clothing and accessories. Department store chain Kohl\u2019s and sporting goods retailer Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods similarly forecast weaker sales for the year.\n\nMarket\n\nWith stocks under pressure, analysts warn that economic uncertainty, shifting trade policies, and weak consumer sentiment could prolong market volatility. Investors will be closely watching upcoming economic data and corporate earnings for further signals on the trajectory of the US economy.",

The news of Tan's appointment, effective next Tuesday, has invigorated investor confidence, fueling speculation about possible strategic shifts in Intel's foundry business.\n\nShares of Intel have surged nearly 17% this week, closing at $24.05 on Friday. Analysts at Deutsche Bank regard the leadership change as a \"desirable outcome\" for the chipmaker, praising Tan's extensive expertise in the semiconductor landscape. Meanwhile, Bank of America analysts have suggested that Tan may pave the way for a transformative strategy within the foundry segment, amidst ongoing acquisition rumors.\n\nEarlier, speculation intensified about the future of Intel's foundry business when Reuters reported potential collaboration talks with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) about forming a joint venture with notable industry players like Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO). Such a partnership could potentially strengthen Intel's position within the U.S. semiconductor industry.\n\nThis positive development marks a notable recovery for Intel's stock, which has experienced a 20% increase in 2025, positioning it as the top-performing chip stock on the S&P 500 so far this year. This rebound is a welcome change following a challenging 2024, where the company's stock lost more than half of its value.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

By age 75, nearly two-fifths of Americans have reaped an inheritance, according to a 2023 report from the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cThat means the typical family is not leaving an inheritance,\u201d said Michael Neal, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute.\n\nThis age range is the sweet spot for inheritance\n\nYou\u2019re most likely to inherit between the ages of 56 and 65, according to a 2021 analysis by researchers at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Americans ages 46 to 55 are next most likely to inherit.\n\nSpend your money smart: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Money newsletter.\n\nAll of those studies draw from the federal Survey of Consumer Finances, conducted every three years and most recently in 2022.\n\nAmong those who do inherit, the average amount is $266,000, as of 2022, the Washington Post reports.\n\nThe good news, if you hope to inherit, is that inheritances are becoming more common.\n\n\u201cSimply put, there are more people aging into prime inheritance age over time,\u201d said Kent Smetters, a Wharton professor who is involved in inheritance research.\n\nWhether you inherit, and how much, depends on your age, your race, your education, and the wealth you already have, among other factors.\n\nAmong older Americans, 35% of white households have received an inheritance, compared with 13% of Black households, the Richmond Fed reports. For those who inherit, the average amount is $154,260 for Black Americans, $303,100 for white Americans.\n\n\u201cIn aggregate, there just tends to be less transferred to Black families,\u201d Neal said.\n\nOne reason why Black households receive fewer and smaller inheritances is that Black Americans are less likely to have a will, according to research by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.\n\n\u201cThe racial wealth gap has proven to be a persistent problem,\u201d said Gal Wettstein, a senior economist at the research center.\n\nWealth transfers go to about 22% of older Americans who have only a high school degree. The share rises to 39% for college graduates, according to the Richmond Fed.\n\nMost Americans hope to leave an inheritance\n\nAmerica's inheritance story comes with a sad twist: Most people really do want to leave something behind.\n\nRoughly three-fifths of Americans hope to pass a sizable estate to their heirs, either definitely or \"possibly,\" the Urban Institute reported in a 2023 study. Those expectations are roughly the same for white and Black families.\n\nYet, for many families, life gets in the way. Some households don't adequately plan to leave a significant estate, researchers said. Others spend their assets paying for long-term care. Many families never achieve homeownership, a key step in building wealth.\n\n\"You can't pass the wealth off if you don't have the wealth in the first place,\" Neal said.\n\nInheritance makes wealthy Americans wealthier\n\nThough it might sound unfair, Americans who have high incomes tend to inherit a lot more money than those with low incomes.\n\nThe median inheritance across all incomes is $12,353, in 2019 dollars, Wharton researchers found. For households with incomes in the top 5%, the sum rises to $51,499.\n\nIf you inherit a really large bundle of cash, you\u2019re more likely than ever to be allowed to keep it, thanks in part to President Donald Trump.\n\nAs recently as 2008, estate taxes applied to estates as small as $2 million, according to the Tax Foundation. By 2017, the estate tax threshold had risen to about $5.5 million. Trump\u2019s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doubled the nontaxable limit to $11.2 million. In 2025, the threshold stands at nearly $14 million.\n\nAs a result, fewer wealthy Americans pay estate taxes. The number of returns subject to estate taxes dropped from 15,100 in 2008 to 4,000 in 2023, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.\n\nThat trend \u201cwill only accelerate existing wealth disparities,\u201d said Collins of IPS, \u201cincluding the racial wealth divide.\u201d",

            "content": "The Oracle of Omaha's long-term optimism and unwavering focus on value are at odds.\n\nOver the last three weeks, Wall Street has sent investors a wake-up call to remind them that stocks do, in fact, move in both directions. Following a nearly 2.5-year bull market rally, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC -1.39%), and growth stock-propelled Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC -1.96%) find themselves 8%, 9.3%, and 13.6% below their respective all-time closing highs, as of March 11.\n\nAmong Wall Street's numerous money managers, perhaps none is least surprised by this move lower in equities than Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A 1.51%) (BRK.B 1.68%) billionaire CEO Warren Buffett. Although the aptly named \"Oracle of Omaha\" is an unwavering long-term optimist when it comes to the U.S. economy and stock market, his $173 billion warning to Wall Street over the last two years has been an ominous signal that trouble was brewing.\n\nWarren Buffett has been a persistent net seller of stocks for over two years\n\nTo reiterate, Berkshire Hathaway's chief has opined, on multiple occasions, that investors shouldn't bet against America. Even though Buffett and his top investment advisors (Todd Combs and Ted Weschler) realize that economic downturns and stock market corrections are inevitable, they also recognize that periods of economic expansion and bull markets last substantially longer than downturns.\n\nNevertheless, Warren Buffett's trading activity over short periods doesn't always align with his long-term investment philosophy.\n\nWhile quarterly filed Form 13Fs with the Securities and Exchange Commission allow investors to see which stocks Buffett and his team have been buying and selling, Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly cash flow statement provides precise insight on how much in net equities the Oracle of Omaha has purchased or sold.\n\nOver the previous nine quarters, Buffett has been a persistent net seller of stocks:\n\nQ4 2022 : $14.64 billion in net-equity sales\n\n: $14.64 billion in net-equity sales Q1 2023 : $10.41 billion\n\n: $10.41 billion Q2 2023 : $7.981 billion\n\n: $7.981 billion Q3 2023 : $5.253 billion\n\n: $5.253 billion Q4 2023 : $0.525 billion\n\n: $0.525 billion Q1 2024 : $17.281 billion\n\n: $17.281 billion Q2 2024 : $75.536 billion\n\n: $75.536 billion Q3 2024 : $34.592 billion\n\n: $34.592 billion Q4 2024: $6.713 billion\n\nAltogether, Berkshire's leader has overseen the sale of roughly $173 billion more in stocks than he's purchased since Oct. 1, 2022 -- and there's pretty clear reasoning behind this net-selling activity.\n\n\"Often, nothing looks compelling\"\n\nIn Warren Buffett's latest annual letter to shareholders, he offered one of the more direct (and chilling) assessments of how he views stocks on Wall Street. Put bluntly, the Oracle of Omaha noted, \"often, nothing looks compelling.\"\n\nOne of the very few traits Buffett is unwavering on is his value-investing roots. Even though value is a subjective term that varies from one investor to the next, Berkshire's CEO refuses to buy shares of a company -- even one deemed to be a wonderful business -- if he doesn't feel like he's getting a good deal. With the stock market being historically pricey, it's become increasingly harder to find a bargain.\n\nThe market-cap-to-GDP ratio, which has become known as the \"Buffett Indicator,\" has long been a favorite valuation measure of Buffett's. It's arrived at by dividing the cumulative market cap of all U.S. stocks by U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nWhen back-tested to 1970, the Buffett Indicator has averaged a reading of 85%. Put another way, the total value of publicly traded stocks equates to roughly 85% of U.S. GDP. In February 2025, the Buffett Indicator surpassed 207%, which is an all-time high.\n\nIt's a similar story with the S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) Ratio, which is occasionally referred to as the cyclically adjusted P/E Ratio (CAPE Ratio). The Shiller P/E is based on average inflation-adjusted earnings over the previous 10 years.\n\nWhen back-tested all the way to January 1871, the S&P 500's Shiller P/E has averaged a modest multiple of 17.22. But as of the closing bell on March 11, the Shiller P/E stood at 34.76. While this is below its peak of 38.89 during the current bull market cycle, it's still more than double its long-term average.\n\nThe five prior instances where the Shiller P/E topped 30 were all eventually followed by declines in the benchmark S&P 500 of at least 20%.\n\nIn other words, when the stock market becomes pricey, Warren Buffett has no qualms about paring down his investment portfolio and sitting on his proverbial hands until valuations become attractive.\n\nShort-term peril often leads to long-term promise on Wall Street\n\nWarren Buffett's persistent selling activity intimates that he's been expecting a sizable pullback in equities for some time. Based solely on historic precedent, there's the possibility investors could witness the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fall by around 40%.\n\nWhile elevator-like moves lower in Wall Street's major stock indexes tend to tug on investors' heartstrings, they're just the type of event Berkshire's CEO waits for to begin deploying his company's capital. Berkshire Hathaway closed out 2024 with a record $334.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\n\nHistory has shown that being patient and pouncing on price dislocations works exceptionally well for the Oracle of Omaha.\n\nOne of Warren Buffett's best all-time investments was purchasing $5 billion worth of Bank of America (BAC -0.60%) preferred stock in August 2011. While Bank of America wasn't exactly looking for a handout at the time, Buffett swooped in with cash to shore up its balance sheet following the Great Recession.\n\nThe real win was the BofA stock warrants that also came with the capital infusion. In mid-2017, Berkshire Hathaway exercised these warrants for just $7.14 per share and acquired 700 million shares of BofA common stock. At the time, it resulted in an instant $12 billion unrealized gain.\n\nWaiting for panic and peril to create price dislocations and bring wonderful businesses down to fair prices has frequently led to long-term promise for Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders. This time will be no different.",

            "content": "Our Nerds say: \"The best checking accounts are designed to be used for all of your regular purchases and transactions, so make sure to pick one that has all of the features that matter to you. \"If you need a flexible overdraft program, pick a bank that has low or no overdraft fees or a buffer or forgiveness program. If you plan to go with an online bank, make sure it has great remote customer service options and an accessible ATM network. And lastly, even though checking accounts aren\u2019t usually known for great interest rates, there are still plenty of accounts that offer a solid return on your money. You can also find rewards checking accounts that offer cash back on your spending.\" - Chanelle Bessette, NerdWallet banking writer\n\nRequirements to open a checking account\n\nBanks typically require some form of valid government-issued photo identification along with basic details about yourself, including your birthdate, Social Security number, and contact information. You may also need to make a minimum opening deposit depending on the bank.\n\nWhat to look for in a checking account\n\nWhen shopping for a checking account, consider factors such as monthly fees, interest rates, overdraft policies, ATM fees and access to customer service. Make sure that you\u2019re getting the features and services you want from your bank.\n\nSee the table lower down on the page to get an idea of what kinds of features the best checking accounts offer.\n\nThe pros of checking accounts\n\nEasy access to your money. Checking accounts are designed to be added to and withdrawn from frequently. Most banks come with mobile apps and desktop login options so that you can handle your banking without needing to go to a branch. As a bank customer, you will usually have access to an ATM network as well, either through your bank or through a partner network.\n\nDebit cards and checkwriting. Debit card and checkwriting both allow you to make transactions without needing to have cash on hand.\n\nSecurity and federal insurance. Apart from a bank\u2019s physical security, a chartered bank will also come with insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) to protect your money in case the bank goes out of business. Online banks, including those listed on this page, also offer FDIC insurance.\n\nConvenient services like bill pay and money transfers. Many banks allow you to set up bill pay services from your checking account, and you might also have access to a money transfer service like Zelle through your bank.\n\nThe cons of checking accounts\n\nLower interest rates than other accounts. Though some checking accounts offer strong interest rates, you\u2019ll generally find higher interest rates through savings accounts and certificates of deposit.\n\nSome accounts come with high fees. Some checking accounts come with monthly fees, minimum balance fees, and overdraft fees, so be sure to look at what a bank charges before you open an account.\n\nAccount features Standard checking accounts The best checking accounts Do checking accounts pay interest? Sometimes; typically minimal. Usually a solid rate, sometimes with a bonus or cash back instead. Common fees Monthly maintenance fee (with ways to waive it).\n\nOverdraft fee.\n\nOut-of-network ATM fee.\n\nForeign transaction fee. No monthly maintenance fees.\n\nFree ways to avoid overdrafts.\n\nBroad, free ATM network and/or ATM fee reimbursements.\n\nNo foreign transaction fees. Typical features Debit card.\n\nPaper checks.\n\nDirect deposit.\n\nOverdraft protection.\n\nOnline and mobile banking services (bill pay, balance inquiries, transfers, account alerts, mobile check deposit). Standard features plus additional features like two-day early direct deposit, online transfer services like Zelle, and spending round-up programs. Other benefits Bill pay.\n\nAccess to cash through ATMs. Standard benefits plus good online app and desktop design.\n\nWhat's the best checking account for me?\n\nWhen choosing a new checking account, take a close look at fees, branch and ATM accessibility, and interest rate. Also consider perks such as early access to direct deposits. People who do online banking should select an institution that offers a good website along with a mobile app that lets them deposit checks remotely.\n\nAs a rule, it\u2019s a good idea to avoid checking accounts that charge \u2014 and don\u2019t allow you to waive \u2014 fees. The rule remains true whether choosing a teen checking account, a college bank account or any checking account.\n\nWhat are some alternatives to checking accounts?\n\nChecking accounts are meant to be used for daily spending and ideally come with some interest or cash back, though you\u2019re more likely to get a higher interest rate with a cash management account, certificate of deposit or high-yield savings account. Here are some alternatives to checking accounts, both for daily spending and for higher interest rates.\n\nPrepaid debit cards. Prepaid debit cards are like regular debit cards, but instead of being linked to a checking account, you load it with cash in advance. This helps you avoid overdraft fees because you can only spend the amount that you\u2019ve loaded onto the card. It doesn\u2019t require any kind of credit check, so they\u2019re easy to get.\n\nSecond chance checking accounts. If you\u2019ve been reported to ChexSystems, a second chance checking account can help you rebuild your banking history.\n\nCash management accounts. Cash management accounts are offered by brokerages and give you a place to keep uninvested cash. Some act like checking accounts and come with a debit card for spending.\n\nSavings accounts. If you\u2019re after a higher interest rate on cash that you don\u2019t plan to use in the near future, a high-yield savings account can be a great place to park your money.\n\nCertificates of deposit. A high-yield CD can offer you a guaranteed rate of return on your money, but the trade-off is that you let it stay in the CD for the full term length. If you try to withdraw from a CD too early, you could become subject to a penalty.\n\nShould I have more than one checking account?\n\nUsually there won\u2019t be many downsides to keeping multiple checking accounts open as long as you can meet the requirements of those accounts to avoid fees.\n\nThe number of checking accounts you should have is based on your situation. If you\u2019re single, for example, you may be fine with just one checking account. If you\u2019re married, you may want to have a personal account and a joint account that you share with your spouse.",

            "content": "SEC Rules on Lobbying and Energy Finance Proposals\n\nMarch 13, 2025\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently made significant decisions that have once again reshaped the dynamic shareholder landscape.\n\nThe SEC allowed five companies to reject lobbying proposals from their agenda. In addition, the SEC have also approved energy finance proposals which have been proposed by the Comptroller of the City of New York, Brad Lander.\n\nGoldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, ExxonMobil, United Airlines Holdings, and McDonald\u2019s were permitted to exclude shareholder proposals related to lobbying activities from their agendas.\n\nThe proposals requested that each company disclose annually a report which provides shareholders with transparency on lobbying payments, information on the company\u2019s policies and procedures governing direct and indirect lobbying activities, together with a description of management\u2019s and the board\u2019s decision-making process.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s issuance of Staff Legal Bulletin No. 14M (SLB 14M) on 12 February 2025 helped aid the decision to leave these shareholder proposals off the company agenda. The new guidance offers companies more flexibility in excluding specific proposals, particularly those related to environmental and social issues.\n\nThis development differs from previous SEC stances in which similar no-action requests were often declined. This could also be a potential cause for concern among shareholders as the decisions indicate that proposals that previously made it onto agendas may be excluded under the new guidance.\n\nThe other recent significant decision was the SEC\u2019s approval of energy finance proposals which the NYC Comptroller proposed. The proposals ask major banks, such as Well Fargo and Bank of America, to disclose their energy supply ratios (ESR) annually.\n\nThese disclosures provide transparency on the proportion of a bank\u2019s financing that supports low-carbon and zero-carbon energy initiatives against their financing of high-carbon and fossil fuel energy products and thus they shed light on whether these banks are committed to transitioning to a sustainable economy.\n\nBoth points further signify the complex landscape of shareholder engagement. The SEC\u2019s guidance appears to favour corporate interests over shareholder activism and this shift is unsurprising given the re-election of the Trump administration.\n\nSince Trump\u2019s return to the helm of US politics, the Republican party have been keen to prioritise reducing regulatory burdens on businesses. On the other hand, the approval of the energy finance proposals has indicated a push for transparency in sustainable finance, which benefits shareholders.\n\nAs the shareholder engagement environment continues to evolve, these decisions will no doubt continue to have an impact on future AGMs and corporate disclosure requirements.\n\nAutor: Daniel Kehoe\n\nYou can read more of our articles by clicking here.\n\nRelated\n\nLast Updated: 14 March 2025",

The company\u2019s volatile nature of the trading business is a major headwind. Despite an impressive performance since 2022, it is expected to normalize going forward. This is likely to hamper fee income growth.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks analyst project non-interest income to rise only 3.4% in 2025. Continued investments in the franchise will keep the company\u2019s expenses elevated. We expect total non-interest expenses to rise 3% this year.\n\n\n\nWhile high funding costs are still a woe, the company\u2019s net interest income (NII) will be positively impacted by higher rates for longer. We expect NII to record a CAGR of 5.3% over the next three years. Plans to open financial centers in new and existing markets and improve digital capabilities will aid the top line. We project total revenues to grow 4.8% in 2025.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Bank of America here >>>)\n\n\n\nAccenture\u2019s have underperformed the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry over the past year (-12% vs. -6.7%). The company is facing rising competition that has led to increased talent costs and pricing pressures. Rapid acquisitions have made the company prone to integration risks. The stock has declined 13.4% in a year and we have a Neutral recommendation for it in anticipation of a better entry.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Accenture\u2019s growth strategy focuses on delivering 360-degree value to stakeholders, making the stock attractive. This consulting services provider thrives on the robust demand for application modernization and maintenance, cloud enhancements, and cybersecurity.\n\n\n\nOver the years, Accenture has leveraged buyouts to strengthen digital technology and capital project capabilities. Its cash position allows the company to explore different markets. Dividend-seeking investors will find this stock appealing. Also, its liquidity position is a tailwind.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Accenture here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of ServiceNow have outperformed the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry over the past year (+4.1% vs. -6.7%). The company has been benefiting from the rising adoption of its workflows by enterprises undergoing digital transformation. It had 2,109 total customers with more than $1 million in annual contract value (ACV) at the end of the fourth quarter, which represents 14% year-over-year growth in customers.\n\n\n\nServiceNow had 19 deals greater than $5 million in net new ACV.

Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) deals continued to gain traction.\n\n\n\nServiceNow is extensively leveraging AI and machine learning technologies to boost the potency of its solutions.

This microcap company with market capitalization of $287.15 million has seen comparable store sales decline 7.8% in 2024, resulting in a 78.2% fall in operating income. SG&A remains high, and inventory write-offs persist. Persistent macroeconomic pressures, including high interest rates and weak home sales, continue to suppress demand.\n\n\n\nRising costs and inventory challenges pose additional risks, while the lack of store expansion limits future revenue growth. Nevertheless, Tile Shop's gross margin grew 130 bps to 65.7% in 2024, aided by lower freight costs and supplier negotiations.\n\n\n\nIt maintains a strong balance sheet with no debt and $20.9 million in cash, up from $8.6 million in 2023, supported by $27.1 million in operating cash flow. Growth initiatives include the relaunch of its high-margin Superior installation line (whose sales volumes improved in fourth-quarter 2024) and an expanded entry-level product assortment.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Tile Shop here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Moving iMage Technologies have underperformed the Zacks Technology Services industry over the past year (-11.6% vs. +40.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $5.08 million has seen revenues decline 12.2% YoY to $8.7 million in the first half of fiscal 2025. Its reliance on one-time high-margin orders creates earnings volatility, while slow adoption of industry upgrades delays revenue recognition. Customer and supplier concentration risks persist.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, MiT is expanding its product portfolio with high-margin offerings like LEA Professional amplifiers, CineQC, and MiTranslator, enhancing its market reach beyond traditional cinema. Favorable industry trends, including rising investments in premium cinematic experiences and technology upgrades, position MiT for growth.\n\n\n\nGross margins improved to 26.5% in the first half of fiscal 2025. Liquidity remains strong with $5.3 million in cash and no long-term debt, supporting expansion.

In reality, there are only four places to cut US spending that will make any difference: the military, medicare, medicaid and social security.\n\nThose are electorally sacred and leave them with a tougher choice: Roll back tax cuts or run a huge deficit.\n\nThe WSJ today reports that all the tax cuts are still on the table and that the price tag is enormous. There appears to be some kind of effort at creative accounting and I suspect that's the direction they will go in.\n\nIf not, Bank of America highlights how dependent the US has been on growing jobs via deficits near 7% of GDP:\n\nIn 2024, the US had never been more government-dependent: for 85% of job growth, 33% of all spending, 6-7% budget deficits; all record highs ex-crisis. In 2025, the world is moving to revive the private sector, e.g. Japanese corp. reforms, Chinese pro-market signals, German defense spending, & Argentine fiscal cuts. The US \"detox\" of efficiency, deregulation, and trade may mean more market pain before visible GDP gains.\n\nThis isn't going to be easy and I don't think it will be pretty. Again, I think the path of least resistance (as usual) is running up the deficit but the Republican majority is slim and there may be some true deficit hawks out there.",

According to Mohan, AAPL\u2019s focus on premium products has led to strong gross margins and diversified offerings like iCloud, Apple Music, and the App Store have expanded services revenue.\n\nAlso, a vast and loyal customer base has resulted in less volatility in its product cycles, ensuring a steady stream of revenue.\n\nThese factors make the company a resilient player in the tech sector.\n\nMohan Says IBM\u2019s Strategies Offer Stability\n\nFor IBM, Mohan believes the spin-off of IT infrastructure services provider Kyndryl (KD), which closed in 2021, has stabilized IBM\u2019s growth trajectory. The move allows IBM to focus on higher-margin areas like cloud computing and AI.\n\nFurther, IBM\u2019s diversified portfolio, coupled with the upcoming launch of a new mainframe, boost the company\u2019s ability to maintain steady performance despite market volatility.\n\nWhich is better, Apple or IBM?\n\nAccording to the TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool, both AAPL and IBM stocks have a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Importantly, analysts see an upside potential of over 15% in Apple stock and 4.2% in IBM stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

            "content": "Buffett bought more than $166 billion of this investment in 2024.\n\nIn his February letter to shareholders, Warren Buffett announced a new record Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.59%) (BRK.B 1.79%) set in 2024: It paid more in taxes than any company ever paid the U.S. government in a single year. And that's despite significantly lower tax rates in recent years than throughout the history of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nOf course, paying a big tax bill means you earned a lot of money for your investors. For Berkshire Hathaway, though, much of those earnings came in the form of capital gains on the sale of publicly traded equities. In total, Buffett and his fellow portfolio managers sold $143 billion worth of stock from Berkshire's portfolio. That resulted in $101.1 billion in taxable gains, dwarfing any amount the company realized in the past as well as its normal operating income.\n\nThe fourth quarter saw Buffett sell off significant chunks of his stakes in financial stocks including Bank of America and Citigroup. At the same time, he's piled any cash leftover after Berkshire's massive tax bill into one high-yield investment.\n\nHere's what investors need to know.\n\nFinancial stocks are on the chopping block at Berkshire\n\nOver the course of 2024, Buffett sold at least a few shares of roughly half the stocks and ETFs Berkshire held at the start of the year. Apple saw the biggest cut in the portfolio, but Berkshire's stake in the tech stock still remains its largest overall position. After culling over two-thirds of its holdings, Berkshire seems happy to hold on to its remaining 300 million shares. He didn't sell any more Apple stock in the fourth quarter.\n\nInstead, he turned his attention to Berkshire's financial stocks. Bank of America and Citigroup saw, by far, the largest cuts. But Berkshire also trim its stake in Capital One Financial and Brazilian fintech stock Nu Holdings.\n\nBerkshire originally acquired Bank of America stock through warrants it received when it acquired $5 billion worth of preferred stock in 2011. Buffett exercised those warrants in 2017 to buy 700 million shares, when Bank of America increased its dividend such that owning the common stock paid more than holding the preferred shares. Berskshire Hathaway added to the position through 2020, but as of the end of 2024, it now holds less than the 700 million shares originally purchased in 2017.\n\nSome have speculated that Berkshire continued selling Bank of America at the start of 2025. The company's name was noticeably absent in a short list of \"profitable businesses with household names\" Buffett laid out in his letter to shareholders.\n\nBerkshire's position in Citigroup is relatively new, acquiring it in early 2022. The financial stock languished in 2022 and 2023 as it faced consent orders from regulators, started a major restructuring effort, and faced a challenging economic environment at the same time. Buffett and hist team may have been unimpressed by the progress in Citi's turnaround and decided to start cutting it.\n\nBuffett has suggested 2024 and 2025 are a great time to start selling some of Berkshire's biggest holdings. Not only are many of the biggest companies in the market expensive in terms of valuation, but Berkshire can also keep more of the earnings because of historically low tax rates. Berkshire's $101 billion in gains incurred only a 21% tax in 2024. Before 2017, those gains would've incurred 35% taxes. That's an extra $14 billion lining Berkshire's coffers.\n\nBuffett may continue to sell in 2025 as valuations remain high and Congress has yet to extend the current tax cuts beyond the end of the year. As of the end of 2024, Berkshire's portfolio was valued at $271.6 billion with unrealized capital gains of $196 billion. If he continues to sell, he clearly has a favorite place to put that cash right now.\n\nThe massive investment Buffett can't stop buying\n\nWhile Berkshire sold about $143 billion worth of equities in 2024, its total stock purchases amounted to just $9.2 billion for the year. Buffett and his team haven't bought much else that shows up outside of Berkshire's portfolio of public equities, either. The CEO stopped repurchasing Berkshire shares in May, and it invested limited amounts of money in nonmarketable equities, such as stakes in Pilot Travel Centers and Berkshire Hathaway Energy.\n\nWithout any good equity investments to buy, Buffett has a big pile of cash on his hands.\n\nThe best thing he can do with that cash right now, in his opinion, is to buy short-term U.S. Treasury bills. Buffett favors short-term government bonds as a place to keep excess capital. Every quarter he writes to shareholders, \"We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments.\"\n\nBuffett was burned by long-term bonds in the 1970s and has favored short-term bonds ever since. Short-term bonds typically have lower yields, but they ensure capital preservation, since they're not as susceptible to interest rate risk of the kind we saw in the 1970s, as well as in recent years.\n\nBuffett increased Berkshire's Treasury bill holdings by over $166 billion in 2024. Despite his insistence on short-term bills, Buffett is currently receiving a substantial yield on those Treasury bills. T-bills maturing within six months currently offer yields on par with 10-year Treasury notes -- around 4.3%, as of this writing. As a result, Berkshire is getting paid handsomely while Buffett waits for an appealing equity investment.\n\nBut Buffett has said that he would be happy to hold Treasuries even if they didn't offer such attractive yields. Speaking at last year's shareholder meeting, he said, \"I don't think anyone up here has any idea how to use [the cash] effectively, and therefore we don't use it.\"\n\nBuffett and the team at Berkshire Hathaway face a unique challenge: With over $334 billion of investable capital, only a handful of stocks remain viable candidates to move the needle for Berkshire's portfolio. Buffett's preference over the past year, and last quarter especially, leaned toward smaller companies. But even investing a few billion dollars in those stocks, buying substantial stakes of all of them, can hardly offset sales of the giant companies Buffett has decided aren't worth holding at today's prices.\n\nAs such, Buffett piled money into Treasury bills and will probably continue to do so in 2025 until megacap stocks, in which Buffett can really make moves, start presenting good value to shareholders again.",

While a recession is not in the firm's base forecast, analyst Ebrahim Poonawala said conditions could look similar to 2000 and 2001 if one does come. He noted that re-rating stock multiples to levels seen during the Covid-19 pandemic would suggest that the average bank stock covered by Bank of America would see a 48% drop in a recessionary scenario. Poonawala pointed to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's comments that the economy was in a \"detox period\" and could \"roll a bit\" as President Donald Trump's administration slashes government spending. This idea, Poonawala said, \"opens the door to a worsening macro\" and could signal downside risk to Bank of America's earnings forecasts for financial institutions. \"This is a significant change that we are still assessing vs a higher probability for positive EPS revisions we expected until a few weeks ago,\" Poonawala told clients. That adds to a growing body of evidence pointing to cooling within the economy. Recent economic releases have pointed to slowing growth in the labor market, soaring layoff figures and rising concerns tied to tariff policies. President Trump himself has said to expect an economic transition period in a Fox News interview. Economic fears weighed on bank stocks in Monday's session. Both the SPDR S & P Bank ETF (KBE) and SPDR S & P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) slid almost 4% in the session.

Using the 2000-01 recession as a guide, he said to expect declines in commercial and industrial banking, as well as on credit cards, to drive this potential downturn. Poonawala said a recession is not in the firm's most-likely scenario and has not been discounted within these stocks. If this transition period instead gives way to an era of stronger economic growth, he would recommend boosting exposure to best-in-class banking franchises, Poonawala said. Within large caps, he pointed to JPMorgan , Wells Fargo , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , among others, as examples.

As of January, Bank of America was providing financial services for 69 million US consumers and small businesses.\n\nIn a statement to potential victims, the bank noted that customers could contact their state Attorney General for more information about avoiding identity theft - a list that included Massachusetts, New York, Washington DC, and Oregon.\n\nAt least 2 Bank of America customers have already been affected by the data breach, after their documents were left outside a financial center on December 30, 2024\n\nThe banking giant handles $4.2 trillion in client balances across their entire wealth management operations.\n\nThis isn't the only data blunder in recent months for Bank of America - part of the 'big four' US banks along with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citibank.\n\nIn January, Bank of America revealed that a third-party software company allowed someone to gain access to the private information of at least 414 banking customers.\n\nThat hack took place in October 2024 and reportedly affected mortgage loan customers in Maine, exposing their social security numbers, addresses, phone numbers, passport numbers, and loan numbers.\n\nFollowing the latest breach, Bank of America sent a letter to each of the customers they believe were exposed by the data destruction vendor, promising to minimize the financial impact to their accounts.\n\n'The vendor cannot confirm if your documents were directly involved or affected,' the letter reads.\n\n'They may have been, and as a result, we are reaching out to notify you in an abundance of caution and support.'\n\nBank of America stated it is monitoring accounts and will notify clients if it notices suspicious activity.\n\nBank of America warned that anyone contacted about this breach may have had their name, account numbers, addresses, contact information, date of birth, social security number, and other government IDs exposed to thieves\n\nThe bank offered two years of free identity theft protection services, provided by Experian - one of the three major credit bureaus that compile credit reports.\n\nAlong with free identity theft services, Bank of America advised anyone receiving a letter about this breach to take several steps to safeguard their own security.\n\nThose tips included checking for signs of fraud on banking statements and credit reports for the next two years, updating your contact information with the bank so they can alert you of any suspicious activity, and updating all account passwords to be at least eight characters long.\n\nBank of America officials added that choosing to use multifactor authentication (MFA) can also enhance your safety. This security method sends you a private code to your personal devices or accounts (like your smartphone or email) which you need to enter before logging into your online bank accounts.\n\nBank of America hasn't been the only member of the 'big four' banks to get sloppy with customer data, although most of the incidents have taken place online.\n\nIn June 2024, Citigroup announced that an unspecified number of customers had their credit card data hacked. The bank had already received a $136 million fine from US regulators in 2020 for failing to fix data management issues.\n\nIn February 2024, JPMorgan Chase revealed that they were hit by a data breach that exposed the personal financial information of over 450,000 customers' retirement plans.\n\nThe breached reportedly stemmed from a software flaw that allowed cyber thieves access to the data. Chase customers using direct deposit were particularly affected as their bank routing and account numbers were exposed in the incident.\n\nIn 2016, Wells Fargo employees, under pressure to meet aggressive sales targets, opened millions of unauthorized bank and credit card accounts without customers' consent.\n\nThe bank was order to pay $3 billion in fines as a result of the Department of Justice's investigation into the misuse of customer records.",

After running his own soccer-related projects, in 2022 he joined Diario AS, where he mainly reports on the biggest news from around Europe\u2019s leading soccer clubs, Liga MX and MLS, and covers live games in a not-too-serious tone. Likes to mix things up by dipping into the world of American sports.\n\nFounded in 2016 by seven of the United States\u2019 largest banks, including Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, Zelle has become one of the most popular banking apps in the U.S. thanks to its simplicity, with money able to be transferred almost instantaneously by entering only a contact\u2019s mobile phone number or email address.\n\nMillions of users therefore were therefore hugely concerned by the news that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) had filed a lawsuit against Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo last December because of Zelle. The suit, however, has now been dropped in somewhat mysterious circumstances.\n\nWe love an easy payment \ud83e\udd11 pic.twitter.com/sWs9EiMtat \u2014 Zelle (@Zelle) March 6, 2025\n\nThe reason Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo were sued\n\nThe CFPB had accused the banks of failing to protect their customers from widespread fraud on the Zelle electronic payment system. The claim was that Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo customers had lost over $870 million since Zelle\u2019s launch in 2017, had not been provided with any assistance and, in some cases, had even been told to \u201ccontact the scammers directly to recover their money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nation\u2019s largest banks felt threatened by competing payment apps, so they rushed to launch Zelle. By not implementing proper safeguards, Zelle became a goldmine for scammers, often leaving victims to fend for themselves,\u201d claimed CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, who was recently fired by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nCFPB drop Zelle lawsuit after Trump changes\n\nThe banks denied the allegations, calling them \u201clegally and factually flawed,\u201d and the CFPB dropped the suit at the beginning of March, without offering an explanation. Several other suits which were filed by the bureau under Chopra, including ones against Capital One, Rocket Homes and Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance, have also been withdrawn.\n\nUnder new acting director Russell Vought, the CFPB has closed offices and attempted to fire hundreds of employees, a move that was blocked by a federal judge.\n\nSince Trump\u2019s return to the Oval Office in January, federal agencies have pulled back significantly on enforcement actions taken by the previous administration.\n\nHow safe is it to send money with Zelle?\n\nIn general, Zelle is considered a secure way to send money because transactions don\u2019t require you to share confidential financial information. Even so, it\u2019s a good idea to enable authentication and monitoring features to help ensure all payments are properly authorized.\n\nThat said, Zelle is best used for sending money to people you know and trust.\n\nThe news that the lawsuit has been dropped without any explanation, however, has led to huge amounts of criticism, with skeptics claiming the Trump administration is turning a blind eye to fraud.\n\nRelated stories\n\nGet your game on!

The company announced the redemption of significant debt components and completed a substantial share repurchase program, with the recent buyback totaling $3,535 million, possibly influencing investor perception. Despite a challenging broader market environment, marked by a 3.4% weekly decline of major indexes like the S&P 500 due to economic uncertainties, Bank of America declared consistent dividend payouts and reported improved annual net income. The financial sector has felt pressure from general economic concerns, including Federal Reserve comments about inflation and interest rates. Such challenges may have impacted investor sentiment towards the stock, reflecting in its recent price movement. Overall, while Bank of America's strategic moves highlighted commitment to shareholder value, broader market dynamics seemed to play a significant role in its share price performance.\n\nNYSE:BAC Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\n```html\n\nOver the last five years, Bank of America (BAC) achieved a total return of 94.03%, a substantial performance for its shareholders. Contributing to this were key corporate actions, such as the completion of significant share repurchases totaling $6.17 billion since July 2024. The bank also maintained a reliable dividend payout, enhancing shareholder returns through cash contributions. In earnings growth, Bank of America's 2.9% annual increase over the five-year period reflects steady development, despite recent challenges in the banking sector.\n\nThe completion of a $9 billion acquisition of residential mortgage loans from The Toronto-Dominion Bank in February 2025 is part of BAC's expansion efforts, potentially increasing future revenues. The company's recent launch of an upgraded digital platform demonstrates its focus on enhancing customer experience, which can drive user engagement. Furthermore, ongoing dialogues around potential mergers and acquisitions indicate a proactive growth strategy to capture more market opportunities.\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

            "content": "The U.S. economic growth and inflation data are contradictory, the risk of stagflation adds uncertainty to the Federal Reserve's policy outlook.\n\nAccording to the latest report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the U.S. economy is at a delicate balance point: on one hand, it faces weak consumer spending, declining business confidence, and the impact of tariff policies; on the other hand, there are rising concerns about inflationary pressures.\n\nThis stagflation risk is reshaping market expectations for the Federal Reserve's policy path\u2014not lowering interest rates may still be the most likely outcome, but the risk of significant rate cuts has increased.\n\nBank of America economist Aditya Bhave stated:\n\nThis stagflation pressure means that the Federal Reserve's policy outlook is polarized: if rates are not cut, they will remain relatively high; if a rate cut is decided, it may be significantly reduced below neutral levels.\n\nMixed data raises market concerns of overreaction\n\nIn the past two weeks, the market has been unsettled by a series of disturbing news.\n\nIn February, several soft indicators reflecting market sentiment deteriorated.\n\nThe University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index and the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index both fell short of expectations.\n\nAlthough the manufacturing ISM index barely held above 50, the new orders and employment sub-indices saw a significant decline.\n\nThe preliminary value of the S&P Services PMI even dropped below the 50 threshold.\n\nHowever, Bank of America Merrill Lynch believes that the market's concerns about these soft data may be somewhat excessive. First, there is a disconnect between market sentiment and actual economic activity. In 2023-24, despite low consumer confidence and the manufacturing ISM index being in a contraction range for almost the entire time, the U.S. economy still achieved nearly 3% growth.\n\nSecondly, not all soft data is performing poorly, especially in the services sector, which accounts for about 46% of GDP and 84% of employment. The ISM Services Index exceeded expectations, and the final value of the S&P Services PMI also returned above 50.\n\nIn addition to the weakening of soft data, the \"cliff-like\" drop in the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model for U.S. GDP growth in the first quarter has also triggered market panic.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch pointed out that the significant drop in the GDPNow model is mainly due to its \"incorrect\" handling of import data and an overly pessimistic interpretation of the details of the manufacturing ISM index. In fact, the ISM index should not affect GDP data at all. Considering the weak consumer spending in January, Bank of America Merrill Lynch currently tracks the U.S. first-quarter GDP growth rate at 1.9%, while the GDPNow forecast is -2.4%\n\nOf course, some hard data has also shown signs of softening at the beginning of the year, including consumer spending and construction activity. Some of the weakness may be attributed to weather factors. However, considering that uncertainty shocks may be intensifying, Bank of America Merrill Lynch is closely monitoring changes in \"soft and hard\" data.\n\nEven if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, it won't be a small cut\n\nEven though the market's reaction to soft data and the GDPNow model may be somewhat excessive, Bank of America Merrill Lynch believes that the downside risk to U.S. economic growth has clearly increased. At the same time, the upside risk of inflation is also rising. This puts the Federal Reserve in a dilemma, as it needs to balance between the two major goals of \"full employment\" and \"price stability.\"\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch's baseline forecast is that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates unchanged. However, market expectations for the magnitude of the Federal Reserve's rate cuts have risen from about 25 basis points after the January CPI data was released to the current approximately 70 basis points.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch believes that the most likely trigger for a Federal Reserve rate cut is a rapid rise in the unemployment rate.\n\nIf the unemployment rate rises to 4.3% in April, the Federal Reserve may cut rates in May. If the unemployment rate further rises to above 4.5%, even if the increase is gradual, it may trigger a rate cut. Of course, these scenarios assume that overall and core PCE inflation remains below 3%. If inflation exceeds 3%, the Federal Reserve will face a more difficult choice.\n\nIn addition to this factor, Bank of America Merrill Lynch believes that if the three-month moving average of non-farm payroll additions quickly falls below 100,000, or if there is a risk of an economic recession in the U.S., the Federal Reserve will cut rates.\n\nIf the labor market collapses under inflationary pressure, the Federal Reserve may not just cut rates to neutral levels.",

            "content": "Electricity providers, especially utility-scale companies that can provide large amounts of power on long-term contracts, have been beneficiaries of the recent boom in AI. The new tech requires power-hungry data centers to function, and power companies like Vistra are strongly positioned to meet that demand. However, these same power companies have faced uncertainty regarding the regulations around special electricity deals \u2013 exactly the kind of deals that data center firms want to sign.\n\nVistra has been working to expand its power portfolio, especially in the non-fossil fuel areas. In March of last year, the company acquired important nuclear power assets, totaling 4 gigawatts, from Energy Harbor, and expanded its customer base by 1 million. More recently, this past December, the company connected two new utility-scale solar projects to the grid. Both of these new solar projects are located in Illinois.\n\nThe first stock we\u2019ll look at, Vistra Energy, is a utility-scale power company based out of Texas. Vistra is the US market\u2019s largest competitive power generation company, with some 5 million customers and more than 41,000 megawatts of electric power generating capacity currently online. The company employs 6,800 people, 14 of its facilities have OSHA VPP star ratings, and it boasts a market cap of $43 billion. Vistra\u2019s power facilities are based on a variety of technologies, including natural gas, coal, nuclear, and solar. The company also has a stated commitment to the development of zero-carbon electricity, of which its nuclear power systems \u2013 the nation\u2019s second largest such network \u2013 are a vital part.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Bank of America analysts have picked out names that feature currently depressed prices along with sound upside potential for the coming year. We\u2019ve opened up the TipRanks database to look at the broader Wall Street take on two of these BofA picks; here are the details.\n\nSome shares slip for any number of reasons, yet Wall Street\u2019s analysts still see them as Strong Buys. In other words, they\u2019re temporarily undervalued, offering investors the chance to load up at a discount.\n\nThat mindset is especially useful when hunting for bargains \u2013 stocks that have taken a hit but aren\u2019t out for the count.\n\nMarket swings come and go, but at the end of the day, individual stocks rise and fall based on their own fundamentals. Savvy investors know that tuning out the noise of macro trends allows them to zero in on the promising opportunities.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThat uncertainty has created a headwind for the power companies \u2013 and in recent weeks, they have felt pressure on their stocks. Additionally, anxiety about the strength of the AI trend has also impacted electricity producers\u2019 stocks since they supply power to data centers. The result: Vistra\u2019s shares are down 40% from the peak they reached in January.\n\nThe stock\u2019s retreat has coincided with Vistra actually reporting sound financial results. The company released its full-year 2024 results last month, and showed a top line of $17.22 billion, up 16.5% year-over-year and some $70 million better than had been expected. The company realized a net income from ongoing operations of $2.93 billion, up from $1.50 billion in the prior year. For Q4, the net income from ongoing operations came to $542 million, up from the $155 million loss reported in 4Q23.\n\nRoss Fowler covers this stock for Bank of America, and he is upbeat about Vistra\u2019s prospects this year. Explaining his stance, Fowler writes, \u201cVistra has a competitive residential retail business in Texas and is the largest power generation company in the US. We believe the valuation of Vistra\u2019s base business offers significant upside after the stock\u2019s decline. Along with this, datacenter co-location clarity is likely in the coming months and this could be the catalyst to secure higher revenues.\u201d\n\nFowler goes on to put a Buy rating on VST shares, with a price target of $152 that suggests a 33% upside potential for the next 12 months. (To watch Fowler\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThe Strong Buy consensus rating on Vistra\u2019s stock is based on 8 recent reviews that include 7 Buys to 1 Hold. The shares are priced at $114.41, and their $176.29 average price target is even more bullish than the BofA view, implying a one-year gain of 54%. (See VST stock forecast)\n\nCredo Technology Group (CRDO)\n\nNext up on our look at Bank of America\u2019s picks is Credo Technology Group, a tech company deeply involved in networking and connectivity. The company has defined itself as a provider of high-speed bandwidth solutions for wired connections in data infrastructure. Its products include various vital components of wired network systems, such as high-end line cards, optical DSP chips, and active electrical cables. The company is also known for its semiconductor chip designs and is a leader in serializer-deserializer (SerDes) technology.\n\nCredo was founded in 2008 and has grown to become a $7.8 billion player in the tech world. The company has benefited in recent years from several high-profile trends in tech. The expansions of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, IoT, streaming video, and 5G wireless have all put a premium on data infrastructure \u2013 which is exactly the tech that Credo develops.\n\nWe should note here that Credo saw strong gains in share price heading into this year, but that year to date the stock is down by 37%. The fall comes on a combination of worries that CRDO is overvalued and that the company, despite its strong reputation, faces competition from industry giants such as Broadcom and Marvell.\n\nInvestors can take heart, however, from Credo\u2019s financial performance. In the company\u2019s last financial report, which covered fiscal 3Q25, Credo delivered top- and bottom-line beats along with solid guidance for fiscal Q4 revenue. In fiscal 3Q25, the company saw revenue of $135 million, up an impressive 154% year-over-year and $14.64 million better than the forecast. The quarterly earnings came in at 25 cents per share by non-GAAP measures, 7 cents better than the estimates.\n\nLooking ahead to fiscal 4Q25, Credo expects revenues to keep climbing, into the range of $155 million to $165 million. The company has had solid successes with hyperscale customers, and 86% of the Q3 revenue came from Amazon Web Services. Credo expects to expand on its hyperscale successes going forward.\n\nThis caught the attention of Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya, an analyst who ranks in the top 4% of Wall Street stock pros. He says of Credo, \u201cWe continue to see a strong AEC ramp into FY26, with multiple hyperscale customers (two new customers in discussion on top of existing AWS, Microsoft, xAI) on track to adopt AECs for intra-rack and over time for <7m rack-to-rack solutions. While we highlight growing competition in the AEC market (MRVL/AVGO), CRDO is diversifying its product portfolio into adjacent optical DSPs, line cards, and PCIe-based retimers/AECs which are expected to ramp starting F2H26/CY26. Despite a growing product mix, we also note CRDO could sustain the current 63-65% GMs as scale increases and AWS contra-revenue dilution impact subsides.\u201d\n\nThe 5-star analyst rates this stock as a Buy, and he complements that with a $75 price target, pointing toward a 78% upside potential in the next 12 months. (To watch Arya\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThere are 10 recent analyst reviews here, including 9 Buys and 1 Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Credo\u2019s shares are selling for $42.07, and their bullish $80.40 average target price implies an upside potential of 91% waiting in store for the coming year.

            "content": "Bank of America ( (BAC) ) has fallen by -8.55%. Read on to learn why.\n\nBank of America experienced a notable decline in its stock price over the past week, dropping by 8.55%. This movement comes amidst mixed analyst actions and market reactions. Erste Group analyst Hans Engel downgraded the stock from Buy to Hold, contributing to the negative sentiment around the stock. Such downgrades often signal caution to investors, potentially leading to sell-offs and impacting the stock\u2019s performance.\n\nOn the flip side, Baird upgraded Bank of America to Outperform from Neutral, raising its price target from $45 to $50. Baird\u2019s analysis suggests that the recent weakness in the bank\u2019s shares presents a buying opportunity, as the risk/reward profile has improved. Despite the current volatility, Baird views Bank of America as a strong franchise available at a reasonable price, indicating potential for future gains.\n\nAdditionally, the dismissal of a lawsuit by the CFPB against Bank of America and other financial institutions could have influenced investor sentiment. This legal development might alleviate some concerns regarding regulatory risks, although it was not enough to counteract the overall downward pressure on the stock. As the market continues to digest these mixed signals, investors remain cautious about the bank\u2019s near-term prospects.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

Bank of America offers strong credit cards for cash-back, such as the Bank of America \u00ae Premium Rewards \u00ae Credit Card.\n\nPremium Rewards Credit Card. Consider switching to Chase if you are looking for reward travel, but if you have large deposits with Bank of America and prefer cash-back, Bank of America has the advantage.\n\nComparing what the largest banks in the U.S. offer in the way of credit cards is always fascinating. Although JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are the 2 largest banks in the U.S. by total assets, the 2 institutions couldn\u2019t have a more opposite approach to credit card portfolios.\n\nIn general, Bank of America focuses on cash-back rewards, while Chase is focused on those interested in travel rewards.\n\nSure, Bank of America and Chase both offer products that intertwine themselves with different credit card strategies, but their messaging of flagship credit cards is pretty clear in general.\n\nLet\u2019s compare what credit cards these 2 juggernauts offer in a head-to-head comparison!\n\nComparing Chase Ultimate Rewards and Bank of America Preferred Rewards\n\nSingapore Airways Airbus A380 First Class Suites. Image Credit: Greg Stone\n\nChase\u2019s flagship rewards system is called Ultimate Rewards. Even though Chase works with airlines and hotels, including United and IHG, to issue co-branded credit cards, Ultimate Rewards is unique because it isn\u2019t tied to a single airline or hotel.\n\nFor this reason, Chase Ultimate Rewards points are incredibly valuable and easy to use. Best of all, Chase issues a series of different credit cards that earn Ultimate Rewards points (or cards with rewards easily converted into Ultimate Rewards points).\n\nBank of America\u2019s flagship rewards program is called Preferred Rewards (its business rewards program is called Preferred Rewards for Business).\n\nBroadly speaking, Bank of America points can\u2019t be transferred to travel partners, which is already a huge setback for Bank of America if you\u2019re looking to maximize value.\n\nRight now, Chase Ultimate Rewards points can be used for:\n\nTransfers to travel partners, including airlines and hotels\n\nBookings made through the Chase Travel portal\n\nPay Yourself Back\n\nGift cards\n\nCash-back/statement credits\n\nOnline shopping, including Apple and Amazon.com\n\nThe redemption options above are sorted from highest to lowest value. The best value, without a doubt, is to transfer Ultimate Rewards points to travel partners for luxury award travel where you can get up to 10 cents per point of value!\n\nRight now, Chase has a fantastic list of transfer partners:\n\nAirline Transfer Partners\n\nChase Transfer Partners\n\nSCROLL FOR MORE Chase Hotel Partner Miniumum Transfer Transfer Ratio\n\n(Chase > Hotel) Transfer Time IHG One Rewards 1,000 1:1 1 day Marriott Bonvoy 1,000 1:1 2 days World of Hyatt 1,000 1:1 Almost Instant\n\nIn particular, you can transfer Chase points to frequent flyer programs including Air Canada Aeroplan, British Airways Executive Club, United MileagePlus, Emirates Skywards, and Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer at a 1:1 ratio to book amazing flights like Emirates first class, Etihad first class, Qatar Airways Qsuites, Singapore Airlines First Class Suites, and so much more.\n\nEven more impressive, you can transfer Chase points to World of Hyatt at a 1:1 ratio to book some amazing luxury hotel stays.\n\nThat\u2019s why we value Chase Ultimate Rewards points at 2 cents each.\n\nChase travel portal reservations and Pay Yourself Back redemptions will get a maximum of 1.5 cents per point in value, while gift cards net up to 1.2 cents per point, cash-back gets 1 cent per point, and online shopping will almost always get you less than 1 cent per point of value.\n\nOn the flip-side, Bank of America points are worth a flat 1 cent per point.\n\nHowever, you can earn a bonus of up to 75% extra rewards if you hold minimum deposits and/or assets in your qualifying Bank of America and/or Merrill accounts. Your points will still be worth a flat 1 cent per point, but you\u2019ll get more rewards per dollar spent with the Preferred Rewards program.\n\nCurrently, you can use your points for gift cards, Bank of America Travel Center bookings, statement credits, or direct deposits into Bank of America and eligible Merrill investment accounts only.\n\nBest Overall Travel Rewards Card\n\nImage Credit: Holly Mandarich via Unsplash\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a great starter rewards credit card to dip your toes into travel rewards, we\u2019ll show you our favorite picks in this section.\n\nWinner: Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card\n\nBEST BEGINNER CARD Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card U.P.

            "content": "The Trump organization just filed a lawsuit against US banking giant Capital One, accusing the lender of unjustly terminating more than 300 of the firm\u2019s bank accounts.\n\nThe suit claims the closures were driven by political bias, targeting the Trump family\u2019s conservative affiliations back in 2021.\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs have reason to believe that Capital One\u2019s unilateral decision came about as a result of political and social motivations and Capital One\u2019s unsubstantiated, \u201cwoke\u201d beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political views. In essence, Capital One \u201cde-banked\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Accounts because Capital One believed that the political tide at the moment favored doing so.\n\nIn addition to the considerable financial harm that Plaintiffs and their affiliated entities suffered, Capital One\u2019s reckless decision is part of a growing trend by financial institutions in the United States of America to cut off a consumer\u2019s access to banking services if their political views contradict with those of the financial institution. Capital One\u2019s conduct is but one example of a systemic, subversive industry practice that aims to coerce the public to shift and re-align their political views.\u201d\n\nThe move comes after Trump openly slammed both Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase.\n\nAt a World Economic Forum session in January, Trump publicly criticized Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.\n\nHe accused them of denying services to conservatives, urging them to \u201copen your banks\u201d to those who have allegedly been unfairly kicked out of the banking system.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks touch on a broader debate over alleged discrimination in the financial sector.\n\nThis month, after meeting with Republican lawmakers, Chase\u2019s Dimon said US banks sometimes \u201cpush people out of the system\u201d due to vague federal anti-money laundering rules.\n\nDimon denied political or religious bias at Chase, instead blaming regulatory pressures that force compliance-driven account closures.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Bank of America's consumer-facing lines of business include its network of branches and deposit-gathering operations, retail lending products, credit and debit cards, and small-business services. The company's Merrill Lynch operations provide brokerage and wealth-management services, as does its private bank. Wholesale lines of business include investment banking, corporate and commercial real estate lending, and capital markets operations. Bank of America has operations in several countries but is primarily US-focused.\n\nKey Indicators: Bank of America's Financial Health\n\nMarket Capitalization Analysis: The company's market capitalization surpasses industry averages, showcasing a dominant size relative to peers and suggesting a strong market position.\n\nRevenue Growth: Bank of America's revenue growth over a period of 3 months has been noteworthy.

            "content": "The recent pullback in Bank of America is an opportunity for investors to buy the stock, according to Baird. Analyst David George upgraded shares to outperform from neutral. He also notched his price target $5 higher to $50, implying shares could rise around 20.6% from Thursday's close. According to George, Bank of America is a \"great franchise at [a] reasonable price.\" The analyst cited Bank of America's \"best-in-class deposit franchise, consistent execution, relatively low credit risk, and top-tier markets businesses.\" Thanks to the stock's 10.6% sell-off this week, he believes shares are now trading at a more reasonable valuation. Bank of America and other big banking peers have tumbled this week amid a broader market pullback, due to concerns of weaker U.S. economic growth and global transactional activity stemming from tariffs. \"BofA is under-earning currently given its below-normal [net interest margin], which should provide a nice tailwind over the coming years, and BAC is well-positioned to return capital given its healthy PPNR profitability and modest balance sheet growth,\" George added. BAC 5D mountain BAC in past 5 trading days Most analysts are bullish on the stock, per LSEG. Of the 24 who cover it, 19 have a buy or strong buy rating. In addition to Bank of America, George also raised his rating on JPMorgan Chase to neutral from underperform. JPMorgan shares also slipped nearly 7% week to date. Despite JPMorgan's \"best-in-class franchise\" and the stock's recent decline, the analyst believes shares are still trading at too-high of a valuation. \"JPM shares are off ~11% in the last month (vs. SPY -5.5%), and we are having a tough time making the short case in the name after this recent weakness. With the stock still relatively expensive at ~2.55x TBV, we aren't buyers of the stock but don't believe it makes sense to be short, as defensive-minded market participants will likely move into JPM if economic data gets a little more volatile,\" George noted.",

            "content": "Good news for banking giant Bank of America (BAC), as it landed an upgrade from analysts at Baird recently. The recent movement in the stock is providing an excellent opportunity for a buy, though investors did not seem to agree. In fact, investors sold off shares, though at a subdued pace, and sent share prices down fractionally in Friday afternoon\u2019s trading.\n\nDavid George, analyst with Baird who has five stars on TipRanks, hiked the rating on Bank of America shares from Neutral to Outperform. Further, George also boosted the price target on Bank of America shares, sending them from $45 to $50 per share, which suggests an upside potential of better than 20% against Thursday\u2019s closing numbers.\n\nGeorge points out that Bank of America is still a major name in United States banking operations, as it has been for some time now, and thanks to the recent downward pressure on shares\u2014which actually continued into today\u2014these shares were available at \u201c\u2026a reasonable price.\u201d George also called attention to Bank of America\u2019s solid risk as a creditor, its excellent markets operations, its solid deposit business, and its overall execution as well.\n\nGetting In On Growth\n\nIn another interesting twist, Bank of America is looking to bring in a new feature to its upcoming Consumer and Retail Conference in Miami, Florida: Camping World Holdings (CWH). As it turns out, Camping World is the world\u2019s largest recreational vehicle (RV) dealer in the world now, and as such, it should make a good addition to Bank of America\u2019s retail lineup.\n\nCamping World will deliver an oddly-appropriate \u201cfireside chat\u201d on March 11 at 2:40 PM ET, and replays of the event will be available through Camping World\u2019s investor pages for the following 90 days. Given that Bank of America recently upgraded Thor Industries (THO) on the strength of the RV market, having an RV dealer show up at its retail conference actually makes a certain amount of sense.\n\nIs BAC a Good Buy Right Now?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on BAC stock based on 10 Buys, five Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 17.08% rally in its share price over the past year, the average BAC price target of $52.86 per share implies 28.83% upside potential.\n\nSee more BAC analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "The team behind Bank of America\u2019s digital banking platform for businesses is concentrating on hastening onboarding and increasing personalization to sharpen client experience.\n\nThat\u2019s according to Kristin Gemma, head of CashPro communication, products and strategy at the bank. CashPro handles treasury and payment needs for about 40,000 companies, ranging from small businesses to global corporates.\n\nKristin Gemma Permission granted by Bank of America\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really thinking about, how do we improve onboarding for clients, so that it doesn\u2019t take a long time to get set up with the bank?\u201d Gemma said during a recent interview. She manages CashPro\u2019s communications process team, which conveys platform changes and developments to clients, and provides customers with thought leadership and information on the payments landscape.\n\nFinance professionals, corporate treasurers, accounts payable and receivable staff and C-suite executives use CashPro to manage their treasury, trade, credit and investments. That includes making payment approvals or decisions related to fraud, or depositing checks. More than $1 trillion in payments were made through CashPro\u2019s app last year, a 25% year-over-year jump, as businesses favor mobile capabilities.\n\nLast year, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender added a function that allows CashPro users to launch an inquiry into the status of a transaction within the platform, part of the bank\u2019s continuous effort to boost its digital banking capabilities so businesses can do more online instead of calling or emailing for assistance.\n\nCurrently, clients spend time talking to bankers or customer service employees, sharing information over the phone and via email, which the bank envisions moving to the CashPro platform, Gemma said.\n\n\u201cWe can all get a transparent view of what\u2019s happening, the client can feel very comfortable exchanging information with us in the platform, because they\u2019re authenticated,\u201d Gemma said.\n\nTo that end, the CashPro team is working to roll out more functionality \u201cto speed up that time to onboard and also take out a lot of the noise,\u201d Gemma said. The team has tweaked CashPro\u2019s application programming interfaces \u2013 which allow clients to access the platform through a third party such as a treasury management system or enterprise resource planning platform \u2013 to hasten client onboarding time.\n\nLater this year, the bank aims to add a new credit card enrollment option to the platform, Gemma said. That will allow certain business banking and commercial banking clients to apply for a commercial card through CashPro, similar to what the bank already does on the consumer side.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bringing more of that consumer experience into Cash Pro,\u201d Gemma said. She declined to specify when the bank plans to add that capability.\n\nCashPro continues to be an area of focus for the bank, which spends $13 billion annually on technology, as of this year; of that amount, $4 billion goes toward new technology initiatives, a bank spokesperson said. Gemma declined to share specific investment numbers for CashPro.\n\nBank of America also seeks to step up personalization for its CashPro clients, she said, which is likely to make it easier to draw their attention to changes or functions that might benefit them.\n\n\u201cOur clients are getting so much information now \u2013 we all are, right? \u2013 it can be hard to cut out the noise and understand what is truly impactful,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cWe do certainly see that with clients, and it takes multiple tries, in some cases, to get them to take advantage of a new capability that we know will help them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more relevant we can make our communications to them, the more likely it is that they\u2019ll actually be able to pay attention to it,\u201d Gemma added.\n\nGemma\u2019s team works to educate clients on how they can use CashPro, because some customers are eager to be early adopters and immediately try new functions, but others need to be informed answers to certain questions could be obtained faster through CashPro\u2019s chat function, which is powered by BofA\u2019s virtual financial assistant Erica. Erica has been able to handle about 40% of client inquiries in CashPro\u2019s chat function, Gemma said.\n\nThe team is also doubling down on data intelligence, to give customers proactive notifications about potential actions, she said. Since a digital tool called Insights was rolled out, the bank has seen strong client adoption, \u201cwhere they actually are taking steps that we recommend that they take,\u201d she said.\n\nRecently, for companies whose users had a payment approval that exceeded average amounts, CashPro issued a notification suggesting limits be reviewed. In response, about 1,000 users took action to lower payment approval limits, Gemma said.\n\n\u201cWe will be doing more personalized and proactive pushes of insights like this throughout the year,\u201d Gemma said. Leveraging data to help clients protect themselves remains a \u201ctop focus area.\u201d",

It's a great responsibility because it requires the bank to constantly improve to offer its customers the best services. Now, it has announced a new development that, more than likely, other banks will also copy.\n\nRecently, Bank of America has announced plans to launch its own stable digital currency. This way, it joins a list of major financial institutions exploring these currencies.\n\nAccording to Bank of America, this is part of an initiative to expand its digital payment options and better serve its customer base. Although specific details haven't been revealed yet, this move marks a significant shift in the bank's approach. Stable digital currencies are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being linked to an asset, such as the U.S. dollar.\n\n| Bank of America, Google Maps\n\nThis makes them attractive to financial institutions because they combine the benefits of cryptocurrencies with the stability of traditional assets. Bank of America is launching its own stable currency at a time when the bank sees a growing demand for digital payment systems.\n\nStable Currency: A Growing Trend in the Financial Industry\n\nThe development of stable currencies is rapidly gaining ground in the global financial landscape. Prominent banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, have already experimented with these digital assets. However, Bank of America is focusing on creating a stable currency specifically designed for institutional use.\n\nThis will allow offering new solutions to companies seeking faster and more secure ways to manage cross-border payments. The bank's foray into this financial product could revolutionize the way it approaches international transactions and digital asset management.\n\n| Pexels, Bank of America, Google Maps, en.e-noticies.cat\n\nAs the financial industry continues to evolve, digital currencies are seen as an effective tool to simplify digital transactions. For Bank of America, they could enhance its position in the digital payments market by offering a more reliable, transparent, and scalable alternative to traditional banking systems.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for the Future of Digital Payments?\n\nBank of America's entry into the stable currency space signals the beginning of a new chapter in digital finance. With the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and cryptocurrencies, traditional banks are increasingly seeking ways to offer related services. The bank's stable currencies could help provide faster transactions with lower fees.\n\nAlthough details remain limited, this launch by Bank of America could serve as a catalyst for other banks to follow suit. This would lead to greater competition and innovation in the digital payments sector. The financial market, in general, will be watching closely as Bank of America rolls out this new initiative in the coming months.",

Financial Snapshot APR: 20.24% - 27.24% Variable\n\nForeign Transaction Fees: None\n\nAlthough the card is marketed as a rewards credit card with an everyday earning at a rate of 1.5 points per dollar, it functions more like a travel rewards card. It earns 2 points per dollar spent on travel (and dining), and you can redeem your points for travel via the Bank of America Travel Center. Or, you can purchase your travel elsewhere, earn 2 points per dollar, and redeem your points for a statement credit against your purchase.\n\nYou\u2019ll have several other options at redemption time, including statement credits, gift cards, or 1 cent per point transferred to an eligible Bank of America bank account.\n\nOne big drawback of the card is that the points are not transferable to any travel partners such as hotel or airline programs.\n\nBottom Line: Although the Bank of America Premium Rewards card earns rewards on every purchase, its bonus earnings on travel and travel redemption options make it a great travel rewards credit card.\n\nBest Ultra-premium Bank of America Credit Card\n\nOne of Bank of America\u2019s newest credit cards is an ultra-premium product.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Bear the Brunt of Trade Threats. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stands against the other stocks.\n\nWall Street\u2019s main indices fell further on Tuesday as investors sold off positions to mitigate risks from the ongoing trade tensions among some of the world\u2019s largest economies.\n\nThe Dow Jones fell the most during the trading session, losing 1.55 percent, while the S&P 500 declined 1.22 percent. The Nasdaq dropped by 0.35 percent.\n\nFollowing the US imposition of a 25-percent tax on goods from Canada and Mexico on Tuesday, countries announced a promise to retaliate. Canada, as well as China, which received a 10 percent additional tax, immediately announced retaliation. Mexico is expected to follow suit.\n\nThe negative sentiment spilled over to 10 stocks, predominantly retailers, with the tariff threats seen to pose pressures on their profit margins. In this article, we have detailed the reasons behind their declines.\n\nTo come up with Tuesday\u2019s worst performers, we considered only the stocks with $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume.\n\nIs Bank of America Corporation (BAC) the Best Dividend Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?\n\nA professional banker providing consultation to a customer in the security of his office.\n\nBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)\n\nBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) dropped its share prices by 6.34 percent on Tuesday\u2014a second straight day\u2014as investor sentiment was weighed down by its potential risks from the growing trade tensions between the US and its largest trading partners.\n\nBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) traded in line with its counterparts on Tuesday, albeit it posted the largest losses among its peers.\n\nWith the economies throwing tariff retaliations, investors moved to park funds for now to mitigate risks. With Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) set to release its next earnings results in April next month, investors will be looking out for any cues on its provisions for credit losses, which could go higher with higher taxes now in place.\n\nPCLs are funds that money lenders keep and are treated as their own expense to absorb delinquent debts that can no longer be recovered.\n\nOverall BAC ranks 10th on our list of Tuesday's worst performers. While we acknowledge the potential of BAC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BAC but trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

Enter your information and apply for the account.\n\nFor most checking and business accounts, you\u2019ll need to make a minimum opening deposit and set up direct deposits that meet the bank\u2019s requirements.\n\nNote that bonuses are available for new bank accounts only, and existing customers may not qualify if they already hold the same type of account. Keep an eye on the fine print for each promotion to ensure you meet all conditions to receive your bonus.\n\nComparing Bank of America Offers to Competitor Promotions\n\nBank of America offers competitive promotions \u2014 though its bonuses aren\u2019t the highest you\u2019ll find, they\u2019re far from the lowest. And with the same bonus for multiple accounts, most people will be able to find an account that\u2019s right for them without missing out on any extra cash. Also, some of the minimum opening deposits are low compared to other banks.\n\nBank of America also offers a wide network of branches and ATMs, making it easily accessible to most.\n\nIn addition, Bank of America\u2019s Preferred Rewards program offers four reward tiers with perks such as waived account maintenance fees, better loan rates and higher annual percentage yields on qualifying savings accounts.\n\nTips for Maximizing Your Bank of America Offer\n\nTo make sure you get the most out of your bonus, here are a few tips:\n\nRead the terms and conditions carefully to make sure you meet all the requirements.\n\nOnly open an account if you\u2019re sure you\u2019ll be able to meet the requirements to waive the monthly maintenance fee.\n\nKeep track of your balance to avoid other fees, like overdraft fees, that could eat up part of your bonus.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re not ready to open an account right now, check the Bank of America website \u2014 and the websites of any other banks you\u2019re considering \u2014 to compare current promotions when you are ready to open a new account.\n\nConclusion\n\nBank of America is currently offering a $300 bonus for new personal checking accounts and a $200 bonus for new business checking accounts, provided you meet the requirements. With a variety of accounts to choose from, anyone should be able to find the right checking account for their needs.\n\nBank of America offers a full lineup of banking products and services with branches across the country. It may be worth checking out if you like the convenience offered by a large, national bank.\n\nCash bonuses are great perks, but they shouldn\u2019t be the only reason you choose a bank. Make sure it meets your needs and explore the bank\u2019s other offerings, including savings accounts and CD accounts, before opening an account.\n\nFAQs Here's more about Bank of America promotions.

Learn More\n\nThe Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card offers several ways to maximize your rewards \u2014 including earning double points when you book travel through the Bank of America\u00ae Travel Center. But the most significant boost comes from having one or more investment accounts with Merrill. And the more money you have in those accounts, the bigger your rewards.\n\nHere's how to make the most of the Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card.\n\nGet the loyalty bonus\n\nWith the Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card, everyone gets 1.5 points for every $1 spent on most purchases. Enroll in the Bank of America Preferred Rewards\u00ae program, and the bonuses increase to 25%, 50% or 75%, depending on your combined balances at Bank of America\u00ae and Merrill:\n\nProgram tier Required balance Relationship bonus Gold $20,000 to $49,999. 25%. Platinum $50,000 to $99,999. 50%. Platinum Honors $100,000 to $999,999. 75%. Diamond $1,000,000 to $9,999,999. 75%. Diamond Honors $10 million or more. 75%.\n\nSay you spend $1,000 a month on the card, or $12,000 a year. At 1.5 points per dollar, you'd earn $180 in rewards. Bonuses really start to climb when you have Preferred Rewards status:\n\nPreferred Rewards level Rewards boost Points per $1 spent Annual points ($12,000 in spending) None \u2014 1.5 18,000 Gold 25% 1.875 22,500 Platinum 50% 2.25 27,000 Platinum Honors, Diamond or Diamond Honors 75% 2.625 31,500\n\nGetting the loyalty bonus is a simple way to boost your rewards, but, of course, simple isn't the same as easy. Having $20,000, $50,000 or $100,000 in combined accounts is easy to say, hard to do.\n\nUse the Travel Center\n\nThe Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card boosts your rewards to 3 points per $1 spent on travel booked through the Bank of America\u00ae Travel Center. That includes flights, hotel nights, rental cars \u2014 everything except insurance. There's no limit on the extra points you can earn this way.\n\nThe card also comes with a solid sign-up promotion, so make sure you spend enough to qualify for it: 25,000 online bonus points after you make at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of account opening - that can be a $250 statement credit toward travel purchases.. Other travel cards offer bigger sign-up bonuses, but those cards typically come with an annual fee. You can't beat the Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card's annual fee of $0. Like most travel credit cards, this card doesn't charge a foreign transaction fee.\n\nTake an interest rate break\n\nNew cardholders get an interest rate break: 0% Intro APR for 15 billing cycles for purchases, and for any balance transfers made in the first 60 days. After the Intro APR offer ends, a Variable APR that\u2019s currently 18.24%-28.24% will apply. You'll be able to rack up points without worrying about the interest piling up, too.\n\nYou should be aware, though, that balance transfers will incur a fee: 3% for 60 days from account opening, then 4%.\n\nHow to redeem rewards on the Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card\n\nIt's just as easy to redeem points as it is to earn them. Simply make a restaurant or travel-related purchase with your card, then redeem your points for statement credit to offset the purchase. Points are worth 1 cent apiece when redeemed for travel. And when you think \"travel\" purchases, think outside the box. The Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card's definition of travel is wider than many other cards', including amusement parks, art galleries, circuses, aquariums, zoos and many other things as travel expenses.\n\nThe ability to redeem for credit against restaurant and travel purchases offers tremendous flexibility. You can book travel any way you want, fly on any airline, stay at any hotel. There are no blackout dates or restrictions.\n\nYou can also redeem points for gift cards or to make a cash deposit into one of your Bank of America\u00ae, Merrill Edge\u00ae or Merrill Lynch accounts\u00ae, but you'll get a much lower redemption value per point. Still, with the bonus percentages, you can earn almost as much as a card that pays a higher reward rate.\n\nPay more, earn more\n\nA key element of the Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card's appeal is the $0 annual fee. If you're willing to pay an annual fee, you can get a higher rewards rate even without loyalty bonuses. Take the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card. Here's what it offers:\n\nAnnual fee: $95.\n\nSign-up bonus: Enjoy $250 to use on Capital One Travel in your first cardholder year, plus earn 75,000 bonus miles once you spend $4,000 on purchases within the first 3 months from account opening - that\u2019s equal to $1,000 in travel.\n\nAPR: The ongoing APR is 19.99%-29.24% Variable APR.\n\nRewards: Earn 2 miles for every $1 spent with no limit on how much you can earn. Miles can be redeemed for travel and restaurant purchases at a rate of 1 cent per point.",

            "content": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is dropping its lawsuit against the company that runs the Zelle payment platform and three U.S. banks as federal agencies continue to pull back on previous enforcement actions now that President Donald Trump is back in office.\n\nIn December a federal regulator sued JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America, claiming the banks failed to protect hundreds of thousands of consumers from rampant fraud on Zelle, in violation of consumer financial laws.\n\nIn the federal civil complaint, the CFPB asserted that the banks rushed to get the peer-to-peer payments platform to market without effective safeguards against fraud and then, after consumers complained about being defrauded on the service, largely denied them relief.\n\nEarly Warning Services, a fintech company based in Scottsdale, Arizona, that operates Zelle, was named as a defendant in the lawsuit. EWS is owned by seven U.S. banks, including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America. Those three banks are the largest financial institutions on the Zelle network, accounting for 73% of activity on Zelle in 2023.\n\nBut a filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona on Tuesday indicated that the CFPB was dismissing its lawsuit against EWS, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo with prejudice.\n\nThe dismissal comes less than a week after the CFPB dropped several enforcement actions against companies like Capital One and Rocket Homes.\n\nIn notices of voluntary dismissals that were filed, the CFPB dropped lawsuits it had brought against Capital One, Rocket Homes, Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance, owned by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, and others.\n\nThose suits were all filed under the agency\u2019s previous director, Rohit Chopra, who Trump fired just weeks ago. The CPFB has since plunged into turmoil \u2014 with the White House later ordering it to halt nearly all its work. The administration also closed the agency\u2019s headquarters and moved to fire scores of its workers.\n\nTrump has defended his administration\u2019s broadside against the CFPB \u2014 including recent claims about the agency being \u201cset up to destroy people.\u201d But supporters of the agency stress that it provides crucial oversight and protects consumers from being vulnerable to predatory business practices.\n\nThe CPFB isn\u2019t the only federal agency to signal a pullback on previous enforcement action under the new administration. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has either closed or paused legal action against several cryptocurrency platforms in recent weeks, as the regulator tries to present itself as more crypto-friendly under Trump.\n\nLast month Binance and the SEC filed a joint motion to pause its high-profile lawsuit against the crypto exchange. The SEC filed a similar joint motion with Coinbase. In addition, Robinhood has said that the case against it has been closed.",

Shares of banking companies are volatile this week amid President Trump\u2019s decision to implement tariffs.\n\nWhat To Know: President Donald Trump's firm opposition this week to further trade negotiations is amplifying concerns over economic stability, a crucial element influencing major financial institutions.\n\nThis uncertainty weighs on Bank of America, one of the largest U.S. banks, which depends heavily on interest income, accounting for over half of its total revenue.\n\nRead Also: Wall Street Awaits Trump\u2019s Tariff Decision, Digests Mixed Economic Data: What\u2019s Driving Markets Wednesday?\n\nOn Tuesday, the 10-year Treasury yield declined to 4.16%, potentially squeezing the bank's net interest margin\u2014the gap between lending rates and deposit costs. The 10-year yield has otherwise moved higher to 4.27% Wednesday afternoon.\n\nWhat Else: Lower yields generally make new loans less profitable, particularly in mortgage and corporate lending. At the same time, trade uncertainty could dampen business confidence, weakening loan demand from commercial clients.\n\nA slowing economy also raises the risk of credit deterioration, potentially forcing Bank of America to bolster its loan loss reserves to cover potential defaults. Higher reserves could further strain the bank's earnings, compounding the challenges presented by declining interest income and trade-related financial instability.\n\nRead Also: CFPB Drops Zelle Fraud Reimbursement Case Against JPMorgan, Wells Fargo\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to BAC by investing in the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund XLF.\n\nHow To Buy BAC Stock\n\nBesides going to a brokerage platform to purchase a share \u2013 or fractional share \u2013 of stock, you can also gain access to shares either by buying an exchange traded fund (ETF) that holds the stock itself, or by allocating yourself to a strategy in your 401(k) that would seek to acquire shares in a mutual fund or other instrument.\n\nFor example, in Bank of America\u2019s case, it is in the Financials sector. An ETF will likely hold shares in many liquid and large companies that help track that sector, allowing an investor to gain exposure to the trends within that segment.\n\nAccording to data from Benzinga Pro, BAC has a 52-week high of $48.08 and a 52-week low of $34.15.",

With benefits that increase as your combined account balance grows, the program offers everything from waived banking fees and higher credit card rewards to discounted loan rates and higher savings account rates.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nBank of America's Preferred Rewards program is designed for loyal customers who have several Bank of America deposit accounts and Merrill investment accounts.\n\nThe Preferred Rewards program is separated into five tiers, each requiring a different three-month combined average daily balance.\n\nThe higher you ascend in the Preferred Rewards tiers, the more rewards and incentives you receive.\n\nTo qualify for the program, you must have a Bank of America personal checking account and a three-month combined average daily balance of at least $20,000 in eligible Bank of America and Merrill accounts.\n\nWhat is the Bank of America Preferred Rewards program?\n\nBank of America is one of the best banks for customer rewards. Its Preferred Rewards program lets you receive certain perks and benefits that vary depending on how much money you have combined in qualifying Bank of America accounts. The eligible accounts can include various Bank of America deposit accounts as well as Merrill investment accounts.\n\nBank of America's Preferred Rewards program is designed for loyal bank customers who have a considerable amount of money held at the bank. The program is divided into five tiers, each with a different minimum balance requirement. The options start with the Gold tier, which requires a minimum three-month average combined balance of $20,000, up to the Diamond Honors tier, which requires a minimum combined balance of $10 million.\n\nThe higher your tier, the more discounts and benefits you can receive. The perks of being a Bank of America Preferred Rewards member include:\n\nWaived select service and monthly maintenance fees\n\nRewards bonuses on eligible Bank of America credit cards\n\nInterest rate discounts on auto loans and home equity loans\n\nDiscounts on foreign currency orders\n\nReduced mortgage origination fees\n\nInterest rate boosts on Bank of America Advantage Savings accounts\n\nAnnual fee discounts on Merrill Guided Investing and more\n\nHow to qualify for the program\n\nTo qualify for the Preferred Rewards program, you must have an eligible Bank of America personal checking account and at least a three-month combined average daily balance of $20,000 across your eligible Bank of America deposit accounts and Merrill investment accounts.\n\nAccounts that qualify for the program include Bank of America Advantage Banking (checking), savings, money market, CD, IRA, Merrill Cash Management Account (CMA), Merrill IRAs, 529 plans on your Merrill account, and revocable grantor trust accounts.\n\nOnce you've qualified, your membership in the Preferred Rewards program lasts for one year, regardless if your combined balance temporarily falls below $20,000. So, if you have at least $20,000 in your accounts, you should enroll in the program to take advantage of the benefits. Participating won't cost you anything.\n\nBank of America reviews your program qualification annually. After a year, if you fall below the $20,000 minimum balance required, you have a three-month grace period to get it back up before you lose your Preferred Rewards benefits. And, even if you do lose your benefits, the bank can still reinstate you within 24 months if your balance increases to meet the minimum.\n\nBank of America Preferred Rewards tiers\n\nThe Bank of America Preferred Rewards program has five tiers based on your three-month average combined account balance. The lowest tier is the Gold tier, and the highest one is the Diamond Honors tier.\n\nBank of America reviews your account status monthly. As your qualifying balance increases, the bank automatically upgrades you to the next tier once you reach the minimum balance required.\n\nThe rewards you receive will increase as you ascend the tiers. For example, Gold tier members receive a 25% rewards bonus on eligible Bank of America credit cards. However, if you're in the Diamond tier, you'll receive a 75% rewards bonus on those credit cards.\n\nThe table below shows the five Bank of America Preferred Rewards tiers with their required three-month average combined balances and select benefits. We'll cover each tier in detail.\n\nTier Credit Card Rewards Bonus Advantage Savings interest rate boost Mortgage discounts Gold ($20,000 - $49,999) 25% 5% $200 off origination fees Platinum ($50,000 - $99,999) 50% 10% $400 off origination fees Platinum Honors ($100,000 - $999,999) 75% 20% $600 off origination fees Diamond ($1 million - $9.99 million) 75% 20% 0.250% interest rate reduction (with PayPlan) Diamond Honors ($10 million+) 75% 20% 0.375% interest rate reduction (with PayPlan)\n\nGold tier\n\nThe lowest tier in Bank of America's Preferred Rewards program is the Gold tier, which requires a three-month combined average daily balance of $20,000 to $49,999. With this tier, you'll avoid select banking service and monthly maintenance fees (for four savings and four checking accounts).\n\nOne of the main advantages of the Preferred Rewards program is getting discounts on mortgages and car loans. With the Gold tier, you'll get $200 off origination fees if you take out a new mortgage or refinance your current one. If you need an auto loan, you'll get an interest rate discount of 0.25%. Plus, you'll get a 0.125% rate discount on a home equity line of credit (HELOC) if you need cash to remodel your home, consolidate debt, or accomplish other goals.\n\nOther Gold tier benefits include:\n\n25% rewards bonus on the bank's eligible credit cards\n\n5% interest rate boost on a Bank of America Advantage Savings account\n\n1% exchange rate discount for online and mobile foreign currency orders\n\n0.05% discount on Merrill Guided Investing annual fees\n\nPlatinum tier\n\nYou reach the Platinum tier with a three-month combined average daily balance of $50,000 to $99,999. If you're already a Gold tier member, you'll enjoy an automatic upgrade to the Platinum tier when your three-month combined account balance reaches this tier's minimum.\n\nLike with the Gold tier, you can avoid select banking and monthly maintenance fees. However, you also get 12 free out-of-network ATM transactions per year (up to one per statement cycle).\n\nThe Platinum tier gets you reduced fees and discounts at a higher level. For example, you'll receive a $400 discount on mortgage origination fees and a 0.250% interest rate discount on a HELOC. The rate discount for auto loans increases to 0.35%, and the credit card rewards bonus jumps to 50%.\n\nOther Platinum tier perks include:\n\n10% interest rate boost on your Bank of America Advantage Savings account\n\n1.5% exchange rate discount on mobile and online foreign currency orders\n\nAnnual program fee discount of 0.10% on Merrill Guided Investing accounts\n\nPlatinum Honors tier\n\nIf you often use non-Bank of America ATMs, the Platinum Honors tier will benefit you because it gives you unlimited fee-free transactions at out-of-network ATMs. To qualify, you'll need a three-month combined average daily balance of $100,000 to $999,999 across your eligible Bank of America and Merrill accounts.\n\nOnce you reach the Platinum Honors tier, your benefits and discounts increase as follows:\n\n20% interest rate booster on your Bank of America Advantage Savings account\n\n75% rewards bonus on your Bank of America credit cards\n\n$600 reduction on mortgage origination fees\n\n0.375% HELOC interest rate discount\n\n0.50% interest rate discount on new auto loan applications\n\n2% exchange rate discount on mobile and online foreign currency orders\n\n0.15% discount on annual Merrill Guided Investing fees\n\nDiamond tier\n\nThe Diamond tier of Bank of America's Preferred Rewards program is where you want to be if you travel often and complete transactions abroad. It offers unlimited fee-free international transactions and ATM use.\n\nTo reach the Diamond tier, you'll need a considerable amount of money in your eligible accounts \u2013 a three-month combined average daily balance of $1 million to $9.99 million. But in exchange, you get access to exclusive lifestyle benefits that include discounts and incentives on travel, fashion brands, dining, golf courses, spa resorts, and vehicle buying and leasing.\n\nSeveral benefits in the Diamond tier are the same as the Platinum tier offers. For example, the credit card rewards bonus, savings account boost, auto loan rate discount, foreign exchange rate discount, and Merrill Guiding Investing annual fee discount remain alike.\n\nBut if you're a current or aspiring homeowner, the Diamond tier offers attractive incentives, including a 0.625% interest rate discount on a HELOC and a 0.250% interest rate reduction on mortgages. You must enroll in PayPlan, Bank of America's automatic payment service, to receive the mortgage rate discount. If you don't, you'll still get the 0.125% discount provided under the Diamond tier.\n\nDiamond Honors tier\n\nThe top tier of Bank of America's Preferred Rewards program is the Diamond Honors tier, which requires a three-month combined average daily balance of $10 million or more. It's very similar to the Diamond tier except for the discounts offered on mortgages and HELOCs.\n\nAs a Diamond Honors tier member, you can receive a 0.375% interest rate reduction on mortgages with PayPlan enrollment and a 0.750% interest rate discount on new HELOCs.\n\nHow to enroll in Preferred Rewards\n\nEnrolling in the Preferred Rewards program is easy and free. To qualify, you must have a Bank of America personal checking account and a three-month combined average daily balance of at least $20,000 across your eligible Bank of America deposit accounts and Merrill investment accounts.\n\nYou can enroll before you meet the $20,000 minimum, but you must reach that level within 30 days of opening your Bank of America checking account. Once you reach that level, the bank automatically enrolls you in the Gold tier of the Preferred Rewards program. The benefits you receive will become available within 30 days of enrollment.\n\nYou can move up in the program's tiers by increasing the amount of money you have in your eligible accounts. The bank reviews your three-month average daily balance every month, and once it reaches the minimum for the next tier level, you will get an automatic upgrade.\n\nRemember that the program is based on a three-month average daily balance, so increasing the balance in just one month may not entitle you to an upgrade.\n\nSay you've been in the Gold tier with a balance of $40,000 for the past seven months and then increase your balance to $60,000 in the eighth month. At that point, your three-month average daily balance would be about $46,667. However, if you have a $60,000 balance in the ninth month, your three-month average daily balance would be $53,333, qualifying you for Platinum.\n\nWhich credit cards qualify for the program?\n\nAll the Bank of America Preferred Rewards program tiers offer reward bonuses on eligible credit cards through the bank. These range from 25% to 75%, depending on your tier.\n\nHere's a list of the Bank of America credit cards that you can use with the program.\n\nHow to get the most out of Bank of America Preferred Rewards\n\nNo matter which tier you're in, you can enjoy many benefits through the Bank of America Preferred Rewards program. To make the most of it, consider the recommendations below.\n\nGet and use an eligible Bank of America credit card\n\nBank of America offers some of the best rewards credit cards available, and its Preferred Rewards program can help you earn even more. All tiers provide a rewards bonus on eligible Bank of America cards.\n\nFor example, if you have a Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card that earns 3% on select purchases, you'd earn $3 cash back on a $100 transaction. As a Gold tier member, you get a 25% rewards bonus, which means you earn $3.75 in cash back on the same transaction. Your 50% rewards bonus as a Platinum tier member would equate to $4.50 per $100, and your 75% rewards bonus would get you $5.25 per $100 if you're a Diamond tier member.\n\nOpen a Bank of America Advantage Savings account.\n\nAs a Preferred Rewards member, you can receive a 5% to 20% interest rate boost on your Bank of America Advantage Savings account, which offers a standard rate of 0.01%-0.02% (as of 01/10/25).\n\nTake advantage of loan discounts\n\nWhether you're buying or refinancing a home, purchasing a new vehicle, or considering a HELOC, Bank of America's Preferred Reward program offers discounts you'll want to utilize. For example, you can get a reduction in mortgage origination fees between $200 and $600, depending on whether you're on the Gold, Platinum, or Platinum Honors tier.\n\nIf you're a Preferred Rewards member who is buying a new car, you can get an interest rate discount between 0.25% and 0.50%. You can also receive interest rate discounts anywhere from 0.125% to 0.750% on new HELOCs.\n\nInvest with Merrill Guided Investing\n\nMerrill, the investment arm of Bank of America, offers an advisory program called Merrill Guided Investing, where Merrill professionals help build, monitor, and rebalance your portfolio. You usually have to pay a program fee of 0.45%.\n\nMerill calculates the fee monthly based on your account balance from the prior month. So, if your account balance at the end of July is $2,000, then your cost for August is $0.75 ($2,000 x .0045 /12). However, as a Preferred Rewards member, you can get a discount on that fee for anywhere between 0.05% and 0.15%.\n\nFor example, being a Platinum tier member would get you a 0.10% annual program fee discount, so your fee would be 0.35% rather than 0.45%. With the same calculations used above, your cost for August would be $0.58 ($2,000 x .0035 /12).\n\nFAQs\n\nHow much are Bank of America rewards points worth? Bank of America reward points are worth $0.01 per point, so the cash equivalent of 1,500 points is $15. As a Preferred Rewards member, you can earn between 25% and 75% more points for your purchases. For example, with the Bank of America Travel Rewards card, you earn a standard 1.5 points for every $1 you spend. However, you can earn between 1.87 and 2.62 points for every $1 spent with the Preferred Rewards program. While these points are worth the same amount when you redeem them ($0.01 per point), more points earned will mean a higher return. Is the Preferred Rewards program worth it? If you have enough money to satisfy the $20,000 three-month minimum daily balance requirement to qualify, then the Preferred Rewards program is definitely worth participating in. There's no cost to join, and as a member, you can save money on banking fees, home and auto loans, foreign transactions, and more. The advantages outweigh any drawbacks. Is there a downside to Bank of America Preferred Rewards? The only possible downside to the Bank of America Preferred Rewards program is the high minimum balance required to participate in it. This may make it cost-prohibitive for many people who don't have at least $20,000 to put into Bank of America and Merrill accounts.\n\nBottom line\n\nThe Bank of America Preferred Rewards program offers substantial benefits if you have a significant amount of money in qualifying Bank of America deposit accounts and Merrill investment accounts. From waived fees and enhanced credit card rewards to discounted loan rates and investment fee reductions, the program is a valuable option for loyal Bank of America customers. While the minimum balance requirement may be a hurdle for some, if you can meet it, the program's perks make it worth participating in.\n\nFinanceBuzz is not an investment advisor.

That is the view of Bank of America's equity and quantitative strategy team, led by Savita Subramanian. \"Perhaps the biggest risk about tariffs is a self-fulfilling slowdown due to corporate paralysis,\" the strategist wrote in a note Tuesday. Such a pause was seen in 2018, during President Donald Trump's first term in office, Subramanian noted. Growing numbers of investors think there is an increased chance the U.S. will soon suffer from stagflation, which is when high inflation is accompanied by only sluggish economic growth, BofA added. Tariffs and deportations are inflationary, while uncertainty and less demand are recessionary. But BofA is unfazed by such concerns. \"Investors [are] assigning a 59% probability to stagflation risk despite the fact that stagflation has occurred ~5% of the time historically,\" Subramanian said. Bank of America forecasts Trump policies will add no more than 0.1% to core PCE inflation, while the hit to gross domestic product will be even smaller. As a result of the tariff headwinds, Subramanian remains underweight in her recommendation on tech stocks, which she says are highly exposed to China as well as globally exposed supply chains. A short- to medium-term beneficiary of the Trump tariffs may be U.S. steel companies, Subramanian noted. \"Our U.S. steel industry coverage should benefit from higher prices as steel sold to U.S. based clients is mostly produced in the U.S.,\" she added. Nonetheless, higher domestic steel prices could also lead to downward pressure on demand, which would eventually hurt prices, she added. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

As of 12:15 p.m. ET, all major indexes were lower, and the S&P 500 (^GSPC -0.51%) was down by about 1.3% for the day.\n\nSome sectors and industries were hit harder than others. While certain areas of the market are clearly tariff-sensitive, such as automakers, there are others that could be indirectly impacted. The financial sector is one big example of this, and many bank stocks were dramatically underperforming the market.\n\nTo name a few examples, megabank Bank of America (BAC -0.07%) was down by 6% for the day. Investment banking leader Goldman Sachs (GS -0.71%) had fallen by 5%. And app-based banking platform SoFi (SOFI -0.80%) was lower by more than 6.5%.\n\nWhy are bank stocks getting crushed by tariffs?\n\nAt first glance, you might think banks could get some positive tailwinds from tariffs. For example, generally higher prices of goods and services could result in higher spending volume. Plus, banks should see margins rise as interest rates fall, and over the past week, the median expectation has shifted from two Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025 to three.\n\nWhile these are positive factors, this is a case of the bad outweighing the good. First and foremost, tariffs could have the effect of causing consumer spending to plunge. Consumers are already feeling stretched after several years of high inflation, and if everyday goods and services cost more because of tariffs, it could force consumers to cut back. In fact, Target and Best Buy both said that tariffs are leading to consumer uncertainty and could weigh on their results for the first quarter.\n\nFor banks, this could mean falling demand for loans, as well as lower credit card spending. When it comes to investment banking, economic uncertainty can be a negative catalyst for things like M&A deals and IPOs.\n\nLast but certainly not least, rising prices could not only hurt demand, but could cause an uptick in delinquencies and charge-offs if stretched consumers have trouble paying their bills.\n\nWhat's next for banks?\n\nTariffs could prove to be inflationary and could slow economic activity down dramatically. And this could be bad news for the banks. To be sure, we have no idea how long the tariffs could remain in effect, but if they stick around, we could certainly see some pain in the financial sector.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 8 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nBank of America and Wells Fargo, like a number of other banks in recent weeks, have backed away from diversity, equity and inclusion mentions in their annual filings last week.\n\nWhere the \u201cDiversity and Inclusion\u201d section in Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America\u2019s 10-K was last year is instead a section in this year\u2019s filing titled \u201cTalent, Inclusion and Opportunity.\u201d It refers to the bank\u2019s approach to recruiting, hiring, employee networks and training and development, without mentioning diversity, equity or inclusion.\n\nA table breaking down workforce demographics \u2013 called \u201cDiversity Metrics\u201d in last year\u2019s filing \u2013 is referred to as \u201cWorkforce data\u201d in this year\u2019s. This year\u2019s filing does break out the share of U.S.-based employees identifying as American Indian/Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific, or \u201cTwo or More Races.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s filing mentioned a \u201cdiversity and inclusion strategy, programs, initiatives and policies,\u201d and noted the bank\u2019s \u201cGlobal Diversity and Inclusion Council, which has been in place for over 20 years, is chaired by our CEO and consists of senior executives from every line of business and region.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no mention of that council or the diversity and inclusion strategy, programs, initiatives or policies in this year\u2019s filing. A person familiar with the matter said the council is being renamed the \u201cGlobal Opportunity and Inclusion Council.\u201d BofA is also swapping out the \u201cdiversity\u201d in a \u201cdiversity and inclusion\u201d internal human resources group name, in favor of \u201copportunity and inclusion,\u201d the person said.\n\nAdditionally, the bank will no longer have aspirational DEI-related goals or require a diverse slate of candidates for open roles. Those changes at the bank, which is a government contractor, were driven by the Trump administration\u2019s DEI executive order, the person said. Those changes mirror similar moves at Citi, announced by CEO Jane Fraser on Feb. 20.\n\nBank of America CEO Brian Moynihan was asked last week whether the bank has a DEI policy, amid recent backlash against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives due to the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown, but the CEO didn\u2019t answer the question directly.\n\n\u201cWe have diversity and inclusion at our company,\u201d he responded at an event at The Economic Club in Washington, D.C. \u201cBut, step back: we\u2019ve always been the bank of opportunity.\u201d\n\nMoynihan\u2019s \u201copportunity\u201d mention aligns with new wording used in this year\u2019s 10-K, which forgoes diversity and inclusion mentions but asserts \u201cBank of America has always been the bank of opportunity for our shareholders, our clients and customers, our communities and our teammates.\u201d\n\nThe bank, in last year\u2019s filing, said it \u201c[reinforces] our commitment to diversity and inclusion by investing internally in our employee networks and by facilitating voluntary enterprise-wide learning and conversations about various diversity and inclusion topics. In addition, we have practices in place for attracting diverse talent, including campus recruitment.\u201d\n\nThat language is absent from this year\u2019s filing. A Bank of America spokesperson said the bank\u2019s annual report, proxy and its website provide far more detail on the bank\u2019s programs.\n\nThe BofA spokesperson also pointed to a mention in this year\u2019s filing that the bank is \u201cdeliberate about the many ways we seek to create an inclusive environment where everyone has the opportunity to achieve their career goals.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo\n\nWells Fargo, too, has cut a \u201cPromoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\u201d paragraph from this year\u2019s annual filing, as well as any mention of an annual pay equity review.\n\nThat review \u2013 which the bank had conducted with a third-party consultant \u201cfor a number of years,\u201d according to last year\u2019s filing \u2013 compared compensation of women to men globally, and U.S. minorities to U.S. non-minorities, \u201ctaking into account factors such as role, level, tenure, and geography.\u201d\n\nPerhaps more critically, the bank is dropping a 2022 policy that required that 50% or more of that job candidates interviewed for certain roles be diverse.\n\n\u201cIn light of the current environment, we have decided to discontinue the diverse slate guidelines,\u201d Wells Fargo said Feb. 26 in a memo seen by Bloomberg. \u201cWe remain focused on maintaining a workplace where we hire the best and most qualified people and one where everyone has equal access to opportunities to grow.\u201d\n\nThe policy had a rocky start, as roughly dozen of Wells\u2019 then-current and former employees alleged, in a New York Times report, that the bank held phony job interviews for nonwhite and female job-seekers for positions that had already been offered to other candidates. Wells Fargo paused its policy for several weeks to review and update it. The initial iteration called for a 50% diverse slate for jobs that paid $100,000 a year or more.\n\nWells Fargo asserted last week that it would continue to \u201csource a broad pool of candidates\u201d when recruiting.\n\nAlthough championing diversity and inclusion is no longer listed as an expectation for every employee, Wells added this line to this year\u2019s filing: \u201cWe want to be recognized as a great company for everyone by maintaining recruitment and career development practices that support our employees and provide an environment that welcomes people from different backgrounds and with different experiences.\u201d\n\nWells maintained its demographic breakdown in this year\u2019s filing: As of the end of 2024, \u201cour global workforce was 51% female and 49% male, and our U.S. workforce was 54% female and 46% male. Our U.S. workforce was 51% white, 48% racially/ethnically diverse, and 1% undeclared,\u201d this year\u2019s filing said.\n\nTruist\n\nTruist, in its latest annual filing, referred to a table breaking down workforce demographics as \u201cTeammate Composition\u201d rather than \u201cTeammate Diversity.\u201d\n\nIn last year\u2019s 10-K filing, the bank, under a section called \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion,\u201d said \u201cinclusivity, belonging, and authenticity are at the core of Truist\u2019s evolving culture,\u201d and \u201cDEI continues to play an instrumental role across this evolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cTruist\u2019s longstanding commitment to DEI thoughtfully positions the organization to lead and execute inclusively,\u201d the bank said last year.\n\nThis year, Truist said it \u201caspires to foster a performance-based culture that is reinforced by belonging and inclusivity. Furthering a sense of belonging drives our teammate mission of creating an inclusive and energizing environment that empowers teammates to learn, grow, and have meaningful careers.\u201d\n\nTruist, Wells and Bank of America join JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Morgan Stanley, Capital One and U.S. Bank among lenders that have de-emphasized mentions of DEI in annual regulatory filings made over the past few weeks.",

            "content": "Bank of America Corp BAC shares are trading lower by 5.7% to $42.95 Tuesday afternoon as fears surrounding U.S. tariffs on Mexico and Canada added to broader market uncertainty.\n\nWhat To Know: President Donald Trump's firm stance against further trade negotiations has heightened concerns about economic growth, a key factor affecting the bank's lending and investment operations.\n\nAs one of the largest U.S. banks, Bank of America relies heavily on interest income, which makes up over 50% of its total revenue. With the 10-year Treasury yield dropping to 4.16% Tuesday, the bank faces a potential squeeze on its net interest margin, the spread between lending rates and deposit costs.\n\nLower yields typically reduce the profitability of new loans, especially in the mortgage and corporate lending segments. Additionally, trade disruptions could weaken business confidence, leading to slower loan demand from commercial clients.\n\nAdditionally, a weaker economy may also increase credit risk, potentially forcing Bank of America to raise loan loss reserves, further pressuring earnings.\n\nRead Also: Investors Shouldn\u2019t \u2018Run To The Hills\u2019 Over Tariffs: Dan Ives Points To 8 AI Stocks \u2018To Own\u2019\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to BAC by investing in the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund XLF.\n\nHow To Buy BAC Stock\n\nBesides going to a brokerage platform to purchase a share \u2013 or fractional share \u2013 of stock, you can also gain access to shares either by buying an exchange traded fund (ETF) that holds the stock itself, or by allocating yourself to a strategy in your 401(k) that would seek to acquire shares in a mutual fund or other instrument.\n\nFor example, in Bank of America case, it is in the Financials sector. An ETF will likely hold shares in many liquid and large companies that help track that sector, allowing an investor to gain exposure to the trends within that segment.\n\nAccording to data from Benzinga Pro, BAC has a 52-week high of $48.08 and a 52-week low of $34.15.",

However, Zelle has now established limits on how much money you can transfer, which varies depending on the bank you are using it in conjunction with. Remember that to use Zelle, you\u2019ll have to link it to your bank account.\n\nFull list of banks and credit unions compatible with Zelle.\n\nWhen they get it, they REALLY get it \ud83d\udc9c pic.twitter.com/TGjymRpdNx \u2014 Zelle (@Zelle) January 22, 2025\n\nZelle transfer limits per bank\n\nTo prevent security and fraud-related issues, there are restrictions on how much money you can transfer daily, with some banks also establishing monthly limits. The current limits for some of the United States' biggest banks are as follows:\n\nBank of America Daily limit: $3,500\n\nMonthly limit: $20,000 BMO Harris Daily limit: $750 for instant transfers and $1,000 for scheduled transfers\n\nMonthly limit: $5,000 for both options Capital One Daily limit: $3,000\n\nMonthly limit: Not disclosed Chase Daily limit: Varies between $500 and $10,000 depending on the account\n\nMonthly limit: Not disclosed Citibank Daily limit: $2,500 (for accounts older than 30 days)\n\nMonthly limit: $15,000 Discover Bank Daily limit: $600\n\nMonthly limit: Not disclosed First Bank Daily limit: $1,000\n\nMonthly limit: $3,500 TD Bank Daily limit: $1,000 for instant transfers, $2,500 for scheduled transfers\n\nMonthly limit: $5,000 for instant transfers, $10,000 for scheduled transfers Truist Bank Daily limit: $2,000\n\nMonthly limit: $10,000 USAA Federal Savings Daily limit: $1,000\n\nMonthly limit: $10,000 Wells Fargo Daily limit: $3,500\n\nMonthly limit: $20,000\n\nAdditional Zelle limits\n\nThe figures listed above show the maximum amounts you can transfer. However, Zelle may impose additional restrictions depending on the type of account you have, your available balance, and your payment history. That can include weekly restrictions, in some cases.\n\nIf in doubt, check with your bank before making the transfer.\n\nCan I increase my Zelle transfer limit?\n\nSome banks may allow you to increase your limit if you can demonstrate a consistent transaction history, particularly involving the same contacts. In that case, you may be permitted to transfer higher amounts to certain people, although your overall limit for other contacts will remain unchanged.\n\nAgain, if you need to transfer an amount higher than the limit you have been set, get in touch with your bank directly.\n\nHow safe is it to send money with Zelle?\n\nIn general, Zelle is considered a secure way to send money because transactions don\u2019t require you to share confidential financial information. Even so, it\u2019s a good idea to enable authentication and monitoring features to help ensure all payments are properly authorized.\n\nThat said, Zelle is best used for sending money to people you know and trust.\n\nRelated stories\n\nGet your game on!

It is valued at a market cap of $350.6 billion.\n\nCompanies valued at $200 billion or more are generally described as \u201cmega-cap\u201d stocks and BAC fits right into that category with its market cap exceeding this threshold, underscoring its size, influence, and dominance within the diversified banks industry. BAC is capitalizing on the digital banking revolution, leveraging its robust digital platforms to expand its customer base and market share. Strategic tech investments have enabled the company to tap into the growing demand for online banking services.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nThis banking giant is currently trading 4.1% below its 52-week high of $48.08, reached on Nov. 29, 2024. Shares of BAC have declined 1.6% over the past three months, slightly lagging behind the Nasdaq Composite\u2019s ($NASX) 1.1% fall over the same time frame.\n\nNonetheless, in the longer term, BAC has rallied 34.1% over the past 52 weeks, outpacing NASX\u2019s 18.2% return. Moreover, on a YTD basis, shares of BAC are up 4.8%, compared to NASX\u2019s 2.4% decline over the same time frame.\n\nTo confirm its bullish trend, Bank of America has been trading above its 200-day moving average for the past year, and has been trading above its 50-day moving average since October 2024, with some fluctuations.\n\nOn Jan. 16, BAC shares fell nearly 1% following its Q4 earnings release, despite reporting stronger-than-expected results. The company posted a Q4 EPS of $0.82 and net revenue of $25.3 billion, reflecting a significant 134.3% year-over-year increase in earnings and a 15.4% rise in revenue.\n\nHowever, investor sentiment may have been impacted by a notable annual increase in provisions for credit losses and net charge-offs, raising concerns about credit quality. Additionally, higher adjusted non-interest expenses and management\u2019s forecast of a further 2% to 3% increase in 2025 may have further weighed on investor confidence.\n\nBank of America has lagged behind its rival, Citigroup Inc. (C), which rallied 44.3% over the past 52 weeks and 13.6% on a YTD basis.\n\nDespite BAC\u2019s recent underperformance, analysts remain highly optimistic about its prospects. The stock has a consensus rating of \u201cStrong Buy\u201d from the 23 analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $52.80 suggests a modest 14.5% premium to its current levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

Paul Nader, a Lee County SWAT sniper, prepared for action. However, the building\u2019s mirrored glass posed a problem.\n\n\u201cI see an image of myself,\u201d Nader said.\n\nWith the help of high-tech equipment, the sheriff and SWAT team got a look inside the bank, revealing hostages.\n\n\u201cI knew at that point, like if it came to a situation where I had to shoot a hostage, that I knew that I was going to be able to,\u201d Nader said.\n\nGus Rengifo was a teller at work that morning and one of the hostages. He shared his story for the first time.\n\nRengifo recalled that he had a knife to his throat.\n\nBoth men walked us through the events it took to take out a man holding two hostages, claiming to have a bomb and a gun.\n\nGetting Rengifo and the other hostage out required eyes and ears inside. Robbie the Robo-Dog played a critical role, providing crucial images.\n\n\u201cHe got very nervous as soon as the Robo-Dog comes,\u201d Rengifo said regarding the suspect.\n\nWith an agitated hostage-taker, Nader and the SWAT team moved into the lobby, taking aim.\n\n\u201cI came up on the sergeant\u2019s shoulder and started getting a sight picture. I explained to him [that] he needs to put his hand on top of his head so I can have a good play, a stable platform,\u201d Nader said.\n\nCalculating the distance between them, Nader aimed two inches higher than where he wanted the bullet to be.\n\n\u201cAnd as you see in the video, I only see the crown of his head most of the time, and in order for me to be able to get a shot that\u2019s going to end the scenario without him being able to cut somebody, I have to shoot him in a particular area,\u201d Nader said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re starting to generate a feeling that you can do this?\u201d Cifatte asked Nader.\n\n\u201cYes, I knew I could do it. I see the Dell logo there. That\u2019s the round in the middle of that monitor. That\u2019s a Dell logo. I had my crosshairs right at the top of that monitor, and as soon as he goes down, squats down a little bit, that\u2019s when I pull the trigger, and I hit him,\u201d Nader said.\n\nA single bullet ended the ordeal.\n\n\u201cI took two steps back, and I was still OK,\u201d Nader said. \u201cNo problem. I was cool, calm and collected. I just came today to do my job.\u201d\n\nThe female hostage, whose hair was blown back when the bullet hit just inches from her face, needed time to recover mentally but wasn\u2019t physically hurt.\n\nStanding side by side, Nader and Rengifo shared their stories, highlighting the importance of Rengifo\u2019s decisions while being held hostage.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t talked to him like this before, and hearing how he kept this hostage taker pushed over in our view, I look at him as way more of a hero than I am because he\u2019s the one in danger. He\u2019s the one with a knife against his throat,\u201d Nader said.\n\nBoth heroes now work together. Nader and Rengifo. CREDIT: WINK News\n\nAfter his ordeal, Rengifo left his job at Bank of America and joined the Lee County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of him as a fellow citizen and as a human. He\u2019s a rock star,\u201d Nader said.\n\nThe hostage-taker, Sterling Alavache, was killed by a single sniper bullet.\n\nSeveral others were in the bank at the time, but Alavache told most of them to leave, except for the two highlighted in this story.",

            "content": "Bank of America BAC is one of the most interest rate-sensitive among big banks. So, when the Federal Reserve lowered the interest rates by 100 basis points last year, the company\u2019s net interest income (NII) benefited from it. Fixed-rate asset repricing, higher loan balance and gradual decline in deposit costs drove the sequential increase in NII since the second quarter of 2024, which was partly offset by lower interest rates.\n\nBank of America\u2019s Net Interest Income\n\n\n\nBank of America Corp.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Bank of America Corp.\n\nThe central bank is now likely to pursue a cautious approach toward interest rate cuts because of stubborn inflation, which is expected to get further aggravated due to the imposition of potential tariffs. Economists and policymakers generally view tariffs as a factor that could drive up prices for U.S. businesses and consumers, at least in the short term, while potentially slowing economic growth over time. Moreover, some of Trump\u2019s other proposed policies\u2014including mass deportations, significant tax cuts, and deregulations\u2014have added complexity to the Fed\u2019s decision-making process as it considers the timing and scale of future interest rate cuts.\n\n\n\nBank of America is seeing an upside in NII in 2025, driven by decent loan demand, higher-for-longer interest rates, robust deposit balance and solid economic growth. The company expects a sequential rise in NII for all the quarters this year, with growth likely to accelerate in the second half of the year, and the fourth-quarter number likely to touch the $15.5-$15.7 billion level.\n\nOther Factors at Play for Bank of America\n\nBranch Expansion & Digital Initiatives: Bank of America\u2019s aggressive branch expansion across the United States as part of a broader strategy to solidify customer relationships and tap into new markets will drive NII growth over time. The company announced plans to open more than 165 new financial centers by 2026-end. This new wave of expansion follows the branch network growth plans announced by Bank of America in June 2023. The plan focused on entering nine new markets, including Omaha, Boise and Milwaukee.\n\n\n\nThe bank's strategic investment in new financial centers and push into new markets reflects a broader industry shift toward optimizing branch networks to deepen customer relationships and tap into new business opportunities. In this competitive environment, the ability to blend digital convenience with in-person expertise is expected to give Bank of America long-term leverage in the evolving banking landscape.\n\n\n\nLast year, digital interactions by BAC clients increased 12% year over year and reached a record 26 billion interactions \u201cthrough a combination of digital logins and proactive alerts.\u201d The company plans to continue strengthening its technology initiatives and spend heavily on these. These efforts help it attract and retain customers and boost cross-selling opportunities.\n\n\n\nResurgent Investment Banking (IB) Business: As global deal-making came to a grinding halt at the beginning of 2022, it weighed substantially on Bank of America\u2019s IB business. Though the company\u2019s total IB fees plunged 45.7% in 2022 and 2.4% in 2023, the trend is reversing. In 2024, the company\u2019s IB fees soared 31.4% year over year.\n\n\n\nWith the operating backdrop turning favorable for deal-making activities, global mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are expected to witness impressive growth this year. Bank of America is expected to witness growth in IB fees, driven by a healthy IB pipeline and active M&A market.\n\n\n\nFortress Balance Sheet & Solid Liquidity: Bank of America\u2019s liquidity profile remains solid. As of Dec. 31, 2024, average global liquidity sources were $953 billion. Also, the company\u2019s investment-grade long-term credit ratings of A1, A- and AA- from Moody\u2019s, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, respectively, and a stable outlook allow easy access to the debt market.\n\n\n\nBAC continues to reward shareholders handsomely. After it cleared the 2024 stress test, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 8% to 26 cents per share. In the last five years, it hiked dividends four times, with an annualized growth rate of 8.72%. Currently, the company's payout ratio is 32% of earnings.\n\n\n\nIn July 2024, the company authorized a $25 billion stock repurchase program, effective Aug. 1. As of Dec. 31, 2024, almost $18.9 worth of buyback authorization remained available.",

Analyst Alexander Perry upgraded the Elkhart, Indiana, manufacturer of iconic Airstreams to buy from neutral and bumped his price target by 14%, or $15, to $125 from his previous $110. That new target suggests shares can jump more than 25% compared to Friday's close. Thor gained 2.5% in early trading Monday. Perry sees Thor shares rebounding this year as the company expands its customer base and increases its shipments. \"We see evidence of THO recapturing market share, especially at Camping World (CWH) which hit recent lows in 2024,\" Perry wrote in a Monday note to clients. So far this year, Thor was able to reach sharper price points across towable contract manufacturing lines, with Perry estimating the company's inventory at RV dealer Camping World increased significantly in December, supporting higher shipments in its fiscal second quarter that ended Jan. 31. Shares are up about 8% this year but are coming off a tough 2024, when the stock fell 19%, according to FactSet data. Thor slumped 14% in December after missing Wall Street estimates for fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue, losing a net $1.8 million, hurt by a soft retail and wholesale environment. Management said then it anticipated a challenging second quarter but strong performance in the second half of its fiscal year ending July 31. THO 1Y mountain Thor Industries over the past year. Perry raised his earnings estimates on Thor, encouraged by improving RV sales trends and higher overall dealer optimism ahead of peak selling season, which typically occurs in late spring through summer months. \"We see signs of green shoots in the overall RV industry including lean channel inventory levels, a recent lift in the value of used units and strong recent shipment data,\" Perry said.",

Each day I focus on 3 stories that are making a difference in the financial technology space. Coupled with things worth watching & most important money movements, it\u2019s the only newsletter you need for all things when Finance meets Tech.\n\nIf you\u2019re not a subscriber, here\u2019s what you missed this week:\n\nAs for today, here are the 3 fascinating FinTech stories that were changing the world of financial technology as we know it. This was yet another insane week in the financial technology space so make sure to check all the above stories.\n\nInside JPMorgan's AI Revolution \ud83e\udd16\ud83c\udfe6\n\nFollowing the trends \ud83e\udd16 JPMorgan Chase JPM 0.00%\u2191 America's largest bank, is making a strategic bet on artificial intelligence by placing it at the center of operations for its 300,000 employees.\n\nAccording to a recent Wall Street Journal interview with Teresa Heitsenrether, JPMorgan's chief data and analytics officer who oversees the bank's AI strategy, the technology is already showing promising results across various functions.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the most interesting insights shared.\n\nMore on this \ud83d\udc49 Since its rollout, JPMorgan's AI tool called LLM Suite has been deployed to 200,000 employees, with half using it actively every day. Not too shabby!\n\nOn average, employees engage with the tool for one to two hours weekly. The system leverages generative artificial intelligence from OpenAI and other providers, helping employees across multiple business functions.\n\nHeitsenrether, who despite not being a technologist brings over 20 years of experience running key businesses at JPMorgan, identified numerous applications where AI is improving productivity. These include:\n\nStreamlining the preparation of client briefing materials\n\nAnalyzing legal documents\n\nEnhancing call center operations, and\n\nSupporting investment banking analysis.\n\nRather than developing proprietary large language models, JPMorgan is focusing on integrating existing models with the bank's internal knowledge and data.\n\nThe bank is following a three-phase approach: first, deploying tools for general use; second, connecting models to JPMorgan-specific information like policies and client data; and third, enabling more sophisticated reasoning capabilities.\n\nZoom out \ud83d\udd0e Regarding workforce implications, Heitsenrether offered a nuanced perspective. Unlike previous technological waves that primarily automated clerical tasks, AI has applications across all job functions. She emphasized that AI will augment rather than replace employees, enabling humans and AI to accomplish more together.\n\nThe bank maintains rigorous controls around AI implementation, applying different models based on risk profiles. For high-stakes decisions like credit approvals, JPMorgan employs constrained, transparent models, while using more flexible systems for lower-risk scenarios like travel planning.\n\n\u2708\ufe0f THE TAKEAWAY\n\nWhat\u2019s next? \ud83e\udd14 Looking ahead, JPMorgan's approach signals a transformative shift in how financial institutions will operate. As banks integrate AI more deeply with proprietary data, we'll likely see the emergence of financial institutions that function increasingly as technology companies with banking licenses. This evolution will create competitive differentiation based on how effectively institutions leverage their unique data assets. As Heitsenrether brilliantly put it:\n\n\"The models are all trained on all the data that's publicly available... What the models don't have access to is the data that's specific to the enterprise. That then becomes the differentiator.\"\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, this suggests customer experiences will become increasingly personalized and responsive. Digital channels empowered by AI will handle more complex inquiries that previously required human intervention, potentially reshaping branch networks and call centers. Additionally, the careful, phased rollout at JPMorgan also indicates that successful AI implementation in banking will require a deliberate balance between innovation and risk management. Financial institutions that can navigate regulatory concerns while scaling AI capabilities will likely emerge as industry leaders. Zooming out, as AI becomes more deeply embedded in financial services, we may see a new paradigm where human expertise is channeled toward higher-value activities like relationship building and complex problem-solving, with AI handling more routine aspects of financial operations across both consumer and institutional banking. AI-first banks are the future.\n\nICYMI: Wall Street giant JPMorgan continues to show strong momentum despite macro headwinds \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udfe6 [breaking down their Q4 2024 financials, what they mean & whether JPM is worth your time and money in 2025 + bonus reads on JPM inside]\n\nBank of America is poised to enter the stablecoin market \ud83d\udc40\ud83e\ude99\n\nThe news \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Banking giant Bank of America BAC 0.00%\u2191 is preparing to enter the cryptocurrency market through stablecoins once regulatory frameworks are established, according to CEO Brian Moynihan.\n\nSpeaking at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., Moynihan expressed confidence that stablecoins are imminent in the financial services industry, describing them as digital assets backed by the U.S. dollar that function similarly to money market funds with check access.\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at this and see why it matters.\n\nMore on this \ud83d\udc49 \"If they make that legal, we will go into that business,\" Moynihan stated during his interview with David Rubenstein, indicating that Bank of America would offer \"BofA coins\" linked to U.S. dollar deposit accounts once legislation permits. He noted that under the Trump administration, lawmakers are actively working to pass stablecoin regulations.\n\nWhile expressing certainty about stablecoins' arrival, Moynihan raised questions about their practical applications, commenting that \"the question of what it's useful for is going to be interesting.\"\n\nZoom out \ud83d\udd0e The stablecoin initiative reflects Bank of America's broader technology strategy, with the institution investing approximately $4 billion in new technology annually and allocating an additional $8-9 billion to maintain existing systems.\n\nThis technological focus has already yielded significant results, with 90% of customer interactions now occurring digitally and 40 million consumers using the bank's digital services.\n\nDespite this digital transformation, Moynihan emphasized that human interaction remains crucial. Bank of America maintains approximately 3,700 branches across the United States, recognizing that customers value multiple communication channels.\n\n\u2708\ufe0f THE TAKEAWAY\n\nWhat\u2019s next? \ud83e\udd14 At the core, Bank of America's potential entry into the stablecoin market represents a pivotal moment in the mainstream financial adoption of cryptocurrency technologies. As one of the largest U.S. banks (ranking 18th in the Fortune 500), BoA's move signals growing institutional confidence in blockchain-based financial products. This should lead to:\n\nMainstream legitimization : BofA's involvement would likely encourage other major financial institutions to develop similar offerings, potentially transforming stablecoins from relatively still niche products to standard financial tools.\n\nRegulatory framework development : The bank's conditional stance (\"if they make that legal\") highlights the critical role that upcoming regulations will play in shaping the stablecoin landscape. The Trump administration's crypto-friendly approach may accelerate this process.\n\nIntegration with traditional banking : Rather than competing with traditional banking, BoA's approach suggests stablecoins will be integrated into existing financial infrastructure (as they should be!), potentially offering customers the benefits of both worlds.\n\nEvolution of payment systems: BoA's stablecoin initiative could significantly impact payment processing, potentially reducing costs and increasing transaction speeds while maintaining the stability of dollar-backed assets.\n\nSlowly then all at once. Bullish.\n\nICYMI:\n\nPayPal is strategically expanding its PYUSD stablecoin \ud83e\ude99\ud83d\udcc8 [what\u2019s the play here, why it matters & what\u2019s next + bonus deep dive into PayPal]\n\nAmerican Express expands Chinese footprint \ud83d\udcb3\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3\n\nThe news \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f American Express AXP 0.00%\u2191 has formed a significant alliance with Alipay, China's digital payments giant, to accelerate its expansion in what analysts consider the world's fastest-growing card market.\n\nThe partnership enables American Express cardholders in mainland China to add their credit cards to Alipay digital wallets, substantially expanding their payment options across the country.\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at this.\n\nMore on this \ud83d\udc49 This strategic move positions American Express to capitalize on China's booming digital payments landscape at a time when global card usage is projected to surge 43% worldwide by 2029. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to experience the most dramatic growth at 46.8%, far outpacing the United States' projected 27% increase, according to research firm Nilson Report.\n\nMore importantly, the partnership represents a significant milestone in American Express's China journey. In 2020, the New York-based company became the first non-Chinese firm to receive a license to clear local currency card transactions through its own network. Before this regulatory breakthrough, American Express was required to process payments through partnerships with Chinese state-controlled entities like UnionPay.\n\nZoom out \ud83d\udd0e Other major card networks have faced varying degrees of success in China's closely regulated financial market. Mastercard MA 0.00%\u2191 received initial approval to operate in 2020 and began processing transactions in 2023 following high-level discussions between U.S. and Chinese leadership. Visa V 0.00%\u2191, despite applying for a license in 2020, continues working with Chinese authorities to secure approval.\n\nAlipay, established in 2004 as a subsidiary of Alibaba Group, claims acceptance by 80 million Chinese merchants and has expanded its digital wallet services to other Asian markets including Thailand and South Korea.\n\nHowever, we must note that the partnership comes with limitations \u2013 notably, the service is unavailable to holders of American Express cards issued outside mainland China.\n\n\u2708\ufe0f THE TAKEAWAY\n\nWhat\u2019s next? \ud83e\udd14 This alliance signals a significant shift in China's approach to international financial service providers while highlighting American Express's commitment to the Chinese market. The partnership could also serve as a blueprint for other Western financial institutions seeking to navigate China's complex regulatory environment. For AmEx, success in China represents enormous growth potential given the country's massive population and rapidly expanding middle class. However, challenges remain, including intense competition from entrenched local payment platforms and potential regulatory uncertainties. Looking ahead, American Express will likely focus on deepening its integration with China's digital ecosystem while expanding its cardholder base within mainland China. Competitors will watch closely, potentially accelerating their own partnership strategies with local technology companies.\n\nICYMI: American Express\u2019 Q4 2024: premium FinTech powerhouse poised for profitable growth \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcb3 [breaking down their Q4 2024 financials, what they tell us & what\u2019s next for AmEx + a bonus dive into their competition]\n\n\ud83d\udd0e What else I\u2019m watching\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Following the Money\n\nCredCore , a vertical-AI company that transforms debt capital markets for lenders and borrowers, today announced $16M in Series A.

It has its hands in various industry niches, like consumer and commercial banking, capital markets and investment banking, and wealth management. The business has been around for over a century, showcasing its durability.\n\nInvestors looking to put money to work in this critical sector of the economy might be focusing their attention on Bank of America. Is this top bank stock a buy, sell, or hold for your portfolio?\n\nThe case to buy and hold\n\nOne clear reason investors might consider this stock is because of Bank of America's wide economic moat. The business has developed some durable competitive strengths that minimize any chance of disruption, and that fact supports its staying power over time.\n\nOne strength is Bank of America's scale. The company generated $102 billion in revenue in 2024. And it ended the year with a whopping $3.3 trillion in assets. This massive size is beneficial because it means the business can leverage its operating expenses better than smaller rivals. What's more, investments made in marketing or digital efforts can have a bigger impact.\n\nAnother competitive edge comes from switching costs. Bank of America offers many different products and services, so it can handle a large part of a customer's financial life. These customers are less inclined to change to competitors once they become familiar and satisfied with Bank of America.\n\nThis is also a consistently profitable enterprise, something that shouldn't be overlooked. In the past five years, Bank of America's net profit margin has averaged a stellar 27.9%. Being able to produce positive net income in virtually any economic scenario is a favorable trait for any business to have.\n\nIt also allows Bank of America to pay a dividend yield of 2.34%. Plus, management is able to repurchase a lot of outstanding shares, spending $3.5 billion last quarter doing so.\n\nInvestors will take comfort knowing that Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway owns 8.9% of Bank of America's outstanding shares. There might be no one who can analyze banks better than Buffett, so this can be viewed as a stamp of approval. However, investors should also note that Berkshire Hathaway has been reducing its stake in Bank of America over the past year.\n\nBank of America's moat and profitability, coupled with the Oracle of Omaha's endorsement, are key reasons why investors might want to buy this stock. These are also factors that could keep shareholders on board to hold their positions.\n\nWhy investors should sell Bank of America\n\nIn 2024, Bank of America's net interest income declined on a year-over-year basis. This was after a huge rise in the previous two years. To me, this might demonstrate that the benefits of higher interest rates on profitability are a thing of the past. And that, in the near future, earnings gains could be muted.\n\nConsequently, because the company operates in a low-growth and cyclical industry, investors should demand a cheap valuation if they're going to buy the stock. This introduces a margin of safety that provides a cushion if economic forces trend in the wrong direction.\n\nAs of this writing, Bank of America trades at a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of more than 1.2. This is a premium to the trailing one-, three-, five-, and 10-year averages. It seems the best time to invest in a business like Bank of America is when the P/B is at a low point and when investor sentiment has taken a hit. It looks like we're way past this point.\n\nSo, I think it makes sense for investors who have benefited from the stock's rise over the past 16 months to consider selling their shares in favor of more attractive buying opportunities that they're looking at.",

            "content": "These days, everyone's getting into crypto. With the self-declared \"crypto president\" in office, the market is surging, and the public is hoping to cash in. Now, even the CEO of the second largest bank in the US wants to get into blockchain, though there's just one tiny wrinkle: it's not quite legal yet.\n\n\"It's pretty clear there's going to be a stablecoin,\" Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said in an interview on Tuesday, referring to a type of digital currency designed to mirror the value of the US dollar. \"If they make that legal, we will go into that business.\"\n\nThe Bank Holding Company Act currently restricts companies from mixing banking with commerce because of the dangers posed to the public. That probably won't stop Trump from letting banks go wild on stablecoins for long.\n\nIn his few months back in office, the president has been busy opening the floodgates on crypto with a slew of executive actions and cozy deals with crypto moguls \u2014 not to mention launching his own meme coin days before his second inauguration.\n\nOne of Trump's first moves in January was an executive order meant to protect and promote cryptocurrency for businesses. This stirred state lawmakers to draw up plans for \"strategic crypto reserves,\" while crypto platforms beg them to loosen regulations.\n\nThe returning president went so far as to designate \"PayPal Mafia\" boss David Sacks as the country's first Crypto Czar. Like Moynihan, Sacks has speculated that stablecoins could \"ensure American dollar dominance internationally, to increase the usage of the US dollars digitally as a world reserve currency.\"\n\nNevermind that the dollar is already the world's reserve currency, in an arrangement that has more to do with military intervention than the blockchain. It's also completely unclear why stablecoins are any better than cold hard cash. Not even Moynihan has any clue: \"the question of what it\u2019s useful for is going to be interesting,\" he said this week.\n\nThe moguls are just the latest in a long line of crypto-hopefuls trying to make a buck before they explain why crypto is a good idea. This desperate search for a use-case has dogged crypto since its inception, leading tech critics like Ed Zitron to argue that the crypto industry \"has fundamentally no purpose other than to continue existing.\"\n\nZitron notes that stablecoins are backed by a slurry of money, loans, and certificates, functioning more like banks than the always-reliable dollar.\n\nWhile this stuff seems stable in theory, says Zitron, in reality these stablecoins hold value due to an \"unspoken, industry-wide zealotry that says, 'we all agree this is worth this, based on a few facts and a lot of faith.'\"\n\nThat faith is often tied to the whim of crypto markets. We saw this in the collapse of Terra, a stablecoin that imploded in 2022, wiping out nearly half a trillion dollars' worth of crypto in the process.\n\nFar from stable, it turned out that Terra was heavily subsidized by Anchor, a crypto protocol that offered a whopping 19.5 percent interest rate on deposits. Once the run started, all the blockchain transparency in the world couldn't stop people from pulling money out of Terra \u2014 a major part of crypto's sales pitch.\n\n\"In any other industry, this would be exceedingly illegal,\" Zitron writes. \"Still, in crypto, this is simply the agreement \u2014 this is worth a dollar.\" Until it isn't.\n\nSo far, the crypto industry has gotten away with its antics thanks to a lack of regulation and its separation from the broader economy. But as Wall Street speculators, bank CEOs, and Crypto Czars start to merge the two into one, the ups and downs of the crypto market might soon become our own.\n\nMore on cryptocurrency: As Crypto Prices Collapse, Trump's Meme Coin Falls to Lowest Value Since Its Launch",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy Before Spring. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stands against the other stocks to buy before spring.\n\nSeasonality in the Stock Market\n\nSeasonality is simply a historical average of how the stock market performs over the course of the year. March has traditionally been a good month for equities, with prices rising more frequently than not and yielding a positive return on average. Furthermore, the first three months of spring often result in robust advances across all indexes. On the other side, because September is often a weak month for equities, a trader who generally takes long positions may choose to take the month off or sell their holdings earlier than normal if they begin to decrease during September.\n\nNaturally, there are a number of investing strategies based on seasonal trends. \u201cSell in May and Go Away\u201d is one such well-known financial aphorism that refers to a stock investment strategy based on the notion that the stock market underperforms during the six months of May to October. Historical facts have usually confirmed this adage throughout the years, particularly after 1945. Furthermore, the S&P 500 generates positive returns around two-thirds of the time from May to October, increasing to 77% from November to April.\n\nSome possibilities surrounding this phenomenon include increased Christmas purchasing, holiday-fueled optimism, and investors settling their accounts before leaving for vacation. While growth is somewhat slow in February and March, the stock market often rises in April owing to the expected publication of first-quarter reports. In contrast, the period from May to October is often less positive, with first-quarter earnings having already been released and many investors spending less time paying attention to equities while on vacation.\n\nSectors Outperforming in Spring\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s Ilan Benhamou expects that, given the backdrop of worsening economic indicators, the US stock market would plateau in early March before recovering later in the Spring. He stated:\n\n\u201cIn the short term, the situation is too chaotic, and the stock market will struggle to break through. I believe the market is stagnating. With liquidity improving, macro uncertainties easing, profits continuing to show resilience in USA businesses, losses stopping, and retail investors buying in again, I believe that in the medium term, the S&P 500 Index will rise and yields will decline.\u201d\n\nKnowing this, more than just select companies, investors would probably be more interested in knowing what sectors of the market outperform the others during the Spring season. Thankfully, CNBC already did the heavy lifting a while back. CNBC.com looked at stock performance over the past ten years and calculated the highest average gains during the spring months of March, April and May. Of all the stocks to achieve a gain of 20 percent or more, 27 percent were in the financial sector, while 21 percent were energy-oriented.\n\nIn 2024, financial stocks outperformed the market, surpassing all other sectors. Financial markets surged sharply and widely following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the 2024 presidential election. This spike was mostly driven by market confidence about a potentially more relaxed regulatory environment in 2025. Furthermore, Spring generally results in higher consumer spending as people receive tax refunds and engage in activities like home buying. This rise in spending may lead to increased loan demand and transaction volumes for banks and financial institutions.\n\nSeasonal demand has a substantial impact on energy sector performance as well. One clear explanation for good spring performance is the seasonal availability of renewable energy producing sources. Toward the end of 2024, energy sector equities had significant volatility, gaining by more than 6% in November before falling over 10% in December. The broader market\u2019s energy sector closed 2024 with a return of only 5.72%. Despite trailing the market last year, Spring may bring better fortune, as refineries ramp up gasoline output to match the expected increase in travel during the warmer months. This can lead to increased crude oil prices, which will boost the performance of energy equities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the best spring stocks, we selected some of the best financial services and energy firms with the most hedge fund investors in Q4 2024, and then ranked based on hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 113\n\nBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is a financial holding corporation that provides a wide range of services such as savings accounts, deposits, wealth and cash management, investment funds, online banking, and other financial products.\n\nThe company recorded solid profitability in the fourth quarter of 2024, with revenues of $25.3 billion, up from $22 billion in the same time the year before. Net income more than quadrupled to $6.7 billion, up from $3.1 billion the year before.\n\nTruist Securities began coverage of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) on January 7, rating the company Buy and setting a price target of $52. According to the firm\u2019s estimates, Bank of America is poised for growth, with net interest income (NII) predicted to increase by 4-5% and retail deposit growth to restart. This expected outcome marks a reversal of what was previously referred to be a \u201clost year\u201d for positive operational leverage.\n\nOverall BAC ranks 3rd on our list of the best stocks to buy before spring. While we acknowledge the potential of BAC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BAC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "In recent months, Michael Hartnett, Chief Investment Officer of Bank of America, has been warning that U.S. stocks are currently overvalued compared to non-U.S. stocks (mainly due to the large AI bubble). However, his views have not been taken seriously, as retail traders are immersed in an unprecedented surge.\n\nJust a week after the stock market hit a historic high, U.S. stocks experienced the fastest five-day decline since the outbreak of the pandemic, making risk management a hot topic again, which has drawn attention to Hartnett's latest report.\n\nHartnett believes that when the market is unanimously bearish, it is precisely a good opportunity to buy U.S. stocks, and attention should be paid to key market support levels. At the same time, he is optimistic about the potential of the Chinese stock market and believes that if Chinese retail sales accelerate, the upward momentum of the stock market may expand from the technology sector to the consumer sector.\n\n\u201cTrump Put Options\u201d Appear, Focus on Key Market Support Levels, \u201cMinister Ma\u201d Cannot Be Ignored\n\nIn his latest report, Hartnett pointed out that market sentiment has shifted from extreme optimism to caution. He believes that the key to determining when to buy U.S. stocks lies in when the market no longer views the current decline as a \u201chealthy correction.\u201d\n\nHartnett mentioned that when it comes to the long-term economic and inflation outlook for the U.S., Jerome Powell, who controls overnight interest rates, still plays a crucial role, but Elon Musk, who leads DOGE, has a more profound impact on the market:\n\nWhile Powell still controls short-term rates, Musk now controls the long end of the yield curve.\n\nFocusing on the present, Hartnett believes that to prevent the tense \u201cnew bulls\u201d from selling off, the post-election volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a key level that needs to be maintained, which are META\u2014$639, PLTR\u2014$80, QQQ\u2014$519, and SPY\u2014$597. The VWAP for Bitcoin since the election is $97,600, and failing to maintain above this level is the first sign of a bubble bursting (Tesla's VWAP is $371).\n\n_ (Note: The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) refers to the average price of a security calculated based on the volume of transactions over a specific period. It is an indicator of market trading activity and is often used to determine whether a security is undervalued or overvalued.)_\n\nIt is worth noting that the S&P 500 index closed at 5,783 points on election day, and Hartnett stated:\n\n\u201cThis is the first strike price for the \u2018Trump Put Options.\u2019 Once it falls below this price, headlines about \u2018the stock market falling under Trump\u2019s leadership\u2019 will begin to appear. After falling below this price, investors holding risk assets will be very eager and need policymakers to provide some verbal support for the market.\u201d Last Friday, the S&P 500 closed at 5,954 points.\n\nAnother indicator worth closely monitoring is IJR (U.S. Small-Cap ETF). Hartnett believes that unless it breaks through the 2021 high of $120, under the backdrop of \"Make America Great Again\" (MAGA), factors such as tariffs, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, tax cuts, deregulation, and Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, bonds are likely to outperform stocks.\n\nGlobal Investor Sentiment Shifts, China's Market Potential Emerges\n\nThe report also summarizes recent feedback from Bank of America\u2019s communications with clients in Dubai and London, noting that investors are skeptical about the S&P 500 index, viewing the European market as \"leasing\" rather than \"owning,\" while interest in long-term bonds remains as strong as in the past decade.\n\nHowever, the speed of changes in investor sentiment and narratives far outpaces position adjustments:\n\nBank of America's February global fund manager survey shows cash levels at 3.5%, the lowest since 2010, indicating that investors are leaning towards risk, but the ammunition for \"buying the dip\" is limited.\n\nMost investors prefer credit bonds over government bonds.\n\nShort positions in European stocks have been reduced through European banks, but asset allocators remain structurally bearish; since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in February 2022, for every $100 that flowed out of European stocks, only $3 has returned in the past three weeks.\n\nHartnett also pointed out that the significant decline in government trust has led to a bull market in gold. Since January 2024, out of 33 global elections, 27 have seen the ruling party ousted, with mainstream parties in the UK, Germany, and France achieving record low vote shares.\n\nHartnett believes that U.S. tech stocks are overvalued and overly held compared to Chinese tech stocks. He predicts that the market will see a massive rotation from the $16 trillion market cap of the U.S. \"Seven Giants\" to the $1 trillion market cap of China's BATX (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Xiaomi).\n\nHe also noted:",

[ Return to account summary ]\n\nHow to choose a student checking account\n\nFees An important thing to keep in mind when choosing your student checking account is the types of fees that you might encounter. While all of these checking accounts listed will have no inherent monthly fees or minimum balance requirements, there still might be some fees such as overdraft or ATM fees. User experience If you value mobile banking you'll want to find the bank that offers the best app, smartphone and web experience. Some of that comes down to personal preference or familiarity, and while all of the banks listed have mobile apps, some have more robust or specific features you might be looking for. It's also important to make sure the website is easy to use and contains any features that you would use frequently such as paying your bills or checking statements. Transferring money Another quality you might be looking for is the ease of sending and receiving money to friends and family. Chase offers Zelle which allows you to transfer money directly through the Chase app and website. Zelle has partnered with over 2,000 banks making it widely available for students.\n\nFAQs What is a student checking account? A student checking account is a checking account with special benefits, such as no monthly maintenance fees, for students enrolled in high school, college, vocational programs and other eligible educational studies. Unlike a child or teen account, student checking accounts don't require an adult co-owner. Is it worth getting a student bank account? It's definitely worth getting a student bank account if you qualify as there are generally no monthly fees associated with these accounts. Plus, banks sometimes offer welcome bonuses for new members, meaning extra cash in your pocket. How old do you have to be to open a student bank account? You generally must be between 17 and 24 years old and enrolled in high school, college or vocational programs to open a student bank account. You'll also need to provide a government-issued photo ID, Social Security number, proof of student status (i.e. a student ID) and expected graduation date. How many student bank accounts are you allowed? It is totally possible to open multiple student bank accounts. In fact, it can be smart to do so if you want to take advantage of multiple sign-up bonuses. What happens to my student bank account when I graduate? Student bank accounts will typically be automatically converted into regular checking accounts after graduating. This means that you may be subject to the usual monthly maintenance fees.\n\nBottom line\n\nStudent checking accounts are a great way for people in school to have access to a bank account with no monthly fees and low deposit requirements. Many of the top student checking accounts offer valuable perks, such as welcome bonuses, the ability to earn APY on your balance and continuing financial education options.\n\nSubscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!

Every checking account review is based on rigorous reporting by our team of expert writers and editors with extensive knowledge of banking products. While CNBC Select earns a commission from affiliate partners on many offers and links, we create all our content without input from our commercial team or any outside third parties, and we pride ourselves on our journalistic standards and ethics. See our methodology for more information on how we choose the best student checking accounts.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo determine which checking accounts provide the best place to deposit your money for students, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. checking accounts offered by online and brick-and-mortar banks, including major credit unions. We narrowed down our rankings by only considering checking accounts that charge no monthly maintenance fees for students. While the accounts we chose in this article consistently have no monthly maintenance fees for eligible students, we also compared each checking account on a range of features, including: No minimum balance requirement\n\nLow initial deposit of $0 to $50\n\nAvailable nationwide\n\nPhysical branch locations and/or online accessibility\n\nLarge ATM network\n\nEase of use and account accessibility\n\nCustomer reviews, when available All of the accounts included on this list are Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) insured up to $250,000. This insurance protects and reimburses you up to your balance and the legal limit in the event your bank or credit union fails. The rates and fee structures for checking accounts are subject to change without notice and they often fluctuate in accordance with the prime rate. Your earnings depend on any associated fees and the balance you have in your checking account. To open an account, some banks and institutions may require a deposit of new money, meaning you can't transfer money you already had in an account at that bank. However, the five accounts listed above currently don't require any deposit during account opening.

Previously, the Fed lowered the rate three times in 2024: in September, November and December. The Fed increased the rate four times in 2023 and seven times in 2022.\n\nThe changes haven\u2019t directly affected bank bonuses, but it could still be a good time to open a new bank account in case savings account interest rates fall. So you could take advantage of both a bank bonus and current APYs in a new savings account.\n\n\u00bb MORE: See what the Fed rate means for savings accounts\n\nAre bank account bonuses worth it?\n\nBank promotions can be worth the effort of opening a new account and adding money if the reward is substantial enough and the requirements aren't too difficult to meet. Before signing up for a new account to earn a bank bonus, understand the details including what fees might be incurred and how long you might have to wait for the bonus to be paid. If earning a bank sign-up bonus requires depositing more than $250,000 (which is the standard amount that\u2019s insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.), you\u2019ll need to employ certain strategies to make sure that all your money \u2014 including funds over $250,000 \u2014 is protected.\n\nOur Nerds say: \"A cash bonus is appealing, but many checking accounts don\u2019t earn interest, so you could miss out on thousands of dollars (much more than the maximum bonus) \u2014 which you could earn by putting that money in a high-yield savings account instead. \"Earning the highest bonus amount offered on this list requires at least $500,000. Depositing more than $250,000 would put you over Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. coverage limits, so you\u2019d need to consider a strategy to protect all your money.\" - Ruth Sarreal, NerdWallet banking writer\n\nCheck out more things to look out for when considering a bank sign-up bonus.\n\n\u00bb Prefer an account that offers rewards beyond a sign-up bonus?

            "content": "Bank of America Plans To Launch Stablecoin Once U.S. Legislation is Passed, CEO Says\n\nBank of America (BoA) CEO Brian Moynihan confirmed this week that the company is ready to enter the stablecoin market once U.S. lawmakers provide regulatory approval. Speaking at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., Moynihan said, \u201cIf they make that legal, we will go into that business.\u201d He compared stablecoins to money market funds or traditional bank accounts, emphasizing their potential role in financial transactions.\n\nStablecoins, digital currencies pegged to the U.S. dollar or other assets, have grown into a $232 billion market despite lacking federal regulation. Tether\u2019s USDT leads the sector with a $142 billion market cap, followed by Circle\u2019s USDC at $56 billion. While financial giants like JP Morgan have already launched their own blockchain-based payment solutions\u2014such as JPM Coin\u2014BoA has held back, waiting for a clear legal framework.\n\nRegulatory efforts are gaining momentum, particularly under the Trump administration. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott has committed to passing the GENIUS Act, a bill focused on stablecoin oversight, within the administration\u2019s first 100 days. A broader market structure bill addressing cryptocurrency regulations is also in the works. White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks recently outlined the administration\u2019s stance, confirming stablecoin legislation as a priority.\n\nSeveral bills are under consideration, including the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2024, which would allow smaller stablecoin issuers\u2014those with less than $10 billion in market cap\u2014to be regulated at the state level. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has spoken in favor of stablecoins, saying they could modernize payments and streamline international transactions.\n\nDespite the lack of regulations, private companies have already started entering the space. PayPal launched PYUSD in 2023 and plans to expand its use to 20 million merchants this year. In December, Ripple received approval from New York regulators to launch RLUSD. Meanwhile, Uber and Meta have also expressed interest in entering the stablecoin market.\n\nMoynihan has previously stated that banks will play a major role in stablecoin transactions once legal hurdles are cleared. In a CNBC interview, he hinted that BoA would integrate stablecoins into its services, enabling faster and more efficient money transfers.\n\nWhile BoA has yet to enter the market, its readiness signals a broader trend of major financial institutions embracing digital assets. If lawmakers pass stablecoin legislation, banks could compete directly with crypto firms and fintech giants, further legitimizing stablecoins as part of the financial system. For now, BoA and others are waiting for Washington to provide the green light.",

His appointment comes amid a number of senior moves at Citi Private Bank in recent weeks.\n\nCiti Private Bank has appointed Chris Biotti, a former Bank of America Private Bank senior figure, as its North America team head.\n\nBiotti, who has more than 25 years\u2019 private banking and wealth experience, worked at BoA\u2019s private bank for 13 years, most recently as Northeast division executive. In that role he oversaw seven markets and 25 offices, according to a memo from Andy Sieg, head of Citi Wealth, as seen by this publication.\n\nPreviously, Biotti held management positions in private banking for Neuberger Berman and Lehman Brothers in San Francisco. Earlier in his career, Biotti played professional ice hockey. He holds a BA from Harvard University and a JD from Suffolk University Law School. He was the executive co-sponsor for Bank of America\u2019s Massachusetts Pride LGBTQ affinity group. Biotti also serves on the board of City Year, Boston, and the Boston Board of Cradles to Crayons.\n\nBiotti will be joining Citigroup in late May. Until then, Cayman Wills is continuing as interim head of Citi Private Bank for North America.\n\nAs reported in late January, global head of Citi Private Bank, Ida Liu (pictured below), left the firm after almost 20 years at the US organisation.

He spoke about it yesterday during an interview with David Rubenstein.\n\nWhile around 30 banks worldwide are issuing or exploring stablecoins, banks tend to discuss tokenized deposits more.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s embrace of crypto and stablecoins is changing the narrative. What\u2019s notable about the Bank of America, is it has been the least active in the blockchain arena compared to its American peers.\n\nThat might mean it has less tokenized deposit baggage and is more willing to lean into stablecoins.\n\nHere\u2019s what Mr Moyniham had to say:\n\n\u201cYou have to think about three parts of this dialogue. There\u2019s a blockchain question. There\u2019s the stablecoin type of currency question. And then there\u2019s the Bitcoin and other types of things. It\u2019s pretty clear there\u2019s going to be a stablecoin which is going to be a fully dollar backed type of thing which is no different than a money market fund with check access. Is no different than a bank account really.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so if they make that legal, we\u2019ll go into that business. So you\u2019ll have a Bank of America coin and a Bank of America US dollar deposit and we\u2019ll be able to move them back and forth. Because (until) now it hasn\u2019t been legal for us to do it, but it\u2019s just then like another foreign currency. The question of what it\u2019s useful for is going to be interesting.\u201d\n\nNormally you should see a Tripetto form over here, but it needs JavaScript to run properly and it seems that is disabled in your browser. Please enable JavaScript to see and use the form.\n\nCrypto de-banking\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion about crypto firms being de-banked, with the FDIC releasing communications supporting this narrative, and the new FDIC chair reassessing that position. Mr Moyniham addressed the topic, saying regulators required banks to get permission to deal with crypto operating firms, and that permission was never forthcoming.\n\nHis discussion on that point is below (full video here).\n\nLedger Insights Research has published a report on bank-issued stablecoins and tokenized deposits featuring more than 70 projects.

The bank also has numerous types of bank account, and you could get perks such as relationship rates if you open multiple bank accounts. Chase is notably featured in our guides for the best kids savings accounts and best national banks.\n\nYou'll pay a monthly service fee if you don't meet certain account requirements. You'll also have to pay a fee if you use an out-of-network ATM.\n\nChase has over 4,700 branches throughout the continental U.S., and around 16,000 ATMs.\n\nChase Bank Review\n\nAxos Bank\n\nAxos offers five different checking accounts, all geared toward specific needs:\n\nEssential Checking (get paid two days early)\n\nRewards Checking (earn a high APY)\n\nCashBack Checking (earn up to 1% cash back on purchases)\n\nGolden Checking (age 55+)\n\nFirst Checking (ages 13-17)\n\nYou'll need at least $250 to open a high-yield savings account. Some of the options on our list do not require an initial deposit.\n\nThere are also several requirements to earn up to 3.30% APY with an Axos Bank Rewards Checking account. You'll have to meet the following criteria:\n\nEarn 0.40% APY when you receive at least $1,500 in direct deposits in a month (this requirement must be met to be eligible to earn any interest during the statement cycle, regardless of whether the other interest-earning requirements are met)\n\nEarn 0.30% APY when you make 10 Axos Visa\u00ae Debit Card transactions in a month (minimum $3 per transaction) or sign up for Account Aggregation/Personal Finance Manager (PFM) in Online Banking\n\nEarn 0.99% APY by maintaining an average daily balance of $2,500 per month in an Axos Managed Portfolios Invest Account\n\nEarn 0.99% APY by maintaining an average daily balance of $2,500 per month in an Axos Self Directed Trading Invest Account\n\nEarn 0.60% APY by using your account to make your full monthly Axos consumer loan payment\n\nAs an online-only bank, Axos doesn't have physical branches. You have free access to around 91,000 ATMs. Axos doesn't have a specific ATM network, but you can likely use one near you for free. Axos also offers generous out-of-network ATM fee reimbursements, in case you can't find a free ATM close by.\n\nAxos Bank Review\n\nDiscover Bank\n\nDiscover is a good option for people who want to do all their banking, investing, and borrowing with one institution. It offers a wide range of products, including credit cards. The bank is a good option if you want to earn cash back with your debit card \u2014 you'll earn 1% cash back on up to $3,000 in purchases per month (see website for details).\n\nYou also don't need to place an inital deposit for a checking, savings, CD, or money market account.\n\nDiscover has just one physical branch, in Delaware. You have free access to over 60,000 ATMs in the Allpoint and MoneyPass networks.\n\nDiscover Bank Review\n\nAlly\n\nAlly is one of the best online banks because it offers strong banking and investing products.\n\nYou can get a high-yield savings account, a money market account, regular CDs, a no-penalty CD, and bump-up CDs. That's more variety than most other banks have. Ally is also one of the few banks that doesn't have minimum opening deposits for any of its accounts, so you can start online banking with any amount.\n\nThe Ally Savings Account stands out in particular because it bucketing feature to help you save money for financial goals. You can create a bucket for an Emergency Fund or Travel, and then separate money in your savings for that specific goal.\n\nAlly also has one of the best investment apps for beginners . If you're looking for a robo-advisor to get started with investing, it's also a solid choice.\n\nAlly Bank Review\n\nSynchrony Bank\n\nSynchrony pays 4.00% APY on its high-yield savings account, which is great compared to other well-known banks. It doesn't require a minimum opening deposit, and there are no monthly fees. Unlike most savings accounts, it comes with an ATM card so you can easily access your savings.\n\nSynchrony only offers a high-yield savings account, CDs, and a money market account \u2014 not a checking account. If you need to transfer money from your Synchrony account to an external checking account, it could take a few business days. But keep in mind that Synchrony makes it easier to access your money than most banks without checking accounts, because it gives you an ATM card.\n\nSynchrony is an online-only bank, so it doesn't have any branches. Although it doesn't have its own ATM network, you can use ATMs in the Plus, STAR, or NYCE ATM networks for free. Synchrony also reimburses up to $5 per month for any fees charged by an out-of-network machine.\n\nSynchrony Bank Review\n\nTD Bank\n\nTD Bank is ranked third in JD Power's 2024 U.S. National Banking Satisfaction Study. Many branch locations are open seven days per week, which is great if you struggle to make it to the bank during the workday.\n\nTD Bank's ATM fees aren't necessarily higher than other banks' fees, but its fine print may affect which checking account you choose to open.\n\nJust be aware that the TD Bank Beyond Checking Account is the only TD Bank checking account that doesn't charge a fee when you non-TD Bank ATMs \u2014 and you must maintain a $2,500 balance for TD Bank to reimburse fees charged by out-of-network ATM operators.\n\nTD Bank has over 1,100 branch locations across 16 states, with about 2,600 ATMs.\n\nTD Bank Review\n\nTotalBank\n\nTotalBank is an online-only financial institution. TotalBank offers some of the best CD rates available nationwide. It offers a high APY for 3-month, 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year CDs. TotalBank CDs pay 4.11% to 4.51%APY.\n\nTotalBank also may be worth considering for a money market account, too. The TotalBank Online Money Market pays up to 4.51%APY and has no monthly service fee.\n\nTotalBank also doesn't have any other products, so it also not the best choice if you'd like to primarily bank with one financial institution. If you want to open other bank accounts \u2014 like checking accounts or savings account \u2014 or get other banking products \u2014 like loans or credit cards \u2014 consider one of our other top picks.\n\nBarclays\n\nBarclays Bank is one of the best banks for a high-yield savings account right now. Barclays Tiered Savings pays 4.15% to 4.40% APY, well above the national average.\n\nYour interest earnings will depend on your account balance.\n\nBarclays also offers some of the best CD rates for a $0 minimum opening deposit.\n\nBarclays does not have a checking account, so if this is a must for you, consider a different bank.\n\nBarclays Bank Review\n\nImportance of Choosing the Right Bank\n\nTo choose the right bank, you have to know what you want. Are you looking to open one specific bank account or do you plan to get multiple bank accounts or products? Do you prefer going to a branch and getting assistance from a banker, or would you rather use your mobile phone and computer to primarily manage your account? Are there certain principles or values you align with? Like, you might consider banking with a women-led or minority-owned bank if you are interested in these specific types of financial institutions.\n\nAlso, if you are currently unbanked because you don't have a U.S. ID, know that you have options. The top banks for immigrants and non-U.S. Citizens allow you to provide a foreign passport or Matricula Consular to open a bank account.\n\nTo help you narrow down your options, we've outlined specific features to look for in a top bank, depending on what you want out of your banking experience. (And if you're particularly looking for women-owned banks, Black-owned banks, or Hispanic-American-owned banks, we have lists of those, too.)\n\nTop Banks for Savings Accounts\n\nThe top banks for savings accounts pay competitive interest rates. The average savings account interest rate is 0.41% APY, but many banks have high-yield savings accounts which have a significantly higher APY than the national average. The top rates you can find are 5% interest savings accounts. Small banks have higher savings rates than national brands, but as you can see from our top pick Synchrony, you'll still benefit from a great interest rate regardless of whether choose a national or local institution.\n\nYou should out look out for monthly bank maintenance fees, excess transaction fees, paper statement fees, and inactivity fees. Many banks waive these fees if you meet certain criteria, and some don't charge these fees at all.\n\nBest Banks for Checking Accounts\n\nThe best financial institutions for checking accounts make it easy to access your money. You should have access to a robust ATM network. If you like in-person banking, you should look for a bank with branches nearby. If you like online banking, you should find a bank that accepts cash deposits or offers a strong mobile app so you can manage your account digitally.\n\nA good bank for checking accounts will also help you avoid common bank fees, like monthly services fees, overdraft fees, and out-of-network ATM fees. You can also find specialty checking accounts that offer additional perks like cash bonuses for new customers, interest, or cash-back debit cards.\n\nBanks with the Best Customer Service\n\nTo find the banks with the best customer service, we used information collected by the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. National Banking Satisfaction Study. The study gathered responses from nearly 11,000 banking customers from July to October 2024. It found that Capital One, Chase, and TD Bank were ranked highest in overall customer satisfaction.\n\nIf you're also looking for banks that have extended customer service hours, a bank with 24/7 customer support could also be a good fit.\n\nIt may also help to check a bank holiday schedule, so you know if a particular financial institution may be open on certain holidays when others aren't.\n\nBest Bank for an Online-Only Experience\n\nOnline banks often do not have any physical locations, but the top banks offer strong mobile and online banking so you won't miss out on going to a branch because you'll have convenient digital access to your accounts.\n\nThe best banks for online-only experience have free checking accounts and savings accounts, meaning that they don't charge any monthly service fees. Many of these top banks also won't charge any overdraft fees.\n\nBest Banks for In-Person Banking\n\nThe best brick-and-mortar banks stand out for their robust account options and services. They'll have different types of checking accounts and savings accounts to choose from, as well as home loans, credit cards, personal loans, and more so you can build your banking experience over time. These banks often also offer relationship banking, which means that you'll get perks like discounts or waived account fees for having multiple products at the bank.\n\nBrick-and-mortar banks usually charge monthly service fees and overdraft fees on their bank accounts, but the top options will give you multiple ways to waive these fees. For example, you might be able to waive fees on a checking account by maintaining a certain amount of money in your account daily or setting up a certain amount in direct deposits per month. To waive overdraft fees, you'll be able to link your checking account to a savings account, or apply for a line of credit. Fees may apply for overdraft protection, but it'll be significantly less than paying overdraft fees.\n\nDifferences Between Online Banks and Traditional Banks\n\nThe biggest difference between online banks and traditional banks is that traditional banks have physical branches, while online banks typically don't.\n\nSince online banks have fewer overhead costs, their bank accounts tend to have fewer bank fees than ones from traditional banks. You'll also find savings accounts with higher interest rates at online banks.\n\nBrick-and-mortar banks tend to have a greater variety of bank accounts and services than online banks, though. For example, brick-and-mortar banks are more likely to exchange foreign currency, or offer more CD term lengths.\n\nHow to Choose Between a Traditional and Online Bank\n\nChoosing between a traditional and online bank depends entirely on your preferences.\n\nMany national online banks have bank accounts with no monthly service fees and no overdraft fees, but you have to be OK with managing your account digitally. If you rely on a branch experience to manage your bank accounts, you might find a traditional bank is better suited for your needs. That said, if you go with a traditional bank just make sure you find bank accounts where you can waive potential bank fees.\n\nHow to Switch Banks\n\nIf you're ready to switch to a new bank, the first thing you have to do is find a new bank that's a better fit for your needs. Make sure the bank has all the accounts and services you want, and review fees to make sure that you can avoid them entirely.\n\nOnce you've settled on a bank, you can open an account at a branch, online, or by phone. Banks verify your identity whenever you're applying for a bank account, so you'll need to provide your Social Security number and a government-issued ID.\n\nYou can close your old bank account once your new bank account is approved and open. To set up a direct deposit to your new account, you'll have to update your account information with your employer. The same goes for any bills that you have set up with autopay \u2014 you'll have to update your information with the company that issues the bill.\n\nBank Trustworthiness and BBB Ratings\n\nWe review the ethics of each company so you can see if a specific financial institution aligns with your values.\n\nWe also include the settlement history of the last three years, so you're aware of any recent public controversies involving the bank.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau grades companies by looking at responses to customer complaints, advertising, and transparency about business practices.\n\nA strong BBB grade doesn't guarantee you'll have a smooth experience with a bank. You may also want to read online reviews or look into public scandals. We've also detailed any existing public issues with each bank.\n\nBrick-and-mortar banks\n\nInstitution BBB grade TD Bank D+ Chase A-\n\nTD Bank has a D+ rating because government action has been taken against the bank.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection said TD Bank had been breaking the law by charging customers for its Debit Card Advance service without their permission.\n\nIn 2023, JP Morgan Chase was also required to pay $75 million in a settlement with the U.S. Virgin Islands that accused the financial institution of failing to report suspicious activity regarding Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation.\n\nOnline banks\n\nInstitution BBB grade Axos Bank A+ Capital One 360 A+ Synchrony NR Discover A+ TotalBank A- Barclays A+\n\nSynchrony currently has an NR rating because the bank is in the process of responding to previously closed complaints.\n\nTotalBank has an A- rating from the BBB because it hasn't responded to one customer complaint.\n\nSynchrony has been involved in a few public controversies. In 2023, Synchrony was required to pay $2.6 million in a settlement when accused of calling customers about bank accounts they didn't have.\n\nIn 2024, Discover was required to pay $1 million in a settlement that claimed Discover denied Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, recipients loans because of their immigration status. In the settlement, Discover agreed to rewrite its lending rules to make DACA recipients equally eligible for loans as comparable U.S. citizens.\n\nIn 2022, Barclays paid $361 million in a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC claimed the bank distributed a high number of unregistered securities and didn't thoroughly keep track of security sales. Although Barclays settled, the bank neither confirmed nor denied these charges.\n\nBest Banks FAQs\n\nWhat are the best banks for savings accounts?

Here's what they had to say about banking online. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.)\n\nHow can someone determine whether a bank is the right fit for them?\n\nTania Brown, CFP\u00ae professional and vice president of coaching strategy at OfColor:\n\n\"Obviously, you want to make sure it's FDIC insured. Also, your banking experience \u2014 do you like walking into a bank? Well, then you need someone local. Do you just not care if you ever see your bank? Then you're okay online. Do you write checks? Do you not write checks? So it's thinking through how your experience with it is going to be before you make that decision.\"\n\nSophia Acevedo, banking editor, Business Insider:\n\n\"I would create a list of what I prioritize most in a bank account. For example, some banks have accounts that charge monthly service fees. I would look to see what the requirements are for waiving the monthly service fee and whether I think I could feasibly meet those requirements each month. If I'm searching for an interest-earning bank account I'll pay attention to interest rates. I would make sure the account pays a higher interest rate than the average bank account.\"\n\nWhat should someone look for in a brick-and-mortar bank?\n\nBrown:\n\n\"How can that bank grow with you? If you are 25, single or newly married, and all you need is a checking account, that's going to look very different 15 years from now when you may have had a couple of jobs, you may have an IRA roll over, or you may want a financial adviser.\"\n\nMykail James, MBA, certified financial education instructor, BoujieBudgets.com:\n\n\"How accessible it is. So where are the branches? And if I am to go out of town or something, how accessible is my money to me?\"\n\nAcevedo:\n\n\"With a brick-and-mortar bank, I would review all the bank accounts and make sure there are options where I can waive monthly service fees. I would also factor in the overall banking experience. For example, I would see if a bank lets you exchange foreign currency \u2014 not all do \u2014 and has a strong mobile app.\"\n\nWhat should someone look for in an online bank?\n\nRoger Ma, CFP\u00ae professional and author of \"Work Your Money, Not Your Life\":\n\n\"How onerous the transfer process is, transferring money in and transferring money out. Is it same day, next day? Is it pretty easy to sync a brick-and-mortar checking account to this particular high-yield savings account?\"\n\nJames:\n\n\"When it comes to online banks, you want to be a little bit more strict about what type of interest rates they're providing. That's the biggest thing, because online banks are supposed to have the higher interest rate because they don't have the overhead of the brick-and-mortar. You want to make sure that it's well above the national average.\n\n\"What types of securities do they provide? Do they have two-factor identification? If it's an online bank, they should definitely have \u2014 at the bare minimum \u2014 two-factor authentication in how easy it is to change your passwords and things like that, because you want to be a little more hypersensitive about the cyber security for a strictly online bank.\"\n\nOur Methodology: How We Chose the Best Banks\n\nBusiness Insider's personal finance team looked at over 200 financial institutions to find the best banks offer a wide range of products and effective customer service.\n\nBusiness Insider's personal finance team is editorially independent and we have editorial standards we follow for rating and reviewing products. Being editorially independent means our business team does not decide how we cover products and what we write about.\n\nBanks should make it easy to access your money. With a brick-and-mortar bank, we looked at banks with large branch and ATM networks. Although most online banks don't have physical branches, we chose ones with plenty of ATMs nationwide.\n\nA bank should also make it affordable to keep your money with the institution. We chose online banks that pay high rates and charge low fees, or no fees at all. Brick-and-mortar banks are known for paying lower rates and charging higher fees, but a good one should make it possible to waive monthly fees. We also looked at other types of charges, such as fees for overdrafts, using out-of-network ATMs, and foreign transactions.\n\nWe rate bank products on a scale from one to five stars. If a checking account has a rating of one star, it means the bank account requires significant improvement. It's also the lowest possible rating. If a checking account has five stars, it's considered a superior option. That's the highest rating possible.\n\nSee our bank account rating methodology to learn more about how we rate bank accounts. We score various features on a scale of zero to five. Then, calculate the weighted average to get an account's final rating, which means we weigh certain features, like interest rates and fees, at a higher weight percentage than others. We understand that these areas can more heavily impact a person's overall banking experience.\n\nIf you live in one of the following states, you can also check out our region-specific bank recommendations:\n\nSophia Acevedo Banking Editor Sophia Acevedo is a banking editor at Business Insider.

            "content": "The post-George Floyd era of the U.S. banking industry is over \u2014 unambiguously so.\n\nAfter several years when banks touted their commitments to hire more women and minorities, they are now dropping, or watering down, public mentions of such pledges.\n\nThe new posture on diversity, equity and inclusion, which coincides with the start of the second Trump administration, has been on display in the banks' latest annual reports.\n\nA year ago, many large publicly traded American banks published data in their annual reports about DEI topics, including their efforts to make their workforces less white and less male and how they were seeking to achieve pay equity. It was part of a trend that had been gaining steam following Floyd's 2020 murder and the protests it sparked.\n\nThis year's annual reports suggest that the Trump administration's hostility to DEI efforts in corporate America is having an impact on banks \u2014 at least with regard to their public messaging.\n\nWells Fargo , for example, stated a year ago that everyone at the bank \"at every level\" and \"in every role\" was expected to \"champion diversity and inclusion.\" That language was missing from the annual report the bank filed this year .\n\nThe $1.9 trillion-asset bank did continue to provide data on workplace diversity. It stated that its U.S. workforce was 51% white at the end of last year, down from 53% a year earlier.\n\nWhat follows is a look at how seven other large and regional banks have changed their DEI reporting in their annual reports. Some of them omitted discussions of diversity entirely, while others took a more nuanced approach, addressing the topic but in less detail than they did previously.\n\n\n\nM&T Bank\n\nJoe Buglewicz/Bloomberg\n\nA year ago, Buffalo, New York-based M&T reported that its recruitment team strived to create and maintain diverse representation at all levels. It said employees attended 74 \"diversity-based recruiting events\" in 2023, including gatherings focused on hiring \"people of color, veterans, LGBTQ+, individuals with disabilities and women.\"\n\nM&T also discussed the role of its chief diversity officer, pointed to data showing that 44% of its total corporate hires in 2023 were people of color, and stated that its board of directors received \"regular updates on the company's diversity, including and belonging efforts.\"\n\nAll of those specific discussions were gone from the bank's most recent report.\n\n\n\nBank of America\n\nChristopher Dilts/Bloomberg\n\nBank of America's latest report excludes a section called \"Diversity and Inclusion\" that was part of the prior year's filing.\n\nIn that earlier report, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based banking giant touted the racial, ethnic and gender diversity of its board and senior management team and said its \"practices and policies\" had\" resulted in strong representation\" across the bank, while its \"broad employee population\" mirrored \"the clients and communities\" it served.\n\nThe word \"diversity\" appeared 14 times in the prior report. \"Inclusion\" appeared 10 times.\n\nIn BofA's latest report, those words haven't entirely been erased . In the \"Human Capital\" section, the company said: \"We are deliberate about the many ways we seek to create an inclusive environment where everyone has the opportunity to achieve their career goals. This is core to our values, to our efforts to make the corporation a great place to work and to delivering on responsible growth for our clients, customers and communities around the globe.\"\n\nBank of America is also changing some of its internal policies around diversity and inclusion. It will no longer have representation goals, nor will it require a diverse slate of candidates for certain job openings, a source familiar with the situation told American Banker.\n\nBank of America is emphasizing the word \"opportunity\" instead of \"diversity,\" though CEO Brian Moynihan said Tuesday that diversity and inclusion are still part of the company.\n\n\"What we've always been is a bank of opportunity,\" Moynhian said during a meeting of the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. \"So we think about creating an opportunity for our teammates and how do we do that? We go out and hire from all areas and bring people into our company \u2026 Once they get in, the opportunity is there for a lifetime.\"\n\n\n\nCitigroup\n\nPatrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg\n\nCitigroup , which had been one of the most vocal banks on diversity and inclusion, greatly scaled back the DEI language in its most recent report.\n\nA year ago, the megabank's report included a detailed section called \"Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.\" The 550-word section covered Citi's efforts on pay equity, representation goals and the board's commitment to ensuring diversity at the highest levels of management.\n\nIn its latest report, the entire \"Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\" section was omitted. A new section, \"Pay Transparency and Pay Equity,\" was added, covering Citi's efforts to ensure that employees of different gender and racial backgrounds receive \"like for like\" compensation for similar jobs.\n\nWhile the report was largely scrubbed of diversity language, the bank did tuck in one mention of workforce diversity , saying: \" Citi's performance and the performance of its individual businesses largely depend on the talents and efforts of its diverse and highly qualified employees.\"\n\nLike Bank of America , Citi has set aside its representation goals and requirements around diverse job candidates, according to a memo last week from CEO Jane Fraser.\n\n\n\nTruist Financial\n\nScott McIntyre/Bloomberg\n\nTruist's most recent report includes tweaks around diversity-related language , but it does not entirely scrap the notion of workplace inclusion.\n\nIn the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company's prior report, it said it \"aims to provide teammates an inclusive and energizing environment that empowers teammates to learn, grow and have meaningful careers.\" It also included a \"Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\" paragraph, stating that \"inclusivity, belonging and authenticity are at the core of Truist's evolving culture\" and that \"DEI continues to play an instrumental role across this evolution.\"\n\nA chart titled \"Teammate Diversity\" showed the gender and race/ethnicity makeup of employees across all levels of the company.\n\nThat same chart appears in the latest report, but it was renamed \"Teammate Composition.\" In addition, while the \"Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\" heading from the prior year was scrapped, the idea of inclusivity was not.\n\nIn fact, the bank writes: \" Truist aspires to foster a performance-based culture that is reinforced by belonging and inclusivity \u2026 Through inclusivity, we strive for business settings where every teammate is respected, everyone matters and has a voice, and everyone feels welcome and empowered to make meaningful contributions.\"\n\n\n\nU.S. Bancorp\n\nDavid Paul Morris/Bloomberg\n\nMinneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp removed a section from its report on \"Diversity, Equity and Inclusion,\" but it also added language elsewhere about its employees respecting and valuing \"each other's differences, strengths and perspectives.\"\n\nAnd another section of the report, titled \"Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action\" and stating that the bank was committed to a diverse workforce, was unchanged.\n\nA U.S. Bancorp spokesperson said in a statement to American Banker: \"Our focus remains growing our business, providing access to opportunities and resources that individuals and organizations need to thrive financially, and supporting our employees.\"\n\n\"Diverse perspectives and experiences continue to be a core component to achieving these goals. It is important that we make the right decisions for our business to be compliant with all laws and regulations, while creating an environment where our employees and clients can succeed and feel welcomed.\"\n\n\n\nCapital One Financial\n\nJeenah Moon/Bloomberg\n\nCapital One's earlier report included a section titled \"Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging\" that was excluded from its most recent report .\n\nAlso gone were measures of workforce diversity that had previously been included, such as the fact that in the United States, among \"associates who are vice president level and above,\" roughly 34% were women and 29% were \"racially/ethnically diverse\" at the end of 2023.\n\nHowever, McLean,Virginia-based Capital One did not drop all references to its \"diversity, inclusion and belonging\" strategy this year.\n\nIts most recent report stated that the strategy is \"developed and executed in close collaboration with leaders and teams across the organization.\" The report also discussed the role of the bank's chief diversity and inclusion officer and stated that it uses \"diversity-related recruiting events.\"\n\n\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nMichael Nagle/Bloomberg\n\nMorgan Stanley also did not entirely ditch references to workforce diversity.\n\nLike last year, the Wall Street investment bank disclosed data on gender and ethnic diversity. Some 35% of its U.S. workforce was \"ethnically diverse,\" and 40% of its global workforce was women, according to its most recent report . Those percentages were unchanged from a year earlier.\n\nMorgan Stanley also referred this year to its \"commitment to diversity and inclusion,\" though it omitted certain other diversity-related language and added a new reference to \"meritocracy.\"\n\n\"Meritocracy is at the heart of Morgan Stanley's talent development,\" the bank's most recent report stated. \"We believe a workforce that represents the societies in which we live and work, and our global client base, is integral to Morgan Stanley's continued success.\"",

            "content": "Investors in Bank of America Corp (Symbol: BAC) saw new options become available today, for the April 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the BAC options chain for the new April 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $44.00 strike price has a current bid of 30 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $44.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $43.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of BAC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $44.58/share today.\n\nBecause the $44.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.68% return on the cash commitment, or 5.79% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Bank of America Corp, and highlighting in green where the $44.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $46.00 strike price has a current bid of 31 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of BAC stock at the current price level of $44.58/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $46.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.88% if the stock gets called away at the April 11th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if BAC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Bank of America Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing BAC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $46.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\nConsidering the fact that the $46.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.70% boost of extra return to the investor, or 5.91% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 31%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 36%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $44.58) to be 22%.

            "content": "Bank of America and Wells Fargo, like a number of other banks in recent weeks, have backed away from diversity, equity and inclusion mentions in their annual filings this week.\n\nWhere the \u201cDiversity and Inclusion\u201d section in Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America\u2019s 10-K was last year is instead a section in this year\u2019s filing titled \u201cTalent, Inclusion and Opportunity.\u201d It refers to the bank\u2019s approach to recruiting, hiring, employee networks and training and development, without mentioning diversity, equity or inclusion.\n\nA table breaking down workforce demographics \u2013 called \u201cDiversity Metrics\u201d in last year\u2019s filing \u2013 is referred to as \u201cWorkforce data\u201d in this year\u2019s. This year\u2019s filing does break out the share of U.S.-based employees identifying as American Indian/Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific, or \u201cTwo or More Races.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s filing mentioned a \u201cdiversity and inclusion strategy, programs, initiatives and policies,\u201d and noted the bank\u2019s \u201cGlobal Diversity and Inclusion Council, which has been in place for over 20 years, is chaired by our CEO and consists of senior executives from every line of business and region.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no mention of that council or the diversity and inclusion strategy, programs, initiatives or policies in this year\u2019s filing. A person familiar with the matter said the council is being renamed the \u201cGlobal Opportunity and Inclusion Council.\u201d BofA is also swapping out the \u201cdiversity\u201d in a \u201cdiversity and inclusion\u201d internal human resources group name, in favor of \u201copportunity and inclusion,\u201d the person said.\n\nAdditionally, the bank will no longer have aspirational DEI-related goals or require a diverse slate of candidates for open roles. Those changes at the bank, which is a government contractor, were driven by the Trump administration\u2019s DEI executive order, the person said. Those changes mirror similar moves at Citi, announced last week by CEO Jane Fraser.\n\nBank of America CEO Brian Moynihan was asked Tuesday whether the bank has a DEI policy, amid recent backlash against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives due to the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown, but the CEO didn\u2019t answer the question directly.\n\n\u201cWe have diversity and inclusion at our company,\u201d he responded at an event at The Economic Club in Washington, D.C. \u201cBut, step back: we\u2019ve always been the bank of opportunity.\u201d\n\nMoynihan\u2019s \u201copportunity\u201d mention aligns with new wording used in this year\u2019s 10-K, which forgoes diversity and inclusion mentions but asserts \u201cBank of America has always been the bank of opportunity for our shareholders, our clients and customers, our communities and our teammates.\u201d\n\nThe bank, in last year\u2019s filing, said it \u201c[reinforces] our commitment to diversity and inclusion by investing internally in our employee networks and by facilitating voluntary enterprise-wide learning and conversations about various diversity and inclusion topics. In addition, we have practices in place for attracting diverse talent, including campus recruitment.\u201d\n\nThat language is absent from this year\u2019s filing. A Bank of America spokesperson said the bank\u2019s annual report, proxy and its website provide far more detail on the bank\u2019s programs.\n\nThe BofA spokesperson also pointed to a mention in this year\u2019s filing that the bank is \u201cdeliberate about the many ways we seek to create an inclusive environment where everyone has the opportunity to achieve their career goals.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo\n\nWells Fargo, too, has cut a \u201cPromoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\u201d paragraph from this year\u2019s annual filing, as well as any mention of an annual pay equity review.\n\nThat review \u2013 which the bank had conducted with a third-party consultant \u201cfor a number of years,\u201d according to last year\u2019s filing \u2013 compared compensation of women to men globally, and U.S. minorities to U.S. non-minorities, \u201ctaking into account factors such as role, level, tenure, and geography.\u201d\n\nPerhaps more critically, the bank is dropping a 2022 policy that required that 50% or more of that job candidates interviewed for certain roles be diverse.\n\n\u201cIn light of the current environment, we have decided to discontinue the diverse slate guidelines,\u201d Wells Fargo said Wednesday in a memo seen by Bloomberg. \u201cWe remain focused on maintaining a workplace where we hire the best and most qualified people and one where everyone has equal access to opportunities to grow.\u201d\n\nThe policy had a rocky start, as roughly dozen of Wells\u2019 then-current and former employees alleged, in a New York Times report, that the bank held phony job interviews for nonwhite and female job-seekers for positions that had already been offered to other candidates. Wells Fargo paused its policy for several weeks to review and update it. The initial iteration called for a 50% diverse slate for jobs that paid $100,000 a year or more.\n\nWells Fargo asserted Wednesday it would continue to \u201csource a broad pool of candidates\u201d when recruiting.\n\nAlthough championing diversity and inclusion is no longer listed as an expectation for every employee, Wells added this line to this year\u2019s filing: \u201cWe want to be recognized as a great company for everyone by maintaining recruitment and career development practices that support our employees and provide an environment that welcomes people from different backgrounds and with different experiences.\u201d\n\nWells maintained its demographic breakdown in this year\u2019s filing: As of the end of 2024, \u201cour global workforce was 51% female and 49% male, and our U.S. workforce was 54% female and 46% male. Our U.S. workforce was 51% white, 48% racially/ethnically diverse, and 1% undeclared,\u201d this year\u2019s filing said.\n\nTruist\n\nTruist, in its latest annual filing, referred to a table breaking down workforce demographics as \u201cTeammate Composition\u201d rather than \u201cTeammate Diversity.\u201d\n\nIn last year\u2019s 10-K filing, the bank, under a section called \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion,\u201d said \u201cinclusivity, belonging, and authenticity are at the core of Truist\u2019s evolving culture,\u201d and \u201cDEI continues to play an instrumental role across this evolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cTruist\u2019s longstanding commitment to DEI thoughtfully positions the organization to lead and execute inclusively,\u201d the bank said last year.\n\nThis year, Truist said it \u201caspires to foster a performance-based culture that is reinforced by belonging and inclusivity. Furthering a sense of belonging drives our teammate mission of creating an inclusive and energizing environment that empowers teammates to learn, grow, and have meaningful careers.\u201d\n\nTruist, Wells and Bank of America join JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Morgan Stanley, Capital One and U.S. Bank among lenders that have de-emphasized mentions of DEI in annual regulatory filings made over the past two weeks.",

All of these processes can be done online.\n\nPrequalification takes less time since you won't need to provide as much information. You'll be asked about your income, assets, and how much you plan to put toward your down payment. Your credit will also be checked.\n\nWith a preapproval, the lender will request documentation showing how much you earn and what you have saved up. This will help them give you a more concrete estimate of how much you can borrow.\n\nBank of America Mortgage Rates and Fees\n\nIn our review of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data, we found that compared to other lenders, Bank of America's mortgage rates are lower than average. Its average fees are relatively low as well.\n\nOn Bank of America's website, you can explore the lender's current rates based on home price, down payment, and ZIP code.\n\nIn 2023, the average borrower getting a conventional loan from Bank of America paid $3,040 in origination charges, according to HMDA data. This is on the low end compared with other lenders.\n\nIs Bank of America a Trustworthy Mortgage Lender?\n\nOverall, we think Bank of America is a trustworthy mortgage lender. However, it has been the subject of a couple of recent government actions.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau gives Bank of America an A rating rather than an A+ due to government action regarding a consent order the bank entered into with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in July 2023. The consent order alleges that Bank of America illegally charged junk fees, withheld credit card rewards, and opened accounts without customers' consent. The CFPB again fined Bank of America in November 2023 over allegations that the bank's loan officers didn't ask mortgage applicants certain required demographic questions and instead falsely reported that applicants chose not to respond.\n\nWhat Borrowers Are Saying About Bank of America\n\nBusiness Insider looked at positive and negative customer reviews, online forums, BBB complaints, and other sources to understand what borrowers think about Bank of America's mortgage lending experience.\n\nCustomer Reviews Are Largely Positive, but Some Borrowers Have Issues With Large Lenders\n\nOverall, previous borrowers who got their mortgages from Bank of America had positive things to say about their experience. Many reviewers said that the loan officers they worked with were helpful and communicative. Some noted that Bank of America offered them great rates. This lender also ranked very high in J.D. Power's Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study, which measures customer satisfaction.\n\nBut we also saw a few complaints of poor communication, frustrating customer service, and delays in the process. Bank of America is the second-largest bank in the country, and it's also one of the largest mortgage lenders. With a larger mortgage lender, you might not always get the smoothest customer experience. This isn't always the case, and it's also possible to have a better experience with a large lender compared to a smaller, local one.\n\nIf you're worried about getting the attention you need or you want to be sure your lender takes a personalized approach to your mortgage, you might want to check out some local lenders or credit unions. But the vast majority of comments we looked at regarding the mortgage experience at Bank of America were positive.\n\nBank of America Mortgage Alternatives\n\nBank of America vs. Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation\n\nFairway Independent Mortgage Corporation is another lender that ranks high in customer satisfaction. It also has a few loan options that Bank of America doesn't, including USDA loans, reverse mortgages, and renovation loans. But unlike Bank of America, it doesn't offer a HELOC.\n\nFairway offers a $7,000 grant to first-time homebuyers in eligible areas, though you might be able to qualify for a larger amount of assistance with Bank of America. Both lenders are good options for new buyers, though Bank of America was our top pick for the best mortgage lenders for first-time buyers.\n\nFairway Independent Mortgage Corporation Review\n\nBank of America vs. Rocket Mortgage\n\nRocket Mortgage is a good choice for both first-time and repeat homebuyers. With Rocket, eligible borrowers can get a mortgage with just 1% down through its ONE+ mortgage program, or a lender credit up to $7,000 with the Purchase Plus program. It also offers up to $5,000 in closing cost assistance for renters.\n\nRocket Mortgage has a highly convenient online application and offers underwritten preapproval, which can help you stand out when you're making offers on homes. If a simple approval process is important to you, you might prefer Rocket Mortgage over Bank of America. Rocket also has home equity loans.\n\nBut Rocket's rates and fees are around average, while Bank of America has low average overall costs.\n\nRocket Mortgage Review\n\nWhy You Should Trust Us: How We Reviewed Bank of America Mortgage\n\nFor our review of Bank of America, we used our methodology for reviewing mortgage lenders.\n\nWe look at four factors \u2014 loan types, affordability, customer satisfaction, and trustworthiness \u2014 and give each a rating between 1 and 5, then we average these individual ratings for the overall lender rating.

The BBB measures trustworthiness based on response to customer complaints, honesty in advertising, and transparency about business practices.

In the first instance, the CFPB says that the bank illegally charged junk fees, withheld credit card rewards, and opened accounts without customers' consent.

His focus was on stablecoins, stating that these assets would function similarly to existing financial products.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no different than a money market fund with check access\u2026is no different than a bank account,\u201d he said.\n\nMoynihan said the vast majority of money movement is already digital, especially for large transactions between central banks, like wire transfers, ACH payments, and other electronic methods.\n\nCredit and debit cards further reinforce the shift towards a digital economy, according to BofA CEO. He noted that consumer spending is heavily digital, with Zelle, credit cards, and other digital payment methods largely outpacing cash transactions.\n\nDespite digital dominance, cash remains \u201ccritically important,\u201d Moynihan stated. Although cash usage is declining, ATMs and branches are still needed for consumers and small businesses who still use cash.\n\nThe bank currently handles substantial digital money movement, with Moynihan noting they \u201cmove three trillion dollars today digitally.\u201d He added that while physical currency remains important, 98% of bills moved globally are handled by the bank as a government service.\n\nRegarding physical currency logistics, Moynihan explained that \u201ca billion dollars of hundreds weighs a few tons\u201d and \u201ca million dollars of hundreds is a 25 foot stack,\u201d highlighting the practical advantages of digital alternatives.\n\nBofA CEO anticipates strong US bank entry into crypto payments with clear regulation\n\nLast month, Moynihan said that US banks are ready to adopt crypto payments if regulatory frameworks are established, focusing on secure, non-anonymous transactions. He also mentioned that the bank already handles most transactions digitally.\n\n\u201cIf the rules come in and make it a real thing that you can actually do business with, you will find the banking system will come in hard on the transactional side of it,\u201d he noted.\n\nMoynihan views crypto as another potential payment method alongside traditional systems and stated that the bank holds numerous blockchain patents.\n\nThe broader adoption of crypto by banks has been hindered by regulatory uncertainties, which could change with the Trump administration\u2019s pro-crypto stance.",

            "content": "Since Warren Buffett became CEO of Berkshire Hathaway in 1965, the company has delivered stellar returns for investors of nearly 20% compounded annually. For this reason, many investors like to look to Berkshire Hathaway and its investment portfolio for ideas.\n\nOver the past year, Buffett has been a net seller of stocks. This includes several bank stocks Berkshire has held for a while. One is Bank of America (BAC -0.01%), which has been a part of Berkshire's portfolio since 2011. Another is Nu Holdings (NU 1.01%), the upstart fintech company bringing banking to Latin America.\n\nDespite Berkshire's selling, these are still solid stocks to own. Here's which one is a better buy today.\n\nBank of America's balance sheet has faced scrutiny\n\nSince the second quarter, Warren Buffett and his team at Berkshire Hathaway have reduced their stake in Bank of America from around 1 billion to 680 million shares, or about a 34% reduction. Despite what has felt like relentless selling, Bank of America remains the third-largest stock in Berkshire's portfolio, with a value of $31 billion as of this writing.\n\nThe past several years have created a tricky operating environment for major banks. In 2022, the Federal Reserve began aggressively raising interest rates to contain inflationary pressures, which resulted in mixed results for Bank of America.\n\nOn one hand, the bank's net interest income rose from $43 billion to $57 billion over two years ending in 2023. On the other hand, the bank's loan portfolio, which contained lower-yielding investments, saw a dramatic increase in unrealized losses, which ballooned from $14 billion to $112 billion.\n\nThese unrealized losses have been a concern among investors. However, Bank of America has a robust deposit base spread across clients, geographies, and industries, which should prevent it from facing a run on the bank, as a few regional banks faced in spring 2023.\n\nOne positive for Bank of America is that these lower-yielding securities are running off its portfolio, freeing up capital for the bank to invest at higher interest rates. This, along with the expectation of fewer interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, has the bank projecting a record net interest income for 2025.\n\nNu Holdings is a fast-growing fintech that dominates Brazilian banking\n\nWith its digital bank business model, Nu Holdings has exploded in growth across Brazil. Today, its customer base stands at 101.8 million, or 58% of Brazil's adult population. Nu has opened up the banking system for millions across Brazil, and the company hopes to do the same in Colombia and Mexico.\n\nOne concern among investors is that the fintech's growth may be slowing. For example, credit card receivables stood at $14.6 billion at the end of last year, a modest increase from the previous year. Slower growth here could signal a shift in consumer trends or that Nu has reached saturation in Brazil, and its rapid growth phase is behind it.\n\nIn the past year, Berkshire Hathaway has slashed its position in Nu by 62% and now holds 40 million shares in the fintech.\n\nThe company is addressing this and expanding new verticals to drive future growth. In recent years, it's launched several services, including NuPay, Nu Travel, and NuMarketplace. Recently, it introduced NuCel, a mobile phone service, to diversify beyond financial services and decrease its reliance on credit to drive growth.\n\nThe fintech is growing well and has posted eight consecutive profitable quarters amid its rapid growth. Last year, the company grew its revenue by 58% to $11.5 billion. Meanwhile, its positive earnings trend continued as net income topped nearly $2 billion, up 28% from one year ago. The company continues to grow well in Mexico, with customer count up 91% year over year, and it also boasts over 1 million customers on its Marketplace platform.\n\nBetter buy: Bank of America or Nu Holdings?\n\nIf you are looking for a more stable investment, you may be drawn to Bank of America. You won't get incredibly high returns, but you will own one of the largest banks with a stable asset base and that can grow in today's interest rate environment. It's also significantly cheaper than Nu, at 1.7 times tangible book value and 14 times earnings.\n\nIf you're seeking growth and willing to take on more risk, Nu Holdings is a better buy. It's seen impressive growth across Brazil, and Mexico and Colombia are next in its sights. If its growth rate slows down or economic conditions in the region impact its business, the stock could be vulnerable to a larger decline, especially because it trades around 9.4 times tangible book value and 37 times earnings.

            "content": "About a month after President Donald Trump accused Bank of America and other big banks of political de-banking, BofA CEO Brian Moynihan offered more of a response Tuesday, blaming regulation.\n\nInterviewing Moynihan during an event at The Economic Club in Washington, D.C., David Rubenstein, the nonprofit\u2019s chairman who\u2019s also co-founder and co-chair of the Carlyle Group, wasted no time asking the bank CEO on Tuesday for his response to Trump\u2019s jab.\n\nThe president made the accusation during his virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month, asserting \u201cmany conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business ... and that included a place called Bank of America.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe bank everybody,\u201d Moynihan said Tuesday. \u201cBut the real question was about over-regulation, frankly.\u201d\n\nMoynihan pointed to interpretations of anti-money laundering, Bank Secrecy Act and know-your-customer regulations, saying \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of burden on the banking system\u201d to report suspicious activity and analyze it.\n\nBank of America sometimes has \u201cto close accounts and we can\u2019t tell people why we did it,\u201d which can create confusion, Moynihan said.\n\nHe noted de-banking has been an issue in the cryptocurrency realm, \u201cwhere the regulators said you can\u2019t bank crypto operating companies, employees of crypto companies, etc.,\u201d Moynihan said. \u201cThe operating company, they said, \u2018That\u2019s a high-risk activity, ask us for authority.\u2019 And guess what? You would have never gotten the authority.\u201d\n\nThe issue was the focus of a recent Senate Banking Committee hearing, in which lawmakers and witnesses agreed de-banking is an issue, but debated whether bank regulation or the lenders themselves are to blame.\n\nUltimately, Trump\u2019s rebuke \u201copens the dialogue about how to get these regulations correct,\u201d Moynihan said. One potential reform, he mentioned later, would be raising BSA reporting requirements for cash transactions, from the current $10,000 threshold.\n\nEarlier this month, during an investor conference appearance, Moynihan indicated he wants balance and \u201cthe right regulation.\u201d The banking industry broadly sees Trump\u2019s presidency ushering in an era of lighter regulation and a more business-friendly environment.\n\n\u201cGive us a rational regulatory structure, and have it stick to the ribs,\u201d Moynihan said Tuesday. If the pendulum keeps swinging hard in either direction following an election, clients can\u2019t depend on the bank, he contended.\n\nHe also suggested consolidation of bank regulatory agencies may be warranted.\n\n\u201cThe spaghetti chart of overlap is the question,\u201d Moynihan said, ticking off the various federal regulators that oversee the industry. Regulatory consolidation \u201cis probably more appropriate today than it was when you had 10,000, 15,000 banks,\u201d he said.\n\nRubenstein also brought up the recent backlash against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which some big banks have sought to distance themselves from amid the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on DEI. Rubenstein asked Moynihan if the bank has a DEI policy, \u201cor not anymore?\u201d\n\nMoynihan didn\u2019t answer that question directly. \u201cWe have diversity and inclusion at our company,\u201d he responded. \u201cBut, step back: we\u2019ve always been the bank of opportunity.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan Chase, Citi, Morgan Stanley, Capital One and U.S. Bank are among those that have de-emphasized mentions of DEI in their annual regulatory filings, or have decided to scrap DEI-related goals, requirements or programs.\n\nMoynihan mentioned various diversity- and inclusion-focused programs the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank has, including one that\u2019s geared toward hiring low- to moderate-income individuals.\n\n\u201cWe have a diverse team, we stress inclusion, so when you\u2019re at our company, you can be who you want to be and be successful,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother area of focus for the Trump administration is advancing digital assets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear there\u2019s going to be a stablecoin,\u201d Moynihan said. \u201cIf they make that legal, we will go into that business ... The question of what it\u2019s useful for is going to be interesting.\u201d",

Last week, Citigroup Inc. said it will no longer have \u201caspirational representation goals\u201d except as required by local law, and will abandon a policy for diversity in candidates and interview panels.\n\nLike Citigroup, Bank of America does work with the US government.

The real question was about over-regulation frankly,\u201d said Moynihan, whose comments Tuesday (Feb. 25) were reported by Bloomberg News.\n\nPresident Donald Trump publicly chastised the CEO at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month, accusing Bank of America of limiting business with certain clients.\n\n\u201cI hope you start opening your bank to conservatives, because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business with the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America,\u201d the president said.\n\nTrump also rebuked JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, alleging the same treatment of conservative customers by his bank.\n\nBoth banks, the report adds, have said they do not restrict customers based on their politics.\n\n\u201cIf you look at what has happened, it\u2019s because interpretations of anti-money-laundering, the Bank Secrecy Act, KYC \u2014 know your customers,\u201d Moynihan said. \u201cThere is a lot of burden upon the banking system to both report suspicious activity and do a lot of analysis.\u201d\n\nBanks, the Bloomberg report adds, have been criticized for shutting down customer accounts for unknown reasons. The law also requires them to report suspicious activity to regulators as a way to prevent money laundering.\n\n\u201cWe have to close accounts, and we can\u2019t tell people why we did it. And often we\u2019re told by authorities to close accounts, that creates confusion,\u201d Moynihan said Tuesday. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s about getting these regulations right. I think it opens the dialog about how we get these regulations correct.\u201d\n\nDimon made similar comments recently when he joined other CEOs for a roundtable on the \u201cdebanking\u201d issue in Washington.\n\n\u201cThe AML/Fincen rules are extraordinary, and it does cause a lot of people to be pushed out of the system because banks were afraid of being sued, fined, because if after the fact something goes wrong \u2014 coulda, woulda, shoulda \u2014 you could pay a billion dollars,\u201d Dimon told reporters.\n\nPYMNTS made the same argument after the debanking issue surfaced last year.\n\n\u201cAt the heart of the issue is potentially the lack of a clear, comprehensive regulatory framework to address the unique risks posed by the FinTech and cryptocurrency industries,\u201d that report said. \u201cFinancial institutions, tasked with navigating a labyrinth of overlapping and often contradictory rules themselves, can commonly be left with little incentive to take on high-risk clients when the compliance burden could outweigh any potential gains.\u201d",

We still have about 3,700. The reality is people want all the ways.\"\n\nMoynihan said Bank of America was among the first financial institutions to launch an app on the iPhone, recognizing early on the need to meet customers where they are.\n\n\"Back then it was an unusual thing to have an app,\" Moynihan said. \"Everybody went to websites, so that took off. From that start, we now have 40 million consumers who bank digitally with us all the time. Last year, about 90+% of our interactions with consumers were digital.\"\n\nWhile consumer preferences have undoubtedly shifted toward online banking, Moynihan said the branch isn't dead. More than nine out of ten Bank of America customer interactions are online or on mobile, but Moynihan said he realizes the important role branches still play. The chairman and CEO listed a variety of reasons why someone would prefer to walk in, from college financing to mortgages and retirement planning.\n\n\"All those things are critically important, so you have to be able to do both,\" he said.\n\nOther physical financial instruments like checks are also becoming antiquated, but are far from extinct, Moynihan said.\n\n\"The number of checks written from 2019 to now is probably down 30% to 40%, but there's still a fair amount,\" Moynihan said. \"What you see is the dollar volume written stays flat but the number written comes down.\"\n\nThe dynamic of how payments are made has evolved to be heavier on the digital side with Zelle now a huge portion of consumer transactions, but Moynihan said Bank of America still sees customers using checks for large purchases.\n\n\"Zelle didn't exist a decade ago and now is a dominant force. Our clients send more money over Zelle than total Venmos sent. It's become the dominant way,\" Moynihan said. \"That's replaced a lot of small-dollar checks, but the big-dollar checks still exist.\"\n\nLooking toward the future of finance, Moynihan told the Economic Club of D.C. that a Bank of America stablecoin could be on the horizon if the Trump administration continues its push.",

            "content": "Risks are mounting for Rivian Automotive , according to Bank of America analyst John Murphy. The analyst downgraded the electric vehicle maker to underperform from neutral and cut his price target by $3 to $10, which implies 22.9% potential downside for shares. \"RIVN remains one of the most viable among the startup EV OEMs and is making progress towards sustainably positive gross margins. However, the 2025 outlook was softer than we had expected and the VW partnership is complicating earnings forecasts for at least the next four years,\" Murphy wrote Monday in a note to clients, citing Rivian's partnership with Volkswagen to develop EVs through a joint venture. He added that competition in the EV market is increasing, with new SUVs and CUVs, or sport utility vehicles and crossover utility vehicles, set to enter the space in 2026 and 2027. Coupled with Rivian's seemingly slower-than-expected ramp of its R2 vehicle, more players in the market \"could hinder RIVN's longer-term volume trajectory,\" Murphy said. Rivian exceeded Wall Street's earnings expectations in its fourth quarter and achieved its first gross quarterly profit, a metric that includes production and sales but does not factor in other corporate expenses. However, it expects lower sales in 2025. Rivian expects another \"modest gross profit\" this year, but it is unclear when it will be profitable with all expenses factored in to its net income. Murphy expects Rivian to get hit by President Donald Trump's hostile stance toward EVs and his administration's focus on cutting costs across the federal budget. He said there could be risk to Rivian's loan of up to $6.6 billion from the U.S. Department of Energy, which was closed by the previous administration in mid-January. \"Demand for EVs is slowing and may not get much better near-term with indications that the U.S. may pull back on EV incentives,\" Murphy said. One of Trump's early promises has been to eliminate the \"electric vehicle mandate,\" or essentially revise regulations such as federal emissions standards and fuel economy requirements that motivate companies to build EVs. Earlier this month, the Trump administration paused a federal clean energy program that intended to expand the country's electric vehicle charging station network. Rivian shares are down 2.5% year to date, after climbing more than 28% over the past year on encouraging revenue growth. Shares are down 41% over the past three years.",

            "content": "Something unexpected happened to bank stock Bank of America (BAC) recently, which left a lot of people puzzled. Normally, when Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK.B) issues its 10K report, Bank of America is commonly mentioned by name. This time, however, it was not, and it drew attention. It did not, however, draw concern from investors, as Bank of America shares were up fractionally in Monday afternoon\u2019s trading.\n\nOne of the first to catch the issue, noted a CNBC report, was Jason Goldberg with Barclays. The language in the report noted \u201cWe own a small percentage of a dozen or so very large and highly profitable businesses with household names such as Apple (AAPL)\u2026\u201d and a few others. But Bank of America, despite being one of the very large and highly profitable businesses in question, was not named.\n\nThe more interesting part of the snub is that it could even be interpreted as deliberate. As part of the \u201c\u2026and the rest\u201d report, the list went alphabetically. However, it featured two names that started with A\u2014Apple was one of them\u2014and then proceeded on to a stock that started with C. It bypassed B, and thus, Bank of America, altogether. It is unclear at this moment just why Buffett bypassed Bank of America.\n\nMore Online Users\n\nBut life was about more than Warren Buffett for Bank of America, and it proved as much with a new report out. More and more users are turning to online options at the bank, as digital interactions cleared the 26 billion mark. That represented a gain of 12% against this time last year.\n\nBank of America pointed to several features, including the Erica system, the CashPro service advisor, and adoption from private bank clients. But what went unnoticed was that Bank of America closed 126 branches in 2024, reports note. That was actually enough to make it the second-highest number of bank branch closures for 2024, second only to Wells Fargo (WFG).\n\nIs BAC a Good Buy Right Now?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on BAC stock based on 18 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 37.1% rally in its share price over the past year, the average BAC price target of $53.03 per share implies 17.92% upside potential.\n\nSee more BAC analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

They do this by increasing the number of shares outstanding and proportionally reducing the price per share. For example, Nvidia's 10-for-1 split last year granted each shareholder an additional nine shares, while its price went from about $1,210 apiece to about $121.\n\nFor a stock price to climb high in the first place, it usually has to have seen significant upside.\n\n\"Stocks usually split after a consistent run of strong performance. Since 1980, companies that split have returned 28.4% annually for five years before their announcement with an average 67% return in the year before,\" the bank said in a client note authored by Jared Woodard, an investment & ETF strategist at BofA Securities.\n\nThat outperformance usually continues after the split, the bank said.\n\n\"After a split is announced, stocks have notched 25% total returns in the subsequent 12 months, compared to 12% for the broad index,\" the note continued. \"Splits in 2024 are on track to outpace historical norms, with the average stock up 17% in the 6 months after their split.\"\n\nStill, other factors are at play. If the macroeconomic picture is poor, stocks that split can still underperform. For example, as inflation soared in 2022, prompting Fed rate hikes and a bear market for the S&P 500, several stocks that split floundered.\n\n\"Companies like Amazon, Google, Tesla, and Dexcom struggled in the 12 months after splits were announced in 2022 as interest rates spiked,\" the note said. \"More recently, Super Micro Computer is down about 50% since its split announcement in August 2024.\"\n\nIn the note, the bank identified a list of stocks with share prices above $500 \u2014 the most expensive 8% of stocks \u2014 making them prime candidates to split in 2025.\n\nBelow, we've included those on the list that Bank of America has also assigned a \"Buy\" rating. Performance over the last 12 months is also included.",

The 25-year-old Southold resident doesn\u2019t have an account with a bank or credit union, so most transactions are cash exchanges: her earnings from cleaning homes, paying the monthly rent, shopping for groceries. Cano, who speaks Spanish, has not opened an account because she worries about being unable to communicate with bank employees. Yet she remains concerned about losing money or having it stolen. \"It's better to have the money in an account,\" she said through a Spanish interpreter. Thousands of people in New York are in the same predicament, in which they depend on cash, check cashing or other means outside of an account with a bank or credit union to manage their finances. But handling money this way can impede financial stability \u2014 making it expensive to access funds in the short term and potentially more challenging to secure credit and housing later on. \"A bank account is fundamental to being able to participate in and benefit from the U.S. economy,\" Keith Ernst, of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said in a podcast. Yet in New York, roughly 5% of residents were unbanked in 2023, meaning they lived in homes where no person had a checking or savings account at a financial institution such as a bank, the FDIC said in a report released in November. Another 15.4% of households in New York \u2014 roughly 8,160 \u2014 were underbanked. Those people have an account but used one of several nonbank financial services such as money orders and cash checking in the last 12 months, the agency said. Nationally, the unbanked rate was 4.2% in 2023, down from 4.5% in 2021, according to the FDIC. The change wasn't statistically significant, but it was far down from the 8.2% unbanked rate in 2011. A lack of bank accounts often costs low-income people, the FDIC said. Unbanked people are more likely to turn to pawn shop loans, money orders or check cashing services, which have fees. Moreover, the money can be stolen without recourse, whereas deposits in FDIC-insured banks are covered up to $250,000. Nationwide, nearly 78% of unbanked people don't have mainstream credit, like a credit card, student loan or auto loan, the FDIC said in the report. Without mainstream credit, a person probably doesn't have a credit score, which is often used to vet applicants for a rental or job opportunity. People remain unbanked for a variety of reasons. For some, it's the absence of neighborhood bank branches or problems with account histories, according to the FDIC\u2019s survey of roughly 30,000 households. Some of the most common reasons people in the report cited for not having a bank account were a lack of trust in banks, not having the minimum balance and fear of fees. About 42% of people without a bank account didn't have \"enough money to meet minimum balance requirements,\" the survey said, and about 30% of respondents who were very interested in an account said high bank fees was a reason they remained unbanked. For years, banks have charged what some consumer finance experts call \"junk fees.\" Those fees for overdraft and inactive accounts can pile up and leave account holders in the red, experts say. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is seeking to curb the use of overdrafts among big banks and credit unions \u2014 those with revenues that exceed $10 billion \u2014 with tighter restrictions. The move would allow banks to charge overdraft fees topped at $5, the watchdog agency said. They could also \"cap their fee at an amount that covers costs and losses\" or \"disclose the terms of their overdraft loan just like other loans.\" The regulation could save households that pay overdraft fees around $220 a year and is expected to be in place by October, the agency said. The Center for Advocacy, Support and Transformation, a nonprofit that primarily serves the North Fork and Shelter Island, hosts workshops that include financial education. Some of those who come are unbanked or underbanked, said Erica Steindl, the interim executive director of CAST. Of the people CAST serves, Steindl said language barriers are key to many foregoing a bank account. She also noted that banking might not be standard in their native country, or they might not be able to maintain a minimum balance. Still, she said those who come to CAST without a bank account face difficulties processing and receiving payments, which also causes them to struggle to get housing in a very competitive market. \u201cWhen people can\u2019t produce a personal check, that becomes an issue \u2014 another reason \u2026 not to rent,\u201d she said. Today, there are several banks, including a Flagstar Bank in Wyandanch built with the state\u2019s Banking Development District program, that seek to open branches in underserved communities in New York. The state gives banks and credit unions that build these branches advantages such as $10 million in public deposits, according to the state's website. But for years, the community had limited banking services, said former Assemb. Kimberly Jean-Pierre, whose district included part of Wyandanch. A bank in the community might have an ATM service but not a representative who could speak with a community member about other financial services, such as getting a mortgage or small business loan. Jean-Pierre, who sat on the state Assembly\u2019s banking committee, believes inadequate banking in a community and financial education helps to perpetuate high foreclosure rates in many communities of color. \u201cNot having access to a bank is detrimental to a growth of any community, the growth of any family,\u201d she said. The state\u2019s Banking Development District has helped build about 20 banks in New York, though Jean-Pierre believes there could be more on the Island and elsewhere. Another bank the district helped build on Long Island is a Flagstar Bank branch in Brentwood. \"They still need access to a banker. They still need access to ... understand how to invest money, how to refinance and how to deal with their mortgage,\" she said. There are initiatives to help more people become part of the mainstream banking system. Bank On is a partnership between banks, credit unions, FDIC and other community groups to create a certified account through the program. The accounts have standards that include debit card access and a $25 minimum or less to open an account, according to the initiative. There are also no fees for low balances, inactivity or overdrafts. Today, nearly 500 financial institutions take part in providing upward of 11 million Bank On accounts nationally as of the end of 2023, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and the initiative. David Rothstein, senior principal with the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund, the nonprofit that helped start the initiative, said continuing to reduce the number of unbanked people means getting to the hardest-to-reach families. Many of them are new Americans, have low incomes, are domestic violence survivors or are aging out of foster care, he said. Rothstein said the initiative works to reach those people through nonprofits, mayors and other entities. He said there needs to be more structural changes, like offering that unemployment assistance be deposited in a Bank On account versus a check. \"Those are the kinds of large-scale pushes and changes that are going to be needed ... if our end goal is to get to zero,\" he said. In Southold, the CAST nonprofit hosted a resource fair in January on topics such as immigration, housing and financial literacy. Bank of America representatives spoke in English and Spanish with a few dozen people, explaining how to open an account, avoid fees and other financial planning information. Cesar Morales, 73, was among the crowd. He has a bank account, but he last used it about three months ago, he said in January. Morales worries that putting away money in an account could mean he might lose it if he should have to leave the country. He also has technological issues when he tries the debit card. So, instead, he deals in cash. \"It's easier for me,\" he said through a Spanish translator. Correction: Julia Cano\u2019s name was misspelled in an earlier version of this story.\n\nFor Julia Cano, cash is king.\n\nThe 25-year-old Southold resident doesn\u2019t have an account with a bank or credit union, so most transactions are cash exchanges: her earnings from cleaning homes, paying the monthly rent, shopping for groceries.\n\nCano, who speaks Spanish, has not opened an account because she worries about being unable to communicate with bank employees. Yet she remains concerned about losing money or having it stolen.\n\n\"It's better to have the money in an account,\" she said through a Spanish interpreter.\n\nWHAT NEWSDAY FOUND In New York, roughly 5% of residents were unbanked in 2023, meaning they lived in a home where no person had access to a checking or savings account with a financial institution like a bank, a FDIC report said.\n\nwere unbanked in 2023, meaning they lived in a home where no person had access to a checking or savings account with a financial institution like a bank, a FDIC report said.

But handling money this way can impede financial stability \u2014 making it expensive to access funds in the short term and potentially more challenging to secure credit and housing later on.\n\nSign up for the NewsdayTV newsletter From breaking news to special features and documentaries, the NewsdayTV team is covering the issues that matter to you.

But if you frequently make large cash deposits or withdrawals, having a local bank branch makes things much easier.\n\nEven then, you can deposit cash into one bank account and then transfer it to a high-yield savings account at another bank. Just make sure you:\n\nAccount for the fact that transfers between different banks typically take a few business days Avoid unnecessary fees at your local bank (some charge a maintenance fee if your balance is too low, for example)\n\nIn short, there's pretty much no reason not to open a high-yield savings account.

            "content": "There's a slate of tech stocks that are well positioned ahead of earnings \u2013 and worth snapping up, according to Bank of America. The firm said that investors should take advantage of any pullback in shares of companies like Nvidia . Other buy-rated stocks include Workday , Dell and Marvell Technology. Nvidia Buy the recent dip in shares of the chip giant, the firm said. Nvidia is down more than 4% in the past month. \"The next important test for AI bulls comes on Feb-26 when NVDA reports FQ4 results,\" analyst Vivek Arya said. The analyst said that despite the stock's choppiness, he still sees a slew of positive catalysts ahead. These include \"NVDA's leading new product pipeline and TAM expansion into robotics and quantum technologies at [its] upcoming GTC [global processing unit tech] conference,\" according to Arya. The analyst said that the quarterly report should have enough earnings per share \"substance even if less sizzle.\" Marvell Technology Arya also said positive catalysts are building for Marvell. The firm is expecting solid fiscal fourth-quarter earnings results when the semiconductor company reports in early March . \"We note overall improving AI visibility into FY26/27E as the cloud capex outlook continues to increase, and MRVL's custom silicon pipeline/execution remains solid amid a fast-growing TAM [total addressable market],\" Arya wrote. The company also has a much-anticipated investor day coming up in early June, which should be a key tailwind for the stock, the firm said. Arya thinks the company could raise its near-term artificial intelligence revenues at the event. Meanwhile, shares are down 6% in 2025. \"Buy on AI share gains,\" the analyst said. Dell Analyst Wamsi Mohan is sticking with shares of Dell. \"Dell will report F4Q on Feb 27th and we believe the discussion will be focused on AI server backlog/Blackwell delays,\" he said. Blackwell is Nvidia's graphic processing unit, which Dell utilizes. Mohan acknowledged that Dell's AI server segment could be \"challenged,\" but the firm ultimately sees the issue as \"transitory.\" \"As Dell begins to deliver on the demand for AI servers and customers shift more enterprise/sovereign, revs/margins should shift higher over time,\" he wrote. The analyst did lower his price target on the stock to $150 per share from $155, but he said Dell remains well positioned for the long haul. Shares are up nearly 45% over the last 12 months. Workday \"WDAY's topline growth rate has likely bottomed at 14%, and any improvement would serve as a catalyst for the stock. We believe there are some leading indicators for a better enterprise applications spending environment, which could drive the growth higher as we move through FY26. \u2026 WDAY has a differentiated SaaS platform that leads in Human Capital Management (HCM) and is emerging as a leader in Financials.\" Marvell Technology \"Buy on AI share gains. \u2026 We note overall improving AI visibility into FY26/27E as the cloud capex outlook continues to increase, and MRVL's custom silicon pipeline/execution remains solid amid a fast-growing TAM. \u2026 We also flag the upcoming Jun-10 Investor Day as a catalyst, where MRVL could raise n-t [near term] AI target to $8bn.\" Dell \"Dell will report F4Q on Feb 27th and we believe the discussion will be focused on AI server backlog/Blackwell delays. \u2026 While the near-term set-up could be challenged on AI server revs/margins, we believe this to be transitory. As Dell begins to deliver on the demand for AI servers and customers shift more enterprise/sovereign, revs/margins should shift higher over time.\" Nvidia \"EPS could have enough substance even if less sizzle. The next important test for AI bulls comes on Feb-26 when NVDA reports FQ4 results. \u2026 The stock could be volatile post results, but we expect positive momentum to resume as investors look forward to NVDA's leading new product pipeline and TAM expansion into robotics and quantum technologies at upcoming GTC conference.\"",

            "content": "Lightspeed bills itself as offering retail software that simplifies retail operations at any scale. The company puts its innovative tools in a single system that is easy to use and can be optimized for each user\u2019s unique business\u2014an important feature in the diverse small business landscape. The tools give Lightspeed\u2019s enterprise customers access to data insights and real-time reporting necessary to boost performance across all aspects of a retail operation. And, for users, the whole platform is supported by Lightspeed\u2019s experts, who bring years of experience and 24/7 service to the benefit of their customers. Lightspeed\u2019s platform is available in versions tailored to retail and to restaurants.\n\nWe\u2019ll start in the world of online commerce, where Lightspeed operates a unified point-of-sale and payments platform and offers retailers a wide range of digital tools to manage inventory, suppliers, teams, and stores from a unified software platform. The company was founded in 2005, is trusted by users in more than 165,000 retail locations, and has made it possible for its customers to process more than $90 billion in gross transaction volume in the fiscal year 2024, which ended on March 31, 2024.\n\nBank of America\u2019s analysts are running with this theme, recommending two stocks that are down sharply in recent months \u2013 but still possess sound fundamentals that should attract investors.\n\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d the strategist added, \u201cValue factors outperformed the index by 6ppt on average vs. just 0.9ppt for Growth. Low P/E fared especially well, generating close to 10ppt of alpha over the subsequent six months.\u201d\n\n\u201cBuy cheap stocks,\u201d she advises. \u201cThe \u2018Recovery\u2019 regime unequivocally favors Value over Growth. Narrow bull markets led by growth stocks as in \u201899/\u201900 tend to reverse violently into Value leadership. Inflation came in hot, the Fed might be done as our economists forecast a month ago and Value has generally outperformed Growth in the six months after the last rate cut.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Bank of America\u2019s equity and quant strategist, Savita Subramanian, is making a strong case for sticking with value plays right now.\n\nInvestors hunting for bargains in the stock market often turn to cheap value stocks \u2013 companies trading below their intrinsic worth with the potential for solid returns. These stocks may be overlooked or undervalued due to temporary challenges, but for patient investors, they can present compelling opportunities.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLast year, Lightspeed conducted a strategic review of the company\u2019s operations, plans for the coming years, and even whether or not it should remain public or privatize. The results of that review were published earlier this month in conjunction with the fiscal 3Q25 financial results. The company has elected to remain public and to proceed with a transformation plan as the best way to maximize its value for shareholders. One key point in the recommendations from the review involves share repurchases; the review committee recommends a share repurchase program of up to $400 million.\n\nOn the financial side, Lightspeed reported slightly mixed results on revenues and earnings. The top line of $280.1 million was up 17% year-over-year, although it missed the forecast by $2.68 million. At the bottom line, the company\u2019s earnings came to 12 cents per share in non-GAAP terms, beating expectations by 2 cents.\n\nWe should note here that shares in Lightspeed have been falling in recent months, and the stock is down 28.5% from the peak it reached in November of last year. That share price decline may give investors a chance to buy, however, according to Bank of America\u2019s Koji Ikeda.\n\nThe 5-star analyst starts from that premise in his write-up on Lightspeed\u2019s stock and then goes on to look at the stock\u2019s likely forward path. He writes, \u201cWe believe the drawdown on the stock following the conclusion of its strategic review in which the company elected to stay public (announced on 2/6) has created a risk/reward too attractive to ignore. Going forward, Lightspeed is focusing on profitable growth, moving the story to adj. EBITDA generation (from revenue growth), where we see upside potential. Driving this is a renewed focus on share gains in its original two key verticals, NA retail and EMEA hospitality. We believe it has been executing its new strategy for several months.\u201d\n\nThese comments support a Buy rating on the shares, which Ikeda complements with a $20 price objective, suggesting a one-year gain of 49%. (To watch Ikeda\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThere are 16 recent Wall Street reviews on file for this stock, and their even split\u20148 to Buy, 8 to Hold\u2014gives the stock its Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares are currently priced at $13.44, and the average price target of $16.36 implies an upside of 22% for the year ahead. (See LSPD stock forecast)\n\nBunge, Ltd. (BG)\n\nNext on our list is Bunge, an agribusiness supply company with a key role in producing the world\u2019s foods and animal feeds. The company works with farmers and agricultural businesses around the world to help them produce and deliver essential food items to consumers. Bunge is a world leader in the production and processing of oilseeds, particularly soybeans, rapeseeds, canola, and sunflower seeds, as well as grains such as wheat and corn. The company is directly involved in the purchase, storage, processing, transport, sale, and distribution of agricultural commodities and serves both domestic and export customers. In addition, Bunge provides risk management and logistic services to the agricultural business community.\n\nBunge\u2019s products are found in a wide range of end uses, from cooking oils and flours to animal feeds, and from infant nutrition to plant-based meat replacements. The company works with farmers to develop efficient crop infrastructure and is a leader in the development of renewable bio-fuel solutions.\n\nThe company is based in St. Louis, Missouri, and can trace its roots as far back as 1818. Today, Bunge is a $9.8 billion company, employing more than 23,000 people in some 300 facilities spread across 40 countries around the world.\n\nBunge has an active strategy of expansion through acquisition, and earlier this year made an important advance on that track. The company received approval from the Canadian government for its merger with the fellow agribusiness giant Viterra. The merger transaction, which was initially announced in June of 2023, is set to be conducted in both stock and cash and is valued at approximately $18 billion in US currency. The move has already been approved in the US and EU, and Bunge is seeking approval from China.\n\nShares in Bunge peaked last summer, in July, and the stock is down 37% from those high levels. Headwinds have included fluctuations in the supply and demand dynamics of the agricultural sector as well as concerns the Viterra acquisition will be dilutive over the short-term. The last earnings report was disappointing too; for 4Q23, Bunge showed revenues of $13.54 billion, down 9.4% year-over-year and some $160 million below expectations. The company\u2019s bottom line, the non-GAAP EPS, came in at $2.13, missing the forecast by 12 cents per share.\n\nDespite the misses in the earnings report, BofA analyst Salvator Tiano remains sanguine about Bunge, seeing the company in a good position for long-term gains. He says of the stock, \u201cPost-earnings reset we believe BG still offers attractive risk/reward- (1) we have a favorable view of the company\u2019s growth levers, including bolt-on acquisitions (e.g., CJ Selecta potentially adding ~$0.30 to EPS) and organic investments; (2) we remain constructive on the potential Viterra acquisition despite concerns re: near-term earnings dilution; (3) we believe the company\u2019s exposure to South America positions BG well for secular growth, and (4) we view the stock\u2019s valuation (at 8.9x 2025\u2019s guide vs ADM\u2019s 10.6x) as undemanding.\u201d\n\nTiano gives BG a Buy rating, and he matches that with an $87 price objective, pointing toward a share appreciation of 22% in the next 12 months. (To watch Tiano\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nBunge has picked up six recent analyst reviews, three to Buy and three to Hold, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares have a current trading price of $71.26 and an average price target of $88.67, implying that BG will see a one-year upside of 24.5%.

David Paul Morris/Bloomberg\n\nAs questions continue to swirl about Warren Buffett's recent preference for cash, Berkshire Hathaway's chairman and CEO says he's not giving up on stocks.\n\n\"Despite what some commentators currently view as an extraordinary cash position at Berkshire, the great majority of your money remains in equities,\" Buffett wrote in his annual letter to the company's shareholders, which was published Saturday. \"That preference won't change.\"\n\nLast year, Berkshire's ownership of marketable equities fell from $354 billion to $272 billion, according to Buffett.

In some countries, this reckless practice has become habitual, and, in our country's short history, the U.S. has come close to the edge,\" he wrote.\n\nBuffett also offered some insight into why he might have soured on certain stocks, even if he didn't name any particular companies.\n\n\"With marketable equities, it is easier to change course when I make a mistake,\" he wrote. \"Additionally, with ownership of minority positions, we can't change management if that action is needed or control what is done with capital flows if we are unhappy with the decisions being made.\"\n\nBuffett's substantial retreat from bank stocks, which reinforced his reputation as a Wall Street contrarian, has sparked speculation about his motivation.\n\nLast year, Berkshire cut its stake in Capital One by 40%, its holdings in Citi by 74% and its position in Bank of America by 34%, according to public filings that show the company's positions as of Dec. 31.\n\nIn the last year, those three banks' stock prices have risen by 48%, 44% and 33%, respectively.\n\nBuffett could be selling off bank stocks to shore up cash, clean the slate for his eventual successor or just slim down Berkshire's over-exposure to specific companies, said Kevin Heal, an analyst at Argus Research Group.\n\nOmaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire may also be seeking to ensure that it has adequate dry powder if an opportunity appears, Heal told American Banker earlier this week. Berkshire has a history of swooping in and buying major positions in troubled companies or industries \u2014 including financial institutions .\n\nFor his part, Buffett has acknowledged that Berkshire holds far more cash and U.S. Treasury bills than conventional wisdom would dictate as necessary. \"Extreme fiscal conservatism is a corporate pledge we make to those who have joined us in ownership of Berkshire,\" Buffett wrote last year in a letter to shareholders.\n\n\n\nSelling when others are buying\n\nSome observers argue that now is the time to invest in bank stocks, as the prospects of deregulation, beneficial tax policies and a potential rebound in mergers under the Trump administration make 2025 a promising year for the sector.\n\nAnalysts have even been extra bullish recently on some of the very stocks Berkshire has been dumping.\n\nWells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo wrote in a January note that he thinks Citi's stock value could double in the next three years.\n\nMihir Bhatia, an analyst at Bank of America , upgraded Capital One from neutral to buy on the expectation that the company's pending acquisition of Discover Financial Services will close and boost performance.\n\nAnd Bank of America , which Berkshire bought into in 2011, still makes \"an attractive play,\" per Truist Securities analyst John McDonald in a February note. Buffett made its initial $5 billion investment in BofA when the Charlotte, North Carolina, company was on the rocks following the financial crisis.\n\nDespite shedding more than one-third of its stake in Bank of America last year, Berkshire is still the bank's largest shareholder, holding more than 680 million shares, or nearly 9% of the company.\n\n\"I don't know what exactly he's doing, because frankly, we can't ask, and we wouldn't ask,\" Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said at a conference in September.\n\nMcDonald of Truist Securities said in a note Friday that in a conversation the night before, Bank of America Chief Financial Officer Alastair Borthwick didn't have additional details to share about Buffett's sell-off of the bank's stock.\n\n\"The main question is what the pace has been so far [year-to-date] and how much longer it may potentially continue, both of which feel somewhat unclear/unknowable at the moment,\" McDonald wrote.\n\nPiper Sandler analyst Scott Siefers wrote in a note that Berkshire's rapid shedding of Bank of America could stoke investor fear that there's more to come, \"which could impede momentum a bit despite the company's good story otherwise.\"\n\n\"We cannot begin to speculate on why Berkshire might be selling,\" Siefers said, referring to the company's stake in Bank of America . \"But a glance at the firm's other changes suggests a pretty broad-based reduction in exposure to financials overall.\"\n\n\n\nStill a believer in American Express\n\nBuffett has affirmed confidence in some financial stocks, such as Ally Financial, which has been a laggard in the market, along with Visa and American Express. Buffett first invested in American Express in the 1960s, and the credit card company's success helped fuel Berkshire's runaway growth.\n\nIn his letter to shareholders last year, Buffett said he would leave Berkshire's holdings in American Express untouched throughout the year. The credit card issuer made up about 4%-5% of Berkshire's net worth at the time. Buffett wrote that Amex had been mismanaged in the past, \"but definitely not now.\"\n\n\"When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it,\" Buffett wrote, referring to Berkshire's ownership of Amex and Coca-Cola. \"Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that are inevitable.\"\n\nAt the end of 2024, Amex and Bank of America were two of Berkshire's five largest investments in equity securities, along with Coca-Cola, Apple and Chevron. That top-five list was unchanged from a year earlier.\n\nArgus' Heal speculated about one possible reason that Buffett has been holding onto its Amex stake while paring down its exposure to certain other banks. Buffett could be concerned about pockets of the economy but still have confidence in the health of high-income consumers, which comprise the bulk of Amex's business, Heal said.\n\n\"I think we're looking at \u2014 and maybe Berkshire is looking at it the same way \u2014 a dual economy, where the haves have a lot and the have-nots have nothing,\" Heal said. \"The overall U.S. economy is fine, but the low- to moderate-income folks are living paycheck to paycheck.\"\n\n\n\nAssessing the impact of climate change\n\nOne key theme in Buffett's letter Saturday was the impact of climate change on businesses. It's an issue that's particularly pressing for Berkshire, which has exposure to both the insurance industry and the energy sector.\n\n\"Property damage arising from hurricanes, tornadoes and wildfires is massive, growing and increasingly unpredictable in their patterns and eventual costs,\" Buffett wrote. \"Climate change may have been announcing its arrival.\"\n\nIn Berkshire's annual report, released Saturday, the company estimated that the January 2025 wildfires in Southern California could result in pretax losses of about $1.3 billion for its insurance group.\n\n\"It's our job to price to absorb these and unemotionally take our lumps when surprises develop,\" Buffett wrote.\n\nBut he also indicated that climate change may present certain opportunities for insurance companies. He wrote that pricing in the property-casualty insurance business strengthened last year, which he said reflected a large increase in damage from storms.\n\nBuffett, who will turn 95 in August, has recently been alluding to his mortality. \"Father Time always wins,\" he wrote in a November letter to shareholders.\n\nIn 2021, Buffett confirmed his pick to take over as CEO of Berkshire was Vice Chair Greg Abel, who is currently 62 and leads the firm's non-insurance operations.\n\nIn his letter to shareholders on Saturday, Buffett did not provide any more specific information about the company's succession timeline, but he did write: \"At 94, it won't be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO and will be writing the annual letters.\"",

The bank may ask customers to specify the reason for the payment and the medium of communication, blocking any transaction that appears risky.\n\n\u201cTo help protect you from fraud and scams, the Zelle Service should be used for payments between friends, family, and others you trust and should not be used to pay for goods from recipients with whom you are not familiar,\u201d a new notice from JP Morgan Chase explained.\n\n\u201cThe Service is not intended, and should not be used, for the purchase of goods from retailers, merchants, or the like, including on or through social media or social media marketplaces or messaging apps.\u201d\n\nHow many customers got scammed with Zelle?\n\nLast year three of America\u2019s biggest banks - JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo - were sued for failing to prevent scammers operating on Zelle. A complaint from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau accused the banks, along with Zelle, of \u201callowing fraud to fester\u201d on the online payments platform.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the banks were worried about the impact that the burgeoning system could have on the financial industry and \u201cfailed to put in place proper safeguards\u201d to protect their own customers. Without\n\nThe complaint continues: \u201cDefendants\u2019 failures resulted in millions of complaints about Zelle fraud at (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo) alone, including complaints of over $290 million in fraud losses by 210,000 Bank of America customers, over $360 million in fraud losses by 420,000 Chase customers, and over $220 million in fraud losses by 280,000 Wells Fargo customers.\u201d\n\nThe banks have rejected the accusations of malpractice in relation to the Zelle scandal, arguing that they are not responsible for the actions of scammers. JPMorgan Chase has labelled the suit a case of overreach from the CFPB.\n\n\u201cAs a last ditch effort in pursuit of their political agenda, the CFPB is now overreaching its authority by making banks accountable for criminals, even including romance scammers,\u201d JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Patricia Wexler said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s a stunning demonstration of regulation by enforcement, skirting the required rulemaking process.\u201d\n\nGet your game on!

            "content": "A few key pillars of the stock market run appear in danger of failing, putting this extended bull run in jeopardy, according to Bank of America's Michael Hartnett. Though market sentiment remains strong, money continues to flow into risk assets and the S & P 500 scored yet another record earlier this week, the bank's chief investment strategist sees some substantial danger signs lurking. In his weekly analysis of money flows, Hartnett noted that \"it's always about rates and EPS,\" or earnings per share, and there's less encouraging news there. The \"trading range for U.S. stocks [is] likely to end via lower inflation (break to upside) or weaker growth (break to downside); [President Donald] Trump unlikely to provoke H1 inflation via big tariffs/immigration cuts,\" he wrote. So while inflation may not be a near-term danger, Hartnett thinks the \"bigger risk is [an] unanticipated slowdown in growth on housing, tailwinds of wealth effect & jobs growth tailing off, inflation nagging consumer confidence, U.S. government heading into recession.\" On the final point, Hartnett in recent weeks has been warning of a slowdown in the nation's capital precipitated by Trump 's efforts to slash the size of government. Since the president has taken office, unemployment claims in Washington, D.C. , have surged. Moreover, a market run that has coincided with a splurge in government spending also could be at risk. Government outlays in 2024 were 52% higher than they were in 2019, before the Covid pandemic. Trump is looking to rein in a budget shortfall that totaled more than $1.8 trillion in 2024 and already is at $840 billion through the first four months of fiscal 2025. The deficit as a share of gross domestic product is at 6.3%, a level virtually unheard of during economic expansions and 37% higher than in 2019. While getting the U.S. fiscal house in order could alleviate some concerns in the bond market , it also has the potential to disrupt stocks. Hartnett pointed out that the \"slowdown [is] starting to be flagged by outperformance of bond-sensitives & defensive stocks (staples best performing sector past month +8%).\" Despite the dangers to the rally, investors put $16.8 billion in equities last week, the most of any asset class and enough to raise the allocation to stocks to the highest level since March 2022. Bonds saw inflows of $16.2 billion while $3.3 billion went to cash. Respondents to BofA's latest fund manager survey reported holding just 3.5% in cash as a share of assets, the lowest level since 2010.",

            "content": "Bank of America (BAC) ended the recent trading session at $45.30, demonstrating a -1.54% swing from the preceding day's closing price. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.43% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.01%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.47%.\n\nThe nation's second-largest bank's stock has climbed by 0.48% in the past month, falling short of the Finance sector's gain of 3.13% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.6%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Bank of America in its forthcoming earnings report. On that day, Bank of America is projected to report earnings of $0.81 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 2.41%. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $26.71 billion, reflecting a 3.47% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nBAC's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.69 per share and revenue of $108.38 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +12.5% and +6.37%, respectively.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Bank of America. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.23% higher. Currently, Bank of America is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn terms of valuation, Bank of America is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 12.45. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 14.89, so one might conclude that Bank of America is trading at a discount comparatively.\n\nOne should further note that BAC currently holds a PEG ratio of 1.24. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Financial - Investment Bank was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.16 at yesterday's closing price.",

            "content": "The S & P 500 is historically pricey at the moment, but the Trump administration's push for deregulation could clear a path for the market rally to continue, according to Bank of America. Equity and quantitative strategist Savita Subramanian said in a note to clients that the S & P 500 is more expensive than average based on 19 of 20 indicators tracked by her team. That includes a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22.1 \u2014 almost 40% above historical average \u2014 and an enterprise value-to-sales ratio of 3.36 \u2014 or two-thirds higher than the long-term trend, according to the note. However, there is still at least one promise of the Trump presidency that is not yet reflected in stock prices, Subramanian said. \"Policy headlines have been dominated by tariffs \u2014 perceived to be growth-negative \u2014 but a growth-positive component of Trump 2.0 is deregulation, via cost cutting and efficiency gains,\" Subramanian wrote. \"Industries that presumably stand to gain most are those that are most regulated.\" The stock groups that could get a boost from deregulation are also cheaper than the Big Tech stocks that have dominated the market over the past two years. Subramanian highlighted consumer goods, commodities, financials and transports as areas that could benefit from lighter regulation. \"We find a strong inverse relationship between the number of regulations (source: QuantGov) and forward P/E ratios \u2014 i.e., more expensive = less regulated. \u2026 And a loosening of the M & A backdrop could benefit Financials from a fee perspective while boosting returns on capital in less expensive, fragmented sectors like Staples, SMID Health Care, etc,\" Subramanian added. The financials sector has been off to a solid start in 2025, but was under pressure on Thursday. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) was down about 2% in midday trading. XLF 1D mountain Financial stocks were under pressure on Thursday after a strong start to the year. Deregulation has been touted as a priority by President Donald Trump and other members of his administration, but the exact extent of those changes are not yet clear. While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission seems more open to cryptocurrency under Trump, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice have said they will keep Biden-era rules for reviewing corporate mergers . \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.",

            "content": "Bank of America continues to close several branches across the country. In the last weeks of last year and so far in 2025, this financial institution has closed and will close locations in more than 15 states in the United States, including California, Florida, Illinois, and more.\n\nEach week, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) shares a list of bank branches that will close in the coming months and those that have already closed. Some of these bulletins include the closures of several Bank of America locations.\n\nAmong other reasons, banks decide to close or relocate certain branches because they are not profitable in the city where they are located. The rise of online banking has also contributed to branch closures, as fewer customers tend to need to take care of their banking needs in person. This doesn\u2019t mean that customers are happy when branches close as they are forced to travel longer distances or try to take care of their problems over the phone, which comes with its own challenges.\n\nComplete list of Bank of America branch closures in the United States\n\nBanks cannot close a branch overnight, as they must notify the OCC at least 90 days before the potential closure date. This notification is made through an Advance Notice of Branch Closure, which is shared by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in weekly bulletins published on their official website.\n\nAccording to OCC information, these are the Bank of America branches that have closed since December of last year and up to February 8, 2025:\n\n1200 West Osceola Parkway, Kissimmee, Florida\n\n684 Fellsway, Medford, Massachusetts\n\n6401 N.W.

Considering that the announcement of a bank closure must be made at least 90 days in advance, we can estimate that the November 2024 bulletins include information on Bank of America branches that could begin closing as of this February:\n\n9961 Manchester Road, Warson Woods, Missouri\n\n920 South Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\n4005 Route 9 North, Howell, New Jersey\n\n5626 Tavilla Circle, Naples, Florida\n\n12965 Collier Boulevard, Naples, Florida\n\n3741 Winchester Road, Memphis, Tennessee\n\n8181 West Broward Boulevard, Plantation, Florida\n\n14400 SW Allen Boulevard, Beaverton, Oregon\n\n6901 Hillcrest, Dallas, Texas\n\n16686 SW 88th Street, Miami, Florida\n\n1525 Market Street, San Francisco, California\n\n190 West Cartwright Road, Mesquite, Texas\n\n2130 Fort Worth Avenue, Dallas, Texas\n\n312 Walnut St, Cincinnati, Ohio\n\nGet your game on!

            "content": "Bank of America (BAC) closed the latest trading day at $46.01, indicating a -1.12% change from the previous session's end. The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.24% for the day. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.16%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.08%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the nation's second-largest bank had lost 0.28% over the past month. This has lagged the Finance sector's gain of 3.3% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.37% in that time.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Bank of America will be of great interest to investors. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $0.81, indicating a 2.41% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $26.71 billion, reflecting a 3.47% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $3.69 per share and a revenue of $108.38 billion, demonstrating changes of +12.5% and +6.37%, respectively, from the preceding year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Bank of America. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.23% higher within the past month. Bank of America is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nWith respect to valuation, Bank of America is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 12.59. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 14.83.\n\nOne should further note that BAC currently holds a PEG ratio of 1.26. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Financial - Investment Bank industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.09.\n\nThe Financial - Investment Bank industry is part of the Finance sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 3, finds itself in the top 2% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to use Zacks.com to monitor all these stock-influencing metrics, and more, throughout the forthcoming trading sessions.\n\nZacks' Research Chief Names \"Stock Most Likely to Double\"\n\nOur team of experts has just released the 5 stocks with the greatest probability of gaining +100% or more in the coming months. Of those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian highlights the one stock set to climb highest.\n\nThis top pick is among the most innovative financial firms.

USA TODAY\n\nMonday, Feb. 17 is Presidents Day, a federal holiday to observe the birthdays of former presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nWhile the holiday is sometimes misunderstood as a celebration of the lives and birthdays of all U.S. presidents, the holiday was initially called Washington's Birthday. It was the first federal holiday to honor an individual's birth date.\n\nWashington's birthday, Feb. 22, was designated by Congress as a holiday for all federal workers in 1885. In 1971, the Uniform Monday Holiday Law changed the date to the third Monday in February, according to the National Archives. It adds that the position of the holiday between the birthdays of Washington and Lincoln, whose birthday is Feb. 12, gave rise to the popular name of Presidents Day.\n\nWhen is Presidents Day 2025? Here's everything to know including what is open and closed\n\nWhile most restaurants, grocery stores, and retail stores will remain open on Feb. 17, that will not happen for banks, post offices, and the stock market. Visalia city offices will be closed.\n\nHere's what will be open and closed on Presidents Day in 2025.\n\nWhen is Presidents Day 2025?\n\nPresidents Day will be observed on Monday, Feb. 17 this year.\n\nIs the post office open on Presidents Day? Will mail be delivered?\n\nU.S. Postal Service post offices will be closed on Monday, Feb. 17, and mail will not be delivered, the USPS told USA TODAY. The USPS will resume regular operations on Tuesday, Feb. 18.\n\nAre banks open on Presidents Day?\n\nBecause Presidents Day is a federal holiday, branches of Capital One, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, PNC, Chase, Truist and CitiBank, among others, will be closed on Monday, Feb. 17.\n\nAre shipping services, like UPS and FedEx, open on Presidents Day?\n\nUPS pickup and delivery services are available on Feb. 17, and UPS Store locations will be open, according to the company's website.\n\nUPS SurePost and UPS Mail Innovations deliveries will require one day additional business days' time in transit due to the U.S. Postal Service being closed on the day.\n\nMost FedEx pickup and delivery services will also be available on the day, and FedEx Office locations will be open as well, according to the company's website.\n\nIs the DMV open on Presidents Day?\n\nThe California Department of Motor Vehicles offices will be closed on Presidents Day, according to the DMV\u2019s holiday calendar.\n\nDo we have school on Presidents Day?\n\nParents and students should check with their school district to determine whether their school is closed on Presidents Day.

Salesforce\u2019s focus on margin expansion through productivity improvements positions it as a compelling Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) stock in the software sector.\n\nSalesforce Inc. (CRM) is experiencing a slight dip in its stock price, currently trading at $325.22, despite positive sentiments from Bank of America (BAC) Securities. Analyst Brad Sills has reaffirmed his \u2018Buy\u2019 rating on the stock, setting an optimistic price target of $440.00. This confidence stems from Salesforce\u2019s potential to reaccelerate growth, highlighted by expectations of a solid 9% to 10% revenue increase for fiscal year 2026 and an even more robust 12% to 13% by the end of FY26.\n\nSills\u2019 positive outlook \u2013 in fact, he has highlighted CRM as a top pick \u2013 is not just based on raw numbers but on broader market trends and Salesforce\u2019s strategic initiatives. He points to an improving software spending environment which could lead to increased demand for Salesforce\u2019s services. Additionally, the introduction of Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce cycle, aimed at enhancing agent productivity and customer engagement, is expected to play a pivotal role in driving this growth. This cycle introduces new tools and methodologies that could redefine how businesses manage customer relationships, thereby expanding Salesforce\u2019s market reach and deepening its penetration within existing clients.\n\nMoreover, Salesforce has been focusing on margin expansion through productivity improvements. This focus on operational efficiency not only supports higher profitability but also makes the stock more appealing as a Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) investment. According to Sills, these efforts are turning Salesforce into a prime example of a company where investors can expect both growth and reasonable valuation, a rare combination in the software sector known for high valuations.\n\nDespite these promising aspects, the stock\u2019s current slight decline might reflect investor caution or perhaps a wait-and-see approach until more tangible results from these growth strategies materialize. The 1%-point beat in current Remaining Performance Obligation (cRPO) is commendable but hasn\u2019t yet acted as a significant catalyst for stock price movement. This might suggest that while investors acknowledge Salesforce\u2019s potential, they are looking for more concrete evidence of growth acceleration before pushing the stock price higher.\n\nBottom line, while Salesforce\u2019s shares see a minor dip, the underlying fundamentals and strategic directions outlined by BofA paint a picture of a company well-positioned for future growth. This scenario makes Salesforce a potentially attractive investment for those looking at the long-term horizon, where the company\u2019s efforts in expanding margins and leveraging new product cycles could indeed lead to significant shareholder value.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

They sold 74% of their Citigroup stake, 18% of their Capital One holding, and 54% of their Nu Holdings position. In addition, they trimmed names such as Charter Communications, Louisiana-Pacific, and T-Mobile US.\n\nThe Berkshire trio exited Ulta Beauty despite only establishing the position in the second quarter of last year. They also dumped SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, two exchange-traded funds that track the benchmark US stock index, after buying into them a few years earlier.\n\nOn the other hand, Buffett and Co. established a $1.2 billion stake in Constellation Brands, the maker of Corona and Modelo beer, and other alcoholic drinks.\n\nConstellation Brands makes Modelo beer.

            "content": "The Oracle of Omaha has shed over 352 million shares of Bank of America stock since the midpoint of 2024 in favor of a $1.1 billion stake in a brand-name, consumer-facing businesses.\n\nThough Wall Street is home to more than a dozen prominent billionaire money managers, none captivates the attention of professional and everyday investors quite like Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A 1.44%) (BRK.B 1.65%) CEO Warren Buffett.\n\nInvestors flock to the \"Oracle of Omaha\" for two reasons. First, he's crushed the benchmark S&P 500 since becoming CEO of Berkshire Hathaway six decades ago. Whereas the S&P 500 has delivered an impressive 40,633% return, including dividends, since the mid-1960s, Buffett has overseen a cumulative return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) that tops 5,815,000%, as of the closing bell on Feb. 14.\n\nSecondly, investors appreciate Buffett's candidness and open-book approach. Whether he's speaking to 40,000 people at Berkshire's annual meeting or writing his annual letter to shareholders, Berkshire's chief is willing to share the characteristics he looks for in wonderful companies.\n\nBut there are other ways to pick Warren Buffett's brain.\n\nNo later than 45 days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM) are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This filing, which was due on Feb. 14, provides a snapshot of which stocks Wall Street's brightest money managers bought and sold in the latest quarter. With Buffett overseeing nearly $299 billion in AUM at Berkshire Hathaway, his company's 13F allows investors an under-the-hood look at what he's been up to.\n\nBased on the latest filing, billionaire Warren Buffett has been on a selling spree with Berkshire's No. 3 holding, and has now established a greater-than-$1.1 billion stake in a beloved consumer brand that's skyrocketed by 7,600%, including dividends, since its initial public offering (IPO).\n\nBuffett has dumped more than 352 million shares of Bank of America\n\nAlthough no Buffett stock was sold more aggressively in 2024 than Berkshire Hathaway's top holding, Apple, money-center giant Bank of America (BAC -0.21%) isn't too far behind. Between July 17 -- a specific date we know, thanks to Form 4 filings with the SEC -- and Dec. 31, Buffett oversaw the sale of 352,618,419 shares of BofA stock, which reduced his company's position by 34%.\n\nDuring Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in May, Buffett intimated that the peak marginal corporate income tax rate was likely to climb from 21%. Therefore, he believed that locking in sizable unrealized gains at an advantageously low rate would, in hindsight, be viewed as a wise move by Berkshire's shareholders. While Buffett was specifically alluding to share sales in Apple when making this point, it's possible the selling activity in Bank of America may be nothing more than tax-based.\n\nThen again, Buffett might also have worrisome reasons for slashing more than a third of his company's stake in BofA.\n\nFor instance, Bank of America's interest rate sensitivity can be a catalyst or crutch, depending on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. When the nation's central bank increased the federal funds rate at the fastest pace in four decades from March 2022 to July 2023, none of America's largest banks by assets benefited more than BofA. But with the Fed now in the midst of a rate-easing cycle, BofA's net interest income declining at a faster pace is also a possibility.\n\nThere are valuation concerns, as well. When Buffett initially acquired $5 billion in preferred BofA stock in August 2011, Bank of America's common stock was valued at a 62% discount to book value. As of the closing bell on Feb. 14, it was valued at a 31% premium to book. Buffett is an unwavering value investor and tends to back away from great businesses if there's no longer a clear value proposition.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that Buffett has been a net seller of equities for nine consecutive quarters. While Bank of America stock is certainly pricier, relative to book, than it's been over the last decade, the stock market as a whole is at one of its priciest levels in 154 years. Berkshire's chief hasn't been shy about raising cash in an environment where value is difficult to come by.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha wants a bigger slice of this leading consumer brand\n\nDespite selling more in stocks than he's purchased for a ninth straight quarter (Oct. 1, 2022 through Dec. 31, 2024), the Oracle of Omaha has been putting his company's capital to work in a select few names. One of these top purchases is beloved consumer brand Domino's Pizza (DPZ -1.45%).\n\nAs of June 30, Buffett's company didn't hold a single share of Domino's. Six months later, when 2024 came to a close, Berkshire owned 2,382,000 shares, worth more than $1.1 billion.\n\nDomino's Pizza possesses a trait that Berkshire's chief truly appreciates: trust. More than 15 years ago, Domino's marketing campaign plainly stated that its product was subpar and laid out its plan to win back consumers. While the mea culpa approach doesn't always work, the company's transparent advertising has worked wonders. Buffett is a firm believer in strong management teams and brand-name companies that have successfully built trust with consumers over time.\n\nAnother factor that's played a critical role in the resurgence of Domino's Pizza is its innovation (both inside and out of the box). The company's \"Hungry for MORE\" initiative, which was introduced in 2023, is a five-year growth strategy that promotes new products and tech-driven operating efficiency, as well as relies on loyalty rewards and its franchisees to build up the Domino's brand. The strategy appears to be paying off, with sales growth hovering around 6% on an annual basis.\n\nThe power of the Domino's brand can also be seen in its efforts to expand internationally. The company's third-quarter operating results, released in October, point to an expected 31st consecutive year of international same-store sales growth. Domino's Pizza has a steady growth runway beyond domestic borders.\n\nLast but not least, Domino's Pizza has a healthy capital-return program, which is something Buffett often looks for in his investments. Domino's board has been increasing its base annual payout for more than a decade, and the company repurchases its own stock somewhat regularly. For companies with steady or growing net income, share buybacks can lift earnings per share (EPS) and make their stock more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.\n\nWhile Domino's Pizza isn't exactly cheap -- 27 times consensus EPS for 2025 -- Buffett understands consumer buying habits better than most investors.",

However, it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\n\nBank account features can make a positive difference in how you\u2019re able to track and save your money. Here are some significant impacts that certain bank account features can have on your savings strategy, according to the FDIC and Marc Russell writing for National Debt Relief.\n\nPlus, learn how bank services can help ease your financial stress.\n\nMonitor How Much Money You Have\n\nBanks typically issue monthly statements to their account holders. Each month, you can carefully review your statement to see exactly where your money is going. Are you spending too much on dining out, or are there lots of recurring charges for subscriptions you forgot about?\n\nOnce you take a closer look, you\u2019ll be informed about how to make adjustments that can help reduce your spending, boost your savings and help you stay out of debt.\n\nSet Spending Alerts\n\nMost banks offer spending alert features that will send you an email or a text message if your account balance drops below a certain threshold or a particular spending limit. This way, you\u2019ll be aware if you need to cut down on your spending.\n\nAdditionally, if there are any fraudulent charges, you may get notifications alerting you. This can allow you to dispute any incorrect charges and be sure you\u2019re not paying for a purchase you didn\u2019t make, saving you money.\n\nTake Advantage of Saving Buckets\n\nSome banks offer a \u201csavings bucket\u201d feature that can make it a lot easier to reach a particular savings goal faster.\n\nThe feature often works like this: You enter the goal amount and deadline to save for that goal, and your bank account should show you how much money and how often you need to save to reach the goal. Savings buckets sometimes show up as sub-accounts within your bank account, eliminating the need to make complicated spreadsheets to keep track of everything manually.",

            "content": "The time has come to invest in cheap stocks for outperformance, according to Bank of America. Over history, cheap stocks have generally tended to beat their more expensive counterparts, Bank of America's head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy Savita Subramanian said in a recent note. She added that since 1986, the bank's low forward price-to-earnings factor has beaten its high price-to-earnings factor by 4.6 percentage points each year. However, ahead of a market peak, the opposite tends to happen \u2014 that is, cheap stocks will underperform expensive ones, as they have over the past six months. But now, the market has seemingly reached an inflection point, where cheaper value stocks will fare better than growth names, Subramanian said. \"The 'Recovery' regime unequivocally favors Value over Growth. Narrow bull markets led by growth stocks as in '99/'00 tend to reverse violently into Value leadership. Inflation came in hot, the Fed might be done as our economists forecast a month ago and Value has generally outperformed Growth in the six months after the last rate cut,\" she wrote. In the same note, the strategist shared a list of Bank of America's buy-rated stocks that have low price-to-forward earnings ratios. Select stocks from the basket are shown below: One name on the list was First Solar . Shares of the solar energy equipment supplier are up about 1% in the last 12 months, and its current forward earnings yield is just 12.9%. In February, Mizuho upgraded the stock to an outperform rating from neutral. \"Our opinion on the sales outlook post-2026 has materially improved,\" wrote analyst Maheep Mandloi. \"The stock has likely underperformed YTD given negative sentiment around 45X manufacturing tax credits surviving Republican administration but, even in our base case assuming 45X expires after 2026 (1-year off-ramp), we see less pain for FSLR anyway offset by tariffs, leading to better negotiating power in 2027.\" The 45X advanced manufacturing production credit was established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. It provides a credit for the production and sale of certain solar and wind energy components, inverters and more. Mandloi raised his price target to $259, up from his previous estimate of $218. This implies a roughly 62% potential upside ahead for the stock. Pharmacy retail stock CVS Health boasts a forward earnings yield of just 10.7%. The stock is down nearly 14% in the past 12 months. However, its strong fourth-quarter earnings report propelled shares to a weekly gain of nearly 22%. Following its latest quarterly results, Cantor Fitzgerald upgraded shares to an overweight rating from neutral. Analyst Sarah James also upped her price target to $71 from $62. This updated forecast is nearly 8% above where shares closed on Friday. James wrote that she decided to upgrade the stock \"on increased confidence in a successful turnaround now that we have proof-of-concept cost trends returned to predictable patterns, and 2025 bids should be sufficient to drive margin expansion.\" The analyst added that the sweeping changes CVS has recently made to its executive team, like hiring CEO David Joyner in October, has also increased her optimism for the company's future. \" We believe CVS has the right team in place to execute the turnaround of Aetna and navigate a challenging environment on the regulatory and retail front,\" she said. Shares of Charter Communications have surged 25% in the last year. The telecommunications stock's current forward earnings yield is 10.7%. In December, KeyBanc analyst Brandon Nispel upgraded the stock to an overweight rating from sector weight. Nispel's price target of $500 corresponds to roughly 39% upside for shares of Charter Communications. \"Excluding ACP, we think CHTR should have modestly better underlying Broadband subscriber trends in '25 vs. '24, and see Rural net adds accelerating,\" he wrote, referring to the Affordable Connectivity Program , which ended last June and affected a swath of Charter clients. \"We think cost efficiency is under-appreciated, [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization] should grow.\"",

While the broader financial sector is expected to continue its upward trajectory, certain stocks within the group appear even better positioned for growth. The broader market\u2019s financial sector has climbed nearly 30% this year, surpassing the overall market and even outperforming the technology sector, which includes many of the high-profile mega-cap tech stocks. The financial index is up by over 7% since the start of 2025.\n\nThe US banking sector continued to expand in the third quarter of 2024, despite sluggish loan growth. The industry saw a 1.4% sequential increase in total assets during the period. Collectively, the 50 largest US banks added $377.22 billion in aggregate assets during the third quarter, with 35 institutions reporting growth, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. This marked a turnaround from the second quarter when the top 50 banks saw a combined decline of $128.01 billion from the first quarter of the year. The report further mentioned that as of September 30, the total assets of the 50 largest US banks stood at $23.985 trillion. Among the 39 banks with assets ranging from $50 billion to $500 billion, 25 recorded an increase in assets during the third quarter.\n\nAlso read: 10 Low PE High Dividend Stocks to Buy Now\n\nFinancial stocks experienced a sharp and widespread rally following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the 2024 presidential election. This surge was largely fueled by market optimism surrounding a potentially more relaxed regulatory environment in 2025, particularly in relation to mergers and acquisitions. In November, the median total return for the 211 banks tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence climbed to 13.4%, significantly outpacing the broader market\u2019s 5.9% gain.\n\nAnother key factor influencing bank performance was the Federal Reserve\u2019s release of parameters for its annual industry stress test. The 2025 test outlined less severe economic shocks than previous years, although it still projected a rise in U.S. unemployment to 10% and a 33% decline in home prices. Compared to prior tests, the latest scenario included milder increases in joblessness and less drastic drops in stock and real estate values. Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg emphasized these adjustments in his report, \u201c2025 Stress Test: Scenarios Easier than Past Two Years.\u201d Meanwhile, Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala suggested that the test\u2019s reduced stringency and greater predictability could lead banks to hold smaller capital buffers later in the year.\n\nThe financial sector is cyclical, meaning its performance is closely tied to the overall health of the economy. The US economy has maintained steady momentum, increasing the likelihood of a \u201csoft landing\u201d\u2014a scenario that would help ease concerns about a potential mild recession that could weigh on financial stocks. According to analysts, a key shift heading into 2025 compared to previous years is the outlook for interest rates. The second half of 2024 marked the start of a new rate cycle, with the Federal Reserve implementing its first rate cut since the early stages of the pandemic. For banks, interest rate changes present both opportunities and challenges. While higher rates can boost net interest margins, rate fluctuations can also impact lending activity and overall profitability.\n\nInvestor enthusiasm for financial stocks is on the rise, driven in large part by their appealing dividend payouts. According to a report by Janus Henderson, the financial sector saw headline growth of 7.7% growth in dividend payouts on a YoY basis. The report also mentioned that the industry paid $72 billion in dividends in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and identified dividend stocks from the finance sector. These companies offer a wide range of financial services, including banking, insurance, investment management, and financial planning. The stocks mentioned below also offer stable dividend yields. From the resultant list, we picked 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked them in ascending order of hedge funds\u2019 sentiment towards them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

            "content": "The Zelle logo is displayed on a smartphone screen. (Nikolas Kokovlis / Associated Press)\n\nWells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America are being sued by the embattled Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over alleged unchecked fraud on the Zelle payment app \u2014 setting up a legal showdown that the incoming Trump administration could quash as soon as next month.\n\nThe three financial institutions, which co-own the app along with four other large banks, were accused in a lawsuit filed Friday of rushing to launch the service in 2017 to compete with popular payment apps such as Venmo without putting in place proper consumer safeguards. The result, according to the lawsuit, was fraud-related losses of more than $870 million over the last seven years.\n\n\"Zelle became a gold mine for fraudsters, while often leaving victims to fend for themselves,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said.\n\nThe 91-page federal lawsuit, which seeks an injunction to prevent future violations of law and monetary relief including restitution, claims that hundreds of thousands of consumers at the three banks made complaints about being defrauded but \"were largely denied relief, and some were even told to try getting their money back by contacting the person who had defrauded them.\" The CFPB said the three banks accounted for 73% of Zelle activity last year.\n\nRead more:Overdraft fees would be slashed under new Biden administration rule. What you need to know\n\nEarly Warning Services, which operates the app on behalf of the banks, attacked the lawsuit as \"legally and factually flawed\" and claimed the suit could be counterproductive by \"incentivizing\" criminals to make bogus fraud claims that institutions would have to pay \u2014 raising the app's costs and driving away credit unions and community and minority-owned banks offering Zelle. Some 2,200 financial institutions use the service.\n\n\"Zelle is relied upon by 143 million enrolled American consumers and small businesses, and we are fully prepared to defend this meritless lawsuit to ensure their service does not suffer,\" said Jane Khodos, a spokesperson for Early Warning, which was also named as a defendant.\n\nBank of America, in its own statement, said that \"more than 99.95 percent of transactions across the Zelle network go through without incident. When a client has an issue, we work directly with them.\"\n\nJP Morgan Chase also denied the allegations and alluded to political overtones raised by Early Warning, saying the CFPB's action was a \"last ditch effort in pursuit of their political agenda.\" Wells Fargo did not return messages requesting comment.\n\nThe CFPB, established in 2011 in the aftermath of the financial crisis, has long been criticized by Republicans as a \"runaway\" agency whose actions are heavy-handed and stifle economic growth.\n\nThe first administration of Donald Trump sought to rein in the bureau and redrafted proposed rules aimed at tightening regulations on payday lenders. Consumer advocates considered the final regulations watered down. The new Trump administration could terminate the Zelle lawsuit when it takes power next month.\n\nSome critics want to abolish the agency altogether. Billionaire Elon Musk, who is leading an effort to streamline the federal government through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, criticized the agency in a November post on X that said, \"Delete CFPB. There are too many duplicative regulatory agencies.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court turned down an effort by a payday lending trade group to declare the bureau's structure unconstitutional because it is funded by bank fees instead of congressional appropriations.\n\nRead more:FTC lawsuit accuses L.A. cash app Dave of charging hidden fees\n\nThe bureau, which boasts it has gotten consumers more than $21 billion in relief, has stepped up its enforcement actions recently ahead of the change in administrations.\n\nOn Monday, it filed separate lawsuits against Walmart and Rocket Mortgage over alleged financial wrongdoing. And earlier this month it issued landmark rules that could lower the costs of bank overdrafts to as little as $5.\n\nSeparately, the Federal Trade Commission, led by outgoing Chair Lina Khan, sued Los Angeles cash app company Dave Inc. last month, accusing it of misleading its financially vulnerable customers about fees it charges and the amount of money it gives out. The company denies the allegations.\n\nThe CFPB in its lawsuit claims that without adequate safeguards, Zelle allows fraudsters to create multiple email addresses and mobile phone numbers in signing up for the service that can be linked to the same or different bank accounts, leaving consumers unaware of who they are sending their money to.\n\nIt claims the banks allowed repeat offenders to hop between banks, with the banks not sharing information about fraudsters and acting too slowly to restrict or track criminals. It also claimed that they did not act on the hundreds of thousands of complaints they received to prevent further fraud.\n\nIn response, Early Warning claimed it has \"highly effective multi-layered fraud and scam prevention measures\" that in 2023 resulted in reports of frauds and scams decreasing by nearly 50% despite a 27% increase in transaction volume.\n\nThe company said it had made \"every effort to engage and cooperate\" with the bureau before the lawsuit was filed, which it said is part of the agency's \"pattern and practice of regulatory overreach.\"\n\nThe bureau's lawsuit was applauded by the National Consumer Law Center, which said, \u201cThe CFPB is standing up for people who weren\u2019t able to get the big banks to take their claims of fraud seriously and return their hard-earned money. The CFPB helps ordinary people who\u2019ve been hurt by big banks.\u201d\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, who spearheaded the creation of the agency, came to its defense last week and called on Trump to work with the agency to help American families by temporarily capping credit card interest rates at 10% \u2014 a pledge he made on the campaign trail.\n\n\"That would be a real boost for millions of families across this country,\" the Massachusetts Democrat said. \"If he's true to his word here, and I think we ought to take them at his word, then the CFPB can help him do that.\"\n\nSign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

            "content": "Bank of America warns of a bubble in US growth stocks echoing the \"Nifty Fifty\" and \"dot-com\" eras.\n\nConcentration in US stocks is significantly above historical norms, BofA said.\n\nInvestors should consider diversifying and focusing on quality stocks to mitigate risks, BofA said.\n\nIf you listen closely enough, amid all the investors cheering on AI, echoes of some of the great bubbles in history are starting to reverberate through the narrow canyon of skyscrapers on Wall Street.\n\nThat's the warning Bank of America strategists issued to clients in a note earlier this week.\n\nAs investors continue to pile into growth stocks, sometimes passively, the market has started to resemble the so-called \"Nifty Fifty\" and \"dot-com\" bubbles in the 1960s and late 1990s, respectively, the bank said. And while stocks could still rise in the near-term, outcomes after those famous bubble periods suggest trouble could be coming.\n\nThe argument was based on concentration levels in the market. The market cap of US stocks compared to the rest of the world is 3.3 standard deviations away from the historical norm.\n\nBank of America\n\nWithin the US, the S&P 500's largest five stocks are now 26.4% of the index.\n\nBank of America\n\nAnd the market cap of \"new economy\" stocks in the S&P 500 also make up more than half of the index's total value, a record high.\n\nBank of America\n\nPart of the reason the market has gotten so concentrated is because of passive investing, where investors shovel money into indexes indiscriminately, Woodard said.\n\n\"Passive funds dominate with 54% market share,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Passive disregard for valuations & fundamentals means big upside from innovations,\" Woodard continued, \"but big risk in a bust cycle.\"\n\nThese concentration levels could mean a long period of pain ahead for investors \u2014 like it did after the \"Nifty Fifty\" and \"dot-com\" bubbles.\n\n\"Momentum reversals are becoming unusually sharp. A 50%+ 'new economy' drawdown (smaller than dot com) could drag the entire index down 40%,\" wrote Jared Woodard, and investment & ETF strategist at Bank of America, in the February 11 note.\n\n\"If the eight sectors outside 'new economy' darlings were to rally 10% and the handful of mega cap tech stocks fell 10%, the index overall would still just be flat,\" he continued. \"Not very healthy or diversified.\"\n\nBank of America\n\nWoodard's warning of a difficult decade ahead for investors aligns with views of strategists at other major Wall Street banks in recent months. Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson said in December that the S&P 500 would see a decade of \"flat-ish\" returns ahead, and Goldman Sachs' David Kostin said the index would return 3% annually, on average, over the next 10 years.\n\nRelated stories\n\nHow to avoid a potential drawdown\n\nThe bank did lay out a playbook for how to avoid a potential bear market and \"lost decade\" ahead.\n\nFirst, Woodard said to watch when the S&P 500 equal-weight index starts to beat the cap-weighted index.\n\n\"The equally weighted S&P 500 index has outperformed the market cap-weighted index by 1ppt/year since 1958. There have been five periods when the cap-weighted index outperformed; those typically lasted 16 quarters,\" Woodard wrote. \"Today, the cap-weighted index is 2.5 standard deviations overbought relative to the long-term trend.\"\n\nBank of America\n\nSecond, consider investing in baskets of quality stocks with lower exposure to the Magnificent Seven stocks, Woodard said. Some examples of funds that offer exposure to quality stocks, the bank said, include: the Pacer US Large Cap Cash Cows Growth Leaders ETF (COWG); the iShares MSCI USA Quality GARP ETF (GARP); and the WisdomTree US Quality Growth Fund (QGRW).\n\nAnd third, diversify. Woodard said Derek Harris, Bank of America's head of global wealth and investment management portfolio strategy, recommends keeping each holding in a portfolio under a 15% weighting.",

            "content": "Donald Trump and the GOP have a surprising new ally in their push to clamp down on \"debanking\": Elizabeth Warren.\n\nThe Democratic senator from Massachusetts outlined her support for the issue known during a Senate banking committee hearing Wednesday when she commended the president for confronting Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan last month.\n\n\"Donald Trump was on to a real problem when he criticized Bank of America for its debanking practices,\u201d Warren said in her opening remarks.\n\nThe confrontation Warren referred to came at at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where Trump told Moynihan that \"I hope you open your banks to conservatives because what you're doing is wrong.\"\n\nBig banks, Warren added Wednesday, \"may be taking shortcuts when it comes to assessing risks rather than investing the time and the resources to identify true criminal risks and shutting down those accounts,\" she added.\n\nU.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). REUTERS/Nathan Howard (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe claim that big banks have discriminated against certain customers is gaining new visibility as the GOP presses for legislation that would better define when banks can decline service. The crypto industry has joined the call for changes after alleging that digital asset companies were unfairly denied bank services in recent years.\n\nBank of America, as well as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and its CEO Jamie Dimon, have denied that they debank customers based on their personal or political views.\n\nWhat Dimon and other bankers have instead argued is that US rules such as the Bank Secrecy Act discourage banks from dealing with customers that are considered high-risk \u2014 and that there needs to be clearer regulation on that front.\n\nUnder the Bank Secrecy Act and related anti-money laundering laws, US banks are required to monitor and report customer transactions to the government to help prevent money laundering, fraud, and other financial crimes.\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nIn practice, that means large banks file tens of thousands of suspicious activity reports on customers each quarter to the government. Because it could hinder law enforcement if something illegal happens, banks are specifically not permitted to alert customers when they file one of these reports.\n\nWhen a lender doesn\u2019t debank a high-risk customer and illicit activity happens, banks face heavy penalties via fines and a potential downgrade in their supervisory rating score.\n\n\"We agree with President Trump\u2019s diagnosis that much debanking occurs as a result of an anti-money laundering and 'reputational risk' regime administered by the federal banking agencies where certain types of customers are designated as 'high risk,'\" Greg Baer, CEO of bank lobbying group Bank Policy Institute, said in a statement last month.\n\nThe early actions from the GOP include bills from Sen. Kevin Cramer and House Rep. Andy Barr that would set clearer standards for when banks can choose to debank customers.\n\nThe bills are largely the same but Cramer's bill applies to lenders with over $10 billion in assets, while Barr's would only apply to banks with $50 billion or more in assets.\n\nBrian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America. REUTERS/Yves Herman (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nWarren made separate recommendations on Wednesday.\n\nShe sent a letter to Trump citing the work the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has done to root out debanking.\n\nShe recommended that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is also the CFPB's acting director, unfreeze \"rulemaking enforcement investigations and litigation against financial institutions that are breaking the law, including the banks that are wrongfully de banking their customers.\"\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

There are few other financial stocks that have achieved this level of valuation. In fact, JPMorgan Chase is the only bank with a higher valuation, and if I expand the scope to the entire financial services industry, payment processing giants Visa and Mastercard are both more valuable than BofA. But that's about it.\n\nHowever, there are some financial technology (or fintech) stocks that could get there within the next decade or so if their management teams can execute on their growth strategies. Here are two, in particular, that I think could surpass Bank of America's valuation. One is a bit of a stretch, and the other has come close to a $350 billion market cap in the past.\n\nA highly profitable business with room to grow\n\nPayPal (PYPL -0.36%) currently has a market cap of about $75 billion, so it would need roughly 17% in annualized returns to get to $350 billion in a decade, or about 11% to achieve it in 15 years. I don't think this is too much of a stretch. After all, PayPal's market cap was nearly $350 billion once already, during the 2021 e-commerce boom.\n\nPayPal's valuation has fallen because growth has been lacking. After several years of rapid user growth, the company stagnated when the pandemic came to an end. But there's a lot to like about its future.\n\nFirst, PayPal is a highly profitable business, expected to generate about $6 billion in free cash flow this year. It also has a cash-rich balance sheet, and this combination gives its management team flexibility to pursue opportunities as they arise. Just to name a few, PayPal launched its much-anticipated advertising platform in October 2024 and its PayPal Everywhere cash-back debit card, launched in September. And neither of these are reflected much in the numbers yet.\n\nPayPal CEO Alex Chriss and his team, who are all rather new to the company and laser-focused on getting the growth story back on track, are making smart moves and focusing on efficiency and optimal capital allocation. If they can return PayPal to growth, this could be a multi-bagger over the next 10 years.\n\nA bit of a stretch, but this bank has tremendous potential\n\nAdmittedly, it would be a bit more of a stretch to see SoFi (SOFI -1.59%) reach Bank of America's valuation. Even in a 15-year time frame, this would require 22.5% annualized returns.\n\nHowever, SoFi is emerging as an online bank that can completely replace customers' existing banking relationships, and the traction has been impressive. SoFi's user base has more than quintupled since the end of 2020, but it's still a relatively small bank for now (its deposit base is about 1% of Bank of America's).\n\nEven though SoFi has already grown impressively, there could be plenty of room ahead. Most of the bank's loan volume still comes from personal loans, and there's still room to grow in that area. But other forms of lending could be massive opportunities.\n\nFor example, SoFi's home loan origination volume grew by 82% in 2024 to about $1.8 billion, but this is about 0.1% of the estimated $1.4 trillion mortgage market. Plus, homeowners in the United States are sitting on about $35 trillion in equity (the highest ever), and could be eager to tap into it if rates start to fall.\n\nThat's just one example. SoFi is just starting to get on its feet in the massive credit card industry and could add other types of loan products, as well.\n\nSoFi wouldn't have to get as big as Bank of America to reach a similar valuation. As an online-based bank, SoFi has a superior cost structure and better margins. In the most recent quarter, SoFi's net interest margin was nearly three times that of Bank of America's. While Bank of America has nearly $2 trillion in deposits and about $1.1 trillion in loans, SoFi could likely get there with far less -- especially if it continues to build out capital-light revenue streams like its third-party loan origination platform.\n\nThings to keep in mind\n\nTo be perfectly clear, I'm saying these stocks could ultimately be worth more than the $350 billion that Bank of America is worth today, not what it will be worth 10-15 years from now. I'm a big fan of Bank of America and its management team, and it could certainly become a trillion-dollar business, eventually.\n\nIt's also worth noting that neither of these are low-risk investments. After all, if it was easy to identify stocks that could produce massive returns, we'd all be wealthy.\n\nPayPal has some major headwinds standing in its way, such as margin pressure and the ability to unlock new revenue streams. SoFi is a small bank today, and no online-based bank has been able to scale to become one of the larger U.S. banks -- yet. If you invest, expect quite a bit of volatility along the way, even if things go well.",

Anaya was appointed by Bank of America\u2019s CEO Brian Moynihan to lead the bank\u2019s comprehensive wildfire response.\n\n\u201cI am honored to be tapped by our CEO for this critical role,\u201d said Anaya. \u201cThousands of families have lost their homes during the wildfires, including so many of my friends. I am pleased to be able to bring the capital, expertise and connections that Bank of America has to help support the critical rebuilding of Los Angeles.\u201d\n\nThe role will involve close collaboration with federal, state and local officials, including L.A. Mayor Karen Bass\u2019 Chief Recovery Officer, Steve Soboroff, as well as various nonprofit organizations already actively involved in the recovery efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBank of America has not only pledged significant financial support but has also mobilized a team of experts to address the long-term recovery needs of the community.\n\nBank of America\u2019s immediate response has already reached $2 million, all aimed at addressing urgent needs. $1 million was granted to the American Red Cross, alongside $500,000 each to the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank and the L.A. Area Chamber of Commerce Foundation. These efforts underscore the bank\u2019s dedication to supporting a community just beginning to recover from the devastating event.\n\nAnaya\u2019s leadership is complemented by his deep roots and pride in the region. His participation on numerous local nonprofit boards, including the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce and the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation, positions him as a key figure in spearheading the city\u2019s recovery and rebuilding efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Bank of America channels its resources and expertise toward the recovery of Los Angeles, the bank reinforces its longstanding commitment to helping communities in need. The initiative reflects the institution\u2019s dedication to social responsibility and also highlights the importance of public-private partnerships in addressing large-scale crises.\n\nThe bank has a history of aid in times of need, dating back to its founder A.P. Giannini\u2019s philanthropic efforts following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. With its wildfire response, Bank of America continues to build on its legacy of community support.",

In 1958, following government antitrust action, Transamerica was reorganized to separate its banking and nonbanking activities, and a new corporation, Firstamerica Corporation (now Western Bancorporation), was formed to take over the banks it controlled. (Bank of America had been divested earlier.) The company then began a program of expansion into insurance and other services and began disposing of some of its non-finance-oriented businesses.\n\nThrough subsidiaries, Transamerica provides services in insurance, sales financing, consumer and commercial loans, equipment leasing, mortgage banking, computer services, and mutual funds. Insurance, which includes life, property, casualty, and title insurance, is handled primarily through the subsidiaries Transamerica Insurance Company and Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company. Transamerica Financial Corporation, formerly Pacific Finance Loans, is one of the oldest consumer loan companies in the United States. In 1979 Transamerica entered the field of transportation-equipment leasing by acquiring Interway Corporation, which it renamed Transamerica Interway.\n\nIn the mid-1980s Transamerica began selling off the travel and manufacturing subsidiaries it had earlier acquired in order to concentrate on expanding its core of financial-service operations. In 1986 it sold Budget Rent-A-Car Corporation, a major car rental service, and Transamerica Delaval Inc. (Delaval Turbine before its acquisition), a manufacturing company specializing in turbines, compressors, and other precision-engineered products.\n\nFrom 1963 to 1981 Transamerica was a major producer and distributor of motion pictures, records, and tapes through its subsidiary United Artists Corporation. It sold United Artists to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1981, following some losses on large-budget films, in order to concentrate on other interests.",

We should fix them. The rules and requirements are so onerous, and it does cause people to be debanked, in my opinion, who should not be debanked,\" the longtime JPMorgan CEO said.\n\nAsked in a follow-up if he was blaming banking regulators primarily for issues surrounding debanking, Dimon said, \"Pretty much, yeah.\"\n\nThe visit from the bank executives comes as new Senate Banking Chairman Tim Scott, R-S.C., has prioritized transparency surrounding debanking.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM FOX BUSINESS\n\nIndeed, Scott led the Senate Banking Committee in hearing from witnesses last week who have experienced debanking.\n\nScott called Thursday's roundtable \"constructive,\" and said in a statement that Congress needs to \"right-size the impacts of the Biden administration\u2019s burdensome and arbitrary regulations.\"\n\n\"The debanking of Americans should concern everyone \u2013 law-abiding citizens and federally legal businesses deserve access to financial services \u2013 regardless of industry or political affiliation,\" Scott said. \"My message is clear: no regulator, and no financial institution, is above the principles of fairness and market access.\"",

Bank of America hinted the precious metal could climb to $3,500 per ounce, driven by investment demand and central bank buying amid growing global economic and policy uncertainties.\n\nIn a note shared Wednesday, Bank of America commodity strategist Francisco Blanch said gold's rally has been largely fueled by \"exceptional purchases by the official sector\" as central banks seek to hedge against geopolitical and fiscal risks.\n\nSpot gold \u2013 as tracked by the SPDR Gold Trust GLD \u2013 is currently trading at $2,920 per ounce as of Feb. 13, 2025, up 11.3% year-to-date.\n\nWill Gold Reach $3,500?\n\nFor gold to average $3,000 per ounce in 2025, investment demand needs to rise by just 1%, according to Bank of America's analysis.\n\nYet, reaching $3,500 would require a more significant 10% jump. While this might seem like a steep climb, Blanch indicated that it's \"not impossible.\"\n\nOne major factor supporting this outlook is China's recent decision to allow insurance funds to invest in gold through various financial instruments.\n\nChina's Financial Supervision Administration has launched a pilot program that could unlock as much as $25 billion to $28 billion in gold purchases, equivalent to about 300 metric tons, or 6.5% of the annual global market.\n\nChinese insurers, managing an estimated $4.4 trillion in total assets, are now permitted to allocate up to 1% of their portfolios to gold. With declining returns on traditional investments and a growing appetite for safe-haven assets, Bank of America's analysts believe insurers will likely use their full allowance within a year.\n\nCentral Banks And Geopolitical Uncertainty\n\nGlobal central banks have been aggressively accumulating gold, largely as a hedge against geopolitical and economic instability.\n\n\u201cWe agree that the gold market is pricing in increased policy tensions,\u201d Blanch said.\n\nThe World Gold Council reported that total gold demand hit a record 4,974 metric tons in 2024, with central bank purchases exceeding 1,000 metric tons for the third consecutive year.\n\nGold investment also surged in 2024, with demand rising 25%\u2014the highest annual growth rate since 2020. Gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which had seen heavy outflows in previous years, stabilized as investors turned to the metal amid market uncertainties.\n\n\"Total gold demand (including OTC investment) rose 1% year-over-year in Q4 to reach a new quarterly high and contribute to a record annual total,\" the World Gold Council said in its latest report.\n\nThe Impact Of US Policy: Could The Dollar Actually Weaken?\n\nOne of the key uncertainties supporting gold demand is the direction of U.S. economic policy under President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump administration is considering fresh tariffs on key trading partners, a move that could initially strengthen the U.S. dollar, according to Bank of America. Yet, policymakers are also discussing efforts to weaken the currency in an attempt to rebalance the elevated U.S. trade deficit, which could eventually support gold prices.\n\nBank of America's note highlighted that \"the call for a weaker USD is also discussed along with a push to rebalance external accounts.\" A weaker dollar typically makes gold more attractive to international investors.\n\nIf investment demand continues its upward trajectory, gold's run may be far from over. Whether it reaches $3,500 will depend on just how much more investors and institutions flock to the metal in the months ahead.\n\nRead Next:\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stands against the other bank dividend stocks.\n\nThe year 2024 was significant for major US banks. A recent Financial Times report highlighted that the country\u2019s seven largest banks accounted for 56% of the industry\u2019s profits in the first nine months of the year, up from 48% in the same period of 2023. The banking sector has also strengthened its capital position. In November, the Federal Reserve Board reported that 99% of US banks maintained capital levels above regulatory requirements. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) observed a 3.5% rise in equity capital during the third quarter of 2024, reinforcing the sector\u2019s improving capitalization.\n\nBank stocks surged after President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the 2024 presidential election. The rally was swift and broad-based, driven by market expectations of a more lenient regulatory environment starting in 2025, particularly regarding mergers and acquisitions. In November, the median total return for the 211 banks analyzed by S&P Global Market Intelligence reached 13.4%, significantly outperforming the broader market\u2019s 5.9% return.\n\nAlso read: 14 Best Large Cap Dividend Growth Stocks To Buy Now\n\nAnother factor influencing the bank\u2019s performance was the Federal Reserve\u2019s release of parameters for its annual industry stress test, which outlined milder hypothetical economic shocks compared to previous years. Although the test remains challenging\u2014projecting US unemployment rising to 10% and home prices dropping by 33%\u2014the 2025 scenario includes smaller increases in joblessness and less severe declines in stock and real estate values than in recent years. Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg highlighted these adjustments in a report titled \u201c2025 Stress Test: Scenarios Easier than Past Two Years.\u201d Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala noted that with the latest version of the test being less stringent and more predictable, banks may not need to maintain as large of a capital buffer later this year. Here are some other comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cThe 2025 stress test scenario, broadly better vs last year, increases our confidence that banks should begin to see the relief on regulatory capital requirements, given our expectations for a shift to a balanced, transparent, and more predictable regulatory regime.\u201d\n\nIn December, Moody\u2019s upgraded its industry outlook from negative to stable for the first time since 2023, pointing to interest rate cuts and monetary policy adjustments by G-20 nations. The Federal Reserve implemented three rate cuts last year, bringing its target interest rate down to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. Wall Street remains optimistic about the sector, with Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg predicting that major bank stocks will continue to rise, driven by expectations of a pro-growth, deregulation-focused agenda under the new administration. However, he acknowledged that corporate borrowing has remained subdued as businesses evaluate the post-election environment.\n\nInvestor interest in bank stocks is growing, largely due to their attractive dividend payouts. A report from Janus Henderson revealed that banks were responsible for one-fifth of all dividends distributed in the third quarter, reflecting a 6.6% increase on an underlying basis\u2014outpacing the average across all sectors. Given their significant market presence, banks contributed the most to dividend growth in Q3, slightly surpassing the media sector. The latter saw a substantial 166% surge in payouts, driven by the resumption of dividend payments from major tech companies. The report further highlighted that bank stocks paid $38.2 billion in dividends during the third quarter of 2024. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks from the banking sector.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we picked the top 10 bank dividend stocks based on their popularity among elite hedge funds in the third quarter of 2024. We gauged hedge fund sentiment for these stocks using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds, as of Q3 2023.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 98\n\nBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is a multinational investment bank and financial services company, based in North Carolina. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has never missed a dividend in 27 years. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.26 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.74%.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) saw a rise in revenue to $25.3 billion, up from $22 billion in the same quarter last year. Net income more than doubled, reaching $6.7 billion, compared to $3.1 billion in the previous year. The bank also grew its customer base, adding 213,000 new consumer checking accounts, continuing its streak of six consecutive years of quarterly growth. Furthermore, it returned $2 billion to shareholders through dividends.\n\nIn the past 12 months, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) has delivered an over 41% return to shareholders and its YRD returns came in at over 4.3%. The company has several competitive advantages that strengthen its market position and protect it from rivals, including both traditional banks and fintech firms. Its broad distribution network, which combines a strong digital platform with a widespread branch presence, enables the bank to expand its low-cost deposit base and attract new customers, driving revenue growth. In addition, its large scale allows for efficient cost management, ensuring steady profitability. The bank\u2019s well-known brand further enhances its attractiveness to current and prospective clients.\n\nOverall BAC ranks 2nd on our list of the best bank dividend stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for BAC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BAC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Global trade tensions show no signs of easing, but two Latin American nations may actually stand to benefit. President Donald Trump on Thursday posted on Truth Social that the U.S. would impose reciprocal tariffs on goods from countries that have hit American products with levies. \"THREE GREAT WEEKS, PERHAPS THE BEST EVER, BUT TODAY IS THE BIG ONE: RECIPROCAL TARIFFS,\" he said in the social media post. He later scheduled a 1 p.m. ET news conference on the matter. Earlier this week, Trump approved tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports. That comes after signing an order to put an additional 10% duty on Chinese imports and a 25% levy on Canadian and Mexican products. The charges on Chinese goods were implemented, while those on products from Canada and Mexico were suspended for 30 days. Many politicians and economists have warned that a trade war could lead to economic pressure for everyone involved. But Bank of America thinks two countries could benefit from U.S. tariffs on imports from China, Canada and Mexico: Brazil and Argentina. \"Similarly to the 2018-19 trade war, we believe farmers in Brazil and Argentina will benefit the most from U.S.-China/Mexico/Canada tariff hostilities,\" BofA said in a Wednesday note. \"China could increase soybean imports from South America, and this region is the best alternative origin for corn should Mexico and Canada decide to apply counter-tariffs to U.S. agriculture produce (we think it's unlikely though),\" BofA added. \"Consequently, we would expect a further expansion in planting area and production in Brazil, supporting strong growth of the agribusiness overall,\" the bank said. Brazil's stock market has outperformed the S & P 500 thus far in 2025, with the Bovespa index rising 3.3% versus the U.S. benchmark's 2.9% advance. Argentina's Merval index has tumbled nearly 10% to start the year, but remains more than 43% higher over the past six months. For U.S. investors looking to gain exposure to these markets, two exchange-traded funds might help: the iShares MSCI Brazil ETF (EWZ) and the Global X MSCI Argentina ETF (ARGT) . EWZ charged 0.59% in fees and is up 12.6% year to date. ARGT, with the same expense ratio, is up 1.3% in 2025. EWZ ARGT YTD mountain EWZ and ARGT year to date Elsewhere Thursday morning on Wall Street, Baird initiated research coverage of turbine maker GE Vernova with an outperform rating, calling for more than 20% upside. \"The rising demand for energy generation solutions gives the company pricing power for out years which we believe will translate to margin expansion and may provide upside to the long-term financial targets (which extend through 2028),\" analyst Ben Kallo said in a note.",

Contrarian Investing Technique: How do you beat the crowd? Fade the crowd. Following the 2008 Global Financial Crisis fallout, most investors licked their wounds. Not David Tepper. Tepper bought positions in some of the most hated and beaten-down stocks of the time, including Bank of America.\n\n2. High Conviction Bets: It\u2019s one thing to make contrarian bets; it\u2019s a whole different thing to have the intestinal fortitude to see those bets through and hold them through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt.\n\n3. Gargantuan-Sized Bets: Tepper\u2019s investing analysis often proves him correct, and as mentioned, he has a unique stomach to hold his bets for years. However, his gigantic bet size really sets him apart from other Wall Street money managers. Being right, holding tight, and betting in size is what made Tepper a multi-billionaire and allowed him to buy the Carolina Panthers football team.\n\nWhat's David Tepper Trading Now?\n\nA 13F disclosure is a quarterly filing regulators require for investment managers with > $100 million in AUM (which Tepper is). 13Fs give investors a unique view into what Wall Street\u2019s brightest minds are investing in.\n\nTepper is Betting Big on China\n\nThere is no bigger contrarian bet on Wall Street than China. Until the past few months, Chinese stocks and the economy have been in the gutter as investors worry about a fledgling real estate sector, government regulations, and a potential trade war with the US. As expected, Tepper is fading the noise and taking the contrarian bet. Two of his largest positions are in Chinese stocks, including Alibaba and JD.com.\n\nThe two leading Chinese e-commerce giants represent ~20% of Tepper\u2019s massive portfolio (BABA = 15%, JD + 5%). The billionaire hedge fund manager\u2019s conviction in China remains steadfast. In a TV interview Tepper was asked if he is hedging his Chinese bets or is worried about tariffs from the US and answered, \u201cMy hedge is I don\u2019t care.\u201d In addition to his individual China bets, Tepper also holds Chinese ETFs like the FXI and the KWEB.\n\nTepper Bullish on AI\n\nTepper\u2019s top ten positions by weight are also filled with AI bets, including Advanced Micro Devices and Vistra (which he doubled). While the AI revolution has become a mainstream bet, AMD is currently beaten-down and is another classic Tepper bet.",

            "content": "Bank of America has a rich history dating back to 1800 and even earlier. It was begun by immigrants as a group of separate and unrelated banks that, over the years, merged and grew together. One such is the Bank of Italy which was founded in 1904 by Amadeo Giannini to serve Italian immigrants that were facing discrimination. He later buys out the Banca de America e de Italia (Bank of America and Italy) which was also located in San Francisco. Over the years additional mergers and changes in Federal banking legislation, as well as the boom brought on by WWI and then WWII, helped boost the bank to national prominence.\n\nThings turned sour, however, in 1998 with a major bond default that led to yet another merger, this time with Charlotte, NC-based Nations Bank to officially become the Bank of America that exists today. At the time, the merger was the largest bank merger in history and the company has only grown in the time since.\n\nOther additions to the new Bank of America include MBNA (a major credit card operator), Fleet Boston (then the US 7th largest and one of its oldest banks), and Merril Lynch, now Merril, which was added to the group in 2008 to provide an investment banking branch. Together the company dominates as one of the Big Four Banks in America. Bank of America lays claim to nearly 11% of all US deposits which ranks in line with its peer group and Bank of America Securities is listed as the world\u2019s 3rd largest investment bank.\n\nToday, Bank of America Corporation provides banking and financial services for individuals, small businesses, institutions, corporations, and governments worldwide. The bank operates in three segments Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, and Global Banking bringing in a combined revenue greater than $90 billion in 2022.\n\nAs of 2022, Bank of America serves approximately 67 million consumer and small business clients with approximately 4,200 retail financial centers. The bank also operates more than 16,000 ATMs and digital banking platforms with approximately 41 million active users.\n\nIts Consumer Banking segment offers traditional banking and investment products for retail clients. These range from deposit accounts to savings, credit cards, consumer loans, and IRAs. The Global Wealth & Investment Management segment offers investment and wealth management solutions including, brokerage, banking, and trust and retirement products. The Global Banking segment provides lending products and services, including commercial loans and leases for businesses of all varieties.

The second-largest bank in the U.S. by assets has seen its shares soar 88% since late October 2023. But they're still trading about 14% off their all-time peak, which might prompt some investors to take a closer look.\n\nShould you buy this financial stock while it's less than $50?\n\nA banking giant\n\nBecause Bank of America has been around for such a long time, tracing its roots back to 1865, the company has developed into a enormous financial services entity that can serve a wide range of customers. This includes individuals and small businesses all the way to multinational corporations and governments.\n\nBank of America is a diversified giant. Consumers can sign up for checking and savings accounts, get credit cards or mortgages, and handle their investments. Corporations can raise equity or debt financing, and even get advice on mergers and acquisitions. This setup is beneficial because it means the business surely has whatever product or service you are looking for.\n\nThis also means Bank of American's revenue comes from many different places. In 2024, the largest revenue source was consumer banking, representing 42% of the business. But the wealth and investment management, global banking, and global markets divisions also were key sales drivers.\n\nConsequently, the business has built up a wide economic moat. This helps protect Bank of America's position in a very competitive industry. One durable competitive edge comes from switching costs: as customers get locked in with multiple products their interest in leaving declines. Another advantage is scale. Being able to spread large fixed costs across the huge revenue base means consistent profits.\n\nWarren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway is a major shareholder, with a 10% stake. The Oracle of Omaha certainly appreciates businesses that have staying power. Bank of America's diversified offerings and its wide moat definitely put it in this category.\n\nEarnings power\n\nOne important factor that can have a big influence on how well a stock performs is the trajectory of earnings. Bank of America's profitability is notable. During the past decade, its net profit margin has averaged 26.2%.\n\nInvestors should think about what will drive higher profitability in the next few years, and thus boost the share price. Bank of America's net interest income decreased year over year in 2024, after soaring between 2021 and 2023. This may signal that the benefits of higher interest rates are fading.\n\nOf course, the change in interest rates is important, although whatever happens is totally unpredictable. However, I think it's reasonable that the likelihood is for interest rates to be little changed, or even drop. The timing is unknown.\n\nFor Bank of America, this could mean it will be difficult for profit to meaningfully grow because the bank won't be able to charge higher rates to borrowers for loans that it originates. On the flip side, non-interest income and fees could pick up with a more favorable macroeconomic backdrop.\n\nSet the right expectations\n\nDespite whatever happens with interest rates, Bank of America isn't a fast-growing enterprise. It operates in a very mature part of the economy.\n\nConsequently, the price investors pay matters quite a bit because that can have an important impact on potential returns. As of this writing, the shares trade at a price-to-book (P/B) ratio -- a key valuation metric for banks -- of 1.3. This is more expensive than the average of the past one-, three-, five-, and 10-year periods. And it's significantly more expensive than the 0.8 P/B multiple in October 2023, right before the stock went on an impressive run.\n\nEven though the stock is below $50, I don't view Bank of America as a smart buy. I don't believe it can outperform the broader market during the next five years.",

            "content": "One point that might bring the Federal Reserve and the recently-minted Trump administration into conflict going forward is a stance over interest rates. And banking giant Bank of America (BAC) weighed in as well on where those were going. Its response was not particularly welcome news to shareholders, who sent Bank of America shares down over 1.5% in Wednesday afternoon\u2019s trading.\n\nBasically, Bank of America looks for no cuts in interest rates, mostly because consumer spending is still rolling along. That in turn would mean that the Federal Reserve would likely not bother to cut interest rates either. In fact, Bank of America noted that customers are spending about 6% more money this year so far than they did at the same time last year.\n\nYet, interestingly, Bank of America also noted that the ongoing high inflation makes it unlikely any interest rate cuts will be seen. Both \u201cprice firmness\u201d and \u201cdemand firmness\u201d are in place, which means that, apparently, rate firmness will also be in play.\n\nMeanwhile In Switzerland\n\nBank of America is also facing some mounting issues in Switzerland, as the regulatory landscape is getting a lot more forbidding. To that end, Bank of America is bringing in a whole new roster to its banking team, fully doubling its size in the country in a bid to take on increasing regulatory oversight provisions.\n\nSwitzerland promised tighter banking restrictions since the loss of Credit Suisse back in 2023, starting with requirements for more capital on hand to prevent such collapses from happening in the future. While there was some concern that the new requirements could ultimately weaken banks in Switzerland, this does not seem to be slowing down the Swiss government\u2019s plans to tighten up. In fact, reports noted, there will likely not be \u201c\u2026much clarity until May\u201d on the overall impact of these moves.\n\nIs BAC a Good Buy Right Now?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on BAC stock based on 18 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 44.18% rally in its share price over the past year, the average BAC price target of $52.86 per share implies 14.32% upside potential.\n\nSee more BAC analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "The dominance of a handful of tech stocks in the equity market is likely linked to investors' massive appetite for cheap index funds, which in turn could be a hidden risk for Wall Street, according to Bank of America. Jared Woodard, investment and ETF strategist at Bank of America, said in a note to clients that passive funds now have 54% of market share and appear to be one reason that just five stocks account for more than 25% of the S & P 500. Passive funds such as the SPDR S & P 500 Trust (SPY) and Vanguard S & P 500 ETF (VOO) are consistently among the most popular by inflows on most months, meaning investors are putting more and more money into those biggest stocks. \"Because passive investing is less sensitive to valuation and other fundamentals, some market participants worry that passive funds make markets less efficient. And since most passive funds are weighted by market-capitalization, passive flows can exacerbate market concentration, thereby reducing diversification,\" Woodard wrote. VOO ALL mountain Passive funds, like Vanguard's VOO, have attracted massive inflows of investor cash over the years. Investors have shifted toward passive investing in recent decades in part because those vehicles typically have lower management fees than their active counterparts. Most traditional active stock pickers also tend to underperform the S & P 500 in any given year, and the performance numbers look even worse over longer periods. But there is a chance that the 54% market share stat is more than just a trivia tidbit. Woodard wrote that passive investing has reached a \"critical mass\" and could cause issues for the stock market, especially during downturns. \"Systemic concentration raises the stakes: passive disregard for valuations & fundamentals means big upside from innovations \u2026 but big risk in a bust cycle,\" Woodard said. Bank of America is not the first to warn of the risk of the rise in passive investing. Concerns had been raised long before recent sharp downturns, such as the 2020 Covid sell-off, that did not appear to result in long-term structural damage to markets. Periods of high concentration in the markets don't require passive investing, either. The so-called Nifty 50, which is often cited as a historical precedent to the current environment, peaked before the founding of Vanguard, a pioneering firm in passive investing.",

The second-largest bank in the U.S. by assets has seen its shares soar 88% since late October 2023. But they're still trading about 14% off their all-time peak, which might prompt some investors to take a closer look.\n\nShould you buy this financial stock while it's less than $50?\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nA banking giant\n\nBecause Bank of America has been around for such a long time, tracing its roots back to 1865, the company has developed into a enormous financial services entity that can serve a wide range of customers. This includes individuals and small businesses all the way to multinational corporations and governments.\n\nBank of America is a diversified giant. Consumers can sign up for checking and savings accounts, get credit cards or mortgages, and handle their investments. Corporations can raise equity or debt financing, and even get advice on mergers and acquisitions. This setup is beneficial because it means the business surely has whatever product or service you are looking for.\n\nThis also means Bank of American's revenue comes from many different places. In 2024, the largest revenue source was consumer banking, representing 42% of the business. But the wealth and investment management, global banking, and global markets divisions also were key sales drivers.\n\nConsequently, the business has built up a wide economic moat. This helps protect Bank of America's position in a very competitive industry. One durable competitive edge comes from switching costs: as customers get locked in with multiple products their interest in leaving declines. Another advantage is scale. Being able to spread large fixed costs across the huge revenue base means consistent profits.\n\nWarren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway is a major shareholder, with a 10% stake. The Oracle of Omaha certainly appreciates businesses that have staying power. Bank of America's diversified offerings and its wide moat definitely put it in this category.\n\nEarnings power\n\nOne important factor that can have a big influence on how well a stock performs is the trajectory of earnings. Bank of America's profitability is notable. During the past decade, its net profit margin has averaged 26.2%.\n\nInvestors should think about what will drive higher profitability in the next few years, and thus boost the share price. Bank of America's net interest income decreased year over year in 2024, after soaring between 2021 and 2023. This may signal that the benefits of higher interest rates are fading.\n\nOf course, the change in interest rates is important, although whatever happens is totally unpredictable. However, I think it's reasonable that the likelihood is for interest rates to be little changed, or even drop. The timing is unknown.\n\nFor Bank of America, this could mean it will be difficult for profit to meaningfully grow because the bank won't be able to charge higher rates to borrowers for loans that it originates. On the flip side, non-interest income and fees could pick up with a more favorable macroeconomic backdrop.\n\nSet the right expectations\n\nDespite whatever happens with interest rates, Bank of America isn't a fast-growing enterprise. It operates in a very mature part of the economy.\n\nConsequently, the price investors pay matters quite a bit because that can have an important impact on potential returns. As of this writing, the shares trade at a price-to-book (P/B) ratio -- a key valuation metric for banks -- of 1.3. This is more expensive than the average of the past one-, three-, five-, and 10-year periods. And it's significantly more expensive than the 0.8 P/B multiple in October 2023, right before the stock went on an impressive run.\n\nEven though the stock is below $50, I don't view Bank of America as a smart buy. I don't believe it can outperform the broader market during the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Bank of America wasn\u2019t one of them.

The new target indicates a potential 46% upside from current levels.\n\nLyft also released its Q4 and full-year results yesterday, revealing mixed performance, which led to a more than 11% drop in shares during after-hours trading. Year-to-date, LYFT stock has gained 11.55%.\n\nBofA Praises LYFT\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nMcGovern\u2019s price target adjustment follows a recent statement from CEO David Risher, who shared his excitement about Lyft\u2019s partnership with Mobileye (MBLY), a leader in autonomous driving technology. McGovern believes this collaboration is set to significantly boost Lyft\u2019s autonomous vehicle operations by 2026, strengthening its position in the ride-sharing market.\n\nAdditionally, McGovern mentioned that positive earnings results from Lyft\u2019s rival Uber (UBER) indicate strong growth potential for the company in the U.S. Mobility sector, even with possible pricing challenges ahead. Last week, Uber reported an 18% year-over-year growth in gross bookings in Q4 and a 20% rise in revenues, fueled by record demand for Mobility and Delivery services. Uber\u2019s management also highlighted strong prospects in autonomous vehicle technology in 2025.\n\nSimilarly, McGovern further points out that the long-term potential in the autonomous vehicle market offers a balanced risk and reward for investors, making it a promising area for growth. This outlook supports his decision to raise the price target for Lyft\u2019s stock, as he believes the company is well-positioned to benefit from advancements in autonomous vehicle technology.\n\nIs LYFT Stock a Buy or Sell?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, LYFT stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on five Buys and 14 Holds assigned in the last three months.

Current valuations ignore these companies' reshaped portfolios with exposure to mission-critical and high-growth areas.\" On top of DOGE's efforts possibly leading to a bigger focus on readiness capabilities and enterprise IT, the analyst also believes that defense IT modernization is in the \"early innings of a long-term up-cycle.\" Amid the backdrop of emerging technologies changing the nature of warfare, Perez Mora sees sustained near-term growth in the high single-digits for the defense IT service sector. On that front, Booz Allen Hamilton is a key beneficiary, she said, noting that it has allowed the U.S. government to integrate commercial solutions and their providers by \"advising on what, how, where and also performing the program management and oversight on behalf of the USG.\" \"They have been agile to adapt to the USG's increasing willingness to work with [commercial off-the-shelf] solutions by partnering with companies like Palantir, Nvidia , C3 AI , Databricks and AWS ( Amazon Web Services ),\" Perez Mora continued. The analyst has a buy rating on the stock, and her $210 price target implies about 64% upside from Monday's close. That call is among the seven out of 14 analysts covering it on Wall Street that have a strong buy or buy rating, according to LSEG data. Meanwhile, six analysts have taken a neutral stance with a hold rating. The stock has underperformed the broader market this year, with shares falling about 0.5% year to date. By contrast, shares of Palantir \u2013 another key beneficiary \u2013 have soared in 2025, rising more than 54%. Perez Mora sees the stock positioned for even more growth as a result of DOGE's efforts given its \"focus on operationalizing data, establishing high-fidelity digital enterprise-twins and accelerating decision making.\" \"AI and data analytics are critical to unlock timely and better informed decision making \u2013 from cutting duplicative contracts, to improved logistics, to autonomous systems, to command, control and communications on the battlefield,\" the analyst added in the note. With a buy rating on Palantir, Perez Mora has a target of $125, which reflects more than 7% upside potential, as of Monday's close. By contrast, however, most of the Street is neutral on the name. Out of the 22 analysts covering Palantir, 13 have a hold rating, while only four have a strong buy or buy rating. Its 12-month consensus target of around $88 reflects more than 24% downside from here.",

Goldman Sachs gave CEO David Solomon an $80 million bonus and a 26% raise, bringing his total compensation to $39 million. That also brought Solomon on par with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, whose compensation rose 8.3% to $39 million in 2024. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scarf received $31.2 million for 2024 \u2014 a 7.6% increase from 2023.\n\nMoynihan\u2019s base salary remained unchanged at $1.5 million, and the value of his 2024 equity incentive is $33.5 million. He did not receive any cash bonus, which was consistent with prior years. The equity incentive is composed of 30% cash-settled restricted stock units with a 12-month vesting period, 20% stock-settled RSUs that vest annually over the next four years, and 50% stock-settled performance RSUs tied to bank performance metrics.\n\nSeparately, Capital One gave its CEO Richard Fairbank a $31 million year-end incentive award for 2024, according to an SEC filing Friday.\n\nCapital One awaits regulatory approvals of its proposed $35.3 billion deal with Discover.\n\nShareholders of both companies are set to meet Feb. 18 \u2013 roughly a year after the deal was announced \u2013 to weigh in on the tie-up.\n\nCapital One\u2019s filing said the compensation committee and the board of directors' decision regarding the year-end incentive award\u2019s form and value \u201cwas based on a qualitative evaluation of multiple factors\" and the company\u2019s performance in 2024.\n\nFairbank\u2019s incentive award package includes 102,440 target shares based on the company\u2019s performance from 2025 to 2027, $18.25 million tied to growth of shareholder value and adjusted return on tangible common equity, and $2.25 million based on relative total shareholder return relative to the company's peers over the performance period.\n\nHe will also receive a $5.5 million deferred cash bonus, which will be paid in 2028, and $5 million in RSUs that will vest in 2028, as noted in the filing.",

            "content": "After nearly 10 years with Bank of America, Ken Thomas of Community Development Fund Advisors found his business was debanked because of overzealous money-laundering enforcement. Adobe Stock\n\nMy business was debanked by Bank of America last year.\n\nThis costly and upsetting problem had nothing to do with politics, religion, crypto or anything else for which President Donald Trump recently criticized BofA's CEO.\n\nRather, it was because BofA's anti-money-laundering efforts, at least in my case, apparently relied on overzealous artificial intelligence or algorithms combined with a shortage of human intelligence, also known as common sense.\n\nIf a bank has a long history serving a local business, especially one in a highly regulated financial space, regular large wire transfers should not trigger a suspicious activity report. That is, unless BSA AI is being interpreted and acted upon by someone who fails to employ common sense.\n\nThis seems to be exactly what happened in January 2024 after BofA sent me a form letter asking for standard information about my business \u2014 information I have repeatedly given them since I opened my business account there nearly 10 years ago. I thought I had properly responded to this request, until I realized my main checking account and credit card and other payments tied to it were frozen.\n\nMy business had been debanked!\n\nI first learned about this not from BofA, but from my insurance carrier and other vendors emailing, texting or, worse, calling me about missing monthly automatic bill payments. When they started with \"How's business?\" I knew why they were calling.\n\nAnd, then there was the in-person embarrassment when BofA credit cards tied to that frozen account were declined as I held up the line at retailers. The absolute worst: restaurant servers returning with the dreaded news in front of guests.\n\nDebanking made me feel like a deadbeat.\n\nBankers are not allowed to disclose why a bank account was frozen or closed for AML reasons. However, as a longtime bank compliance consultant and community bank board member, I quickly confirmed my new \"high risk\" status by asking the right questions of BofA customer service representatives, one of whom privately admitted what I already knew.\n\nFortunately, I had some senior contacts at BofA who made fixing this problem a top priority. It was still very time-consuming and frustrating filling out multiple application forms for new credit cards, identifying automatic payees, etc., and the matter was not totally resolved until nearly six months later.\n\nImportantly, I continue to bank with BofA because they took responsibility for this problem and helped me get rebanked.\n\nIt's easy to point my finger at them for this debanking, but they will properly reply, like a TSA agent randomly selecting you for a full-body pat down, that they were \"just doing their job.\" In fact, BofA's CEO replied to Trump that \"We are required to follow extensive government rules and regulations that sometimes result in decisions to exit client relationships.\"\n\nRegulating Crypto Bank customers still complain about crypto debanking Despite crypto-friendly signals coming from Washington, getting a bank account still appears to be a challenge for crypto businesses and investors. February 6\n\nBSA compliance has become the single most costly banking regulation, at 22% of all compliance expenses, three times more than CRA, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis . Despite these costs, 23% of banks are annually cited for BSA violations according to a GAO report citing Fincen data .\n\nNo one knows this better than bankers in my South Florida home, where prudential regulators, Fincen, and other federal and state enforcement agencies cannot forget Scarface's money-laundering negotiation scene with a Miami banker .\n\nThere was so much drug money, or \"narcobucks,\" in South Florida during the '80s Cocaine Cowboys days that the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's Miami branch had a currency surplus of $5 billion in 1981, mostly in drug-generated $50 and $100 bills, more than all other Federal Reserve banks combined. Miami banks, at least four being controlled by drug dealers at the time, were so awash in cash that some charged a fee to take deposits.\n\nInstead of a bank shutting down a customer's account, debanking in Miami in the '80s meant the government shutting down a money-laundering bank. For example, the $100 million Great American Bank of Dade County laundered $60 million of cash in one year for one drug lord alone in the early '80s. That community bank, serving the needs of drug lords rather than its North Miami neighborhood, was indicted for money laundering and later shut down.\n\nThe only debanked person I ever knew was also in Miami but in the '90s. O.J Simpson was in line with me at my local First Union branch, and we briefly chatted about football. The following month I was telling the branch manager about my chance encounter with O.J., and she told me \"You won't be seeing him here anymore!\" I then learned a bank can refuse service to anyone for legitimate business reasons, in O.J.'s case multiple complaints by female customers feeling uncomfortable in his presence.\n\nI can understand drug lords, money launderers and even O.J. being debanked, but I never thought it would happen to me.\n\nBut, then again, I live and work in The 305 .\n\nNo other market in the nation gets such intense AML scrutiny as South Florida. In fact, an unwritten rule of thumb among some local bankers is that you should think about selling when AML staff make up 10% or more of your employees.\n\nIt is not uncommon for a legitimate South Florida customer with a six-figure bank account regularly sending mid-five figure wires to be red flagged by BSA algorithms. However, this is where old-fashioned common sense must come into play to exclude AI \" false positives \" based on a bank's knowing its customers .\n\nHowever, whether a TSA agent, bank examiner or BSA officer, a job can be done with or without common sense.\n\nTrump and his deregulatory team, including the new Department of Government Efficiency , has made it a top priority to reduce banking's immense regulatory burden and bring back common sense in the federal government. I don't see this happening anytime soon, unless someone invents a commonsense chemical, like fluoride, that can be added to D.C.'s water supply.\n\nBased on my debanking experience, perhaps the best place to start reducing the regulatory burden is by reforming BSA compliance, so bankers can better serve small businesses instead of holding them hostage because of overzealous and misdirected AML AI and personnel.\n\n",

The assets are across Germany and France and were bought by the Carlyle Group during 2020 and 2021 in 10 transactions, including as part of a sale-and-leaseback with the main occupier Kuehne + Nagel which has 55% of the passing rent.\n\nThe portfolio comprises mainly single-let medium-box logistics properties and located in out-of-town sites within reasonable driving distance of French or German populations. K&N occupies 25 of the 37 and there is near-100% occupancy. On 13 December, Bank of America Europe DAC, the original lender or the loan seller, entered into a common terms agreement with the borrowers, ultimately The Carlyle Group, and a French law local loan agreement.\n\nOn 31 October, Cushman & Wakefield conducted valuations on the properties and appraised their aggregate market value at \u20ac384.4 million, which translates into a day-one loan-to-value ratio of 67.5%.\n\nThe CMBS is the third to launch in Europe in 2025, a major increase in activity on the last three years.\n\nLast week, Blackstone's first European CMBS of the year, the \u20ac525 million Sequoia Logistics 2025-1 DAC, the largest euro-denominated issuance CMBS since 2021, priced at a weighted average margin of 192 basis points, the tightest on a direct CMBS in four years, as reported.\n\nIn January, presales ratings were assigned to Pembroke Property Finance 3 DAC, a \u20ac343.6 million multi-borrower securitisation focused on Irish properties. Finance Ireland, the non-bank lender owned 48% by Pimco and 42% by M&G, is the sponsor, which comprises 110 non-recourse commercial property loans to 68 borrowers secured against 234 properties across the Republic of Ireland.\n\nCMBS transactions appear to be becoming more plentiful and diverse in terms of the borrower in response to more competitive pricing.\n\nCMBS deals priced tighter as 2024 progressed thanks to falling interest rates. There were five European deals in the year, totalling \u20ac2.3 billion, meaning this year's transactions already total more than half of last year's and more than 2023 and 2022 put together. The only deal that did not involve Blackstone last year was Vantage\u2019s \u00a3600 million data centre CMBS. Three of Blackstone's transactions involved logistics properties, underlining investor demand for the asset class.\n\nIn 2023, there were three CMBS transactions, totalling \u20ac909 million, 40% less than the \u20ac1.5 billion issued in the first four months of 2022, before the market shut down. The figures are way down on the \u20ac7 billion issued in 2021.",

            "content": "Bank of America has lagged its peers since the lender's stellar fourth-quarter earnings report, leading some analysts to speculate that Berkshire Hathaway , the biggest investor in the nation's second-largest bank, has been quietly offloading shares again. Since its latest quarterly report on Jan. 16, Bank of America shares are little changed, compared to a 2% gain for the S & P 500 and a 4% advance for SPDR S & P Bank ETF (KBE) over the same span. The underperformance is even more notable since Bank of America posted results that topped expectations thanks to better-than-expected investment banking and interest income. Fourth-quarter profit more than doubled to $6.67 billion, or 82 cents per share, from a year earlier. Closely-watch net interest income rose 3% to $14.5 billion, topping estimates by about $170 million. BAC KBE 1M mountain Bank of America has lagged a leading bank ETF over the past month Two Wall Street analysts believe that the weak performance is due to continued selling pressure from Warren Buffett's conglomerate. \"Is Warren in the room with us now?\" Truist Securities' John McDonald asked in a note to clients. \"Some investors are questioning whether part of the post-4Q underperformance is selling pressure from Berkshire Hathaway,\" after large sales in the second half of 2024, he said. Reducing the stake Last year, Omaha-based Berkshire began a selling spree in what had once been its second-biggest stock holding behind Apple . Berkshire ultimately reduced its stake to below 10%, at which point it was no longer required to report what are known as \"related transactions\" in a timely manner. Wolfe Research's Steven Chubak said the recent price action in BofA \"strongly indicates\" that Berkshire has continued to reduce its position. \"While it's still too soon to give the all clear, we sense investors are growing more comfortable handicapping this technical overhang, and would look to lean in gradually as we are confident the stock will inflect [and the ] valuation gap will narrow, but [are] less certain on timing,\" Chubak said in a note. Investors will get a clearer picture when Berkshire releases its 13F filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 14, which will show its stock market holdings as of the end of 2024. Buffett's widely-read annual letter to shareholders, to be released at the end of this month, might also reveal what the latest thinking is by the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" on the markets in general and Bank of America in particular. Chubak estimated that Berkshire's next 13F could show a leaner position of about 7% at the end of 2024, and guesses the holding today might be closer to 5.5% or 6%. Buffett famously bought $5 billion of Bank of America preferred stock and warrants in 2011 to shore up confidence in the embattled lender in the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis. He converted the warrants to common stock in 2017, making Berkshire the largest shareholder in the bank. Buffett then added 300 million more shares to his investment in 2018 and 2019. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.",

            "content": "5 Mins Read\n\nDriven by climate-related disruptions, America\u2019s largest banks face financial risks of up to $9.3B from their investment in livestock agriculture.\n\nBy lending money to some of the world\u2019s biggest meat and dairy companies, US banks aren\u2019t just hurting the planet, but also their bottom lines.\n\nSince 2023, 58 American banks have provided at least $134B in loans and underwriting to animal protein and feed producers, and 55% of this sum ($74B) has come from just three institutions. Bank of America, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase are the largest US-based lenders for livestock farming, but the climate crisis they\u2019re exacerbating is putting their money at risk.\n\nNearly 90% of the outstanding financing provided by these \u2018Big Three\u2019 banks faces climate-related risks, while the 31 companies that benefit from this capital \u2013 including Nestl\u00e9, JBS, Tyson Foods, Fonterra, and Danone \u2013 themselves stand to lose up to $5.4T, according to a new report by Dutch research group Profundo.\n\nIt analysed financial data from 2016 to 2023 and used climate scenario modelling to calculate both near-term and long-term risks to both the banks and their beneficiaries, considering factors like deforestation impacts, greenhouse gas emissions, water scarcity, and supply chain risks due to weather volatility.\n\n\u201cThe analysis and the numbers are a wake-up call: continued investment in this unsustainable industry creates very high externalized climate damage costs as well as potential high cash costs,\u201d said Gerard Rijk, senior equity analyst at Profundo and a lead researcher for the study. \u201cThese hurt the planet as well as the portfolios of banks and asset managers.\u201d\n\nBig Three face up to $9.3B in long-term losses\n\nCourtesy: FromtheNorth/Ben Sutherland/Bloomberg/Patricia Enciso via Flickr/CC, Getty Images\n\nThe report suggests that in the near term (to 2030), the 31 corporations analysed could face $116B in losses, representing 44% of their gross debt. For the Big Three banks \u2013 whose outstanding financial exposure here is valued at $10.4B \u2013 this translates to a risk in the range of $430M to $1.1B.\n\nIn the long term, the numbers really rack up. The meat, dairy and feed producers face a risk in the range of $536B to $5.4T by 2050. These potential losses comprise 58% of their enterprise value at the lower end, and 581% at the higher end.\n\nThere are more factors that influence the long-term risks \u2013 in addition to higher feed costs and volume changes, livestock farming companies could also face carbon taxes, higher interest rates, declining consumer demand, and reputation loss.\n\nBank of America, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase, meanwhile, are confronted with financial risks between $2.3B and $9.3B in the long term. But by ending financing as soon as loans are redeemed, the Big Three can reduce these risks by 83-95%.\n\n\u201cFinancial institutions must act swiftly to mitigate these risks by shifting capital toward more sustainable food systems,\u201d said Kelly McNamara, senior research and policy analyst at climate non-profit Friends of the Earth US, which supported the report.\n\n\u201cThe tools to redirect investments toward environmentally sustainable practices that benefit consumers, the climate and the global economy are already within our reach. The real question is: do major financial institutions have the will to use them?\u201d she added.\n\nHow banks can halt climate risks and emissions\n\nCourtesy: Erik McGregor\n\nThe study notes that Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase have joined the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) and committed to aligning their financed emissions with net-zero pathways. But while agriculture is among the high-emitting sectors for which NZBA signatories are required to set 2050 net-zero targets, no bank has taken this step.\n\n\u201cThe data is clear: climate risk is financial risk. By significantly curtailing or ending financing to a small number of high-emitting companies in the agricultural sector, the Big Three and any other lenders or investors in the sector can limit exposure to climate-related losses and make significant progress on their net-zero commitments,\u201d the report reads.\n\nThe Big Three\u2019s lending to these companies represents just 0.25% of their total outstanding loans, but roughly 11% of their reported financed emissions \u2013 so taking action on a tiny portion of their portfolios will have an outside impact on their path to net zero.\n\nThe report recommends these banks curtail and ultimately end financing that enables the expansion of livestock farming. To do so, they need to stop issuing new corporate or project-based financing or revolving credit facilities to meat, dairy or feed producers, and not renew existing loans or facilities either. The banks should also refrain from underwriting bonds or IPOs and halt new investments in their publicly traded securities.\n\nAccording to Profundo, banks should require clients to disclose 100% of their emissions across scopes 1, 2 and 3, set near- and long-term absolute reduction targets, and prioritise methane cuts with a pledge to decrease emissions by at least 30% by 2030 (from 2020 levels). These companies should also lower emissions by reducing the number of animals in their supply chains, and without relying on carbon credits or offsets.\n\nCourtesy: The Nature Conservancy\n\nBank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase were also among the banks that left the Equator Principles, a set of minimum standards and safeguards to identify and manage the potential ESG impacts of financing high-polluting projects, after political pressure last year.\n\nThat said, in November, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s head of nature and biodiversity, Gwen Yu, highlighted the importance of filing the $700B nature funding gap: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a significant increase in client demand for products that incorporate nature, so we\u2019re excited to be part of these global dialogues and share our expertise on how banks can help facilitate capital towards nature-related projects.\u201d",

            "content": "Bank of America has a rich history dating back to 1800 and even earlier. It was begun by immigrants as a group of separate and unrelated banks that, over the years, merged and grew together. One such is the Bank of Italy which was founded in 1904 by Amadeo Giannini to serve Italian immigrants that were facing discrimination. He later buys out the Banca de America e de Italia (Bank of America and Italy) which was also located in San Francisco. Over the years additional mergers and changes in Federal banking legislation, as well as the boom brought on by WWI and then WWII, helped boost the bank to national prominence.\n\nThings turned sour, however, in 1998 with a major bond default that led to yet another merger, this time with Charlotte, NC-based Nations Bank to officially become the Bank of America that exists today. At the time, the merger was the largest bank merger in history and the company has only grown in the time since.\n\nOther additions to the new Bank of America include MBNA (a major credit card operator), Fleet Boston (then the US 7th largest and one of its oldest banks), and Merril Lynch, now Merril, which was added to the group in 2008 to provide an investment banking branch. Together the company dominates as one of the Big Four Banks in America. Bank of America lays claim to nearly 11% of all US deposits which ranks in line with its peer group and Bank of America Securities is listed as the world\u2019s 3rd largest investment bank.\n\nToday, Bank of America Corporation provides banking and financial services for individuals, small businesses, institutions, corporations, and governments worldwide. The bank operates in three segments Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, and Global Banking bringing in a combined revenue greater than $90 billion in 2022.\n\nAs of 2022, Bank of America serves approximately 67 million consumer and small business clients with approximately 4,200 retail financial centers. The bank also operates more than 16,000 ATMs and digital banking platforms with approximately 41 million active users.\n\nIts Consumer Banking segment offers traditional banking and investment products for retail clients. These range from deposit accounts to savings, credit cards, consumer loans, and IRAs. The Global Wealth & Investment Management segment offers investment and wealth management solutions including, brokerage, banking, and trust and retirement products. The Global Banking segment provides lending products and services, including commercial loans and leases for businesses of all varieties. The Global Markets segment offers market-making, clearing, settlement, and custody services, as well as risk management, derivatives, and FX exchange services.",

            "content": "Major US and Canadian banks have abandoned an industry-led climate alliance aimed at aligning net zero targets with global goals.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBefore Trump signed the order to exit the Paris Agreement, six of the biggest banks in North America pulled out of the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA).\n\nBank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo all announced that they would be leaving the coalition in December 2024 and early January.\n\nIn late January, a number of Canadian banks followed their US counterparts. Five of the country\u2019s top banks - TD Bank, Bank of Montreal, National Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Scotiabank - also left the alliance.\n\nThese departures have left many questions about the future of banking\u2019s climate ambitions. While 135 financial institutions remain in the alliance \u2013 including all of Europe\u2019s major banks \u2013 it\u2019s unclear how it will now move forward.\n\nWhat is the Net Zero Banking Alliance and why are banks leaving it?\n\nThe NZBA is a group of leading global banks committed to aligning their lending, investment and capital markets activities with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n\nLaunched in 2021 with 43 founding members, NBZA was convened by the UN Environment Programme\u2019s finance initiative but is led by the banks themselves. Citigroup, one of the major US banks to exit the alliance, was one of these founding members.\n\nPaddy McCully, senior analyst at NGO Reclaim Finance, says the spread of \u201cTrumpism\u201d \u2013 even before his reelection \u2013 is to blame. This hostile political climate has put particular pressure on US firms to leave the alliance, while Canadian institutions with widespread US presence are also vulnerable.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House, Monday, 20 January, 2025. AP Photo/Evan Vucci\n\n\u201cState-level attorneys general have been launching various threats against banks and investors if they make any noise or indicate concerns about climate change, or suggest they might do anything about it,\u201d he explains.\n\nLegal threats came from attorneys general in Republican states, who claimed the coalition was in breach of competition laws. It pushed some major banks to the brink of leaving in 2022. Instead, the NZBA clarified that none of their recommendations were compulsory and they stayed.\n\nThe straw that sort of broke the camel's back was Trump getting elected. Paddy McCully Senior analyst at NGO Reclaim Finance\n\n\u201cThe big banks at least had held off against these attacks and they remained part of the NZBA despite the right-wing criticising them for it,\u201d says McCully.\n\n\u201cBut obviously the straw that sort of broke the camel's back was Trump getting elected and realising that the attacks were going to intensify.\u201d\n\nThough the rise of \u2018Trumpism\u2019 may have been the main cause of this upset in climate finance, it hardly comes as a surprise. Many of these major banks had already been delaying concrete climate action.\n\nAre European banks also going to leave the industry climate alliance?\n\nDespite the departure of their American peers, European banks appear to still be backing the NZBA. Several have already declared their intention to remain committed to the industry coalition.\n\nSlawomir Krupa, chief executive of Societe Generale, said at a press conference last Thursday that the French bank is \u201cnot planning to leave\u201d. Earlier in the week, the CEO of Credit Agricole Philippe Brassac also said that it would remain a member of NZBA stating that the \u201cclimate emergency has never been so strong\u201d.\n\nKrupa added that the exit of their American peers had given European banks \u201cthe opportunity to have a deep dialogue on a complex topic to better understand our direct but also indirect emissions\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor those more ambitious European members of the alliance, it could even provide an opportunity to act and increase the ambition of the NZBA.\n\nWill a weaker banking climate alliance impact existing climate action?\n\nA consistent lack of action from banks that were members of the alliance puts the US mass exodus into perspective. Their exit does little to change the material reality of banks\u2019 climate commitments - or lack thereof.\n\nThe policies of every bank that has left so far were already deeply insufficient for the goal of aligning their activities with net zero by 2050. And 10 of them were among the top 21 fossil fuel financiers since the Paris Agreement, according to the Banking on Climate Chaos report.\n\nJPMorgan Chase alone provided nearly $41 billion (\u20ac39.5 billion) in finance for coal, oil and gas companies in 2023.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMcCully says the Canadian banks were also \u201cjust about the worst\u201d in terms of climate commitments under the NZBA. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a huge deal for them to pull out given that they didn\u2019t really want to be there.\u201d\n\nThis reticence to commit or act has been holding back other, more ambitious members of the alliance. Three European banks \u2013 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, BNP Paribas and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole \u2013 more than halved their fossil fuel financing between 2020 and 2023. None of the policies or changes that resulted in these cuts came as a direct result of their NZBA membership.\n\nPedestrians approach JP Morgan Chase headquarters in New York. AP Photo/Peter Morgan, File\n\nTriodos, an ethical bank based in the Netherlands, is one of the more progressive NZBA members. It has long been calling for the coalition to be more ambitious with its commitments.\n\nThe ethical bank views the exodus as an opportunity for the remaining members to do more \u2013 now that they are not being held back by their American counterparts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cTheir departure is distressing because it reduces our scope for action, but it also provides an opportunity for a strong \u2018coalition of the willing\u2019 to take the NZBA forward and show what climate action really looks like,\u201d chief commercial officer and member of Triodos\u2019s executive board Jacco Minnaar writes in an article on the bank\u2019s website.\n\nPreviously, he says, seemingly more committed banks ran the risk of condoning the lack of action and ambition from others in the alliance. Minnaar also adds that relying solely on voluntary efforts allows policymakers to \u201cshirk their responsibilities\u201d.\n\nMcCully thinks the remaining members are likely to stay quiet until the dust settles. After that, however, depending on how the political winds shift across Europe and the rest of the world, there\u2019s a window of opportunity for a positive outcome.\n\n\u201cEuropean banks have said in the past they wanted more ambition but were being held back by the US banks because they were refusing to accept any more ambition and pushing to make the NZBA as weak as possible,\u201d he explains.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIf those European banks were true to what they were saying 18 months ago, then they would be pushing for more ambition.\u201d",

These homes are often sold at lower-than-market prices to recover the outstanding loan balance. While this may sound intimidating, it actually offers an opportunity to secure valuable properties at reduced costs.\n\nWhy Choose an REO Property?\n\nAffordable Pricing: REO homes are typically priced competitively, often providing significant savings for buyers. Streamlined Purchase: Transactions with banks are often quicker and more straightforward than traditional home sales. Potential for Equity: With proper renovations, buyers can increase the property\u2019s value significantly, turning it into a lucrative long-term investment. Reduced Competition: Compared to traditional listings, REO properties may see fewer bids, making it easier for buyers to secure a deal.\n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Buying This Spacious Dream Home\n\nStep 1: Research the Property\n\nVisit the Bank of America Real Estate Center to view detailed listings and photographs. Check property reports, including taxes, liens, and any existing maintenance issues. Understanding the home\u2019s history and current condition is crucial before moving forward.\n\nStep 2: Get Pre-Approved for Financing\n\nWhile REO homes are affordable, securing pre-approval for a mortgage will make your offer more attractive to the bank. This process also provides clarity on your budget, ensuring you can comfortably manage payments. Contact local lenders or consult Bank of America\u2019s mortgage services for personalized advice.\n\nStep 3: Work with a Real Estate Agent\n\nPartner with an agent experienced in REO properties to navigate the purchasing process. They can assist with:\n\nScheduling viewings to evaluate the property\u2019s condition firsthand.\n\nNegotiating the best price while considering your budget.\n\nManaging paperwork, ensuring all legal requirements are met.\n\nTheir expertise can save you time and provide invaluable insights into making a wise purchase.\n\nStep 4: Conduct an Inspection\n\nHire a licensed home inspector to evaluate the property\u2019s condition. While REO homes are sold \u201cas-is,\u201d an inspection can help identify potential renovation costs. Knowing what repairs are needed ahead of time allows you to plan your budget more effectively and negotiate any required adjustments.\n\nStep 5: Make an Offer\n\nSubmit a competitive but reasonable offer through your agent. Keep in mind that the bank\u2019s priority is recovering its investment, so flexibility is key. If there are multiple offers, having a pre-approved mortgage and offering a quick closing timeline can make your bid more attractive.\n\nBenefits of Living in Boynton Beach\n\nA Perfect Place for Families\n\nBoynton Beach boasts excellent schools, community parks, and a welcoming environment for families.

            "content": "Upon landing in a foreign country, expect a lot of lines. There\u2019s immigration, passport control and customs inspection. But there\u2019s one line you can \u2014 and absolutely should \u2014 skip: the airport currency exchange.\n\nNot only does the airport currency exchange counter\u2019s line cut into precious time abroad, but it\u2019s typically a terrible money move. Airport currency exchange rates are among the worst you\u2019ll find.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to see airport exchanges charging 14% more than the current International Monetary Fund (IMF) exchange rate. NerdWallet even found some premiums exceeding 17%. Some also charge additional fees on top of the poor exchange rate.\n\nSo what do you do if you need cash upon arrival to order a cab or tip the bellhop? Consider ordering foreign currency before you fly.\n\nMost banks allow you to order foreign currencies, which you can typically pick up at a local branch before your trip. Some banks offer to ship currencies to you, and sometimes they don\u2019t even charge extra for postage if you order a certain amount.\n\nPlus, the exchange rate are usually quite good. For instance, at Bank of America, the exchange rates we checked in January 2024 average roughly 6% more than the IMF rates \u2014 and less than half of what the airport currency exchanges are charging.\n\nJust check your own bank's exchange rate to ensure it's optimal before initiating the transaction.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: The best travel credit cards right now\n\nHow to order foreign currency from your bank\n\nWhile the exact process varies by bank, most major banks make it easy to order online.\n\nTypically you can access the currency exchange webpage through your bank\u2019s website or mobile app, or by phone. From there, you usually enter the currency you need, add the desired amount, select the pickup method and place your order.\n\nWhile you can generally expect a solid exchange rate, use a trusted source such as Reuters or the International Monetary Fund to find current exchange rates and ensure you get a fair deal.\n\nAdditionally, understand all the fees involved. For example, Citi charges a $5 service fee for transactions under $1,000, though it\u2019s waived for clients with premium bank accounts.\n\nOr you might get charged a shipping fee. Bank of America\u2019s standard shipping costs $7.50, but overnight shipping is $20. Sometimes you can avoid shipping fees by opting to pick up the cash at a local branch or by being a loyal customer. Bank of America Preferred Rewards program members get free standard shipping.\n\nThere\u2019s also generally a minimum amount of foreign currency you can order ($100 or $200 is common) and a maximum ($10,000 within a 30-day period is common).\n\nOther good ways to pay abroad\n\nIf it\u2019s too late to order foreign currency from your bank, here are other ways to curtail currency fees:\n\nFind an in-network ATM abroad\n\nMajor banks usually have branches abroad or partner with other banks to create a network. Using those ATMs often provides a decent exchange rate while eliminating out-of-network ATM fees.\n\nIf you end up using a non-network ATM, pay attention to ATM fees, which vary but usually run about $5 per transaction. Given that, consider limiting ATM debit transactions by withdrawing the amount you think you\u2019ll need for the entire trip, or at least a large portion of it.\n\nATM availability is more common in some places than others. Macau has the highest number of ATMs per capita with 316 ATMs per 100,000 adults, based on 2021 data from the World Bank Group. Uruguay, Canada and Austria are other destinations with the most ATMs per capita.\n\nBut other countries tend to have far fewer. For example, Kenya had fewer than 7 ATMs per 100,000 adults and Nepal had only 20 ATMs per 100,000 adults, according to the same data.\n\nPay with a credit card that doesn\u2019t charge foreign transaction fees\n\nDepending on the card, you might get dinged with foreign transaction fees of 1%-3% when you make purchases at non-U.S. retailers abroad.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s wise to carry a no-foreign-transaction-fee credit card abroad.\n\nCards without foreign transaction fees Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card NerdWallet Rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

In this position, the announcement said, Hood will serve as acting comptroller of the currency.\n\n\u201cThe strong leadership and career experience of Rodney Hood will strengthen the OCC\u2019s efforts to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system while also enhancing economic growth,\u201d said Bessent.\n\nHood has served two tenures on the National Credit Union Administration Board, serving as the board\u2019s chair under the first Trump administration. He has also held senior roles in retail finance, commercial banking, affordable housing, and community development at the likes of JPMorgan Chase, GE Capital, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo.\n\n\u201cI remain steadfastly committed to serving the American people and the banking system by creating a regulatory structure that fulfills our obligations, fosters innovation, and promotes financial inclusion, including those Americans who have been debanked and underserved,\u201d Hood said in the announcement.\n\nAs PYMNTS wrote late last year, a number of figures in the cryptocurrency and FinTech space have been warning about \u201cdebanking,\u201d accusing the industry of shutting out conservatives from financial services.\n\n\u201cAt the heart of the issue is potentially the lack of a clear, comprehensive regulatory framework to address the unique risks posed by the FinTech and cryptocurrency industries,\u201d that report said. \u201cFinancial institutions, tasked with navigating a labyrinth of overlapping and often contradictory rules themselves, can commonly be left with little incentive to take on high-risk clients when the compliance burden could outweigh any potential gains.\u201d\n\nHood\u2019s appointment comes amid some major changes to the government\u2019s approach to financial regulation, including the recent freeze on enforcement efforts by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).\n\n\u201cCommunity banks have suffered immensely as increased regulatory requirements force them to devote more and more resources to lawyers and check-the-box compliance programs instead of serving their customers,\u201d Rep.

            "content": "There's still plenty of stocks to buy ahead of earnings, according to Bank of America. The firm named several companies it says are \"compelling\" such as Nvidia. The other buy-rated stocks include: JD.com, Block and Toronto-Dominon. Toronto-Dominion Toronto-Dominion Bank was recently upgraded to buy from neutral by analyst Ebrahim Poonawala. The Canadian bank had been under scrutiny for failing to properly maintain its anti-money-laundering unit, but Poonawala said the company is turning a corner following a series of fines and penalties imposed by the U.S. Department of Justice. New CEO Raymond Chun took the helm on Feb. 1, bolstering Poonawala's confidence in the stock. He expects the new executive will help drive the franchise \"toward improved profitability,\" he wrote. Shares are up 8% this year and remain attractive, he said. \"We believe the stock is more than adequately discounting downside risks, while giving little credit for improved execution,\" Poonawala wrote. Toronto-Dominion will report earnings in late February. JD.com The China-based e-commerce company really is firing on all cylinders, according to analyst Joyce Ju and team. JD shares are up almost 75% over the past year with plenty more room to run, the firm says. \"Direct sales revenues are estimated to grow 10.5% YoY, driven by 10.6% growth in electronic and home appliances sales and 10.3% growth in general merchandise sales,\" she wrote. Further, Ju estimates that other services revenue like logistics will be markedly higher. The firm likes JD's direct sales model as well as its third-party marketplace capabilities. \"JD.com should grow moderately faster than the industry average off a lower base, driven by diversification of product categories and expansion in business models,\" she wrote. JD is scheduled to report earnings in early March. Block Analyst Jason Kupferberg is standing by Block this year as a slew of positive metrics shows the fintech payment company is extremely well positioned. \"We are bullish on [Block's] full-fledged dual-sided ecosystem,\" he wrote referring to its financial apps, Cash App and Square. The latter is primarily used by businesses. The firm says the stock is just not getting enough credit from investors. \"[Block's] combination of top-line growth and profitability (best among large-caps) is underappreciated in our view...,\" he added. Kupferberg acknowledged the company's Feb. 20 earnings report might not be a significant event for the stock as shares are up almost 25% over the last 12 months. Still, the firm says it sees more upside ahead. Nvidia \"Expect Q4 eps call to reassure on CY25 outlook. Reiterate Buy, top pick ahead of NVDA's FQ4'25 (Jan) earnings call scheduled for 26-Feb. We expect modest beat/inline sales guidance and lower GM in FQ1 (Apr) given Blackwell product transition/China restrictions.\" Block \"[ Block ]'s combination of top-line growth and profitability (best among large-caps) is underappreciated in our view, and as a US-centric re-acceleration story, we believe shares can outperform in '25. ... .We are bullish on [Block's] full-fledged dual-sided ecosystem. We believe the stock is not being given enough credit for the general resilience the business has shown to date as well as its opex discipline.\" Toronto-Dominion \"We are upgrading our rating on (Toronto-Dominion) TD Bank-TD to Buy from Neutral on increased confidence that new leadership under CEO Raymond Chun can fix the US AML issues while driving the franchise toward improved profitability relative to our current forecast. ... .We believe the stock is more than adequately discounting downside risks, while giving little credit for improved execution.\" JD.com \"Direct sales revenues are estimated to grow 10.5% YoY, driven by 10.6% growth in electronic and home appliances sales and 10.3% growth in general merchandise sales. ... .JD.com should grow moderately faster than the industry average off a lower base, driven by diversification of product categories and expansion in business models.\"",

The bank\u2019s analysts have labeled Nvidia as a \u201ccompelling\u201d investment, citing its strong position in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, robust financial performance, and future growth potential.Nvidia has become the leader in AI-driven technology, with its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) powering AI applications worldwide. The demand for its AI chips has surged, with companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Google relying on Nvidia\u2019s hardware for their AI advancements.According to BofA analyst Vivek Arya, Nvidia\u2019s earnings potential remains strong, and the market is underestimating the impact of its latest AI chips. He has raised the stock\u2019s price target from $165 to $190, indicating a potential upside of nearly 39% from its current level (CNBC).Nvidia has delivered remarkable stock performance over the past year, tripling its value as the AI sector expands. Analysts expect the company to generate at least $200 billion in free cash flow over the next two years, strengthening its ability to invest in research and development.The company\u2019s upcoming earnings report will be crucial. Wall Street estimates suggest Nvidia could continue its growth streak, with revenue expected to surpass $30 billion this quarter, reflecting the high demand for AI-powered GPUs.Nvidia dominates the AI chip market, holding over 80% of the GPU segment for AI workloads.Companies investing in AI, including OpenAI and Amazon, use Nvidia\u2019s chips.Nvidia is projected to quintuple its earnings per share by 2027, making it a long-term growth stock.Out of 64 analysts surveyed, none have a sell rating on Nvidia.Bank of America cites AI chip demand, strong cash flow, and growth potential.BofA raised it to $190, predicting a 39% upside.",

(NYSE:DT) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nThe evolving space of AI has been a major focus these days, as experts and executives are weighing in on how it is reshaping the tech sector. From the rise of open-source models to the shift towards AI agents that perform tasks autonomously, AI is quickly transforming industries. Advancements in large language models are continuing to progress and companies are rethinking their strategies, with some seeing AI as a commodity and others exploring new ways to harness its potential. At the same time, regulatory shifts and market reactions to these technological developments, like the introduction of DeepSeek's R1 model, are creating both opportunities and challenges for the future of AI in tech.\n\nAI Investments and the Future of Tech Stocks\n\nFinancial Markets analyst, Fiona Cincotta recently discussed AI's impact on tech earnings and the regulatory environment under the new Trump administration on Bloomberg Technology. She highlighted that AI continues to be the main focus for investors, who are eager to see returns from the significant investments made in the sector. The optimism surrounding AI has helped maintain high stock valuations, as investors expect the potential for cost reductions in the future. However, Cincotta noted a divergence between software and hardware companies, with software firms benefiting from fewer restrictions, while chipmakers could face challenges due to tariffs and export limitations.\n\nWhen talking about regulation, Cincotta mentioned that a potential reduction in regulation under the new administration could benefit the tech industry, especially in AI, where regulation is still an open question. She suggested that decreased regulation would likely boost stock prices in the tech sector.\n\nShe also discussed investor expectations, especially the pressure to see results from AI investments. While AI spending is still seen as crucial, the recent unveiling of DeepSeek raised questions about the sustainability of such investments. Investors are optimistic for now, but as we approach mid-2025, they will expect stronger revenue streams and profit margins. She pointed out that some Big Tech stocks are under scrutiny, with investors looking for solid financial returns as a measure of success. Nevertheless, the Mag7 tech stocks remain a focal point for investor interest.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Meanwhile, Bank of America strategist Hartnett is claiming that the outperformance of the US stock market may begin fading soon, according to a Bloomberg report.The concept and narrative about the booming US stock market are slowly changing, and the equity markets of other countries, including the likes of Brazil, Germany, the UK, China, and Canada have yielded significantly better returns than the US in recent times, according to strategists including Hartnett. The biggest reason for the same could be because of the sudden faltering of the Magnificent 7 stocks including likes of Apple, Microsoft, and others, says Bloomberg.Some investors may take their chances at markets beyond Wall Street, especially in the UK, whose markets are yielding comparatively better returns this year to date. Meanwhile, there are concerns that Treasury yields could drop by nearly 4% as President Donald Trump looks to tackle government spending after he came to power at the White House.The Magnificent Seven stocks are a group of seven high-performing assets, including the likes of Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and many more.No, the US stock market has slumped slightly in recent while, but there has been no major crash yet.",

He doubts U.S. stocks will continue to outpace global markets, citing an expected slowdown in government spending and tighter immigration policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFiscal spending has been high in recent years, but President Trump is now pushing for extensive cuts, even creating the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), now led by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\nHartnett has advised investors to seek cheaper international markets instead of pursuing overpriced U.S. stocks. He noted that equities from Brazil, Germany, the UK, and Canada have provided higher returns than Wall Street\u2019s S&P 500-listed stocks.",

The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nThe Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card offers several ways to maximize your rewards \u2014 including earning double points when you book travel through the Bank of America\u00ae Travel Center. But the most significant boost comes from having one or more investment accounts with Merrill. And the more money you have in those accounts, the bigger your rewards.\n\nHere's how to make the most of the Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card.\n\nGet the loyalty bonus\n\nWith the Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card, everyone gets 1.5 points for every $1 spent on most purchases. Enroll in the Bank of America Preferred Rewards\u00ae program, and the bonuses increase to 25%, 50% or 75%, depending on your combined balances at Bank of America\u00ae and Merrill:\n\nProgram tier Required balance Relationship bonus Gold $20,000 to $49,999. 25%. Platinum $50,000 to $99,999. 50%. Platinum Honors $100,000 to $999,999. 75%. Diamond $1,000,000 to $9,999,999. 75%. Diamond Honors $10 million or more. 75%.\n\nSay you spend $1,000 a month on the card, or $12,000 a year. At 1.5 points per dollar, you'd earn $180 in rewards. Bonuses really start to climb when you have Preferred Rewards status:\n\nPreferred Rewards level Rewards boost Points per $1 spent Annual points ($12,000 in spending) None \u2014 1.5 18,000 Gold 25% 1.875 22,500 Platinum 50% 2.25 27,000 Platinum Honors, Diamond or Diamond Honors 75% 2.625 31,500\n\nGetting the loyalty bonus is a simple way to boost your rewards, but, of course, simple isn't the same as easy. Having $20,000, $50,000 or $100,000 in combined accounts is easy to say, hard to do.\n\nUse the Travel Center\n\nThe Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card boosts your rewards to 3 points per $1 spent on travel booked through the Bank of America\u00ae Travel Center. That includes flights, hotel nights, rental cars \u2014 everything except insurance. There's no limit on the extra points you can earn this way.\n\nThe card also comes with a solid sign-up promotion, so make sure you spend enough to qualify for it: 25,000 online bonus points after you make at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of account opening - that can be a $250 statement credit toward travel purchases.. Other travel cards offer bigger sign-up bonuses, but those cards typically come with an annual fee. You can't beat the Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card's annual fee of $0. Like most travel credit cards, this card doesn't charge a foreign transaction fee.\n\nTake an interest rate break\n\nNew cardholders get an interest rate break: 0% Intro APR for 15 billing cycles for purchases, and for any balance transfers made in the first 60 days. After the Intro APR offer ends, a Variable APR that\u2019s currently 18.24%-28.24% will apply. You'll be able to rack up points without worrying about the interest piling up, too.\n\nYou should be aware, though, that balance transfers will incur a fee: 3% for 60 days from account opening, then 4%.\n\nHow to redeem rewards on the Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card\n\nIt's just as easy to redeem points as it is to earn them. Simply make a restaurant or travel-related purchase with your card, then redeem your points for statement credit to offset the purchase. Points are worth 1 cent apiece when redeemed for travel. And when you think \"travel\" purchases, think outside the box. The Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card's definition of travel is wider than many other cards', including amusement parks, art galleries, circuses, aquariums, zoos and many other things as travel expenses.\n\nThe ability to redeem for credit against restaurant and travel purchases offers tremendous flexibility. You can book travel any way you want, fly on any airline, stay at any hotel.

            "content": "A handful of companies are prime candidates to split their stock in the near future, according to Bank of America, which could allow shares to double the average market return, if history is any guide. Jared Woodard of Bank of America Securities pointed out that companies are splitting their stock at a pace that hasn't been seen in more than ten years in recent months. And he notes there could be more ahead as S & P 500 stocks with lofty share prices above $500 equates to 14% of the broad market index. To be sure, stock splits do not fundamentally change anything about a company. A stock split cuts the share price (typically in half) and increases the total amount of outstanding shares without altering shareholder equity. However, splitting a stock is typically a signal of future outperformance, Woodard's research shows, and he cited BofA research that implies a return for the shares between 20% and 25% in the next twelve months. That outpaces the average 12% return over the same time period for the broader market, Woodard noted. \"I think stock splits in some ways are kind of a triumph for democracy, because they make a successful company available to a broader base of shareholders,\" Woodard told CNBC's \" The Exchange \" on Tuesday . \"Whatever the short-term noise might be, historically stock splits are a sign of strength for a company.\" Here's a look at some of the stocks BofA pegged as split candidates, which the firm identified through the following criteria: Share price is above $500 Shares have notched a higher historical average return over a one-year to five-year timeframe compared to stocks that split in that same period. The firm reasons that strong recent returns makes it more likely for the stock to split. Streaming giant Netflix made the list. The stock closed at $994.87, which puts it well above BofA's $500 per share criteria. Shares have advanced 77% over the past year. The company hasn't had any issue flexing its muscles and showing off its fundamental strength. Netflix's most recent quarterly results saw the firm notch another beat on the top and bottom line, while boasting 300 million paid memberships. Netflix also raised its full-year revenue outlook. NFLX 1Y mountain Netflix stock. Average analyst price targets compiled by FactSet calls for about 8% upside moving forward. Meta Platforms also made the list. Stock in the Facebook-parent company has surged about 53% over the past year, and closed at $700.49 on Tuesday. The company is coming off of a fourth-quarter beat on the top and bottom line, where Meta boasted a 21% jump in sales year-over-year. Meta also noted more than 700 million monthly active users for its MetaAI chatbot. META 1Y mountain Meta Platforms stock.

During Senator Warren\u2019s questioning, McCauley agreed with her that it would be useful to have more transparency into the problem like the CFPB\u2019s consumer complaints database provides and agreed with her that people who are illegitimately debanked deserve some rules to protect them and an appeals process if they lose access to their accounts.\n\nTranscript of Senator Warren\u2019s opening remarks and questioning below:\n\nThank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding today\u2019s hearing on de-banking. It is a real problem, and I hope it is something we can work on together.\n\nPeople need access to a bank account in order to thrive in today\u2019s economy. The same goes for businesses. Without a banking account, you really can't get along.\n\n\u201cDe-banking\u201d happens when a bank shuts down a customer\u2019s bank account because they think that account poses a financial, legal, or reputational risk to the bank. Once the bank shuts someone out, they may share that information with companies that get paid to maintain a Do Not Bank list\u2014with the result that the customer is blacklisted everywhere.\n\nFor me, this is straightforward. It doesn\u2019t matter who you voted for, what you believe, or the origin of your last name\u2014people shouldn\u2019t be arbitrarily denied access to their banks, locked out of their accounts, or stripped of their banking privileges.\n\nTo help identify what is going on, my staff reviewed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau complaint database, looking for cases where consumers reported that they were unable to open accounts or their accounts were wrongly closed\u2014classic de-banking. Mr. Chairman, we put together a supplemental memo on this data that I\u2019d like to make part of the Committee record.\n\nMy staff identified 11,955 complaints\u2014and that\u2019s only the people who took time to file complaints and only in the past three years.\n\nThey all reported common themes.\n\nNo warning.\n\nNo explanation.\n\nNo chance to dispute or appeal.\n\nThey described how one day, all of a sudden, they lost their place in the banking system.\n\nWe know from the consumer complaint hotline that millions of Americans\u2014of all political stripes\u2014have had the same experience.\n\nTens of millions of customers have been blacklisted by the banking industry because they overdrafted their account a few times.\n\nFormerly incarcerated Americans have been de-banked because of their criminal history.\n\nSome people have been de-banked for merely having the same name as someone who has a criminal history.\n\nMuslim Americans and Armenian Americans have faced de-banking on account of their last names.\n\nNon-profits and charities operating internationally have been de-banked through no fault of their own.\n\nLawful cannabis businesses have been unable to open accounts, and employees of those businesses have also been de-banked.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t be happening. So we need to figure out why, and who is responsible. My staff did some more work here as well. They found that just four big banks\u2014Bank of America, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and Citibank\u2014accounted for half of all the complaints filed at the CFPB.\n\nDonald Trump was onto a real problem when he criticized Bank of America for its de-banking practices.\n\nBanks may be taking shortcuts when it comes to assessing risks. Rather than investing time and resources to identify true criminal risks and shutting down those accounts, big banks are relying on black box algorithms and middle-men companies and shutting down accounts without doing careful due diligence.\n\nWe can prevent these abuses. I know that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a favorite whipping boy of Republicans on this Committee, but the CFPB is the main agency in our government that is actively working to stop unfair de-banking.\n\nLet me say that again: the CFPB is the one agency that is actively working to stop unfair de-banking. Right now, the agency has five different rules either in place or in progress that would help prevent de-banking by addressing some of the root causes, from overdraft fee practices to religious discrimination. And the CFPB is working to hold banks accountable when they close law-abiding citizens and businesses\u2019 accounts for no good reason.\n\nI sent a letter to President Trump today that walks through the CFPB\u2019s work. I\u2019d like to make that letter part of the Committee record. I said the CFPB is the one agency fighting back against de-banking, but that may be at risk.\n\nEarlier this week, Treasury Secretary and Acting CFPB Director Scott Bessent halted all CFPB rulemaking, enforcement investigations, and litigation against financial institutions that are breaking the law\u2014including the banks that are wrongfully de-banking their customers. The freeze Secretary Bessent has put on the CFPB means more Americans across the country will be unfairly de-banked, and they will lose the one agency that is working to help them.\n\nThere is additional work to be done by the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and other regulators to issue clear Anti-Money Laundering rules and guidance for banks to follow, which would reduce the incentive to use de-banking as a form of risk management.\n\nMr. Chairman, I\u2019ll say again: I appreciate your holding this hearing. De-banking is a real problem, and I\u2019m eager to work with you and President Trump to support the CFPB\u2019s efforts to make sure that banks treat all people fairly and that we put an end to this de-banking.\n\nTranscript of Senator Warren\u2019s questioning of witnesses Nathan McCauley, CEO and Co-Founder of Anchorage Digital and Mr. Aaron Klein, Senior Fellow in Economic Studies, Brookings Institution:\n\nSENATOR WARREN: Debanking is a real problem and we need to work across the aisle to solve it. I have a stack of stories sent in by consumers and organizations that were debanked and I would like to submit them for the record. These stories are from Muslim Americans, from cannabis businesses, from formerly incarcerated individuals, all of whom lost their bank accounts for no apparent reason. I want to talk about what kind of recourse consumers have or don't have when they are debanked.\n\nMr. McCauley, you testified that your company lost its bank account, and when you tried to open a new one, dozens of banks\u2014including some of the biggest in the country\u2014turned you down. Which of the big banks refused to offer you an account?\n\nMCCAULEY: I don't think it is productive to name individual banks. I believe the banks were the victims here.\n\nSENATOR WARREN: Okay, I just want to get it into the record because we have recourse. Did you get an opportunity to appeal that decision?\n\nMCCAULEY: No, Senator. There was no room for discussion with the banks.\n\nSENATOR WARREN: So, no appeals. That\u2019s unfortunate. The CFPB has accepted 11,955 complaints from consumers and organizations that were unable to open accounts or their accounts were wrongly closed, just in the last 3 years.\n\nDo you agree that it\u2019s useful to have a database for this information, so we can identify trends, both in the types of individuals that are being targeted and also the banks where this is happening?\n\nMCCAULEY: Senator, more data and more transparency will help.\n\nSENATOR WARREN: Okay. Good. I don't think for a second that you should be locked out of our banking system. In many cases, it is wrong for banks to close accounts and threaten your ability to make payroll or pay rent on time without providing an explanation, so long as you are following the law.\n\nMr. Mccauley, do you agree that people who are illegitimately debanked deserve rules to protect them and an appeals process if they lose their accounts?\n\nMCCAULEY: Yes, Senator. Some things should be done to make sure regulators don't do this again.\n\nSENATOR WARREN: Okay. And if banks are adopting policies that routinely debank people based on their beliefs or illegitimate reasons, that is wrong, it needs to be stopped.\n\nMr. McCauley, should consumers be protected from being debanked based on political or religious?\n\nMCCAULEY: Yes, Senator. Many individuals within the crypto industry were debanked and I wished industries would help them.\n\nSENATOR WARREN: And I presume you would carry that over to those debanked for other reasons as well\u2014because of their beliefs?\n\nMCCAULEY: Of course.\n\nSENATOR WARREN: The CFPB has been on the front lines combating debanking for years. In 2022, they added debanking to the list of illegal practices that bank examiners should be on the lookout for. Last year they wrote rules to crack down on debanking by payment apps and the third-party data aggregators that the banks used to decide who to kick out of the financial system. Last month, they proposed a rule to stop companies like PayPal that considered fining users for certain types of speech on their platform.\n\nMr Klein, how will the CFPB\u2019s rules help put a stop to unfair debanking?\n\nKLEIN: Well, Senator, the CFPB is on the forefront of looking after consumers, making sure consumers have access to high-quality and fair banking practices As opposed to bank regulators who are too often focused on the bank.\n\nI can think of five rules the bureau has: the contract rule, their UDAP, unfair discriminatory practices rule, and the larger participant rule which would give them authority over places like Venmo and Paypal, which you just described. Their data broker rule which includes credit reporting agencies like the ChexSystem, that maintained a defacto do not bank list. There is no economics to require those things to be accurate. It is simply a limited appeal process. And their overdraft rule.\n\nWhen you ask people who have lost their bank account or are out of the banking system, why don't you have a bank account? The number one reason is it's too expensive, and their overdraft fees, which some estimates were up to $30 billion a year or more, are part of the large reason people leave. Those five rules that the bureau put out would all combat debanking in various ways.\n\nSENATOR WARREN: Thank you. The CFPB is ready for this fight. Every day that the CFPB is locked out of doing its job people are getting debanked. If the president is serious about stopping debanking, he needs a strong CFPB as its partner to get this done. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",

            "content": "Nvidia should have no issue navigating headwinds tied to global trade and rising competition, allowing shares to hit a fresh all-time high, according to Bank of America. BofA reiterated a buy rating on the artificial intelligence darling, alongside a $190 price target. Bank of America's forecast implies nearly 63% upside from Monday's $116.66 close. While Nvidia stock has surged more than 76% over the past year, its shares have been under pressure so far in 2025 and have dipped 13% year to date, as the rise of DeepSeek sparked a tech sector sell-off. Investors are reevaluating the artificial intelligence trade as they try to gauge how much investment will be needed and which companies will dominate the technology. NVDA 1Y mountain Nvidia stock. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said Nvidia is still well positioned despite DeepSeek's large language model sparking questions about whether or not the tech sector's high spending for AI development is necessary. The analyst noted large customers, Meta Platforms and Microsoft , which recently reported earnings, have not pulled back on their capital expenditure plans. This suggests Nvidia's sales will continue to grow at a robust pace. Nvidia reports its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 26. While President Donald Trump on Saturday announced stiff tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico, and Beijing hit back with its own duties, set to begin on Feb. 10, the door is open for the world's largest economies to come to a new trade agreement, Arya said. At the moment, tariffs for Canada and Mexico have been placed on pause . Regardless, the analyst expects overall demand will offset any losses seen in the Chinese market. This is especially true given most global server production has shifted away from Beijing and toward Taiwan, Mexico and even the U.S., he said. \"Overall, we expect rising demand from the west (US cloud, enterprise, OpenAI Stargate etc.) to offset China headwinds for NVDA,\" Arya said. \"Some have pointed to NVDA's rising Singapore exposure but that's a 'bill-to' and not a 'ship-to' destination, per NVDA.\"",

Analysts highlighted the strong position of the company despite geopolitical tensions and trade wars.BofA believes that the breakthrough of artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek will not impact the semiconductor giant.Bank of America analysts expect Nvidia to report a lower gross margin in Q1 2025 due to restrictions in China and the transition to the Blackwell product, Investing.com reported.According to the report, Nvidia is expected to reassure investors on execution of Blackwell GPUs and signal confidence in 2025-2026. This has the potential to represent a low point in investor sentiment. The forecast for data center sales growth could go above 60 percent year-on-year.BofA analysts, in a note, highlighted that Nvidia\u2019s strong performance has been driven by derivative model training, infrastructure upgrades, artificial general intelligence (AGI), and increasing AI inference requirements. As per their note, the mix between the drivers could change over time, but the overall performance of the company will be positive.The note carried an example of Nvidia\u2019s processors and data center sales from CY18-24, stating that the growth in one sector did not impede progress in another.The note may calm investors after DeepSeek\u2019s open source AI model led to turbulence in the markets.On January 27, Nvidia recorded its biggest single-day market value loss in the American stock market, with $600 billion being wiped out, as per CNBC. The shares of the semiconductor company had tumbled after DeepSeek\u2019s latest AI model made its debut.In January, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicted that practical quantum computing was 15-30 years away. This was met with skepticism by Meta head Mark Zuckerberg. Microsoft founder Bill Gates added his own take on the matter, saying that logical quantum computing qubits may be developed in three to five years, but the process could be longer.The technology giant will reveal the data on February 26 at approximately 1:20 PM PT.The Bank of America expects that any negative impact from China will be countered by strong demand from Western markets.",

            "content": "Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.\n\nWhile cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.\n\nBank of America in Focus\n\nBased in Charlotte, Bank of America (BAC) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 5.35%. Currently paying a dividend of $0.26 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.25%. In comparison, the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield is 0.85%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.5%.\n\nLooking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.04 is up 4% from last year. In the past five-year period, Bank of America has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 8.72%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Bank of America's current payout ratio is 32%, meaning it paid out 32% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\n\nBAC is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is $3.67 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 11.89%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.\n\nBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that BAC is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).",

The last thing I could've handled would be a complicated credit card with special rewards categories or activation periods, so I find the Bank of America\u00ae Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card for Students a good choice if you want a basic, easy-to-use card.\n\nThanks to the card's structure, the following groups might benefit the most.\n\nStudents looking to earn rewards on basic college expenses\n\nYou've likely heard about credit card rewards, but you may not know how they work. Put simply, some cards give you cash back, airline miles, or points when you make a purchase. However, they can sometimes be complicated, requiring you to keep track of different categories or remember to activate special bonus categories.\n\nBy contrast, this student card is easier to manage. It simply allows you to earn an unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases you make, making it a good choice for credit card beginners. This also gives you more flexibility to get rewarded for everything from your utility bills and meals to your electronics and college bookstore purchases.\n\nStudents who need to finance a major purchase\n\nWith this Bank of America credit card, you can benefit from a 0% intro APR on purchases for 15 billing cycles, and then 18.24% - 28.24% Variable.\n\nSo, what does that mean for you? If you have a major purchase \u2014 like a new laptop for class \u2014 you can buy it with your card and have 15 billing cycles to pay it off without worrying about interest charges.\n\nOn the other hand, it could also benefit you if you've already made a big purchase on another card and want to escape high interest charges via a qualifying balance transfer. You'll just need to pay a balance transfer fee of 3% for 60 days from account opening, then 4%, to move the debt and enjoy a 0% intro APR for 15 billing cycles for any balance transfers made in the first 60 days (then 18.24% - 28.24% Variable).\n\nWhat should you know before applying?\n\nAs a college student, you likely have very little credit history. Getting a student credit card is usually easier to get than other types of credit, and managing your card responsibly \u2014 making your payments on time and keeping your balance low \u2014 could help you establish good credit.\n\nHowever, Bank of America doesn't disclose its minimum credit score requirements. When I reached out to customer support to ask about what range is required, the representative said there wasn't one they could provide and there was no way to check your eligibility without submitting a full application (and undergoing a hard credit check, which can hurt your credit).\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's a closer look at this card's top benefits\n\nThe Bank of America Unlimited Cash for Students card has some standout advantages.\n\nIntroductory APR\n\nWith the introductory APR, you can qualify for an intro APR on purchases and qualifying balance transfers. If you have a large purchase planned, like dorm furniture or a new computer or want to pay down debt and save money, the introductory APR can help. You'll just need to pay that balance off within the introductory period to avoid interest.\n\nSimple reward structure\n\nWhile some cards have complex reward structures, the Bank of America Unlimited Cash for Students card keeps it simple. You can earn one flat rewards rate of 1.5% on all purchases. This makes it a good card to use for everything from textbooks to streaming subscriptions.\n\n$0 annual fee\n\nSome credit cards charge annual fees that you must pay regardless of how often you use them. Luckily, the Bank of America Unlimited Cash for Students Card has a $0 annual fee, so there's no cost to carry it.\n\nCredit management tools\n\nSince you probably want to build credit while you're a student, this card's monthly FICO score update option is useful for tracking your progress. By using Bank of America's online banking site or mobile app, you can see your credit score and what's currently impacting it so you can take action, such as reducing debt or controlling your spending. Plus, Bank of America provides other educational resources.\n\nDrawbacks: Why you may want a different card\n\nAlthough this credit card may be useful for some students, there are some drawbacks to keep in mind.\n\nForeign transaction fees\n\nIf you plan on studying abroad or traveling for spring break, be aware that this card charges foreign transaction fees. It adds 3% to every transaction completed in another country or in a foreign currency. The competing Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card for Students doesn't.\n\nLack of other benefits\n\nSome of the best credit cards offer perks like travel insurance or cell phone protection. Those can come in handy if you're traveling abroad or if, like me, you have a tendency to drop and crack your phone. Unfortunately, the Bank of America Unlimited Cash for Students is a barebones rewards card without such features. Plus, you can't earn a higher rewards rate on certain purchases.\n\nHigh spending requirement for the welcome bonus\n\nAlthough the idea of a bonus is appealing, it comes with a catch. You can earn a $200 online cash rewards bonus after you make at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of account opening. If you're a cash-strapped college student who is just scraping by, meeting that spending requirement can be challenging, and racking up debt solely to earn a bonus isn't a good idea.\n\nEarning and redeeming cash rewards\n\nPotential earnings in years one and two\n\nHere's a look at how your cash back can add up with the Bank of America Unlimited Cash Rewards for Students card.\n\nRemember, this is an estimation. The actual value will be determined by how much you spend and in which categories you spend.\n\nYear one earnings: $409\n\nYear two earnings: $209\n\nThese values are based on the FinanceBuzz Credit Card Rewards Valuation Model, which takes a look at points earned via spending, the welcome bonus, and the annual fee.\n\nBest ways to earn\n\nUnlike other cards that have tiered rewards structures, this card pays the same cashback rate on every purchase.\n\nCategories Rewards Rate All purchases 1.5%\n\nMaximizing your redemptions\n\nYou get the same value whether you redeem your cashback rewards for statement credits, bank account deposits, or Amazon and PayPal purchases.\n\nOther cards to consider\n\nIf the Bank of America Unlimited Cash for Students card isn't for you, consider some of the other best credit cards for students.\n\nCapital One Quicksilver Student Cash Rewards Credit Card\n\nThe Capital One Quicksilver Student Cash Rewards Credit Card has a $0 annual fee, and you can earn unlimited 1.5% cash back on every purchase, every day; plus unlimited 5% cash back on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.\n\nWhere it stands out from the Bank of America Unlimited Cash for Students card is in its welcome offer and fees \u2014 you can earn $50 when you spend $100 in the first three months. This is a much more attainable spending requirement for college students.\n\nPlus, the card doesn't charge foreign transaction fees, so it's a better choice if you plan on traveling to or studying in another country.\n\nRead our full Capital One Quicksilver Student Cash Rewards review.\n\nDiscover it\u00ae Student Cash Back\n\nLike the Bank of America Unlimited Cash for Students card, the Discover it\u00ae Student Cash Back has a $0 annual fee.\n\nIf you're comfortable with more complexity, you could earn higher rewards. There's a rotating bonus category calendar that lets you earn up to 5% cash back on rotating categories each quarter, on up to $1,500 in purchases when you activate, then 1% cash back on all other purchases. While you have to remember to activate these categories, it can be worth the extra effort.\n\nPlus, Discover will match all the cash back you\u2019ve earned at the end of your first year.\n\nRead our full Discover it Student Cash Back review.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs the Bank of America Unlimited Cash for Students card worth it? This card can be a useful addition to your wallet if you want a basic, no-frills card to earn cash back on your routine purchases like textbooks or groceries, and it can help you build credit with educational tools. However, you might find a different card more worthwhile to earn a better rewards rate or access perks such as cell phone insurance and no foreign transaction fees. What credit score do I need to get a Bank of America student credit card? You typically need good-to-excellent credit to qualify for a Bank of America student credit card. That said, keep in mind that your credit score is only one factor issuers consider, and having a certain credit score doesn't guarantee your application will be approved. What is the credit limit for the Bank of America Unlimited Cash for Students card? Bank of America doesn't disclose the minimum or maximum credit limit for this credit card. Like other banks, Bank of America will likely look at your income, existing debt, and credit score to decide the limit to offer.\n\nBottom line\n\nIf you're a college student and credit card novice, the Bank of America Unlimited Cash for Students card is a good starting point. It's simple and easy to use, and you can earn rewards on everything from groceries to streaming subscriptions. Additionally, its FICO score benefit and educational resources can be appealing when you're looking to build your credit while in school.\n\nYou can likely get more value from another rewards credit card with a tiered rewards structure and additional perks if you're a more experienced card user. However, the Bank of America Unlimited Cash for Students card is appealing if you're learning to manage money on your own for the first time.",

            "content": "Donald Trump has said and done a lot of outrageous things in his short time back in office, so it is easy to overlook a brief yet bizarre exchange he had with a top American financier while addressing the World Economic Forum last month in Davos, Switzerland. But it would be dangerous to ignore the assault Trump is threatening to mount on the financial regulatory system on behalf of his Silicon Valley backers.\n\n\u201cMany conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank,\u201d Trump told Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan by video link on Jan. 23. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what.\u201d He called out Bank of America and name-checked \u201cJamie,\u201d referring to Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is wrong,\u201d the president said, providing neither specifics nor evidence, as usual.\n\nTrump\u2019s comment came out of the blue, having nothing to do with the question Moynihan had asked him. Nervous laughter enveloped the room at Davos, and Moynihan ignored the jab.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump was surfacing \u201cde-banking,\u201d a grievance among some conservatives that regulators and financial institutions routinely deny them bank accounts and other financial services for political reasons. There is no question that banks close accounts. They do it to satisfy various regulatory requirements. Yet there is little reason to believe ideology guides them.\n\nBut even if the evidence of an anti-conservative bias inside banks is thin, the de-banking theory is getting support from Trump\u2019s newfound supporters in Silicon Valley. This contingent of the MAGA movement is particularly incensed about the widespread difficulties cryptocurrency exchanges and companies have experienced in their interactions with financial institutions.\n\nThe fevered accusations of political targeting betray a willful lack of understanding of how banking regulations work. They are set up to require that financial institutions not only know the identities of their customers but also cut off clients who might be laundering money. No one should be shocked that purveyors of crypto products \u2014 whose very purpose often is anonymity, particularly with regard to government oversight \u2014 would receive a high degree of regulatory scrutiny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the concerning combination of wealth, power, a dose of paranoia and having the ear of the new administration means charges of de-banking aren\u2019t going away.\n\nOne intellectual leader of the de-banking theory is venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, a recent MAGA convert. Andreessen\u2019s comments are widely followed in Silicon Valley and beyond, and lately he has fiercely advocated what he calls \u201ctechno-optimism,\u201d the belief that technological progress can solve any problem.\n\nIn comments to right-leaning interviewers and on social media, Andreessen has been outspoken about de-banking, amplifying a claim by Melania Trump in her memoir that she had been dropped by her bank and that her son, Barron, was rejected from opening an account. (The first lady hasn\u2019t identified her bank, making it impossible to verify her claims.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndreessen has even issued a threat against \u201cdeep state\u201d regulators that it would be foolish not to take seriously. \u201cI actually think \u2026 that there actually is a pretty good case that a lot of this behavior is illegal and, further, quite possibly criminally illegal,\u201d he told journalist Bari Weiss of the Free Press in December. \u201cThere\u2019s a reasonable take that if there\u2019s been a conspiracy to deny somebody bank accounts \u2026 and specifically that the government has been involved in that, then it very well might be criminal felony behavior.\u201d Andreessen, who has a direct line to Trump and Elon Musk, is suggesting a criminal conspiracy among regulators for doing their jobs.\n\nThere are good reasons for banks to shutter accounts. \u201cBanks are at risk if they have shady customers,\u201d Anil Kashyap, an economics and finance professor at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business, told me. \u201cThey pay fines frequently.\u201d\n\nIndeed, last year Canada-based TD Bank paid an unheard-of $3 billion fine for having lax anti-money-laundering controls, even as its top officials had been warned about internal lapses. In other words, the fear of punishment for allowing criminals to use their regulated financial networks is real. Add in the built-in flimflammery of crypto markets and it makes total sense that banks would cancel accounts rather than face penalties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe law has a bunch of obligations,\u201d says Kashyap, who, despite being an expert in banking regulation, seems genuinely befuddled by the right-wing allegations. \u201cAlmost every crypto exchange has paid fines for not knowing their customers.\u201d\n\nDe-banking might seem like a fringe issue advanced by an angry corner of the electorate. But there\u2019s no mistaking the intention \u2014 and abilities \u2014 of its adherents. It is to loosen the rules that govern our system of financial security and cow the watchdogs empowered to protect it. On Feb. 5, the Senate Banking Committee, chaired by Sen. Tim Scott (R-South Carolina), is hosting a hearing on the issue. \u201cDebanking is unacceptable and un-American,\u201d Scott said in a statement. \u201cThis hearing is the first step in our efforts to hold bad actors accountable.\u201d",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stands against the other American bank stocks.\n\n2024 was a memorable year for America\u2019s banking giants. According to a recent report in the Financial Times, the seven largest banks in the country represented 56% of the industry\u2019s profits during the first nine months of the year, up from 48% during the same period in 2023.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 High Growth Financial Stocks To Invest In and 10 Best Bank Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nThe banking sector is also experiencing improved capitalization. In November, the Federal Reserve Board found that 99% of the country\u2019s banks reported capital above regulatory requirements. Moreover, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) noted a 3.5% increase in equity capital in Q3 2024, reflecting the upward trend in capitalization.\n\nGlobally, credit rating agency Moody\u2019s upgraded the overall outlook for the industry from negative to stable in December for the first time since 2023, citing interest rate cuts and monetary adjustments being made by the G-20 countries. The Federal Reserve announced three cuts last year, lowering the central bank\u2019s target interest rate to 4.25% and 4.5%.\n\nTrump\u2019s return to the White House has also raised optimism about lax regulations in the financial sector, which analysts believe can spur dealmaking activity in the banking sector. Reduced oversight and a business-friendly environment are also likely to boost revenue and loan growth, and subsequently improve banks\u2019 bottom line.\n\nThe U.S. president has also repeatedly demanded further reductions to the interest rate. Here is what he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 23.\n\nWith oil prices going down, I'll demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise they should be dropping all over the world.\n\nWhile the general outlook for the banking industry looks promising for 2025, analysts also warn of the potential risks associated with ongoing geopolitical conflicts, which can have adverse effects on the global economy. Increasing trade tensions and protectionist policies can also hurt investment inflows.\n\nOn January 31, the White House announced that President Trump would move ahead with his planned tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico, starting February 1. The 78-year-old has also threatened to impose tariffs on the EU, citing the bloc\u2019s treatment of the U.S.",

            "content": "Bank of America has a rich history dating back to 1800 and even earlier. It was begun by immigrants as a group of separate and unrelated banks that, over the years, merged and grew together. One such is the Bank of Italy which was founded in 1904 by Amadeo Giannini to serve Italian immigrants that were facing discrimination. He later buys out the Banca de America e de Italia (Bank of America and Italy) which was also located in San Francisco. Over the years additional mergers and changes in Federal banking legislation, as well as the boom brought on by WWI and then WWII, helped boost the bank to national prominence.\n\nThings turned sour, however, in 1998 with a major bond default that led to yet another merger, this time with Charlotte, NC-based Nations Bank to officially become the Bank of America that exists today. At the time, the merger was the largest bank merger in history and the company has only grown in the time since.\n\nOther additions to the new Bank of America include MBNA (a major credit card operator), Fleet Boston (then the US 7th largest and one of its oldest banks), and Merril Lynch, now Merril, which was added to the group in 2008 to provide an investment banking branch. Together the company dominates as one of the Big Four Banks in America. Bank of America lays claim to nearly 11% of all US deposits which ranks in line with its peer group and Bank of America Securities is listed as the world\u2019s 3rd largest investment bank.\n\nToday, Bank of America Corporation provides banking and financial services for individuals, small businesses, institutions, corporations, and governments worldwide. The bank operates in three segments Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, and Global Banking bringing in a combined revenue greater than $90 billion in 2022.\n\nAs of 2022, Bank of America serves approximately 67 million consumer and small business clients with approximately 4,200 retail financial centers. The bank also operates more than 16,000 ATMs and digital banking platforms with approximately 41 million active users.\n\nIts Consumer Banking segment offers traditional banking and investment products for retail clients. These range from deposit accounts to savings, credit cards, consumer loans, and IRAs. The Global Wealth & Investment Management segment offers investment and wealth management solutions including, brokerage, banking, and trust and retirement products. The Global Banking segment provides lending products and services, including commercial loans and leases for businesses of all varieties. The Global Markets segment offers market-making, clearing, settlement, and custody services, as well as risk management, derivatives, and FX exchange services.",

The company also expects to introduce at least two new products in 2025, including a lower-cost vehicle. Meanwhile, its energy storage business continues to gain traction, with deployments projected to grow by more than 50%. Additionally, Tesla recorded a $600 million mark-to-market gain on its Bitcoin holdings, a factor some investors may view as a positive. While battery pack constraints pose a challenge, the company is actively working to resolve the issue.\n\nHowever, while evidently investors liked all the above, Bank of America analyst John Murphy remains cautious, citing multiple challenges ahead. The transition to the updated Model Y will lead to weeks of lost production across all Tesla factories, weighing on Q1 results by impacting both revenue and gross margins. Murphy estimates this shift could result in a production loss of 100,000 vehicles. Additionally, declining average selling prices, attractive leasing terms, and various incentives have put sustained pressure on gross margins \u2013 a trend likely to persist as Tesla prioritizes volume growth.\n\nMurphy also views the discussion surrounding Optimus as more of a distraction, noting that while the humanoid robot holds \u201cmeaningful long-term potential,\u201d its current contribution to Tesla\u2019s valuation remains small. Meanwhile, tariffs could further squeeze profitability due to Tesla\u2019s reliance on imported parts.\n\nWhile Tesla said it is eyeing a return to growth for its core vehicle business in 2025, Murphy points out that the less defined outlook looks like a \u201cstep back\u201d from the 20-30% volume growth in 2025 Elon Musk talked about on the 3Q24 earnings call (although that was never put in writing).\n\nConsidering the results and comments made by the company, Murphy has made some small changes to his estimates. Specifically, mainly on account of the changeover of the Model Y in Q1, his 2025e EPS forecast is lowered from $3.15 to $3.05.\n\nTo this end, Murphy remains on the sidelines with a Neutral rating and a $490 price target on Tesla shares. That said, with a projected 21% upside over the next 12 months, one could argue his stance leans closer to bullish than neutral. (To watch Murphy\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThe Street\u2019s average target, on the other hand, is a more downbeat $335.44, suggesting the stock has overshot by 17%. All told, based on 12 Buys and Holds, each, and an additional 9 Sells, the analyst consensus rates TSLA stock a Hold.

            "content": "Russia transferred over $5 billion to Turkey through American banks, allegedly to finance the construction of the Akkuyu nuclear power plant. However, the United States believes that the Kremlin is trying to create an offshore reserve to finance its operations under Western sanctions.\n\nThis is reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nRussia transferred several large tranches in the months after the start of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and was planning to transfer even more. The purpose of the payments was stated to be financing the construction of the Akkuyu nuclear power plant, which is being run by \u201cRosatom\u201d. The transactions were carried out with the participation of American banks JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. The US Department of Justice drew attention to this.\n\nAmerican experts believe that the construction of Akkuyu was used to circumvent US sanctions against the Russian Central Bank, sources familiar with the situation told the WSJ. According to the publication, the money was transferred to Turkey so that the Kremlin could use it to finance its initiatives abroad.\n\nThe US has blocked several transfers worth $2 billion. In 2024, prosecutors were working on the possibility of confiscating this money as proceeds from sanctions evasion, but the administration of former President Joe Biden stopped the initiative, fearing a deterioration in relations with Turkey. After all, the country is an important US ally in the issue of prisoner exchanges, the fight against terrorism, stabilizing the situation in Syria and ending the war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe WSJ claims that the idea to use American banks in the operation belonged to the head of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation Elvira Nabiullina and other senior Russian officials. The scheme used financial institutions against which Western countries did not impose sanctions in order to avoid a collapse of global markets.\n\nIn this way, Moscow sought to create an offshore dollar reserve to finance Russian interests beyond the attention of America. According to the Kremlin\u2019s plan, the Akkuyu NPP could transfer money to Russian companies with accounts at Turkey\u2019s largest bank, Ziraat. In this case, there would be no need to conduct transactions through the United States.\n\nTurkey was interested in this scheme because it was able to attract dollars into the country, which are desperately needed to combat rising inflation. The US Department of Justice believes that one of the main aides to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the head of Turkey\u02bcs National Intelligence Organization, Ibrahim Kalin, may have been involved in the scheme. This is what made Washington fear a deterioration in relations with Ankara in the event of confiscation of the money.\n\nRosatom stated that all the transferred funds were allegedly used for the construction of Akkuyu.\n\nUnlike other NATO allies, Turkey did not impose sanctions on Russia when it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Instead, they have deepened their economic partnership. For example, Turkey has asked the US to allow it to pay for gas through Russia\u02bcs \u201cGazprombank\u201d, despite the sanctions.\n\nFor more news and in-depth stories from Ukraine please follow us on X.",

            "content": "Bank of America has a rich history dating back to 1800 and even earlier. It was begun by immigrants as a group of separate and unrelated banks that, over the years, merged and grew together. One such is the Bank of Italy which was founded in 1904 by Amadeo Giannini to serve Italian immigrants that were facing discrimination. He later buys out the Banca de America e de Italia (Bank of America and Italy) which was also located in San Francisco. Over the years additional mergers and changes in Federal banking legislation, as well as the boom brought on by WWI and then WWII, helped boost the bank to national prominence.\n\nThings turned sour, however, in 1998 with a major bond default that led to yet another merger, this time with Charlotte, NC-based Nations Bank to officially become the Bank of America that exists today. At the time, the merger was the largest bank merger in history and the company has only grown in the time since.\n\nOther additions to the new Bank of America include MBNA (a major credit card operator), Fleet Boston (then the US 7th largest and one of its oldest banks), and Merril Lynch, now Merril, which was added to the group in 2008 to provide an investment banking branch. Together the company dominates as one of the Big Four Banks in America. Bank of America lays claim to nearly 11% of all US deposits which ranks in line with its peer group and Bank of America Securities is listed as the world\u2019s 3rd largest investment bank.\n\nToday, Bank of America Corporation provides banking and financial services for individuals, small businesses, institutions, corporations, and governments worldwide. The bank operates in three segments Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, and Global Banking bringing in a combined revenue greater than $90 billion in 2022.\n\nAs of 2022, Bank of America serves approximately 67 million consumer and small business clients with approximately 4,200 retail financial centers. The bank also operates more than 16,000 ATMs and digital banking platforms with approximately 41 million active users.\n\nIts Consumer Banking segment offers traditional banking and investment products for retail clients. These range from deposit accounts to savings, credit cards, consumer loans, and IRAs. The Global Wealth & Investment Management segment offers investment and wealth management solutions including, brokerage, banking, and trust and retirement products. The Global Banking segment provides lending products and services, including commercial loans and leases for businesses of all varieties. The Global Markets segment offers market-making, clearing, settlement, and custody services, as well as risk management, derivatives, and FX exchange services.",

            "content": "Most of us are closer to homelessness than becoming a billionaire. According to a recent Bank of America survey, almost half of Americans believe they live paycheck to paycheck.\n\nComing into a large chunk of cash is a nice thought, and for some people it actually happens. A few folks are lottery winners and rolling in cash, while others get large payouts through an inheritance or a refund.\n\nRegardless of how the windfall arrives, knowing how to manage it is essential; otherwise, you could struggle to make ends meet and possibly be worse off than you were before. Here\u2019s how to handle your money if you end up with a hefty payout.\n\nUnderstand where the money is coming from\n\nHow you receive your money could impact how you handle it, particularly if it's inherited, said Elizabeth Buffardi, a financial planner, founder and president of Crescendo Financial Planners.\n\n\"Money is emotional even in the best of times,\" she said. \"Very often, [clients] tell the story of how hard the relative had to work to accumulate it and they want to make sure they honor that hard work by making sure they put it to good use.\u201d\n\nStephen Kates, a financial planner and principal financial analyst at Annuity.org, says you might need different types of accounts, depending on how you receive your money.\n\n\"If the money is in the form of a check or cash, it will be easy to deposit,\" he said. \"If it\u2019s an inheritance, you may need to open the right type of account to hold the assets.\"\n\nKates says if you inherit something like a retirement account, you\u2019ll need to open an IRA to move those funds into. If you inherit stock, you\u2019ll need a brokerage account.\n\nGet good advice\n\nNot every financial expert is the same. The kind of payout you get and how much you get can impact where you get help.\n\n\"Some people need someone to manage the money they have received,\" Buffardi said. \"Some people are looking for more advice like paying off a mortgage, student loans or credit card debt. Some people want a holistic overview of everything they have.\"\n\nIf you\u2019ve never talked with a financial adviser or planner, it\u2019s hard to figure out where to start. Consider the help you need and remember that your circumstances might not necessarily be the same as someone else\u2019s, which means the type of help you get may not be the same, either.\n\n\"If you will be receiving a large amount of money, you should seek out a financial adviser to help you plan how to invest and manage those assets,\" Kates said. \"You may also need to speak with an attorney or accountant to handle legal or tax responsibilities. With substantial assets, employing a team of advisers may be the difference between generational wealth and dwindling resources.\"\n\n\"If you will be receiving a large amount of money, you should seek out a financial adviser to help you plan how to invest and manage those assets\"\n\nLook first for a fiduciary financial advisor. A fiduciary is legally and ethically obligated to put your best interest first. Some financial advisers would rather give advice that earns them the most money may not be right for you.\n\nAlso look for a fee-only financial adviser. These advisers and planners get paid a flat rate for their services rather than a commission. Advisers who get paid by commission might be more inclined to sell you products or services that earn them more money, even if those things aren\u2019t necessarily best for you.\n\nAvoid debt and regret\n\nManaging your money depends on several factors, including how much you receive and your long-term plans. Kates suggests starting with an emergency fund and paying down debt.\n\n\"Building an emergency fund insulates you from other unexpected expenses or financial issues in the future,\" he said. \"Credit card balances or personal loans can be especially draining on your finances,\" so you may want to tackle paying off high-interest debt sooner rather than later.\n\nLarge purchases might sound fun, but they aren\u2019t always responsible \u2014 especially since they might put you in a worse financial position than before.\n\n\"The worst thing you can do with your windfall is make spontaneous financial decisions\"\n\n\"These should be limited to planned and vetted choices,\" Kates said. \"The worst thing you can do with your windfall is make spontaneous financial decisions. Plan and evaluate what money is available for spending after you have shored up the other aspects of your finances.\"\n\nBuffardi suggests managing money one step at a time. Like Kates, she encourages an emergency fund first. After that, it\u2019s up to you.\n\n\"What is the goal of this money?\" she asks her clients. \"Sometimes, clients know exactly what they want to do and sometimes they are overwhelmed by all the choices that they don't know where to start. If they don't have specific goals, I like to go step by step to figure out where they are and how we use this new money to make things better.\"\n\nAvoid talking to lots of friends and family about your recent influx of money. Money can cause a lot of strong emotions, even among partners and relatives. Do your best to work out a plan with a trusted financial adviser or planner, even if that means expanding your team based on recommended advice.",

            "content": "US stock-market outperformance is due to end, says Bank of America's Michael Hartnett.\n\nChinese AI firm DeepSeek challenges US tech-stock valuations, he said.\n\nPlus, a US fiscal slowdown and lower immigration rates pose risks to market performance.\n\nThe days of the US stock market's outperformance on a global stage are about to end, Bank of America's top global strategist Michael Hartnett says.\n\n\"US exceptionalism now exceptionally expensive, exceptionally well-owned, outperformance to peak in '25,\" Hartnett said in a client note on Friday.\n\nHartnett laid out a three-point argument for why US stocks' outshining of the rest of the world may be over. One was the unexpected left hook that hit the US tech sector on Monday: DeepSeek.\n\nThe Chinese AI firm released its R1 chatbot to much fanfare, as it seemingly rivals ChatGPT's performance with a significantly lower production price tag and more efficient energy usage. Investors were suddenly left questioning if all the money that tech firms were throwing at AI infrastructure was going to generate the kind of profits they were betting on. Hartnett thinks the answer is no.\n\n\"DeepSeek means peak in AI capex return expectations,\" he wrote.\n\nThe other reasons Hartnett is skeptical that US stocks can continue to beat their global counterparts are the slowdown in government spending he expects and lower immigration levels.\n\nUS fiscal spending has been well above trend over the last five years, which has helped propel the market's outperformance, Hartnett argued. But since taking office on January 20, President Trump has tried to issue a government spending halt.\n\nBank of America\n\nThe number of immigrants entering the US at the southern border has also sharply dropped in the last few months. Hartnett highlighted that of the US population's 3.3 million gain in 2024, 2.7 million (84%) were immigrants. And according to a Cato Institute analysis of Census Bureau data, 78% of job gains from 2019 to March 2024 were by immigrants. Lower immigration rates could slow job growth and hamper the economic expansion.\n\nBank of America\n\nThese trends don't necessarily mean the broader market is set to crash, Hartnett said. Rather, the so-called Magnificent Seven is probably set to underperform, and other parts of the market could benefit. The biggest risks facing the market are inflation and where 10-year Treasury rates go, he said.\n\nTariffs could prove trouble for inflation and rates and, in turn, stocks. On Friday, major US stock indexes dropped after the White House announced 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and 10% tariffs on China. The S&P 500 fell more than 1% in the last few hours of trading, while 10-year yields climbed as much as eight basis points, from 4.5% to 4.58%.\n\n2 trades outside the US\n\nTwo \"quiet\" opportunities in global markets right now, meanwhile, are bank stocks in both Japan and Europe, according to Hartnett.\n\n\"Investors all-in on US exceptionalism, missing new secular bulls in cheap, unloved Japan & Europe banks,\" the notoriously short-winded Hartnett wrote. \"Note Japan banks still 74% below 1980s highs (Chart 4), EU banks 67% below 2007 highs (Chart 5), and both breaking with upside likely in our view.\"\n\nBelow are the charts Hartnett is referring to.\n\nBank of America\n\nTwo ways to gain exposure to these trades are through exchange-traded funds like the iShares MSCI Europe Financials ETF (EUFN) and the iShares MSCI Japan Value ETF (EWJV), which has a 26% weighting to Japanese financials sector stocks.",

            "content": "Since then, equity markets have rebounded strongly, with earnings surging, particularly from Big Tech and, more recently, AI. Dividends, typically set by cautious boards, tend to lag behind earnings during these surges. As a result, payout ratios are now close to 25-year lows, meaning companies are paying out less than historical averages, as reported by J.P. Morgan. Simply returning to more typical payout levels could result in an additional 2% growth annually over the next five years. This recovery is already taking shape, as global dividend growth has outpaced earnings growth in seven of the past eight quarters.\n\nThe main factor driving this increased dividend growth is the low starting point for payout ratios (dividends relative to earnings). In 2020, during the pandemic, an unusual number of companies reduced their dividends. In fact, global dividends dropped by 12%, a sharper decline than during the Global Financial Crisis. This response was reasonable given the uncertain environment.\n\nAccording to a report by J.P. Morgan, global equities are on the brink of a significant period of dividend growth, not just due to a cyclical rise in payouts but also because of a more permanent increase in dividend momentum. Over the past two decades, global dividends per share have grown at an annual rate of 5.6%, but J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysts now predict this rate will accelerate to 7.6% in the future.\n\nDividends are a long-term investment strategy, and the benefits take time to materialize. For example, a dollar invested in the broader market in 1927 without reinvesting dividends would be worth $243 today, but if dividends were reinvested, that same dollar would be worth $3,737. Fortunately, you don\u2019t need a century to see the potential growth in dividend stocks, as the outlook for the near future is improving. According to a report by AGF Investments, in the second half of 2024, global monetary easing has led to lower bond yields, making fixed income less attractive compared to dividend-paying stocks. In addition, companies with high dividend payouts often have more leverage, and lower bond yields help them manage interest expenses, boosting their overall financial performance, which in turn would contribute to dividend growth.\n\nDuring a time of great excitement about AI-driven capital gains, it's crucial to remember that dividends have consistently played a vital role in total returns. Over the long term, dividends become even more significant. Looking back at the past few decades, approximately 55% of market returns from 1987 to the end of 2023 have come from reinvested dividends.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors and analysts both support companies that have raised their payouts. Companies that consistently raise their dividends typically manage economic downturns better because they have strong business models, solid balance sheets, and promising earnings potential. These qualities make them attractive to investors, and historical data shows that the market tends to reward them. Stocks of companies that increase dividends often outperform the broader market while experiencing lower volatility. According to a report by AGF Investments, the companies in the broader market that grew their dividend between January 1990 and August 2024 grew by 12.1%, compared with an 11% return of companies that pay no dividends and a 10.8% return of dividend cutters. With market conditions improving, it's not surprising that an increasing number of companies are beginning to pay dividends.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nTo compile this article, we first scanned a list of stocks known for their consistent dividend track records and sustained shareholder payouts over an extended period. This group reflects stability and long-term performance in dividend payouts.

Meanwhile, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, abandoned a sister initiative, the Alliance for Net Zero, which brought together firms that collectively hold $130 trillion of assets under management.\n\nThe second great US retreat\u2014the first being Trump\u2019s 2017 withdrawal, which the subsequent Biden administration reversed\u2014will have an immediate impact on other international efforts to curb global warming. The US bankrolls 21% of the budget for the UN Climate Secretariat, which leads climate change negotiations. National and international spending by the private and public sectors combined reached $175 billion annually in 2021 and 2022, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden.\n\nAt least a portion of this funding will disappear.\n\nAdditionally, Trump promises to erase the US\u2019s national emissions-cutting plan. Tax credits for C02-reduction projects, manufacturing targets for electric vehicles, and offshore wind leases could also be suspended. Some US states, such as California, claim they will continue their climate efforts.\n\nAmerican bankers are in a delicate position. They don\u2019t want to annoy elected Republican officials, who are feared advocates of the oil and gas industry, but at the same time they cannot alienate their EU clients. Companies must adopt stricter climate targets on the old continent to comply with European reporting rules.\n\nWill American banks risk losing these clients? The Net Zero Banking Alliance still boasts more than 130 member institutions ready to offer services.",

Previously, the Fed lowered the rate three times in 2024: in September, November and December. The Fed increased the rate four times in 2023 and seven times in 2022.\n\nThe changes haven\u2019t directly affected bank bonuses, but it could still be a good time to open a new bank account in case savings account interest rates fall. So you could take advantage of both a bank bonus and current APYs in a new savings account.\n\n\u00bb MORE: See what the Fed rate means for savings accounts\n\nAre bank account bonuses worth it?\n\nBank promotions can be worth the effort of opening a new account and adding money if the reward is substantial enough and the requirements aren't too difficult to meet. Before signing up for a new account to earn a bank bonus, understand the details including what fees might be incurred and how long you might have to wait for the bonus to be paid. If earning a bank sign-up bonus requires depositing more than $250,000 (which is the standard amount that\u2019s insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.), you\u2019ll need to employ certain strategies to make sure that all your money \u2014 including funds over $250,000 \u2014 is protected.\n\nOur Nerds say: \"A cash bonus is appealing, but many checking accounts don\u2019t earn interest, so you could miss out on thousands of dollars (much more than the maximum bonus) \u2014 which you could earn by putting that money in a high-yield savings account instead. \"Earning the highest bonus amount offered on this list requires at least $500,000. Depositing more than $250,000 would put you over Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. coverage limits, so you\u2019d need to consider a strategy to protect all your money.\" - Ruth Sarreal, NerdWallet banking writer\n\nCheck out more things to look out for when considering a bank sign-up bonus.\n\n\u00bb Prefer an account that offers rewards beyond a sign-up bonus?

The best bank bonuses for you are ones that have requirements you're comfortable with, including the amount of time you'll have to keep your money in the account to earn the bonus.\n\nAre bank bonuses taxable?\n\nIf you\u2019ve earned a cash bonus for opening a new bank account, it's usually taxable. You are responsible for covering any tax liability. Learn more about taxes on bank bonuses.\n\n\u00bb Churning through accounts to get bonuses? Find out whether closing a bank account hurts your credit\n\nShould I have more than one checking or savings account?\n\nIt can be helpful to have multiple bank accounts \u2014 as long as you can meet the requirements and minimums in order to avoid fees.\n\nThe number of checking and/or savings accounts you should have depends on your individual situation. Married or partnered people, for example, might each want to have their own accounts in addition to one or more shared accounts. You might want to consider having accounts at different financial institutions for different purposes \u2014 such as having an account with a bank that works well for international travel if you\u2019re frequently abroad, or with the bank that handles your mortgage or other loans for more seamless payment transfers.

            "content": "Bank of America has a rich history dating back to 1800 and even earlier. It was begun by immigrants as a group of separate and unrelated banks that, over the years, merged and grew together. One such is the Bank of Italy which was founded in 1904 by Amadeo Giannini to serve Italian immigrants that were facing discrimination. He later buys out the Banca de America e de Italia (Bank of America and Italy) which was also located in San Francisco. Over the years additional mergers and changes in Federal banking legislation, as well as the boom brought on by WWI and then WWII, helped boost the bank to national prominence.\n\nThings turned sour, however, in 1998 with a major bond default that led to yet another merger, this time with Charlotte, NC-based Nations Bank to officially become the Bank of America that exists today. At the time, the merger was the largest bank merger in history and the company has only grown in the time since.\n\nOther additions to the new Bank of America include MBNA (a major credit card operator), Fleet Boston (then the US 7th largest and one of its oldest banks), and Merril Lynch, now Merril, which was added to the group in 2008 to provide an investment banking branch. Together the company dominates as one of the Big Four Banks in America. Bank of America lays claim to nearly 11% of all US deposits which ranks in line with its peer group and Bank of America Securities is listed as the world\u2019s 3rd largest investment bank.\n\nToday, Bank of America Corporation provides banking and financial services for individuals, small businesses, institutions, corporations, and governments worldwide. The bank operates in three segments Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, and Global Banking bringing in a combined revenue greater than $90 billion in 2022.\n\nAs of 2022, Bank of America serves approximately 67 million consumer and small business clients with approximately 4,200 retail financial centers. The bank also operates more than 16,000 ATMs and digital banking platforms with approximately 41 million active users.\n\nIts Consumer Banking segment offers traditional banking and investment products for retail clients. These range from deposit accounts to savings, credit cards, consumer loans, and IRAs. The Global Wealth & Investment Management segment offers investment and wealth management solutions including, brokerage, banking, and trust and retirement products. The Global Banking segment provides lending products and services, including commercial loans and leases for businesses of all varieties. The Global Markets segment offers market-making, clearing, settlement, and custody services, as well as risk management, derivatives, and FX exchange services.",

            "content": "SOUTH HADLEY, MA (WGGB/WSHM/Gray News) - An 84-year-old South Hadley woman claims she was scammed out of nearly all her life savings. She has now turned to Western Mass News for help since her bank seemingly refused to. Despite doing everything she and her family can to get the money back, banks have found a loophole that keeps them off the hook when it comes to most scams, but legislation is currently on the table to change that.\n\nIn July, Madeline Slade got a text asking if she authorized a payment to Geico, then a call from \u201cJordan\u201d purporting to be with the Bank of America fraud department. For five hours, Madeline was tricked into disclosing private bank information, thinking she was verifying transactions. Her daughter, Sharon, even sat-in on the call. \u201cSophisticated, very professional, and so there wasn\u2019t anything initially, obviously, that clued us into that this was not an actual Bank of America fraud representative,\u201d Sharon Slade explained.\n\n\u201cSo, $20,000 was taken out. It turned out it went down to South Carolina and then from there, it went to somebody, who is in prison in Florida,\u201d Madeline Slade added.\n\nSince July, Sharon, Madeline, and Madeline\u2019s son, Mark, have gone to multiple bank branches, have spent countless hours on the phone with fraud representatives, and have sent more than a dozen letters to Bank of America.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been going back and forth with them and trying to get some kind of an answer. You know, you talk to somebody at Bank of America, they go \u2018Oh yeah, we\u2019re going to check into it, yes, this makes sense\u2019 and so forth and then three, four weeks later, get another denial letter,\u201d Madeline Slade explained.\n\nMadeline was eventually repaid the two $3,000 transfers and a $55 Zaxby\u2019s meal. If those transactions are fraudulent, what about the $20,000? \u201cTo give me back that, but not to follow through on the wire transfer is just mind boggling,\u201d Madeline Slade noted.\n\nWhy did Bank of America deny the claim? \u201cIt basically said it fits the general practices of my mom\u2019s banking behavior. I\u2019m not quoting that language. I don\u2019t have the letters in front of me. The challenge is my mom has never done a wire transfer,\u201d said Mark Slade.\n\nAfter trying local lawmakers, lawyers, area police, the Federal Trade Commission, even the FBI, seemingly no one could help Madeline. The last place the Slades thought to turn to was our newsroom. \u201cYou name it, between Mark and Sharon, my children, we have tried everything, everything. We never heard back from Richie Neal, we never heard from Ed Markey,\u201d said Madeline Slade.\n\nWe reached out to Bank of America for comment on December 19. It wasn\u2019t until January 24 that we got a statement which reads, in part: \u201cIn cases like Ms. Slade\u2019s, we attempt to recover the stolen funds from the receiving account, but there is no guarantee once the client has authorized the payment.\u201d\n\nAfter lots of digging, we found out why it\u2019s been dead end after dead end and why Bank of America is legally not liable. In July 2024, a U.S. Senate subcommittee questioned the three biggest owners of Zelle - JPMorganChase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America. \u201cYou do the absolute minimum required by law,\u201d said U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.\n\nLed by Blumenthal, subcommittee members pressed on failures to protect consumers from fraud. \u201c\u2026But what is most striking to me is the unauthorized claims, that is to say losses without consent or approval by the customer, were reimbursed only 38% of the time, which is down by 62% in 2019. Those claims are required to be reimbursed,\u201d he added.\n\nOn August 2nd, the Protecting Consumers from Payment Scams Act was introduced to the U.S. House of Representatives, co-authored by Blumenthal and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. If passed, it would put more guardrails on the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which currently does not require banks to reimburse customers tricked by scammers. Right now, the bill awaits the House Committee on Financial Services. \u201cWe will be preparing, as well, for the next steps. We hope you\u2019ll cooperate. We sincerely hope you would be good on the promises you make in the testimony,\u201d Blumenthal said.\n\nMeantime, as the Slades continue fighting for the $20,000, they want to make sure other Bay Staters don\u2019t bank on their money being protected, even if you\u2019re a victim and even if it\u2019s your life savings.\n\nCopyright 2025 WGGB via Gray Local Media, Inc.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Big Name Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stands against other best big name stocks to invest in now.\n\nBig name stocks refer to well-known companies that are widely recognized and have a significant presence in the stock market. These companies are often industry leaders and are included in major stock indices such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, or Nasdaq Composite. These companies are characterized by their large market capitalizations, stable financial performance, and strong brand recognition.\n\nIn an interview on January 22, Dave Sekera, US Market Strategist at Morningstar, provided a detailed outlook for large-cap stocks in 2025. Sekera highlighted that the performance of large-cap stocks in 2024 was particularly strong, driven by several key factors. The explosive demand for artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and platforms, especially in the first half of 2024, significantly boosted the performance of large-cap tech stocks. Additionally, the US economy remained resilient, with faster-than-expected growth, which supported the performance of large-cap stocks. The Federal Reserve\u2019s easing of monetary policy also played a crucial role in driving the market higher.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Most Promising Green Stocks According to Hedge Funds and 10 Worst Performing Energy Stocks in 2024.\n\nHowever, Sekera noted that the rate of monetary policy easing is now slowing, and the market is pricing in fewer rate cuts this year than originally projected. This, combined with sticky inflation and a rise in long-term interest rates, suggests that the tailwinds that supported large-cap stocks in 2024 are beginning to recede.\n\nFurthermore, Sekera pointed out that the concentration of market returns in 2024 was notable, with 10 stocks accounting for 58% of the market gain, despite representing only 30% of the market capitalization. This concentration is less than the 67% peak in June 2024, indicating a broadening of returns in the second half of the year. Despite this broadening, many of these large-cap stocks, particularly those tied to AI, are now trading at significant premiums. Sekera advised investors to be cautious, as very few of these large-cap stocks are currently undervalued, with most trading at 2-star or 1-star ratings, indicating they are overvalued.\n\nBig name stocks remain a compelling investment choice, offering stability, strong financial performance, and long-term growth potential.",

If you missed the episode, don\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019ve pulled out some highlights (and a couple of her epic charts).\n\nValuations Aren\u2019t Always a Problem\n\nThe value investor in me struggles to invest in a market when most valuation metrics are stretched, but Savita offered a fresh perspective:\n\n\u201cWhen you buy the S&P 500 today, it\u2019s not fair to compare its valuation multiple to the S&P of 1980. The index has fundamentally changed\u2014half of it is now comprised of asset-light, labor-light industries like tech and healthcare with high margins. Back then, the market was dominated by asset-heavy, capital-intensive sectors like manufacturing, which had structurally lower margins.\u201d\n\nTake a look at how the S&P 500 has evolved over the decades:\n\nThe Case for Total Return Investing\n\nIn the last decade, total returns have been dominated by price appreciation. But Savita thinks dividends are going to make a comeback:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going back to a world where dividends play a much larger role in total returns. Over the past decade, price appreciation dominated, but historically, dividends have contributed nearly half of total returns for the S&P 500.\u201d\n\nBoth of the charts below highlight this:\n\nIt\u2019s Time to Get Selective\n\nSavita emphasized the importance of moving beyond index-level thinking in today\u2019s market:\n\n\u201cThis is the year where you really want to get selective. Don\u2019t buy the index\u2014buy stocks that look attractive within the benchmark. The index is skewed by a handful of mega-cap companies, and we believe there\u2019s value to be found elsewhere.\u201d\n\nTranslation: equal-weight S&P 500\n\nYou can listen to the episode on Apple or Spotify or watch along with charts on YouTube.",

Based in Charlotte, North Carolina, it serves individuals, businesses, and governments globally.\n\nShares of the nation's second-largest bank have outperformed the broader market over the past 52 weeks. BAC has increased 34.1% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ( $SPX ) has rallied 22.8%. On a YTD basis, shares of BAC are up 6.1%, compared to SPX\u2019s 2.8% gain.\n\nIn addition, BAC has slightly outpaced the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s ( XLF ) 32.1% return over the past 52 weeks.\n\nDespite Bank of America's better-than-expected Q4 EPS of $0.82 and net revenue of $25.3 billion, shares fell marginally due to concerns over its worsening credit quality, with a 32% increase in provisions for credit losses and a 23% rise in net charge-offs. Additionally, while net interest income (NII) grew, there were concerns about the potential impact of rising non-interest expenses, with a projected 2% - 3% increase for 2025. The market also reacted negatively to a slight increase in non-performing loans and leases.\n\nFor the fiscal year, ending in December 2025, analysts expect BAC\u2019s EPS to grow 11.9% year-over-year to $3.67 . The company\u2019s earnings surprise history is promising. It beat the consensus estimates in the last four quarters.\n\nAmong the 23 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 16 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings, four \u201cModerate Buys,\u201d and three \u201cHolds.\u201d\n\nThis configuration is more bullish than three months ago, with 13 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings on the stock.\n\nOn Jan. 18, Evercore ISI lowered its price target on BAC to $51 while maintaining an \"Outperform\" rating, citing strong revenue growth and a solid 2025 outlook. However, the firm reduced its FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates due to anticipated higher expense pressure, which contributed to a slight decline in BAC\u2019s shares.\n\nAs of writing, BAC is trading below the mean price target of $52.43. The Street-high price target of $59 implies a potential upside of 26.2% from the current price levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

Open Account\n\nHow we evaluate products When choosing the best banks with early deposits, we started with a list of many different banks that offer this feature. From there, we compared the banks\u2019 other features and characteristics, both positive and negative. On the positive end, we looked for things like interest earnings, cash back, fee-free overdraft protection, and a large ATM network. On the negative side, we specifically avoided banks with monthly fees, high opening deposits, and ongoing monthly balance requirements. Ultimately, our goal was to provide a list of the best banks with early direct deposit based on their other characteristics. We also specifically looked for banks that had something to set them apart from the crowd, such as Ally with its buckets or Current with its credit-building features.\n\nBanks that help you get paid early\n\nCompare banks with early direct deposit\n\nBank Direct deposit estimate Discover Up to 2 days early SoFi\u00ae Up to 2 days early3 <p>Early access to direct deposit funds is based on the timing in which we receive notice of impending payment from the Federal Reserve, which is typically up to two days before the scheduled payment date, but may vary.</p> Capital One Up to 2 days early Chime\u00ae Up to 2 days early4 <p> Early access to direct deposit funds depends on the timing of the submission of the payment file from the payer.

To help narrow your choices, consider the following before signing up with any bank.\n\nFDIC insurance: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) protects the money you deposit in a bank up to $250,000 per depositor. Looking for the Member FDIC symbol on a bank's website or account materials can be an excellent way to determine if it is legitimate and know your money is protected.\n\nType of pay you receive: Consider what qualifies for early direct deposit. Do Social Security payments and tax refunds count for early pay, or only employer paychecks? Make sure the ways you get paid meet the qualifications for early access. Additionally, check for balance or activity requirements on your end.\n\nLow (or no) fees: Some banks charge monthly service fees, which can eat into your available cash each month. Many banks offer low- or no-fee accounts if you meet specific requirements like setting up monthly direct deposit or maintaining a certain balance in the account at all times.\n\nBefore signing up with a bank, read the fee disclosure statement and terms and conditions to understand what you may be responsible for.\n\nHigh-interest rates: While you probably won't find interest rates on checking accounts that compete with high-yield savings accounts, searching for a bank that pays interest on its checking account can help you earn as much as possible from your paycheck. You may need to decide between a low- or no-fee checking account and earning interest, but finding both features is possible, especially if you are comfortable with an online-only bank.\n\nCash back rewards: Some banks offer cash back on our purchases, similar to how you'd earn cash back on a credit card. While most banks we explored don't offer this feature, there are a select few that do, and their cash back rates are actually competitive with many credit cards. You won't get rich from this feature, but it's a nice way to earn a bit of extra cash for purchases you're already making.\n\nYour preferred banking method: Online-only banks typically have lower costs than brick-and-mortar banks, so you're more likely to find healthy interest rates and lower fees. They might also have additional account perks like rewards cards, ATM fee reimbursement, overdraft protection features, and interest-earning checking accounts.\n\nSome people prefer a more traditional bank, with physical branches you can visit.\n\nConsider a credit union: Credit unions often have more competitive rates and lower fees. They also usually have physical branches that customers can visit, making them a good solution for people looking for a brick-and-mortar bank with more options. Any credit union you consider should be insured by the National Credit Union Association (NCUA), the equivalent of a bank's FDIC insurance, and provides coverage up to $250,000 per single ownership account.\n\nCheck customer service reviews: As part of your research, pay attention to customer service reviews and ratings. Reviews can give you insight into the bank's customer service approach and how it solves problems.

According to the PNC website, direct deposits should be available the same business day, while checks from a PNC account will be available the next day. For large deposits, $100 will be available the same business day, while the remainder may take until the next business day or longer to clear. Does Bank of America offer early direct deposit? No, Bank of America does not currently offer early direct deposit. Your deposit should be available on your regular pay date for direct deposit or within moments for other types of deposits, like person-to-person payments. According to the Bank of America website, paper checks and mobile deposits should be available the next business day if deposited by 9 p.m. ET or 8 p.m. PT. What are the benefits of early direct deposit? With early direct deposit, you may receive your money up to two days before you usually would. Early direct deposit can help you pay your bills before the deadline and also help you avoid overdraft fees, late fees, or returned checks. Receiving your money earlier also means you can earn an extra couple of days worth of interest on your paycheck.\n\nBanks that didn't make our list\n\nWhile early direct deposit isn't exactly a universal feature yet, there are still plenty of banks that offer it. Alternatives we explored that didn't make the cut include banks that offer early direct deposit, but that didn't necessarily offer anything else to set them apart from the crowd. Examples of these include Axos Bank and Fifth Third Bank.\n\nWe also considered a few banks that have early direct deposit and maybe even a few other perks but charge fees on their accounts. These banks include Huntington Bank, Wells Fargo, and Regions Bank (though all have ways of having your fees waived). These days, there's just no reason to pay account fees when other banks offer the same perks with no fees.\n\nBottom line\n\nMany banks offer early direct deposit as a standard feature on their checking accounts. When you're narrowing down the best option, make sure to pay attention to some of its other features, including monthly fees, minimum balances, interest earnings, and cash back.\n\nFinding the right bank account might take a little effort, but ensuring it has all the features you want and is earning you the highest interest rate possible can be well worth the time.\n\nBe sure to do your research before you sign up with any financial institution, and check out our roundup of the best banks to help you learn more about your available options.",

Both banks have robust down payment assistance programs, but PNC's largest is $10,000 for borrowers with a qualifying income in select areas, while BoA offers up to $17,500 in combined assistance for those who qualify.\n\nHow do I apply for a mortgage with Bank of America?\n\nYou can apply for a mortgage on the Bank of America website or with a loan officer at one of its 3,700 branches nationwide. You can also begin the process on the phone by calling 866-466-0979. To prequalify, you'll need proof of ID, income and employment, as well as bank statements and details on your assets and debts. You'll also need to provide your Social Security number and allow the bank to run a credit check. When you find the home you want, you'll let Bank of America know that you plan to proceed. The bank will start the underwriting process, which will include an appraisal on the home and a title search.\n\nIs Bank of America right for me?\n\nBank of America's low rates, well-established reputation and widespread availability make it an attractive lender, especially for borrowers looking for help with a down payment or other assistance. Existing customers will also like being eligible for rate reductions or money off their origination fees. But while it has a variety of loan options, Bank of America doesn't offer USDA loans, reverse mortgages or home equity loans.\n\n\n\nIn addition, its lack of transparency about credit scores and other requirements may frustrate some potential borrowers.\n\nBank of America mortgage FAQ How long does it take to close on a Bank of America mortgage? It can take 30 to 60 days to close on a Bank of America mortgage, with an average of 45 days \u2014 which is in line with the industry average. Your specific closing timeline will depend on several factors, though, including the type of loan, your credit history, when the appraisal and inspection can be scheduled and if the title search turns up any irregularities. Does Bank of America offer reverse mortgages? No, Bank of America stopped offering reverse mortgages in 2011, in the wake of the Great Recession. At the time, it said it was exiting \"due to competing demands and priorities that require investments and resources be focused on other key areas.\" Is Bank of America good for mortgages? Bank of America is a great option for many mortgage customers, one that offers competitive rates, superior customer service, helpful down payment assistance and the resources of one of the largest financial institutions in the nation.\n\nSubscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!

            "content": "SOUTH HADLEY, MA (WGGB/WSHM) - An 84-year-old South Hadley woman claims she was scammed out of nearly all her life savings. She has now turned to Western Mass News for help since her bank seemingly refused to. Despite doing everything she and her family can to get the money back, banks have found a loophole that keeps them off the hook when it comes to most scams, but legislation is currently on the table to change that.\n\nIn July, Madeline Slade got a text asking if she authorized a payment to Geico, then a call from \u201cJordan\u201d purporting to be with the Bank of America fraud department. For five hours, Madeline was tricked into disclosing private bank information, thinking she was verifying transactions. Her daughter, Sharon, even sat-in on the call. \u201cSophisticated, very professional, and so there wasn\u2019t anything initially, obviously, that clued us into that this was not an actual Bank of America fraud representative,\u201d Sharon Slade explained.\n\n\u201cSo, $20,000 was taken out. It turned out it went down to South Carolina and then from there, it went to somebody, who is in prison in Florida,\u201d Madeline Slade added.\n\nSince July, Sharon, Madeline, and Madeline\u2019s son, Mark, have gone to multiple bank branches, have spent countless hours on the phone with fraud representatives, and have sent more than a dozen letters to Bank of America.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been going back and forth with them and trying to get some kind of an answer. You know, you talk to somebody at Bank of America, they go \u2018Oh yeah, we\u2019re going to check into it, yes, this makes sense\u2019 and so forth and then three, four weeks later, get another denial letter,\u201d Madeline Slade explained.\n\nMadeline was eventually repaid the two $3,000 transfers and a $55 Zaxby\u2019s meal. If those transactions are fraudulent, what about the $20,000? \u201cTo give me back that, but not to follow through on the wire transfer is just mind boggling,\u201d Madeline Slade noted.\n\nWhy did Bank of America deny the claim? \u201cIt basically said it fits the general practices of my mom\u2019s banking behavior. I\u2019m not quoting that language. I don\u2019t have the letters in front of me. The challenge is my mom has never done a wire transfer,\u201d said Mark Slade.\n\nAfter trying local lawmakers, lawyers, area police, the Federal Trade Commission, even the FBI, seemingly no one could help Madeline. The last place the Slades thought to turn to was our newsroom. \u201cYou name it, between Mark and Sharon, my children, we have tried everything, everything. We never heard back from Richie Neal, we never heard from Ed Markey,\u201d said Madeline Slade.\n\nWe reached out to Bank of America for comment on December 19. It wasn\u2019t until January 24 that we got a statement which reads, in part: \u201cIn cases like Ms. Slade\u2019s, we attempt to recover the stolen funds from the receiving account, but there is no guarantee once the client has authorized the payment.\u201d\n\nAfter lots of digging, we found out why it\u2019s been dead end after dead end and why Bank of America is legally not liable. In July 2024, a U.S. Senate subcommittee questioned the three biggest owners of Zelle - JPMorganChase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America. \u201cYou do the absolute minimum required by law,\u201d said U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.\n\nLed by Blumenthal, subcommittee members pressed on failures to protect consumers from fraud. \u201c\u2026But what is most striking to me is the unauthorized claims, that is to say losses without consent or approval by the customer, were reimbursed only 38-percent of the time, which is down by 62-percent in 2019. Those claims are required to be reimbursed,\u201d he added.\n\nOn August 2nd, the Protecting Consumers from Payment Scams Act was introduced to the U.S. House of Representatives, co-authored by Blumenthal and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. If passed, it would put more guardrails on the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which currently does not require banks to reimburse customers tricked by scammers. Right now, the bill awaits the House Committee on Financial Services. \u201cWe will be preparing, as well, for the next steps. We hope you\u2019ll cooperate. We sincerely hope you would be good on the promises you make in the testimony,\u201d Blumenthal said.\n\nMeantime, as the Slades continue fighting for the $20,000, they want to make sure other Bay Staters don\u2019t bank on their money being protected, even if you\u2019re a victim and even if it\u2019s your life savings.\n\nCopyright 2025.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nAs per a CNBC report, billionaire investor Steve Cohen remains confident in the long-term potential of artificial intelligence, despite recent volatility. He views AI as a transformational shift that could take 10 to 20 years to fully unfold, which will impact businesses and daily life. Cohen acknowledged that the AI market may experience ups and downs, with periods of doubt fueled by misinformation and uncertainty. His comments followed a major sell-off in U.S. tech stocks, triggered by the competitive advancements of the Chinese startup DeepSeek. Despite this, Cohen's firm plans to raise $1.5 billion for an AI-focused hedge fund to take advantage of the sector\u2019s growth.\n\nEmbracing the AI Future in the U.S.\n\nSteve Cohen\u2019s support for AI's long-term growth and President Donald Trump\u2019s recent push for rapid AI infrastructure development highlight the U.S. emphasis on dominating the global AI race. However, Cohen stresses a more measured approach while Trump favors fewer regulatory constraints to accelerate progress.\n\nIn his first days back in office, Trump reversed Biden's executive order on AI, removing key safety and transparency measures for AI development, Bloomberg reported. Trump introduced a $100 billion joint venture with SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, focused on AI infrastructure like data centers. He emphasized reducing environmental regulations, which could relax clean energy requirements for powering AI operations. While tech leaders expressed optimism about Trump's pro-tech stance, experts warned about the risks of unregulated AI growth. Trump\u2019s focus on outpacing China in AI development could shift U.S. policy toward faster, less regulated progress, raising concerns about long-term consequences, the report stated.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).",

The tech-heavy index declined 3% on Monday.\n\nSeveral IT hardware companies saw their share prices unfairly punished, providing a golden opportunity for investors to swoop in post-sell-off and snatch up these stocks at a bargain, according to a recent Bank of America note authored by Wamsi Mohan. Mohan, a senior technology analyst at the bank, is eyeing certain IT hardware stocks with \"compelling growth drivers separate from Gen AI/data center spending.\"\n\nOverall, the IT industry has been trading at depressed levels due to customer pullback in spending. In recent years, many companies have cut back on their IT budgets over recession fears and concerns about rising interest rates, bringing stock valuations down.\n\nAn anticipated cyclical recovery, along with the recent sell-off, create a perfect opportunity to buy into hardware tech stocks, according to Mohan.\n\nListed below are four tech stocks that Bank of America believes will take off independently of AI, along with commentary from the firm. These names saw their stock prices tumble in excess of the 3% loss the Nasdaq posted on Monday, making now a good time to invest at an attractive entry point, Mohan said.",

We have a mix of online and brick-and-mortar banks because, depending on what you're looking for, one type of bank may appeal to you more than another.\n\nFor each of our top picks, we highlighted specific stand-out features or services. Read more about the best banks, below.\n\nCapital One Bank\n\nCapital One 360 Checking ranks as one of our best checking accounts. It doesn't charge any overdraft, foreign transaction, or monthly service fees, and Capital One doesn't require any minimum opening deposits. The bank ranks No. 1 on J.D. Power's U.S. National Banking Satisfaction Study.\n\nYou can use your debit card at over 70,000 ATMs nationwide for free, but unlike many online banks, Capital One doesn't reimburse any fees charged by out-of-network ATM providers.\n\nCapital One savings account and CD rates are also higher than the national average, so it could be beneficial to open multiple bank accounts if that's your preference.\n\nAlthough Capital One 360 is considered an online bank, the institution does have some physical branches. There are over 280 branches in seven U.S. states, plus around 50 Capital One Caf\u00e9s, where you can grab Verve Coffee, speak with a money coach, and open a bank account. As a Capital One checking customer, you can get money from 70,000+ fee-free Capital One, MoneyPass and Allpoint ATMs\u2014including in select Target, Walgreens and CVS stores.\n\nCapital One Bank Review\n\nChase Bank\n\nChase has branches in more states than Bank of America or Wells Fargo. The bank also has numerous types of bank account, and you could get perks such as relationship rates if you open multiple bank accounts. Chase is notably featured in our guides for the best kids savings accounts and best national banks.\n\nYou'll pay a monthly service fee if you don't meet certain account requirements. You'll also have to pay a fee if you use an out-of-network ATM.\n\nChase has over 4,700 branches throughout the continental U.S., and around 16,000 ATMs.\n\nChase Bank Review\n\nAxos Bank\n\nAxos offers five different checking accounts, all geared toward specific needs:\n\nEssential Checking (get paid two days early)\n\nRewards Checking (earn a high APY)\n\nCashBack Checking (earn up to 1% cash back on purchases)\n\nGolden Checking (age 55+)\n\nFirst Checking (ages 13-17)\n\nYou'll need at least $250 to open a high-yield savings account. Some of the options on our list do not require an initial deposit.\n\nThere are also several requirements to earn up to 3.30% APY with an Axos Bank Rewards Checking account. You'll have to meet the following criteria:\n\nEarn 0.40% APY when you receive at least $1,500 in direct deposits in a month (this requirement must be met to be eligible to earn any interest during the statement cycle, regardless of whether the other interest-earning requirements are met)\n\nEarn 0.30% APY when you make 10 Axos Visa\u00ae Debit Card transactions in a month (minimum $3 per transaction) or sign up for Account Aggregation/Personal Finance Manager (PFM) in Online Banking\n\nEarn 0.99% APY by maintaining an average daily balance of $2,500 per month in an Axos Managed Portfolios Invest Account\n\nEarn 0.99% APY by maintaining an average daily balance of $2,500 per month in an Axos Self Directed Trading Invest Account\n\nEarn 0.60% APY by using your account to make your full monthly Axos consumer loan payment\n\nAs an online-only bank, Axos doesn't have physical branches. You have free access to around 91,000 ATMs. Axos doesn't have a specific ATM network, but you can likely use one near you for free. Axos also offers generous out-of-network ATM fee reimbursements, in case you can't find a free ATM close by.\n\nAxos Bank Review\n\nDiscover Bank\n\nDiscover is a good option for people who want to do all their banking, investing, and borrowing with one institution. It offers a wide range of products, including credit cards. The bank is a good option if you want to earn cash back with your debit card \u2014 you'll earn 1% cash back on up to $3,000 in purchases per month (see website for details).\n\nYou also don't need to place an inital deposit for a checking, savings, CD, or money market account.\n\nDiscover has just one physical branch, in Delaware. You have free access to over 60,000 ATMs in the Allpoint and MoneyPass networks.\n\nDiscover Bank Review\n\nAlly\n\nAlly is one of the best online banks because it offers strong banking and investing products.\n\nYou can get a high-yield savings account, a money market account, regular CDs, a no-penalty CD, and bump-up CDs. That's more variety than most other banks have. Ally is also one of the few banks that doesn't have minimum opening deposits for any of its accounts, so you can start online banking with any amount.\n\nThe Ally Savings Account stands out in particular because it bucketing feature to help you save money for financial goals. You can create a bucket for an Emergency Fund or Travel, and then separate money in your savings for that specific goal.\n\nAlly also has one of the best investment apps for beginners . If you're looking for a robo-advisor to get started with investing, it's also a solid choice.\n\nAlly Bank Review\n\nSynchrony Bank\n\nSynchrony pays 4.00% APY on its high-yield savings account, which is great compared to other well-known banks. It doesn't require a minimum opening deposit, and there are no monthly fees. Unlike most savings accounts, it comes with an ATM card so you can easily access your savings.\n\nSynchrony only offers a high-yield savings account, CDs, and a money market account \u2014 not a checking account. If you need to transfer money from your Synchrony account to an external checking account, it could take a few business days. But keep in mind that Synchrony makes it easier to access your money than most banks without checking accounts, because it gives you an ATM card.\n\nSynchrony is an online-only bank, so it doesn't have any branches. Although it doesn't have its own ATM network, you can use ATMs in the Plus, STAR, or NYCE ATM networks for free. Synchrony also reimburses up to $5 per month for any fees charged by an out-of-network machine.\n\nSynchrony Bank Review\n\nTD Bank\n\nTD Bank is ranked third in JD Power's 2024 U.S. National Banking Satisfaction Study. Many branch locations are open seven days per week, which is great if you struggle to make it to the bank during the workday.\n\nTD Bank's ATM fees aren't necessarily higher than other banks' fees, but its fine print may affect which checking account you choose to open.\n\nJust be aware that the TD Bank Beyond Checking Account is the only TD Bank checking account that doesn't charge a fee when you non-TD Bank ATMs \u2014 and you must maintain a $2,500 balance for TD Bank to reimburse fees charged by out-of-network ATM operators.\n\nTD Bank has over 1,100 branch locations across 16 states, with about 2,600 ATMs.\n\nTD Bank Review\n\nTotalBank\n\nTotalBank is an online-only financial institution. TotalBank offers some of the best CD rates available nationwide. It offers a high APY for 3-month, 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year CDs. TotalBank CDs pay 4.11% to 4.51%APY.\n\nTotalBank also may be worth considering for a money market account, too. The TotalBank Online Money Market pays up to 4.51%APY and has no monthly service fee.\n\nTotalBank also doesn't have any other products, so it also not the best choice if you'd like to primarily bank with one financial institution. If you want to open other bank accounts \u2014 like checking accounts or savings account \u2014 or get other banking products \u2014 like loans or credit cards \u2014 consider one of our other top picks.\n\nBarclays\n\nBarclays Bank is one of the best banks for a high-yield savings account right now. Barclays Tiered Savings pays 4.15% to 4.40% APY, well above the national average.\n\nYour interest earnings will depend on your account balance.\n\nBarclays also offers some of the best CD rates for a $0 minimum opening deposit.\n\nBarclays does not have a checking account, so if this is a must for you, consider a different bank.\n\nBarclays Bank Review\n\nImportance of Choosing the Right Bank\n\nTo choose the right bank, you have to know what you want. Are you looking to open one specific bank account or do you plan to get multiple bank accounts or products? Do you prefer going to a branch and getting assistance from a banker, or would you rather use your mobile phone and computer to primarily manage your account? Are there certain principles or values you align with? Like, you might consider banking with a women-led or minority-owned bank if you are interested in these specific types of financial institutions.\n\nAlso, if you are currently unbanked because you don't have a U.S. ID, know that you have options. The top banks for immigrants and non-U.S. Citizens allow you to provide a foreign passport or Matricula Consular to open a bank account.\n\nTo help you narrow down your options, we've outlined specific features to look for in a top bank, depending on what you want out of your banking experience. (And if you're particularly looking for women-owned banks, Black-owned banks, or Hispanic-American-owned banks, we have lists of those, too.)\n\nTop Banks for Savings Accounts\n\nThe top banks for savings accounts pay competitive interest rates. The average savings account interest rate is 0.41% APY, but many banks have high-yield savings accounts which have a significantly higher APY than the national average. The top rates you can find are 5% interest savings accounts. Small banks have higher savings rates than national brands, but as you can see from our top pick Synchrony, you'll still benefit from a great interest rate regardless of whether choose a national or local institution.\n\nYou should out look out for monthly bank maintenance fees, excess transaction fees, paper statement fees, and inactivity fees. Many banks waive these fees if you meet certain criteria, and some don't charge these fees at all.\n\nBest Banks for Checking Accounts\n\nThe best financial institutions for checking accounts make it easy to access your money. You should have access to a robust ATM network. If you like in-person banking, you should look for a bank with branches nearby. If you like online banking, you should find a bank that accepts cash deposits or offers a strong mobile app so you can manage your account digitally.\n\nA good bank for checking accounts will also help you avoid common bank fees, like monthly services fees, overdraft fees, and out-of-network ATM fees. You can also find specialty checking accounts that offer additional perks like cash bonuses for new customers, interest, or cash-back debit cards.\n\nBanks with the Best Customer Service\n\nTo find the banks with the best customer service, we used information collected by the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. National Banking Satisfaction Study. The study gathered responses from nearly 11,000 banking customers from July to October 2024. It found that Capital One, Chase, and TD Bank were ranked highest in overall customer satisfaction.\n\nIf you're also looking for banks that have extended customer service hours, a bank with 24/7 customer support could also be a good fit.\n\nIt may also help to check a bank holiday schedule, so you know if a particular financial institution may be open on certain holidays when others aren't.\n\nBest Bank for an Online-Only Experience\n\nOnline banks often do not have any physical locations, but the top banks offer strong mobile and online banking so you won't miss out on going to a branch because you'll have convenient digital access to your accounts.\n\nThe best banks for online-only experience have free checking accounts and savings accounts, meaning that they don't charge any monthly service fees. Many of these top banks also won't charge any overdraft fees.\n\nBest Banks for In-Person Banking\n\nThe best brick-and-mortar banks stand out for their robust account options and services. They'll have different types of checking accounts and savings accounts to choose from, as well as home loans, credit cards, personal loans, and more so you can build your banking experience over time. These banks often also offer relationship banking, which means that you'll get perks like discounts or waived account fees for having multiple products at the bank.\n\nBrick-and-mortar banks usually charge monthly service fees and overdraft fees on their bank accounts, but the top options will give you multiple ways to waive these fees. For example, you might be able to waive fees on a checking account by maintaining a certain amount of money in your account daily or setting up a certain amount in direct deposits per month. To waive overdraft fees, you'll be able to link your checking account to a savings account, or apply for a line of credit. Fees may apply for overdraft protection, but it'll be significantly less than paying overdraft fees.\n\nDifferences Between Online Banks and Traditional Banks\n\nThe biggest difference between online banks and traditional banks is that traditional banks have physical branches, while online banks typically don't.\n\nSince online banks have fewer overhead costs, their bank accounts tend to have fewer bank fees than ones from traditional banks. You'll also find savings accounts with higher interest rates at online banks.\n\nBrick-and-mortar banks tend to have a greater variety of bank accounts and services than online banks, though. For example, brick-and-mortar banks are more likely to exchange foreign currency, or offer more CD term lengths.\n\nHow to Choose Between a Traditional and Online Bank\n\nChoosing between a traditional and online bank depends entirely on your preferences.\n\nMany national online banks have bank accounts with no monthly service fees and no overdraft fees, but you have to be OK with managing your account digitally. If you rely on a branch experience to manage your bank accounts, you might find a traditional bank is better suited for your needs. That said, if you go with a traditional bank just make sure you find bank accounts where you can waive potential bank fees.\n\nHow to Switch Banks\n\nIf you're ready to switch to a new bank, the first thing you have to do is find a new bank that's a better fit for your needs. Make sure the bank has all the accounts and services you want, and review fees to make sure that you can avoid them entirely.\n\nOnce you've settled on a bank, you can open an account at a branch, online, or by phone.

To set up a direct deposit to your new account, you'll have to update your account information with your employer.

Although Barclays settled, the bank neither confirmed nor denied these charges.\n\nBest Banks FAQs\n\nWhat are the best banks for savings accounts? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. The best banks for savings accounts tend to be online banks or banks with no-fee high-yield savings accounts. You should use an online bank if you're looking for low fees and the highest APYs. Because online banks don't pay for physical branch locations, they can charge less and pay more. However, physical banks are better for anyone who needs to deposit cash regularly.\n\nWhich banks have the lowest fees for checking accounts? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Online banks usually have the lowest fees for checking accounts, but keep in mind that most do not have any physical branches. If you value banking in-person, you can find checking accounts that waive typical bank fees in several ways.\n\nHow can I choose the best bank? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. To choose the best bank, think about which type of financial institution you want to bank with: a traditional, an online bank, a credit union, or a non-traditional banking platform. If you're looking for a bank account, look at various options from different financial institutions and compare fees, interests rates, opening requirements, and any other perks. It's also beneficial to think about your overall banking experience and whether you might be interested in other accounts or services in the future.\n\nWhat is the No. 1 bank in America? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. The No. 1 bank in America is Chase, if you go by the highest number of locations. Many locations makes it good for getting easy access to your money and regular customer service. Chase also has a high score from the Better Business Bureau.\n\nWhich bank has the most complaints? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. The bank with the most complaints may be Citibank. Unlike other major banks, it is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau and received a score of F.\n\nWhy You Should Trust Us: Our Expert Panel for the Best Banks\n\nBI\n\nTo learn more about what makes a good bank and how to choose the best fit, four experts weighed in:\n\nWe're focusing on what will make a bank most useful, including fees, interest rates, accessibility, and more. Here's what they had to say about banking online. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.)\n\nHow can someone determine whether a bank is the right fit for them?\n\nTania Brown, CFP\u00ae professional and vice president of coaching strategy at OfColor:\n\n\"Obviously, you want to make sure it's FDIC insured. Also, your banking experience \u2014 do you like walking into a bank? Well, then you need someone local. Do you just not care if you ever see your bank? Then you're okay online. Do you write checks? Do you not write checks? So it's thinking through how your experience with it is going to be before you make that decision.\"\n\nSophia Acevedo, banking editor, Business Insider:\n\n\"I would create a list of what I prioritize most in a bank account. For example, some banks have accounts that charge monthly service fees. I would look to see what the requirements are for waiving the monthly service fee and whether I think I could feasibly meet those requirements each month. If I'm searching for an interest-earning bank account I'll pay attention to interest rates. I would make sure the account pays a higher interest rate than the average bank account.\"\n\nWhat should someone look for in a brick-and-mortar bank?\n\nBrown:\n\n\"How can that bank grow with you? If you are 25, single or newly married, and all you need is a checking account, that's going to look very different 15 years from now when you may have had a couple of jobs, you may have an IRA roll over, or you may want a financial adviser.\"\n\nMykail James, MBA, certified financial education instructor, BoujieBudgets.com:\n\n\"How accessible it is. So where are the branches? And if I am to go out of town or something, how accessible is my money to me?\"\n\nAcevedo:\n\n\"With a brick-and-mortar bank, I would review all the bank accounts and make sure there are options where I can waive monthly service fees. I would also factor in the overall banking experience. For example, I would see if a bank lets you exchange foreign currency \u2014 not all do \u2014 and has a strong mobile app.\"\n\nWhat should someone look for in an online bank?\n\nRoger Ma, CFP\u00ae professional and author of \"Work Your Money, Not Your Life\":\n\n\"How onerous the transfer process is, transferring money in and transferring money out. Is it same day, next day? Is it pretty easy to sync a brick-and-mortar checking account to this particular high-yield savings account?\"\n\nJames:\n\n\"When it comes to online banks, you want to be a little bit more strict about what type of interest rates they're providing. That's the biggest thing, because online banks are supposed to have the higher interest rate because they don't have the overhead of the brick-and-mortar. You want to make sure that it's well above the national average.\n\n\"What types of securities do they provide? Do they have two-factor identification? If it's an online bank, they should definitely have \u2014 at the bare minimum \u2014 two-factor authentication in how easy it is to change your passwords and things like that, because you want to be a little more hypersensitive about the cyber security for a strictly online bank.\"\n\nOur Methodology: How We Chose the Best Banks\n\nBusiness Insider's personal finance team looked at over 200 financial institutions to find the best banks offer a wide range of products and effective customer service.\n\nBusiness Insider's personal finance team is editorially independent and we have editorial standards we follow for rating and reviewing products. Being editorially independent means our business team does not decide how we cover products and what we write about.\n\nBanks should make it easy to access your money. With a brick-and-mortar bank, we looked at banks with large branch and ATM networks. Although most online banks don't have physical branches, we chose ones with plenty of ATMs nationwide.\n\nA bank should also make it affordable to keep your money with the institution. We chose online banks that pay high rates and charge low fees, or no fees at all. Brick-and-mortar banks are known for paying lower rates and charging higher fees, but a good one should make it possible to waive monthly fees. We also looked at other types of charges, such as fees for overdrafts, using out-of-network ATMs, and foreign transactions.\n\nWe rate bank products on a scale from one to five stars. If a checking account has a rating of one star, it means the bank account requires significant improvement. It's also the lowest possible rating. If a checking account has five stars, it's considered a superior option. That's the highest rating possible.\n\nSee our bank account rating methodology to learn more about how we rate bank accounts. We score various features on a scale of zero to five. Then, calculate the weighted average to get an account's final rating, which means we weigh certain features, like interest rates and fees, at a higher weight percentage than others. We understand that these areas can more heavily impact a person's overall banking experience.\n\nIf you live in one of the following states, you can also check out our region-specific bank recommendations:\n\nSophia Acevedo Banking Editor Sophia Acevedo is a banking editor at Business Insider.

            "content": "Luxury spending may come back with a bang in 2025.\n\nAfter 10 quarters of declining spending on luxury goods, signs are pointing toward growth this year, according to a new report from the Bank of America Institute. That trend is being helped along by increased spending abroad, as well as spending on luxury services such as high-end hotels.\n\nIn 2024, luxury companies lost a combined $52 billion of market value, according to Bank of America Global Research. Shoppers in the United States contributed to that downward spiral, with high-end fashion spending per household falling 12 percent year over year in 2023 and 9 percent year over year in 2024. However, that decline started to ease in the second half of 2024, which could portend more favorable winds for the luxury sector this year.\n\nIn particular, U.S. consumers have started to carry out more of their luxury shopping abroad, with 13 percent of such spending happening outside the States, a jump from average levels in both 2019 and 2023. Much of that growth is thanks to high-income households, with the top 5 percent increasing their luxury spending abroad by 10.5 percent year over year. That\u2019s almost five times more than the larger high-income group that Bank of America looked at.\n\nAnd while most luxury purchases fall into the category of retail, high-end services are helping to boost overall spending, too. This past summer, for example, luxury travel offerings like high-end hotels outperformed more standard accommodations, and even did better than retail purchases across all generations, especially for Baby Boomers.\n\nWhen it comes to the breakdown by age, Gen X made up the largest share of luxury purchases in 2024, with older millennials and baby boomers coming in next on the list. Older generations also saw stronger year-on-year growth when compared with younger cohorts, with only baby boomers seeing positive year-on-year growth in 2024.\n\nAll of these trends have led the Bank of America Institute to believe that luxury spending may be back on track this year. That should be welcome news to an industry that has struggled mightily over the past couple of years, with many of the biggest luxury brands posting poor financial results and outlooks in recent quarters. This year, though, thanks to U.S. consumers\u2019 strong spending\u2014especially when it comes to travel\u2014that could all be reversing course soon enough.",

These include workshops around the health care industry and in-person and Zoom meetings with health care professionals.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to help connect SDSU students to high demand health care careers,\u201d said Pamela Gabriel, SVP, Market Executive, Bank of America San Diego. \u201cAs a part of the San Diego community for more than 100 years, Bank of America recognizes the importance of health-related fields to the region\u2019s economy, to career mobility and the overall health of households.\u201d\n\nAs Lona found, shadowing opportunities with physicians and other health care professionals turned out to have an especially positive impact on student success. They are typically a week long, scheduled over an academic break.\n\n\u201cIt gives them such a focused and deep experience,\u201d Ulloa said, \u201cand an opportunity to ask questions, to really help them not only solidify their motivation and validate the choice that they made to enter into this career, but also to help them understand the things that they might need to continue to prepare for graduate school or other career opportunities.\u201d\n\nThe program also provides specific certifications some students may need, such as training for emergency first aid and administering naloxone for opioid overdoses. For others, direct financial support to allow them to attend conferences for professional development or supplies needed in a lab class can help.\n\nTo make a gift to SDSU please contact Mary Darling, [email protected], 619-594-8299.",

            "content": "The transition to digitalization in the banking sector continues to gain momentum, and one of the largest financial institutions in the United States, Bank of America, has announced the closure of several branches starting in January 2025.\n\nCustomer habits are also changing, and entities need to optimize their resources to face this transition.\n\nThat is why digital banking has transformed the way we all manage our money. Today, transactions that previously required a visit to the bank can be done from a mobile phone or a computer in less than two minutes. This change has caused many traditional branches to become less profitable, as has happened to Bank of America.\n\nBank closure boom\n\nEvery week, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) shares the list of branches that will close in the coming months, because, if you don\u2019t know yet, a branch cannot close overnight, but must notify the OCC at least 90 days in advance.\n\nWhy do banks close?\n\nUsually, it\u2019s because they become less profitable, i.e. the location of these branches no longer generates enough income to keep them open (this happens, above all, in places where in-person demand has decreased due to the use of APPs and ATMs).\n\nThe result of this was the pandemic that we experienced in 2020, which accelerated the use of digital services, and Bank of America, like other banks, has invested considerably in technological platforms and suffered from this as well.\n\nSo, once people get used to using online banking, there is no need to keep so many physical branches open.\n\nWhich regions will be affected by the Bank of America branch closures?\n\nAccording to the OCC, the closures will affect several states. Here is the list:\n\nCalifornia 6351 East Spring Street, Long Beach 8760 Wilshire Boulevard, Beverly Hills 702 Mission Avenue, Oceanside\n\nFlorida 8681 Cypress Lake Drive, Fort Myers 902 South Atlantic Avenue, Ormond Beach 2700 West Dr. Martin L. King Jr. Boulevard, Tampa\n\nOther states 49 East Chicago Avenue, Chicago, IL 133 Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, MA 1501 Queen Anne Ave N, Seattle, WA\n\n\n\nWhat happens now for customers?\n\nBank of America has proposed several options to guarantee its customers 100% service. Even if the branches are closed, the bank\u2019s mobile applications and digital platform allow you to carry out any transaction at any time of day. In addition to this, they have personalized help (via chat or call) for those who have difficulties using the app.\n\nOn the other hand, the ATMs will continue to operate, so if you only go to the bank to withdraw money from your ATM, don\u2019t worry because you can continue as if nothing happened.\n\nFinally, Bank of America has committed to providing users with the nearest branches that remain open.\n\nDigitalization and our elders\n\nWe, the young, are already well accustomed to going everywhere with our mobile phones, from paying bills to buying things without having to go anywhere physically. But what about our elders? The digital divide (inequality in accessing the use of technology, mostly between different age groups) is causing havoc among the older people in our cities, and for many of them, an action as simple as withdrawing money becomes a world with so many screens and so much information, which is leading them to become socially depressed groups (or socially excluded, as we would say). If we add to all these difficulties the number of hackers out there lurking to do harm, we once again place our elders in a vulnerable situation.\n\nWith the closure of Bank of America branches, many ladies and gentlemen in our country are seeing how something as basic as going to the bank is becoming an odyssey.\n\nSo, we will have to gradually adapt to this \u201cmigration\u201d towards digital, but always taking into account the most vulnerable sectors of society.",

            "content": "Making things easier rarely goes out of style. Just take, for example, unattended payments.\n\nTypically facilitated by self-service machines, kiosks or other devices allowing customers to complete purchases independently, these transactions occur without the need for direct human interaction at the point of sale.\n\nWith the unattended payments market projected to reach $129 billion globally by 2030, it is clear they are becoming a fundamental part of our commerce infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe growth [has been] explosive,\u201d Mousumi Chatterjee, director of product innovation in Global Payments Solutions at Bank of America, told PYMNTS, adding this market represents not just a technological shift but a reimagining of how industries interact with consumers.\n\nWhile retail has led the charge with self-checkout kiosks, vending machines and micro markets, new use cases are emerging across a variety of sectors.\n\nThe challenge for businesses now lies in determining not whether to implement these solutions, but how to do so effectively while maintaining customer trust, operational efficiency and performance standards.\n\nUse Cases of Unattended Payments\n\nUnattended payments are transforming industries by offering efficiency and convenience, particularly in a cashless and automated world.\n\nChatterjee pointed to hospitality and dining as prime examples, highlighting the evolution of \u201cpay-at-the-table solutions, loyalty programs and even customized cocktail dispensers.\u201d She added that ghost kitchens are also using unattended systems to enable \u201ccontactless pickup and delivery.\u201d\n\nTransportation and mobility are also experiencing a shift.\n\n\u201cIn New York City and San Francisco, over 60% of in-person payments are contactless; [half of all domestic in-person transactions are tap to pay]; with 70% of those made using plastic and 30% through mobile devices,\u201d Chatterjee said, citing various sources.\n\nAt the same time, technologies like RFID and license plate recognition are streamlining transit and parking payments, offering what Chatterjee described as \u201chuge line-busting opportunities.\u201d\n\nHealthcare represents another promising vertical, with unattended kiosks facilitating prescription pickups and hospital copays. In entertainment and travel, unattended minibars in hotels and vending machines at amusement parks are enhancing customer convenience.\n\nChatterjee pointed out that other sectors, such as electric vehicle charging, car washes with subscription models with upselling detailing services, and gyms and wellness centers, demonstrate how unattended payments are evolving to meet specialized consumer needs.\n\nChallenges in Adoption\n\nDespite the expansion, unattended payment systems have room to improve.\n\n\u201cThe self-checkout experience definitely has high adoption, but the satisfaction overall has been low, around 15%,\u201d Chatterjee said.\n\nShe attributed this to issues such as complex user interfaces, limited options and technical glitches, including machine malfunctions and lack of real-time assistance.\n\n\u201cThink about \u2026 a mom with three kids having a day job and going into three different services at the end of the day \u2014 groceries, a car wash and EV charging,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the checkout is not intuitive, if things are not staring at me where I need to click, that\u2019s when you have an abandoned transaction.\u201d\n\nChatterjee said some retailers are addressing this by introducing human runners to help customers navigate these systems.\n\n\u201cThat blend of human interaction and unattended kiosks is helping customers [get past the initial adaptability curve],\u201d she said.\n\nPrivacy and security concerns are also barriers. Unless market participants can build trust with their customers, it will be hard to increase adoption, Chatterjee said, adding that improving these systems involves creating intuitive designs, addressing accessibility, and incorporating features like speech-to-text and multilingual support.\n\nFuture of Unattended Payments\n\nAs unattended payments infiltrate more industries, companies face the dual challenge of embracing automation while ensuring customer satisfaction and regulatory compliance.\n\nEmerging technologies like artificial intelligence and predictive analytics promise to enhance these systems, but they must be implemented responsibly. By focusing on trust, security and usability, businesses can unlock the full potential of unattended payments and transform the customer experience across verticals.\n\nChatterjee underscored Bank of America\u2019s own commitment to responsible innovation, highlighting the importance of piloting new technologies in controlled environments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about providing cool \u2026 solutions,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about meeting clients where they are and offering opportunities that support their customers directly.\u201d\n\nWhile automation dominates small-dollar transactions, Bank of America recognizes the value of human interaction in high-dollar engagements, such as loans or wealth management. Drawing lessons from retail, Chatterjee said she envisions a future where consumers can initiate processes online and complete them in person, combining the best of both worlds.\n\n\u201cCustomers could start off in a digital environment and finish in a retail one,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2026It\u2019s all about consistency.\u201d",

Since 2002, participants have raised more than $358 million through the event's official Charity Program. This feat is accomplished by participants who sign on to support an affiliated cause and commit to fundraising as a part of their marathon journey. Individuals hoping to take part in this year's sold-out event can still secure their place by committing to run and fundraise on behalf of an official charity team.\n\nBank of America Chicago Marathon logo\n\n\"We're excited by the growth of the Charity Program and the commitment thousands of runners make each year to run and raise funds for nonprofits both in Chicago and around the world,\" said Executive Race Director Carey Pinkowski. \"The funds raised by each runner allows the impact of the race to reach far beyond the finish line. We're excited to continue to grow this tradition and support the incredible work being done by so many organizations.\"\n\nThe Bank of America Chicago Marathon Charity Program launched in 2002 with 14 charities and 1,674 runners; since then, the program has grown to 217 charities with more than 17,000 runners expected to run for charity in 2025.\n\nRunning for charity gives participants a unique opportunity to make the miles on their marathon journey more meaningful. One runner took that mission to heart through their participation in the 2024 Bank of America Chicago Marathon. Carl Allegretti, President of Arbor Investments (a Chicago based private equity firm founded in 1999 by CEO Gregory J. Purcell) and longtime Chicago Marathon participant had an idea to make his 70th marathon special. In addition to recruiting his colleagues to run the marathon alongside him, Allegretti engaged several of Arbor's portfolio companies to join the race and fundraising efforts. Brands such as Lantana Hummus, Mountain House and Vital Essentials became event partners and plugged in to support Allegretti and the event Charity Program.\n\nAllegretti not only started and finished his 70th marathon, but he also became the event's top fundraiser raising a record $277,491, shattering the previous record by over $100,000. The dollars Allegretti raised went towards supporting three critical charities: Greater Chicago Food Depository, PAWS Chicago and Lurie Children's Hospital.\n\n\"In 1986, I started running to get into shape after my college football career and I ran my first Chicago Marathon that year,\" said Allegretti. \"The reason behind my marathons changed in 2007 when my oldest son was diagnosed with cancer and cured by Lurie's Children's Hospital. After that, I made the commitment to run for Lurie's and cancer research to give back. Since then, I have run eight marathons for charity (four for Chicago and four for Boston) and I'm proud to close out my marathon career with my Arbor colleagues and Carey Pinkowski by raising funds for organizations that are meaningful to me and that are making a positive impact in our city.\"\n\nIndividuals inspired by Allegretti and the thousands of other participants who have run for charity can still secure an entry into this year's Bank of America Chicago Marathon through the official Charity Program. Those who register to run with an official charity at this time are required to raise a minimum of $2,100.

Texas has been one of the most active states in anti-ESG initiatives, with actions including having several asset managers placed on a list for potential divestment for allegedly \u201cboycotting\u201d energy companies, and more recently launching a multi-state lawsuit against BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, accusing the asset managers of using their positions in climate-focused investment initiatives to manipulate energy markets.\n\nIn the weeks following the election, each of the firms targeted by the new letter announced withdrawals from climate-focused investment and finance coalitions, including the Net-Zero Banking Association (NZBA) and the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative.\n\nWhile the letter states that the AGs \u201capplaud you for terminating your relationships\u201d with the NZBA, NZAM and climate-focused engagement network Climate Action 100+ (CA100+), the AGs added that \u201cwe still want answers\u201d to decisions made by the firms while they were members of the groups, and accused the firms of potential legal violations through their support for net zero-focused shareholder resolutions and engagement practices.\n\nThe letter added that statements made by some of the firms reiterating their net zero commitments after leaving the groups \u201craise serious concerns as to whether your exodus is an optics-only effort.\u201d\n\nThe letter also warns the firms of potential legal actions related to their DEI policies, including \u201cdiscriminatory employment quotas,\u201d such as BlackRock\u2019s use of DEI goals in employee performance reviews and bonus considerations, \u201cdiscriminatory board quotas,\u201d citing BlackRock\u2019s proxy voting guideline that encourages large companies to have boards with \u201cat least two women and a director who identifies as a member of an underrepresented group\u201d as an example, and \u201cdiscriminatory supplier quotas,\u201d such as Goldman Sachs\u2019 goal to \u201cspend a cumulative $1.5 billion with small and diverse vendors between 2023 and 2025.\u201d\n\nThe letter includes a series of questions for each firm regarding their ESG and DEI policies, requesting responses within 45 days as an \u201copportunity to avoid a lengthy enforcement action,\u201d and to \u201cdemonstrate whether violations have occurred, whether they will continue, and the necessity of enforcement actions to vindicate federal or State laws.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released alongside the letter, Texas AG Paxton said:\n\n\u201cBanks and financial institutions are finally starting to realize that the ESG and DEI policies pushed by radical activist groups are bad for consumers and potentially violate the law. Unlawful race- and sex-based quotas and so-called \u2018green energy\u2019 schemes will not be allowed to stand and I will continue to urge these organizations to uphold the legal obligations they owe to consumers and investors. Any institution found to be violating the law will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nClick here to access the letter.",

First, jaws were on the floor when President Trump, during a Q. and A. session that included Brian Moynihan of Bank of America, claimed to Moynihan\u2019s face that his institution had debanked conservatives. The bank is now scrambling to undo the damage.\n\nSecond, the tech community here can\u2019t stop talking about an A.I. model by the Chinese start-up DeepSeek that is as powerful as ChatGPT and purportedly uses much less compute power. (We have more on both of these below.)\n\nAnd on a more personal note, a very unusual thing happened yesterday: A meme coin called \u201cSorkincoin\u201d emerged after Larry Fink of BlackRock joked on CNBC that there should be one. It appears some viewers created it \u2014 and the token has since topped $160 million in trading volume.

Being a member of the Bank of America Preferred Rewards\u00ae program also helps you dodge the monthly fees on all four checking accounts, but membership requires having a three-month average balance of at least $20,000 across eligible linked accounts.\n\nBank of America also offers the SafeBalance Banking\u00ae account, which can help frequent overdrafters. In lieu of charging overdraft fees, the bank simply declines transactions if the account holder doesn\u2019t have enough funds. But the account comes with downsides, such as the lack of check-writing privileges and a $4.95 monthly fee monthly fee (though it is avoidable). The only interest-bearing checking account that Bank of America offers, Advantage Relationship Banking, requires at least $20,000 as a daily minimum balance to avoid a $25 monthly fee and pays minimal interest.\n\nYou can earn a $300 bonus offer for opening a new eligible Bank of America Advantage Banking account. See details and more bonus options at NerdWallet's list of best bank bonuses.\n\nCustomers that use non-Bank of America ATMs are charged a $2.50 fee for U.S. ATMs, and a $5 fee abroad.

            "content": "Bank of America (BAC) has seen relatively strong performance in the past six months, rising more than 10% in that time. So, long-term investors thinking Bank of America stock might trade sideways for a few months could look at selling covered calls on their underlying stock position to increase their income.\n\nBank of America stock is also sitting above the 21-day exponential moving average as well as the 50 and 200-day moving averages. A cup with handle has formed, creating a new buy point of 47.51. Shares have jumped 86% since bottoming at 24.96 in the week ended Oct. 27, 2023.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported earnings of 82 cents per share, more than doubling from 35 cents the previous year, with a 15% increase in revenue to $25.3 billion. Analysts had upgraded Bank of America stock ahead of earnings, citing expectations of billions of dollars worth of buybacks this year.\n\nBank Of America Stock Today\n\nThe stock's annualized dividend yield currently stands at 2.23%, according to MarketSurge. But savvy investors can significantly increase the yield from their Bank of America shares using covered calls.\n\nA covered call involves buying 100 shares of the underlying stock and simultaneously selling a call option against those shares.\n\nSelling the calls limits the upside but increases the yield from the investment in the form of option premium.\n\nThe investor keeps the premium generated from selling calls, no matter what happens with Bank of America stock.\n\nAccording to the IBD Stock Checkup, BAC ranked No. 13 in its group and has a Composite Rating of 89, an EPS Rating of 80 and a Relative Strength Rating of 82.\n\nWhen trading covered calls, most investors sell monthly calls against their stock to make the most of the effects of time decay.\n\nThat makes a lot of sense but also requires a lot of active management. What if we sold longer-term covered calls against Bank of America stock? Let's take a look.\n\nLong-Term Covered Call: The Setup\n\nOn Bank of America stock, a Jan. 16, 2026, expiring call option with a strike price of 50 recently sold for around $3.25, generating $325 in premium per contract.\n\nPurchasing 100 shares of Bank of America stock will cost around $4,620, but the net cost can be reduced by the $325 option premium received.\n\nTherefore, we have created a yield of 7.57% (325 / 4,295) in 355 days, or 7.78% annualized.\n\nThat clearly beats the dividend yield on most stocks in the current market and still allows for around $380 of capital appreciation.\n\nCovered calls are a fantastic way to generate extra income from a stockholding while also providing some downside protection. Investors would need to weigh the pros and cons of the stock before initiating a bullish trade like a covered call.\n\nPlease remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.\n\nThis article is for education purposes only and not a trade recommendation. Remember to always do your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.\n\nGavin McMaster has a Masters in Applied Finance and Investment.

A high interest rate environment has led to a moderation in housing demand, according to Jadrosich. In addition, rising input costs are pressuring the company's gross margins, he added. \"We believe DHI is prudently adjusting to a more challenging backdrop (slowing starts and increased share repurchase), but we expect margin headwinds to persist through F2025,\" Jadrosich wrote in a Monday note. In addition, higher lot costs \u2014 which represent around 26% to 27% of total cost of goods \u2014 will be difficult to offset in a challenging macro environment, according to BofA. On a yearly basis, lot costs rose 10%, the company said on its most recent earnings call. Jadrosich added that D.R. Horton is already trading at a more expensive level relative to other homebuilders with similar return on equity. D.R. Horton's \"valuation [is] not compelling vs. peers,\" according to the analyst.

This year, Bank of America's Savita Subramanian believes that the bull market rally has more room to grow. The strategist's year-end target for the S & P 500 is 6,666, representing 9% upside from the benchmark's Friday closing level of 6,101.24. \"Savita is calling for a 'cyclical inferno' driven by: (1) Red sweep, (2) Fed cuts, (3) accelerating profits, (4) reshoring, (5) productivity cycle, (6) shift from everyone spending on Tech to Tech spending on everything, (7) municipalities refurbishing to court corporates, (8) tight capacity / decades of underspend in manufacturing, and (9) lightest positioning in cyclical sectors since at least the [global financial crisis],\" Bank of America wrote in the note to clients. Against this backdrop, the bank released a selection of its top stock picks for 2025. The table below includes 10 of the names Bank of America analysts highlighted as their year ahead picks: One name is spice manufacturer McCormick . Shares have risen almost 14% in the past 12 months, but analyst Peter Galbo's $96 price objective implies additional upside ahead of more than 28%. Galbo pointed to the stock's relative valuation versus the market and its peers as one catalyst. \"We also expect MKC to build on the gross margin expansion momentum as cost inflation continues to ease and productivity takes hold,\" he said. \"We expect FY24 volume growth to continue into FY25 as laps easy compares and executes on its initiatives.\" Most analysts covering the name have rated it as a hold, although the average price target corresponds to a 16% upside, according to LSEG. Bank of America also pointed to life sciences company Danaher as another potential winner. Shares of Danaher have added 7.5% in the last 12 months. \"Following the 2016 spinoff of industrial-themed Fortive, Danaher became one of the premier standalone life sciences companies,\" wrote analyst Michael Ryskin. \"The acquisition of GE's Life Sciences (now called Cytiva) business and the divestiture of the lagging dental segment are transformational for the company as they should sharply improve organic sales growth, margin profile, and free cash flow generation potential.\" Ryskin's $290 price objective is approximately 18% above where shares of Danaher closed on Friday. Wall Street analysts across the board are bullish on Danaher, with most analysts covering the name assigning it either a \"strong buy\" or \"buy\" rating. The average price target implies a 15% upside for the stock from here. Discount retailer Ross Stores has popped almost 8% in the last 12 months, but analyst Lorraine Hutchinson's $180 price objective corresponds to an additional rally of more than 20%. \"We expect Ross to gain market share as inventory flow normalizes and it benefits from a trade down. The company has a long history of being able to grow in good and bad macroeconomic environments,\" she wrote. Hutchinson pointed to Ross' solid track record of returning excess cash to shareholders as an additional catalyst. The analyst added that the company has the potential to nearly double its existing footprint. Most analysts covering the stock have assigned it either a \"strong buy\" or \"buy rating,\" while the average price target is approximately 13% higher than where shares of Ross are currently trading. Artificial intelligence beneficiary Nvidia also made the list. The \"Magnificent Seven\" titan has surged 132% in the last 12 months. Despite this rally, analyst Vivek Arya's $190 price target implies the stock still has upside of about 33% ahead. \"Our positive view on Nvidia is based on its underappreciated transformation from a traditional PC graphics chip vendor, into a supplier into high-end gaming, enterprise graphics, cloud, accelerated computing and automotive markets,\" he remarked. \"The company has executed consistently and has a solid balance sheet with demonstrated commitment to capital returns.\" Analysts covering Nvidia have overwhelmingly assigned the stock either a \"strong buy\" or \"buy\" rating. The consensus price target is nearly 20% above where shares are currently trading, LSEG said. Other names on Bank of America's list of year-ahead top picks included airline carrier United Airlines , energy producer Chevron and e-commerce giant Amazon .",

            "content": "A rather telling scene at Davos should provide corporate executives with a feel of what it means to do business in the Trump 2.0 era if they were wondering what the next four years would hold.\n\nThe top minds in business, technology, investing, and economics come together at Davos, also known as the annual World Economic Forum conference held in the Swiss Alps.\n\nNaturally, a large number of people attended President Donald Trump\u2019s keynote address, which he gave via video conference from Washington.\n\nHowever, Lauren Hirsch of the New York Times claims that Thursday\u2019s happy hour was not dominated by Trump\u2019s proposals for reduced corporate taxes or tariffs.\n\nRather, the conversation focused on Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who initially believed he was setting up a softball for the president but was quickly targeted by Trump. What followed was a public censure of one of the world\u2019s most influential bankers\u2014a direct warning to the private sector from Trump himself: The administration will not tolerate \u201cwoke\u201d philosophy in the government, and businesses had best join the cause.\n\nTrump bragged about his promises to lower inflation during a Q&A session before abruptly turning the conversation back to Moynihan.\n\n\u201cYou did a great job, but I hope you start letting conservatives work in your bank because a lot of conservatives complain that banks don\u2019t let them do business with them,\u201d Trump stated. \u201cYou, Jamie, and everyone else\u2026 You\u2019re doing something incorrectly.\n\nBank of America CEO Brian Moynihan\n\nTrump was referring to a claim that conservative and religious organisations had been \u201cdebunked\u201d by big banks, such as Bank of America and Jamie Dimon\u2019s JPMorgan Chase, because of their political views.\n\nAfter over a dozen state auditors and treasurers signed an open letter to Moynihan this spring, describing a few instances in which accounts belonging to right-wing or religious organisations were closed, the claim\u2014which both banks have always denied\u2014became a talking point for right-wingers. (BofA earlier declared that such incidents had nothing to do with political or religious affiliations.)\n\nSpeaking to CNN on Thursday, Bank of America spokesperson Bill Halldin reaffirmed that the bank has \u201cno political litmus test\u201d and serves 70 million customers, including conservatives.\n\nAdditionally, Patricia Wexler, a representative for JPMorgan, stated in a statement: \u201cWe have never and would never close an account for political reasons, full stop.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of Trump\u2019s comment about Moynihan was not to defend a few groups that were forced to switch banks. The intention was to make it clear to all of the executives there and to the global audience watching the livestream that any assault, whether imagined or genuine, against his base would not be accepted.\n\nThe Republican Party, which until recently had a laissez-faire attitude towards business, has undergone a dramatic change.\n\nConservative orthodoxy resented any hint of government interference in business matters, whether it be through corporate taxation or federal regulations, for many years.\n\nAccording to Trump\u2019s carrot-and-stick policy, however, the calculation has shifted: \u201cSure, we\u2019ll lower your taxes, but it will come at a cost.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cdebunking\u201d allegation is consistent with a larger sentiment among conservatives who feel betrayed by a left-wing agenda that has infiltrated Corporate America. A series of alleged inequities have sparked a vigorous campaign against diversity, equality, and inclusion measures, initially from the White House and later on social media.\n\nBud Light may not have started the uproar, but its brief 2023 advertising collaboration with a trans influencer stoked long-simmering animosities on the right.\n\nConservative influencers and the media exploded the story into a conspiracy theory about the pervasiveness of \u201cwoke\u201d culture after a single sponsored piece appeared on Instagram. This was Budweiser, and it wasn\u2019t just the coastal elites with their open borders and pronouns. All of a sudden, the King of Beers joined the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nBud Light lost more than $1 billion in sales the following year as a result of consumer backlash, despite the company\u2019s concession and attempt to regain the advertising place.\n\nSince then, it appears that scores of companies have given in to right-wing activists by announcing changes to their DEI programmes.\n\nWalmart, Ford, and Target are just a handful of these companies. Many of the \u201cwins\u201d are exaggerated by the activists because many businesses, such as McDonald\u2019s, have only changed their wording rather than changing how they do business.\n\nNevertheless, the DEI pushback has evolved from a social media campaign by a few rabble-rousers to the official policy of the US government since Trump went into office.\n\nTrump rescinded federal DEI programmes last week and even directed government agencies to look into these initiatives at publicly traded corporations.",

            "content": "Bank of America has a rich history dating back to 1800 and even earlier. It was begun by immigrants as a group of separate and unrelated banks that, over the years, merged and grew together. One such is the Bank of Italy which was founded in 1904 by Amadeo Giannini to serve Italian immigrants that were facing discrimination. He later buys out the Banca de America e de Italia (Bank of America and Italy) which was also located in San Francisco. Over the years additional mergers and changes in Federal banking legislation, as well as the boom brought on by WWI and then WWII, helped boost the bank to national prominence.\n\nThings turned sour, however, in 1998 with a major bond default that led to yet another merger, this time with Charlotte, NC-based Nations Bank to officially become the Bank of America that exists today. At the time, the merger was the largest bank merger in history and the company has only grown in the time since.\n\nOther additions to the new Bank of America include MBNA (a major credit card operator), Fleet Boston (then the US 7th largest and one of its oldest banks), and Merril Lynch, now Merril, which was added to the group in 2008 to provide an investment banking branch. Together the company dominates as one of the Big Four Banks in America. Bank of America lays claim to nearly 11% of all US deposits which ranks in line with its peer group and Bank of America Securities is listed as the world\u2019s 3rd largest investment bank.\n\nToday, Bank of America Corporation provides banking and financial services for individuals, small businesses, institutions, corporations, and governments worldwide. The bank operates in three segments Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, and Global Banking bringing in a combined revenue greater than $90 billion in 2022.\n\nAs of 2022, Bank of America serves approximately 67 million consumer and small business clients with approximately 4,200 retail financial centers. The bank also operates more than 16,000 ATMs and digital banking platforms with approximately 41 million active users.\n\nIts Consumer Banking segment offers traditional banking and investment products for retail clients. These range from deposit accounts to savings, credit cards, consumer loans, and IRAs. The Global Wealth & Investment Management segment offers investment and wealth management solutions including, brokerage, banking, and trust and retirement products. The Global Banking segment provides lending products and services, including commercial loans and leases for businesses of all varieties. The Global Markets segment offers market-making, clearing, settlement, and custody services, as well as risk management, derivatives, and FX exchange services.",

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nListen to article\n\nWall Street banks are getting ready to sell up to $3 billion of debt holdings in X, the social media platform controlled by Elon Musk, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Friday.\n\nMorgan Stanley and other banks have contacted investors ahead of a planned sale next week, the sources said. Banks expect to get 90 to 95 cents on the dollar, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported preparations for the sale.\n\nMusk denied the journal report as \"false,\" posting on X that the newspaper was \"lying.\" The journal cited a January email to X staff in which Musk said finances remained problematic but pointed to the growing power and influence the company had. Musk said in his X post that he had \"sent no such email.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley and others, such as Bank of America and Barclays, lent Musk money to complete his $44 billion buyout of X, then known as Twitter, in 2022.\n\nMorgan Stanley, Bank of America and Barclays did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Banks typically sell such loans to investors soon after a deal is done, but lenders have faced difficulties in offloading the debt in the case of X.\n\nMusk's sweeping changes to the platform, including laying off many people who had worked to moderate content, and one of his posts on X, scared away advertisers and hit revenues. That reduced the value of the debt, as the risk of default increased.\n\nReuters reported in November that Musk's political ascendancy and proximity to President Donald Trump had banks pondering over the improved prospects of the social media platform, helping them in selling the debt without having to take a massive loss on the deal.\n\nAttempts to sell the debt in late 2022 attracted bids which would have seen banks taking as much as a 20% loss on the face value of the debt, sources said at the time.\n\nOther banks in the consortium that helped finance the deal include Mitsubishi UFJ, BNP Paribas, Mizuho and Societe Generale.",

Check the terms and conditions of your credit card to see whether or not your card (or the card you're considering applying for) charges foreign transaction fees.\n\nCHASE\n\nWhen looking at a rates and fees table, the foreign transaction fee is typically listed explicitly under a fees section.\n\nRelated: How to choose a no-foreign-transaction-fee credit card\n\nForeign transaction fees vs. ATM fees\n\nAnother type of fee you may hear about when you travel is a foreign ATM fee. While the two fees can apply when traveling outside the U.S., they are not synonymous.\n\nA foreign ATM fee is charged when you withdraw cash from an ATM in a foreign country. Some banks waive this fee, especially if you use an ATM that falls within a specific network of banks.\n\nVERA ARSIC/EYEEM/GETTY\n\nAdditionally, you might be on the hook for additional fees when you use an ATM abroad, including a flat fee from your bank for using an ATM not affiliated with the bank (which is typically $5), a foreign currency conversion fee (which typically falls in line with foreign transaction fees at 3%) and additional fees charged by the owner of the specific ATM you use.\n\nThis is one reason we recommend paying with a credit card wherever possible. But in some places, cash is still king and you'll need to have a game plan for avoiding these types of fees \u2014 or factor them into your budget.\n\nRelated: Ways to save on overseas ATM withdrawals\n\nHow to avoid foreign transaction fees\n\nUse a card with no foreign transaction fees\n\nThe easiest way to avoid foreign transaction fees is to use a card that doesn't charge them. TPG has a regularly updated guide on the top credit cards with no foreign transaction fees that can help you choose the best cards for your trips.\n\nDIVERSITY STUDIO/GETTY IMAGES\n\nUnfortunately, cash-back cards such as the Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae and the Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express (see rates and fees) tend to charge foreign transaction fees.\n\nRelated: The pros and cons of cash-back credit cards\n\nAvoid 'dynamic currency conversion'\n\nWhen using a card terminal abroad, you may be prompted to pay in the local currency or in U.S. dollars. You should always choose the local currency.\n\nSDI PRODUCTIONS/GETTY IMAGES\n\nDynamic currency conversion is a sneaky way that banks encourage you to pay in your home currency (U.S. dollars) while abroad. However, they'll usually give you a poor conversion rate, so it's best to pay in euros, pesos or whichever is the local currency.\n\nRelated: Why you should avoid dynamic currency conversion\n\nPay with cash\n\nOf course, you'll also avoid foreign transaction fees by paying with cash.\n\nGRACE CARY/GETTY IMAGES\n\nHowever, those purchases will not earn you rewards, and withdrawing cash abroad may be subject to pesky fees.\n\nRelated: How to decide when to use cash or miles for buying airline tickets\n\nBottom line\n\nThe good news is that foreign transaction fees are much less common across top credit cards than they used to be. Hopefully, the industry as a whole is moving away from charging customers these types of fees. Until then, check your credit card's terms and conditions to know if you'll be on the hook for a fee when you're traveling \u2014 and plan your card usage accordingly.\n\nTo avoid foreign transaction fees, choose a top travel rewards card or one from Capital One or Discover. Also, always pay in the local currency rather than U.S. dollars to avoid poor conversion rates.\n\nRelated: Best travel rewards cards\n\nFor rates and fees of the Blue Cash Preferred card, click here.",

            "content": "America's second-largest bank and Warren Buffett's third-largest holding seems like a no-brainer.\n\nYou might know Bank of America (BAC -0.21%) as one of the world's largest financial institutions. It is a well-known consumer-facing bank with over $3.2 trillion in assets today. You might also know it for the controversial bailout money it and its peers received following the financial crisis of 2007-2008.\n\nYou might also associate Bank of America with famous investor Warren Buffett, who has owned stock in it through Berkshire Hathaway for years. Bank of America is Berkshire's third-largest holding, accounting for approximately 12% of its portfolio.\n\nEither way, many people (including myself) invest in the companies they know, making Bank of America a hot topic. It probably doesn't need to be said that Bank of America is a get-rich-quick stock. The company is already huge, with a $350 billion market cap today.\n\nBut can Bank of America make you rich slowly? Can it compound for decades, potentially making you a millionaire over the course of your investing life?\n\nThe boom-and-bust nature of the big banks\n\nA bank's business is simple at first glance. A bank pays you interest on the money you deposit. The bank takes your money and loans it to someone else at a higher interest rate. The bank makes money (net interest income) from the difference between the interest they earn on the loan and what they pay on deposits.\n\nBig banks, such as Bank of America, are far more complex. They touch almost every aspect of the economy, including personal and business banking, mortgages, student loans, commercial real estate, and the financial markets. Banks can be very lucrative when the economy is firing on all cylinders, and people and businesses borrow a lot.\n\nBut it goes the other way, too. When something goes wrong in the financial markets or the economy, it usually affects the banks. Remember the housing crash and financial crisis of 2007-2008? It was partially due to a bubble in subprime mortgages -- to which, you guessed it, Bank of America and other big banks had major exposure. Their heavy losses prompted financial intervention from the government.\n\nThe U.S. economy is a juggernaut over the long term, but sometimes, things break for one reason or another. When this happens, Bank of America and its peers tend to feel it, too. It comes with the territory of being so deeply ingrained in the world's largest economy. This creates a boom-and-bust nature for big banks, and their size and notoriety can sometimes make them a regulatory target.\n\nBanking meltdowns eat into the stock's long-term performance\n\nOver time, the occasional crisis or recession has dragged Bank of America stock down.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see that Bank of America's 2008-2009 crash wiped out decades of investment returns. Most bank stock downturns aren't that severe, but Bank of America stock is no stranger to sharp declines. Sometimes, it can take several years to recover.\n\nEven today, there are potential risks. Rising interest rates have piled $108 billion in unrealized losses on hold-to-maturity securities onto Bank of America's balance sheet. Now, as long as nothing forces Bank of America to touch those securities, it won't have to realize those losses. Eventually, those loans will mature harmlessly.\n\nStill, investors shouldn't completely dismiss the risk. Who knows what might happen in the future? Who foresaw a global pandemic in 2020?\n\nCan Bank of America make you a millionaire?\n\nBank of America has been a fantastic stock for Warren Buffett since he invested in 2011. But as great as Buffett is, don't buy Bank of America simply because he did. Warren Buffett struck a unique deal for preferred stock and warrants during a time of need for the big bank. It's not the same as buying common stock on the open market today. Berkshire has trimmed its stake in the company over the past year, though Bank of America remains a core holding.\n\nThe lesson? Don't buy (or sell) based solely on someone else's actions, even those of a legend like Buffett.\n\nThere's a lot to like in Bank of America. It's still one of the world's largest banks and will likely keep growing alongside the U.S. economy. Analysts expect roughly 10% annualized earnings growth over the next three to five years. The company pays a stable dividend that yields 2.2% today, making it a solid holding in a diversified portfolio. And, if you bought and held through all the ups and downs, the stock has returned over 3,000% since the early 1970s.\n\nBut a millionaire-maker today? Probably not. Big banks are too prone to disaster, and Bank of America is too large and mature now to deliver the explosive growth you'd need for life-changing investment returns anytime soon.",

            "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nIn case any corporate executives were sitting around this week wondering what the next four years might look like, a pretty telling moment at Davos should offer them a sense of what it means to do business in the era of Trump 2.0.\n\nICYMI: Davos, aka the annual World Economic Forum confab in the Swiss Alps, brings together the world\u2019s leading figures in business, tech, investing and economics. (Think long days of academic panels followed by chummy cocktails and steak and the most elite corporate scuttlebutt on the planet.)\n\nNaturally, President Donald Trump\u2019s keynote \u2014 he video-conferenced from Washington \u2014 was well attended. But it wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s vision for lower corporate taxes or tariffs that dominated Thursday\u2019s happy hour, according to the New York Times\u2019 Lauren Hirsch.\n\nInstead, the chatter centered on Brian Moynihan, the CEO of Bank of America, who thought he was teeing up a softball for the president but soon found himself in Trump\u2019s crosshairs. What happened next was a public berating of one of the most powerful financiers in the world \u2014 a warning shot to the private sector, direct from Trump\u2019s mouth: The administration won\u2019t stand for \u201cwoke\u201d ideology in the ranks of the federal government, and companies had better get on board, too.\n\nDuring a Q&A session, Trump touted his plans to reduce inflation before abruptly shifting the focus back to Moynihan.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done a fantastic job, but I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives, because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou and Jamie and everybody\u2026 What you\u2019re doing is wrong.\u201d\n\nJaws hit the floor, the Times reported.\n\nWhat Trump was referring to is an allegation that major lenders, including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase (run by Jamie Dimon), have been \u201cdebanking\u201d conservative and religious groups over their politics. Both banks have repeatedly denied the claim, which became a right-wing talking point last spring after more than a dozen state auditors and treasurers wrote an open letter to Moynihan, citing a few examples in which right-wing or religious organizations\u2019 accounts were shut down. (BofA previously stated those instances were unrelated to any political or religious leanings.)\n\nBank of America spokesperson Bill Halldin reiterated to CNN on Thursday that the bank serves 70 million clients, including conservatives, and has \u201cno political litmus test.\u201d And JPMorgan representative Patricia Wexler said in a statement: \u201cWe have never and would never close an account for political reasons, full stop.\u201d\n\nThe scolding is the point\n\nThe point of Trump\u2019s jab at Moynihan was not to stand up for a handful of groups that had to change banks. The point was to send a warning to every executive in the room, and everyone watching the livestream around the world, that any slight \u2014 real or imagined \u2014 against his base won\u2019t be tolerated.\n\nIt\u2019s a stunning shift for a Republican Party that, up until recently, embraced a laissez-faire approach to business.\n\nFor decades, conservative orthodoxy bristled at any sign of government meddling in corporate affairs, whether through federal regulations or corporate taxes. But the calculus has changed in line with Trump\u2019s carrot-and-stick philosophy: Sure, we\u2019ll slash your taxes \u2014 but it\u2019ll cost you.\n\nThe \u201cdebanking\u201d claim echoes a broader sense among some on the right who believe they are victims of a left-wing agenda that has taken root in Corporate America. A string of perceived injustices have snowballed into an active campaign \u2014 at first on social media, now from the White House \u2014 against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nBud Light may not have caused the backlash, but its brief 2023 ad partnership with a trans influencer poured lighter fluid on the right\u2019s simmering resentments. After a single piece of sponsored content showed up on Instagram, conservative influencers and media blew the story up into a conspiratorial narrative about the creep of \u201cwoke\u201d culture into everything. It wasn\u2019t just the coastal elites with their pronouns and porous borders \u2014 this was Budweiser. The King of Beers, suddenly standing with the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nEven as Bud Light capitulated and tried to walk back the ad spot, consumers revolted and the brand lost more than $1 billion in sales in the year that followed.\n\nSince then, dozens of brands \u2014 Walmart, Ford and Target, to name just a few \u2014 have seemingly caved to right-wing activists by announcing rollbacks to their DEI programs. Many of those \u201cwins\u201d are overstated by the activists, as many of the companies, like McDonald\u2019s, have simply tweaked the language they use rather than alter their operations.\n\nStill, with Trump\u2019s ascension to the presidency, the DEI backlash has graduated from a social media campaign by a handful of rabble-rousers to the official policy of the federal government. This week, Trump signed executive orders clawing back federal DEI programs and even ordered government agencies to investigate such efforts at publicly traded companies.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear how many people would be laid off as a result, though dozens have already been placed on administrative leave. The former acting head of the Office of Personnel Management, Rob Shriver, told NPR that \u201cgiven the broad brush that they have painted, it\u2019s potentially very large numbers of people.\u201d\n\nNot all companies are ready to throw in the towel, of course.\n\nOn Thursday, Costco shareholders voted overwhelmingly against a proposal from a conservative think thank that would have compelled the retailer to quantify the risks of maintaining its DEI initiatives. Apple rejected a similar proposal this month. And even JPMorgan Chase \u2014 not exactly a bastion of liberalism \u2014 on Wednesday seemed to draw a line in the sand. Dimon, asked by CNBC about activist pressure to abandon DEI, stood firm, stating: \u201cBring them on.\u201d",

If you have an emergency fund, a holiday account, a savings account and a checking account, combining all those balances may qualify you for a Preferred Rewards tier. Once you add in investment accounts, such as IRAs, you may even find that the Platinum or Platinum Honors tiers are within reach.\n\nOLEG BRESLAVTSEV/GETTY IMAGES\n\nYour balance doesn't need to originate with Merrill or Bank of America to count toward each threshold. You can roll existing IRAs and investment accounts over to Merrill or Bank of America and immediately use those balances to begin establishing a three-month average to boost your tier. Of course, you'll have to consider other things like account management fees and available investment options to decide whether doing so is a good option.\n\nRelated: How to maximize your earning with the Bank of America Premium Rewards card\n\nHow to move among Preferred Rewards tiers\n\nYou can rise from one rung to the next any month after your average daily balance for the three previous months reaches the threshold for the following tier.

The card earns 3 points per dollar on travel purchases made through the Bank of America Travel Center and 1.5 points per dollar spent on all purchases. Points can be redeemed to cover travel expenses at a rate of 1 cent per point.\n\nTHE POINTS GUY\n\nBy earning 3 points per dollar on purchases through the Bank of America Travel Center and 1.5 points per dollar spent on everything plus a 75% Preferred Rewards bonus as a Platinum Honors (or higher) Preferred Rewards member, you effectively earn 5.25% (on purchases through the Bank of America Travel center) and 2.625% (on everything else) cash rewards toward travel purchases made with the card. That's a fantastic cash reward rate to earn on all spending \u2014 especially for a card with no annual fee.\n\nRelated: Bank of America Travel Rewards card full review\n\nBank of America Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card\n\nThe Bank of America Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card is great for folks who don't want to keep track of multiple bonus categories but who still want to earn at a strong fixed rate on all their purchases. This no-annual-fee credit card earns unlimited 1.5% cash rewards on all purchases with no limit.\n\nTHE POINTS GUY\n\nPlatinum Honors and higher members would get back 2.625% on all your purchases \u2014 one of the best rewards rates any card offers for nonbonus everyday purchases.\n\nRelated: The best Bank of America cards\n\nBank of America Customized Cash Rewards credit card\n\nAnother no-annual-fee card is the Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards credit card. It earns 3% in one of the following categories of your choice each calendar month:\n\nDining\n\nDrugstores and pharmacies\n\nGas and electric vehicle charging stations\n\nHome improvement and furnishings\n\nOnline shopping (including cable, streaming, internet and phone services)\n\nTravel\n\nTHE POINTS GUY\n\nIt also earns 2% back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs and 1% back on everything else. Just note that you can only earn 3% and 2% on up to $2,500 in combined purchases each quarter (then 1%).\n\nSo, if you're at least a Platinum Honors member, you'll earn up to a whopping 5.25% back on your 3% category. You'd also earn up to 3.5% back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs and 1.75% back on all other purchases. That's pretty phenomenal for a no-annual-fee cash rewards card.\n\nRelated: Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards full review\n\nHow to convert your Bank of America points to cash\n\nSeveral Bank of America credit cards earn straight-up cash. But some earn \"points,\" which you can trade for cash.\n\nTo redeem your Bank of America points with a card such as the Premium Rewards card, you'll find a \"cash\" option within your online account. This allows you to request a statement credit or a cash deposit into your Bank of America checking or savings account (or eligible Merrill Edge and Merrill Lynch accounts) at a rate of 1 cent per point. Note that you can also redeem into a 529 College Savings Plan.\n\nOSCAR WONG/GETTY IMAGES\n\nAdditionally, the Travel Rewards card earns a slightly different rewards currency. You can redeem them as a direct deposit into your Bank of America checking or savings account or as a credit into an eligible Merrill Cash Management Account \u2014 but you'll usually get a paltry value of 0.6 cents per point. You'll only achieve a value of 1 cent per point when offsetting a travel-related transaction on your card.\n\nRelated: How to redeem points using the Bank of America Premium Rewards card\n\nBottom line\n\nThe Bank of America Preferred Rewards program is probably not worth pursuing unless you qualify for at least Platinum Honors to maximize the 75% bonus on credit card earnings.\n\nThat said, the program's perks mean that if you already do business with Bank of America or Merrill, you should consider consolidating your banking and investing to boost your rewards and benefits.\n\nIt might even be worth switching to Bank of America if doing so won't cost you anything extra. After all, the Preferred Rewards program can tip the scale on some of Bank of America's top card offerings and reward you with significant discounts on other banking services like mortgage and auto loans.\n\nRelated: The ultimate guide to credit card application restrictions\n\nUpdated 3/5/2025.",

REUTERS/Yves Herman \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\n\nMoynihan did not respond to Trump\u2019s criticism in the moment, but Dimon offered his defense of debanking in a Chase podcast interview published earlier this past week.\n\nThe reason isn\u2019t politics, he said. It has to do with regulations imposed on banks by regulators in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"We have not debanked anyone because of political or religious relationships, period,\" he said.\n\nWhat Dimon instead argued is that US rules such as the Bank Secrecy Act discourage banks from dealing with customers that are considered high-risk \u2014 and that there needs to be clearer regulation on that front.\n\n\"We are responsible in the law to fight sex trafficking, money laundering, tax avoidance,\" Dimon said, and regulators \u201cput a lot of pressure on us\u201d and \u201ctell us what is high risk.\"\n\n\"If we don't debank someone and something goes wrong, it could be hundreds of millions of dollars in fines.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stands against other best bear market stocks to invest in now.\n\nAs of January 2025, the prevailing sentiment among US economic experts leans towards cautious optimism regarding the stock market\u2019s trajectory. While concerns about potential downturns exist, explicit predictions of a bear market in 2025 are not prominent. For example, economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal have adjusted their forecasts, anticipating higher inflation and interest rates in the coming years. They note that inflation has been higher than expected, with the consumer-price index rising 2.9% in December, leading to projections of continued inflation momentum into 2025. Despite these concerns, the US economy has demonstrated resilience, driven by strong consumer spending and a declining unemployment rate, which fell to 4.1% in December. Consequently, economists estimate a 22% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, marking the lowest probability in three years.\n\nJeremy Siegel, a renowned economist from the Wharton School, suggests that the stock market could experience a cooling-off period in 2025, particularly within the technology sector, amid concerns over the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. He also anticipates that interest rates might decline, which could influence market dynamics. Additionally, MarketWatch reports that foreign retail investors have been purchasing US stocks at unprecedented rates, with $76.5 billion acquired in the last three months. Historically, such surges in foreign investment have preceded market downturns, as observed before the 1987 crash, the 2000 dot-com bubble burst, and the 2008 financial crisis. This pattern suggests that increased foreign investment may serve as a contrary indicator, signaling potential market peaks.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nSeveral economic experts also predict a bear market in 2025. For example, Cem Karsan, a volatility trader and founder of Kai Volatility, foresees a possible stock market decline of up to 40% within the next year, per a report by MarketWatch. He emphasizes that the Federal Reserve\u2019s management of rate cuts and market expectations will be crucial. Karsan predicts that the 10-year Treasury yield could surpass 6% by the third quarter, which would exert additional pressure on stocks. He suggests that the Fed\u2019s approach can either delay or accelerate the decline; a dovish stance might prolong the market rally but lead to a harder drop, whereas a hawkish stance could cause an earlier slide.\n\nSimilarly, Paul Krugman, a Nobel laureate and economist, has raised concerns that aggressive policy measures, such as imposing tariffs on China, could lead to inflation spikes and trade wars, potentially destabilizing the economy. He warns that such policies might exacerbate inflation and pressure the US labor market, contributing to economic instability. While these experts highlight potential risks, it\u2019s important to note that market predictions are inherently uncertain. Other analysts maintain a more optimistic outlook for 2025. For instance, JP Morgan Research anticipates robust global economic growth, with the exception of a slowdown in China, and projects a price target of 6,500 for the S&P 500, with earnings per share of $270.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur list of the best bear market stocks to buy is grounded in hedge fund sentiment towards each stock. These selections are derived from sectors such as consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, given their historical resilience and stability even during economic downturns. A considerable number of these stocks present enticing annual dividend yields and possess defensive attributes that enable them to maintain stability in a bear market. Additionally, we\u2019ve identified promising tech stocks that currently pose as appealing entry opportunities for investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The worth of the firm as an attractive investment is highlighted by the following factors. Firstly, as per the report for the fourth quarter of 2024, the revenue of $25.3 billion represents a 15% increase, driven mainly by higher fees from asset management, investment banking, and sales and trading activities. Also, the net income was $6.7 billion, or $0.82 per diluted share, compared to $3.1 billion, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of the prior year, reflecting the company\u2019s strong profitability growth and improved performance. Moreover, the company has a consistent record of returning value to shareholders as it returned $5.5 billion to shareholders, with $2 billion through dividends and $3.5 billion via share repurchases. The return on average common shareholders\u2019 equity of 9.4% and return on average tangible common shareholders\u2019 equity of 12.6% reflect the company\u2019s efficient use of equity to generate profits.\n\nOverall, BAC ranks 6th on our list of best bear market stocks to invest in now.

            "content": "President Donald Trump on Thursday called out Bank of America for allegedly failing to do business with conservatives.\n\nThe accusation came as an aside during Trump\u2019s virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, on stage during a Q&A session, asked Trump how the wave of executive orders he issued this week might affect efforts to grow the gross domestic product, reduce inflation and boost stock prices.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done a fantastic job, but I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives, because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the regulators mandated that because of [former President Joe] Biden or what, but you and [JPMorgan Chase CEO] Jamie [Dimon] and everybody, I hope you\u2019re going to open your banks to conservatives because what you\u2019re doing is wrong.\u201d\n\nMoynihan did not comment on Trump\u2019s accusation in the moment but laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject, thanking Trump for helping to bring the 2026 World Cup, which Bank of America is sponsoring, to the U.S.\n\nA Bank of America spokesperson said Thursday the bank \u201cserve[s] more than 70 million clients and we welcome conservatives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be engaging with the administration and Congress regarding the extensive government regulations that sometimes result in decisions to exit client relationships,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe never close accounts for political reasons and don\u2019t have a political litmus test.\u201d\n\nA JPMorgan spokesperson said the bank \u201cfollow[s] the law and guidance from our regulators and have long said there are problems with the current framework Washington must address.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have never and would never close an account for political reasons, full stop,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nDimon backed that up in a podcast appearance this week. \u201cWe have not de-banked anyone because of political or religious relationships, period,\u201d he said, according to Reuters. \u201cNow, when we de-bank someone, they often blame that reason, but that\u2019s not a reason.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Banking Committee is planning a hearing on the de-banking issue in February, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAGs\u2019 accusations\n\nBank of America last April weathered \u2013 and countered \u2013 allegations from 15 Republican attorneys general that it \u201cappears to be conditioning access to its services on customers having the bank\u2019s preferred religious or political views.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour discriminatory behavior is a serious threat to free speech and religious freedom, is potentially illegal, and is causing political and regulatory backlash,\u201d Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach wrote to Moynihan. \u201cYour bank needs to be transparent with and assure us, its shareholders, and others that it will not continue to de-bank customers for their speech or religious exercise.\u201d\n\nThe bank rebutted in a May letter of its own that it maintains banking and investing relationships with roughly 120,000 faith-based clients in the U.S.\n\n\u201cReligious beliefs or political view-based beliefs are never a factor in any decisions related to our client\u2019s accounts,\u201d the bank wrote in May, according to CNBC.\n\nRather, the bank said, accounts are de-banked for reasons including a change of stated purpose of the account, the expected level or type of activity on the account or failure to verify certain documentation required by law.\n\nBeyond faith, Kobach in April accused Bank of America of denying services to firearms manufacturers, fossil-fuel producers, private prisons and other clients.\n\nFinancing decisions\n\nIndeed, Bank of America and Citi both agreed in 2018 to stop financing the operations of certain firearms manufacturers after a high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, left 17 students and staff dead.\n\nSimilarly, BofA and several of its peers sought, during Trump\u2019s first presidential term, to divest themselves from financing private prisons as attention focused on immigrant detention centers along the U.S.\u2019s southern border \u2013 and the banks that financed them.\n\nBut the bank more recently tweaked the language of its environmental and social risk policy, potentially backpedaling on firearms and energy restrictions.\n\nThe June 2022 version of the bank\u2019s environmental and social risk policy framework read, \u201cWe have determined that we are currently unable to engage in the following activities based on the appropriate application of our Risk Framework and enhanced due diligence.\u201d\n\nA December 2023 update, though, doesn\u2019t contain the \u201cunable to engage\u201d language for certain activities, instead indicating business is taken on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\u201cAny client relationship or transaction related to the below areas must go through an enhanced due diligence process and be escalated to the senior-most risk review body of the applicable line of business for decisioning,\u201d it reads.\n\nMore directly, de-banking surfaced as a Republican talking point around the time of the 2024 election. Andreessen Horowitz co-founder Marc Andreessen accused certain banks of de-banking crypto executives as clients and posted on X that \u201cthe President\u2019s own wife and son were de-banked.\u201d Andreessen appeared on the Joe Rogan podcast in November, asserting he knows 30 tech company founders who had been \u201cde-banked in the past four years.\u201d\n\nDe-banking can hold severe consequences for lenders, in some cases. Alison Rose, onetime CEO of U.K.-based NatWest resigned in 2023 after discussing, with a journalist, the bank\u2019s decision to close the account of Brexit supporter-turned-pundit Nigel Farage.\n\nTrade group backing\n\nAt least one banking trade group, the Bank Policy Institute, aligned Thursday with Trump\u2019s \u201cdiagnosis that much debanking occurs as a result of an anti-money laundering and \u2018reputational risk\u2019 regime administered by the federal banking agencies where certain types of customers are designated as \u2018high risk.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOver 5,000 government examiners administer this regime, and pressure banks to defend retention of any \u2018high risk\u2019 customer and expend extraordinary resources monitoring those accounts,\u201d BPI\u2019s CEO, Greg Baer, said in a statement Thursday. \u201cThese examiners operate in secret, without checks and balances, and banks that deviate from their directives risk severe fines and penalties.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s spokesperson, likewise, said Thursday the bank welcomes \u201cthe opportunity to work\u201d with Trump and Congress \u201con ways to remove regulatory ambiguity while maintaining our country's ability to address financial crime.\"\n\n\u201cThere should be far cleaner lines about what we have to do and don\u2019t have to do,\u201d Dimon said on this week\u2019s podcast. \u201cWe\u2019ve been complaining about this for years. We need to fix it.\u201d\n\nInvestors, historically, have been less swayed by the issue.\n\nA Bank of America shareholder resolution last year aimed to force the bank to report on \"risks of politicized de-banking.\" The measure received just 3% support.\n\nRaymond James analyst Ed Mills, however, asserted Trump\u2019s BofA barb may be a flare to the banking sector at large.\n\n\"These comments could be early indicators that expansion of [banks\u2019] business to cover some of his preferred industries would be welcomed,\" Mills wrote Thursday in a note seen by Reuters.",

            "content": "President Donald Trump took aim at some of the largest banks in the U.S. on Thursday, Jan. 23, during his address at the World Economic Forum. While speaking about his early accomplishments and economic agenda, the president accused Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase of refusing business from political conservatives.\n\nDuring the event in Davos, Switzerland, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan asked Trump about how he planned to sustain economic growth. After answering the question, the president pivoted to the issue of debanking conservatives. Banks have denied these accusations.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done a fantastic job,\u201d Trump said to Moynihan. \u201cBut I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America. They don\u2019t take conservative business.\n\nDownload the SAN app today to stay up-to-date with Unbiased. Straight Facts\u2122. Point phone camera here\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut you and Jamie [Dimon] and everybody, I hope you\u2019re going to open your banks to conservatives because what you\u2019re doing is wrong.\u201d\n\nMoynihan chose not to address the president\u2019s accusation in the moment, instead opting for a deflection on Bank of America\u2019s plans to sponsor the upcoming World Cup.\n\nBut Bank of America said later, political ideology has no bearing on its customer decisions.\n\n\u201cWe serve more than 70 million clients and we welcome conservatives,\u201d the bank said in an email to Straight Arrow News. \u201cWe are required to follow extensive government rules and regulations that sometimes result in decisions to exit client relationships. We never close accounts for political reasons and don\u2019t have a political litmus test.\u201d\n\nConservative debanking claim goes viral\n\nThe allegations of big bank bias against conservatives gained widespread attention after billionaire engineer and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen talked about it on the \u201cJoe Rogan Experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a constitutional amendment that says the government can\u2019t restrict your speech, but there\u2019s no kind of constitutional amendment that says the government can\u2019t debank you, right,\u201d Andreessen told Rogan in November 2024. \u201cAnd so if they can\u2019t do the one thing, they do the other thing, and then they don\u2019t have to debank you. [Government officials] just have to put pressure on the private company banks to do it. And then the private company banks do it because they\u2019re expected to, but the government gets to say, we didn\u2019t do it. It was the private company that did it. And of course, JP Morgan can decide who they want to have as customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so a lot of this started about 15 years ago with this thing called Operation Choke Point, where they decided, as marijuana started to become legal, as prostitution started to become legal, and then guns, which there\u2019s always a fight about under the Obama administration, they started to debank legal marijuana businesses, escort businesses, and then gun shops, just like your gun manufacturers,\u201d Andreessen added.\n\nAndreessen\u2019s comments caught the attention of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.\n\n\u201cI called Mark Andreessen after that,\u201d Dimon said on Chase\u2019s \u201cThe Unshakeables\u201d podcast on Tuesday, Jan. 21. \u201cHe\u2019s a friend of mine. I want to explain to him, we have not debanked anyone because of political or religious relationships, period.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, when we de-bank someone, they often blame that reason, but that\u2019s not a reason,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t bank marijuana companies because there\u2019s no federal law around it. We simply can\u2019t follow the law. If there\u2019s a federal law, we probably would, and we do bank some crypto companies, and very carefully. We are responsible in the law to fight sex trafficking, money laundering, tax avoidance. It\u2019s the Bank Secrecy Act, and we have to follow that.\u201d\n\nDebanking accusations before Andreessen\u2019s remark\n\nRepublicans have accused big banks of debanking gun makers and fossil fuel companies. And there has been a legislative response.\n\nA number of Republican-led states like Florida, Arizona and Georgia have passed laws that, in some capacity, stop banks from denying services over risks related to ESG, which stands for environmental, social and governance.\n\nBack in 2018, Bank of America instituted a rule to stop lending money to gun manufacturers that make \u201cmilitary-style weapons.\u201d In December 2023, that rule was clarified to say these clients and transactions \u201cmust go through an enhanced due diligence process and be escalated to the senior-most risk review body.\u201d\n\nCitigroup also instituted a policy in 2018 that required its business customers to stop selling firearms to people who hadn\u2019t passed background checks or are younger than 21. They also stopped clients from selling bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.\n\nGet up to speed on the stories leading the day every weekday morning. Sign up for the newsletter today!

Trump specifically named Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase , alleging they were not providing banking services to conservative clients. However, he did not provide any evidence or specifics to support his claims.During the question and answer session, Trump stated, \"I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank and that included a place called Bank of America.\" He also addressed JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, saying, \"I hope you open your banks to conservatives because what you're doing is wrong.\"In his remarks, Trump reiterated his administration's stance on defence spending, urging NATO nations to increase their defence budgets to 5% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This call aligns with his long-standing demand for greater financial contributions from NATO allies.Trump also emphasised the importance of manufacturing products in the United States. He warned companies that they should either produce their goods domestically or be prepared to face tariffs and higher taxes. This message is consistent with his administration's efforts to boost American manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign production.President Trump's administration has consistently pushed for policies aimed at strengthening the U.S. economy through increased domestic production and reduced trade deficits. His calls for higher tariffs on imported goods and incentives for companies to manufacture within the U.S. are part of a broader strategy to revitalise American industry. Additionally, his demands for increased NATO spending reflect his belief that U.S. allies should shoulder a greater share of the defence burden.",

In their statement, the bank noted that they would never close anyone's account for political reasons. \"Bank of America serves more than 70 million clients, and we welcome conservatives. We would never close accounts for political reasons and don't have a political litmus test,\" the bank wrote.\n\nJP Morgan responded to Trump's comment in an email to Business Insider. Their statement was similar to Bank of America's. \"We have never and would never close an account for political reasons, full stop. We follow the law and guidance from our regulators and have long said there are problems with the current framework Washington must address,\" JP Morgan's statement read.",

            "content": "Gulfport has 266,000 net reservoir acres between these regions, with 193,000 of that total in the Ohio holdings and 73,000 in Oklahoma. During the last quarter reported, 3Q24, Gulfport\u2019s total production averaged 1,057.2 MMcfe per day. Of that total, 861.6 MMcfe per day came from the Utica and Marcellus shales, and 195.6 MMcfe per day came from the SCOOP activities. The company states that its production mix is composed of 91% natural gas and 6% natural gas liquids, with the remainder being oil and condensates.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with Gulfport Energy, one of the North American independent natural gas exploration and production companies. Gulfport, from its headquarters in Oklahoma City, has active operations in two widely separated but highly productive natural gas plays: the Marcellus and Utica shale formations in eastern Ohio, and the SCOOP Woodford and SCOOP Springer formations of its home state of Oklahoma.\n\nWith this outlook in mind, the BofA analysts are bringing attention to two energy stocks they believe could emerge as key winners. Using the TipRanks database , we delved into these picks to see if the general Street view chimes with the BofA take.\n\n\u201cWhile one can now argue that gas valuations appear fully baked, we believe AI and its derivatives are a multi-year theme that dovetails with a fundamental reset in US gas,\u201d the analysts said in a recent note. \u201cWe believe 2H25 is framed by tight gas balances that sets up for a material shift higher the forward curve, creating momentum around gas E&P\u2019s that could shift valuations higher to $4.00 NYMEX \u2013 the new baseline for our Gas E&P valuations.\u201d\n\nIncreased consumption will translate into increased opportunities for investors, as energy producers ramp up to meet higher demands. Now Bank of America\u2019s energy analysts are laying out a bullish case particularly in the natural gas sector.\n\nThe energy industry is transforming under the AI tech boom, which relies on real-time, high-speed computing and vast databases. This demands large-scale data centers to support the necessary server stacks and databanks. This kind of infrastructure doesn\u2019t come cheap, however, and the cost is measured in more than money. Data centers on this scale have notoriously high energy demands \u2013 and in fact, they are a major driver of increased energy consumption in recent years.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the financial side, Gulfport reported revenues of $253.9 million in Q3, up 15% compared to 3Q23 while reporting $178.1 million of adjusted EBITDA. Gulfport\u2019s quarterly cash from operating activities came to $189.7 million, and the adjusted free cash flow was $72.6 million.\n\nThis stock has caught the attention of BofA\u2019s Noah Hungness, who sees the firm\u2019s combination of quality holdings and operational efficiency as key to its success. He says of Gulfport, \u201cGPOR broke out at 3Q24 results with positive well results in the volatile oil window of the Utica and continuing to add to its liquid rich inventory that in our view leaves room for GPOR to beat on its liquids growth expectation. This plus increased operational efficiencies and an improving natural gas macro means GPOR has more to go.\u201d\n\nHungness complements his Buy rating with a $227 price target that shows the analyst\u2019s confidence in a 16% one-year upside potential. (To watch Hungness\u2019 track record, click here)\n\nThere are 7 recent reviews on file for GPOR shares, including 6 Buys and 1 Hold for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock has a current trading price of $196.22 and an average target price of $216.86, together suggesting a gain of 10.5% on the one-year horizon. (See GPOR stock forecast)\n\nRange Resources Corporation (RRC)\n\nWe\u2019ll stay in the natural gas sector, where Range Resources has been working the Pennsylvania gas fields, particularly the Marcellus Shale. The company is one of the US gas industry\u2019s independent producers, focusing on natural gas and natural gas liquids. Rage Resources currently operates on approximately 460,000 net acres of prime gas land holdings in southwest Pennsylvania, and its holdings include some 3,100 undrilled Marcellus wells. The company\u2019s well inventory includes 2,600 liquids-rich wells and 500 dry gas wells.\n\nRange Resources doesn\u2019t just depend on scale and size in its operations \u2013 the company boasts that its holdings are high-quality. Range\u2019s core inventory has the longest projected life expectancy among its Appalachian peers, of 16 years or more. The company also estimates that it has some 2,000 undrilled wells in the Marcellus with an estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) greater than 2 Bcfe per 1,000 feet of lateral distance. All of this makes Range Resources one of the strongest players currently operating in western Pennsylvania\u2019s gas fields.\n\nTurning to the company\u2019s results, we find that in 3Q24 \u2013 the last period reported \u2013 Range Resources generated $680.17 million in adjusted non-GAAP revenues. This was up 5% from 3Q23, and beat the forecast by more than $52 million. At the bottom line, the company\u2019s non-GAAP EPS came to 48 cents, beating the forecast by 3 cents per share. The company also saw $246 million in quarterly cash flow from operating activities, for a year-over-year increase of 63%.\n\nThese results were supported by solid production numbers. The company\u2019s total production in the third quarter averaged 2.2 Bcfe per day, with some 68% of that total being natural gas and most of the rest being natural gas liquids.\n\nFor Bank of America\u2019s Kalei Akamine, the key points here are quality and potential. He lays out the case for both in his recent note on Range Resources, saying, \u201cRRC has always been a quality name with a low break even and deep inventory which has been reflected in its multiple\u2026 In 2025 we see an increased likelihood that RRC to utilizes some of its DUC capacity given the strong pricing we have seen in winter so far and progress at Plaquemines. In the first half of the year we continue to expect above trend NGL realizations before extra takeaway capacity at Mont Belvieu comes online in 2H25. We estimate capital will be similar to 2024 levels around.\u201d\n\nAlong with a Buy rating, Akamine puts a $45 price target on RRC, suggesting a one-year upside potential of 10%. (To watch Akamine\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nNot all on the Street are quite as confident. The stock has a Hold rating from the analyst consensus, based on 19 recent reviews with a breakdown of 5 Buys, 12 Holds, and 2 Sells. The shares are priced at $41 and recent gains have pushed the stock 6% above its $38.44 average price target.

That meant that payday lenders, pawn shops, firearms dealers and those involved in pornography had their accounts revoked, often with little notice or explanation as to why.\n\nAs recently as October, Trump singled out Bank of America, repeating claims that it discriminates against conservatives.\n\nThe accusations may have roots in allegations from state attorneys general last year. In April, Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach sent a letter to Moynihan, accusing the bank of canceling the accounts of \"multiple religious groups with mainstream views in the last three years.\"\n\nIn a May letter in response to Kobach, Bank of America said accounts are de-banked for reasons including a change of stated purpose, the expected level or type of activity on the account or failure to verify certain documents required by law.\n\nOne account highlighted by Kobach was de-banked because it engaged in debt collection services, according to the bank's response.\n\n\"We would like to provide clarity around a very straightforward matter: Religious beliefs or political view-based beliefs are never a factor in any decisions related to our client's accounts,\" the bank said in that letter. \"Bank of America provides banking services to non-profit organizations affiliated with faith-based communities throughout the United States. We have banking and investing relationships with approximately 120,000 faith-based clients.\"\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Bank of America said it would engage with the Trump administration on the regulations that sometimes result in de-banking.\n\nInfluential people in Trump's orbit have continued to claim that banks are discriminating based on religion or politics.\n\nIn November, Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the venture capital firm that bears his name, told podcaster Joe Rogan that dozens of startup founders had been de-banked in recent years. Andreessen has said he advises Trump on technology matters.\n\nBank of America shares were up more than 1% on Thursday, with JPMorgan shares higher as well.\n\nThe banking industry is seen as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the election of Trump, in large part because of expectations he would kill Biden-era regulatory efforts to force banks to hold tens of billions of dollars in additional capital against losses, make annual stress tests less opaque and drop efforts to cap credit card and overdraft limitations.",

Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott is leading organization efforts on an upcoming debanking hearing.\n\nThe debanking debate goes back to the Obama administration, during which the so-called \"Operation Choke Point\" discouraged banks from engaging with payday lenders and gun sellers. In 2022, a banking regulator asked banks to pause \"crypto asset-related activity.\"\n\nState attorneys general in 2024 alleged major banks canceled accounts of people with conservative views. Last April, Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach accused Bank of America of canceling accounts of gun manufacturers, Immigration and Customs Enforcement contractors, and Christian ministry groups.\n\n\"Bank of America's practice of cancelling the bank accounts of conservatives and even turning over information about customer's purchases to federal law enforcement undermines free speech, religious freedom and the right to privacy,\" Kobach said in the letter. \"It's discriminatory and likely illegal. As state attorneys general, we will vigorously defend the constitutional rights of all Americans when they are threatened by big business.\"\n\nBank of America responded at the time that de-banking accounts sometimes happens when they fail to verify some documents or change an account's stated purpose.\n\n\"We would like to provide clarity around a very straightforward matter: Religious beliefs or political view-based beliefs are never a factor in any decisions related to our client's accounts,\" the bank wrote at the time.\n\nVenture capitalist Marc Andreessen also said on Joe Rogan's podcast that 30 tech and crypto founders have said their companies were cut off by banking regulators during the Biden administration.\n\nOn JPMorgan Chase's \"The Unshakeables\" podcast released on January 21, chair and CEO Jamie Dimon said of debanking, \"There should be far cleaner lines about what we have to do, and we don't have to do.\" He added, \"We need to fix it.\"",

There are more prosperous times in store for the ubiquitous bank, if a recent and bullish analyst take proves to be accurate.\n\nA price bump from a bull\n\nIn mid-January, Truist Securities's John McDonald published a new analysis of Bank of America just after the lender reported its fourth-quarter 2024 results. Those figures compelled McDonald to lift his price target incrementally; he now feels the bank is worth $53 per share, $1 higher than his previous estimation. He maintained his buy recommendation on the shares.\n\nAccording to reports, McDonald's adjustment mirrors his tweaks to profitability estimates for full-year 2025 and the following year. Although he shaved his 2025 per-share earnings estimate by 1%, he raised his forecast for 2026 by the same percentage.\n\nThe pundit is expecting the bank to spend lavishly on share buybacks. In his view, repurchases should rise dramatically in the coming two years -- from 2024's roughly $14 billion to $17 billion in 2025 and $24 billion in 2026.\n\nA direct play on the economy\n\nA frothy economy, which has been breaking free of the inflation worries that plagued many Americans, supports a thriving banking sector.

            "content": "Is the banking industry prepared for the disruption crypto payments might cause, and if Bank of America leads the charge, what lasting changes can we expect in how banks, businesses, and consumers interact?\n\nBank of America CEO advocates for crypto payments\n\nThe banking and crypto worlds have often seemed like two ships passing in the night \u2014 acknowledging each other\u2019s existence but rarely finding common ground.\n\nHowever, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan has now thrown his weight behind the idea of integrating crypto payments into the U.S. financial system \u2014 but only if regulators give the green light.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1881705570543304806\n\nSpeaking at the prestigious World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Moynihan addressed a question that has long lingered over the industry \u2014 what would it take for banks to embrace crypto as a payment method?\n\n\u201cIf the rules come in and make it a real thing that you can actually do business with, you\u2019ll find that the banking system will come in hard on the transactional side of it,\u201d Moynihan remarked during an interview with CNBC.\n\n\u201cIf you go down the street here and buy lunch, for example, you could pay with Visa, Mastercard, a debit card, Apple Pay, and so on. In that sense, cryptocurrency would just be another form of payment,\u201d Moynihan explained.\n\nHe also discussed a growing realization that crypto \u2014 especially stablecoins backed by traditional assets like the U.S. dollar \u2014 could seamlessly integrate into existing payment networks.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a stablecoin-type of dollar-backed crypto\u2026and our consumers actually want to use it, we think there\u2019s value there,\u201d Moynihan said, hinting that banks could view these tokens as a safer entry point into the crypto payments space.\n\nHowever, Moynihan did not touch upon the notion of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) as an investment or store of value, stating that it is \u201creally a separate question.\u201d\n\nBank of America\u2019s twofold relationship with crypto\n\nBank of America has not always been optimistic about crypto. For years, the institution\u2019s top executives voiced strong concerns, often portraying crypto as a challenge to the transparency and security upon which the banking system relies.\n\nBack in 2018, BofA\u2019s Chief Technology Officer, Cathy Bessant, expressed sharp criticism of crypto\u2019s fundamental structure, stating:\n\n\u201cAs a payment system, I think it\u2019s troubling because the foundation of the banking system is on the transparency between the sender and the receiver, and cryptocurrency is designed to be nothing of the sort.\u201d\n\nShe labelled crypto as the \u201cantithesis\u201d of transparency, mentioning how its pseudonymous nature made it difficult for authorities to \u201ccatch bad guys.\u201d\n\nHowever, over the years, BofA\u2019s stance has drastically evolved. The bank has invested heavily in blockchain, recognizing its potential to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and modernize financial systems.\n\n\u201cWe have hundreds of patents on blockchain already,\u201d CEO Brian Moynihan remarked recently in Davos.\n\nIn 2021, BofA began experimenting with Paxos Settlement Service, a blockchain-powered platform designed to expedite stock settlements. With Paxos, BofA joined global giants like Nomura Holdings and Credit Suisse to address payment inefficiencies, reducing trade settlement times from 48 hours to near-instantaneous processing.\n\nThe bank\u2019s interest in crypto itself has also grown. In 2024, BofA\u2019s Merrill Lynch added Bitcoin exchange-traded funds to its brokerage platforms for eligible wealth management clients.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recently announced the creation of a crypto task force aimed at establishing a \u201csensible regulatory path,\u201d which could provide the necessary guidance for banks like BofA to integrate crypto payments into their operations.\n\nHow U.S. institutions are stepping into crypto\n\nFor years, many of America\u2019s largest financial institutions kept crypto at arm\u2019s length, watching the volatile digital asset market unfold from the sidelines. Concerns about regulatory ambiguity, compliance risks, and the shadow of illicit activities made many hesitant to engage.\n\nHowever, as of 2025, a growing number of giants in the financial sector are beginning to embrace crypto in ways that could fundamentally reshape the market.\n\nTake JPMorgan Chase, for example, a bank whose CEO, Jamie Dimon, once famously referred to Bitcoin as a \u201cfraud\u201d and a \u201cpet rock.\u201d\n\nToday, the bank is not only leveraging blockchain but also pioneering solutions like Kinexys, a platform designed to tokenize real-world assets and enable real-time foreign exchange settlements.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s stablecoin, JPM Coin, launched in 2019, has further cemented its role in digital finance. JPM Coin facilitates high-value institutional transactions, processing roughly $1 billion daily as of late 2023.\n\nBlackRock, another major player, has embraced crypto differently. The world\u2019s largest asset manager launched its spot Bitcoin ETF in early 2024, and the fund has since become the largest of its kind, holding 563,000 BTC valued at over $59 billion as of Jan. 22.\n\nThe rise of exchange-traded products has further bolstered crypto\u2019s legitimacy. In 2024, the launch of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs brought crypto closer to mainstream investors, and similar products for altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) are gaining traction globally.\n\nAccording to a recent statement by WisdomTree, an asset manager closely monitoring digital trends, institutions that fail to integrate crypto into their offerings risk being left behind.\n\nUnder President Trump, pro-crypto policies have gained traction, with expectations of executive orders aimed at accelerating adoption.\n\nDecoding the probable impact\n\nIf regulators give Bank of America and other financial institutions the green light to integrate crypto payments, it could alter how the financial system operates in the U.S.\n\nBank of America, the nation\u2019s second-largest bank with $1.6 trillion in assets under management and $52 billion in new flows in 2023, has the scale and resources to lead this transformation.\n\nCEO Moynihan\u2019s statement that the bank is ready to \u201ccome in hard on the transactional side\u201d reflects years of preparation, backed by hundreds of blockchain patents and the adoption of infrastructure providers like the Paxos Settlement Service to speed up settlement times.\n\nTo grasp the potential impact, it\u2019s important to consider the current size of cryptocurrencies, especially stablecoins.\n\nAccording to Coinbase, in 2023, stablecoins processed $10.8 trillion in transactions, with $2.3 trillion coming from organic activities like consumer payments and business transfers \u2014 marking a 17% increase from 2022 and positioning stablecoins as credible competitors to traditional payment systems like Visa and Mastercard.\n\nIf integrated into banking, crypto could enable consumers to use digital wallets linked to their bank accounts to pay for groceries, utilities, or subscriptions, all without the fees or delays associated with credit cards or ACH transfers.\n\nThe effect would be even more pronounced for businesses, particularly in cross-border transactions.\n\nToday, international transfers are often slow and expensive, with payments taking days to settle. Crypto could change this dynamic, allowing, for instance, a small business owner in Texas to pay a supplier in Singapore within seconds, bypassing currency conversions and intermediary banks.\n\nSuch a shift aligns with trends in North America\u2019s crypto activity. According to Chainanalysis, between mid-2023 and mid-2024, $1.3 trillion in on-chain value was recorded, with about 70% of these transactions being high-value transfers exceeding $1 million.\n\nIf banks like Bank of America incorporate crypto, they could streamline these operations further, reducing liquidity and counterparty risks while keeping operational costs low for their largest clients.\n\nBut the impact doesn\u2019t stop at businesses and large institutions. Crypto payments could help address financial exclusion. The FDIC reports that over 19 million households in the U.S. remain unbanked, often due to high fees, lack of access, or mistrust of traditional banks.\n\nCrypto payments, requiring only a smartphone and internet connection, offer a viable alternative.\n\nThough there are still hurdles, like regulatory concerns and infrastructure gaps, bringing traditional banking and digital currencies together offers a chance to completely reimagine how financial systems work for both people and businesses.",

And the feeling is that it will now swing back to more normalcy,\" Moynihan noted.\n\n\"It swung way too far in the last administration,\" he added. \"We tried to explain to them that was going to cause them troubles\u2026 But I think it's more important that the general economy feels a little bit of relief on regulation across the board, the ability to get deals done, and American companies can now go out domestically and around the world and be the kings that they're supposed to be.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nMoynihan explained that Bank of America\u2019s top research team is expecting 2.4% GDP growth for the U.S. in 2025, the M&A pipeline being \"full\" and a 20% increase in IPOs.\n\n\"Therefore, that says the capital can be put to work. So all that bodes well,\" the chairman and CEO said. \"The enthusiasm by our team for what's ahead is far greater than it was in the fourth quarter because that was sort of under the old regime.\"\n\nREAD MORE FROM FOX BUSINESS\n\nFOX Business\u2019 Eleanor Terrett contributed to this report.",

            "content": "In the last year, many Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Bank of America\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Bank of America\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Bernard Mensah, for US$3.7m worth of shares, at about US$39.81 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$46.66, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 49% of Bernard Mensah's holding.\n\nInsiders in Bank of America didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\n\nNYSE:BAC Insider Trading Volume January 22nd 2025\n\nI will like Bank of America better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of undervalued and small cap stocks with considerable, recent, insider buying.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Bank of America insiders own about US$488m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Bank of America Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nIt doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Bank of America shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Bank of America insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. Of course, the future is what matters most. So if you are interested in Bank of America, you should check out this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.",

            "content": "This page was originally published in 2022 and still contains relevant reader experiences from that time. The rest of the article has since been updated.\n\nKey takeaways One of the best features of this card is its flexible redemption options. You can redeem rewards for travel, gift cards, statement credits or deposits to eligible accounts, all for the same value.\n\nThis card also includes a low annual fee for a travel card, a welcome offer and the ability to boost rewards earnings through Bank of America Preferred Rewards membership.\n\nYou\u2019ll also get other convenient travel benefits like travel-related statement credits, travel insurance and no foreign transaction fees.\n\nThe Bank of America\u00ae Premium Rewards\u00ae credit card redemption flexibility has become one of its greatest attractions. Although technically a travel card, cardholders also have the option of redeeming their points for cash back or gift cards \u2014 with the same redemption value for travel rewards.\n\nWhile the Bank of America Premium Rewards credit card may not be as revered in the travel card world as other options, such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae , it may still be worth considering.\n\nWhat to love about the Bank of America Premium Rewards credit card\n\nWe searched for an everyday user of the Bank of America Premium Rewards card and found attorney Stewart Guss, who loves using his card for two main reasons: its redemption flexibility and its low annual fee. Here\u2019s how Guss maximizes the card\u2019s value and makes it work for his lifestyle.\n\nFlexible redemption options\n\nCardholders earn 2X points for travel and dining purchases and 1.5X points on everything else, and they can redeem their rewards points in several ways. Points can be redeemed for:\n\nTravel booked through the Bank of America Travel Center\n\nGift cards\n\nEligible travel and dining purchases\n\nDeposits into eligible Bank of America or Merrill accounts\n\nEach redemption option varies in value \u2014 0.6 to 1 cent per point.\n\nSome travel credit cards boost your rewards when you redeem your points through a card\u2019s travel portal . This card doesn\u2019t offer that point-boosting perk, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a bad rewards card option. For some, a flat rate on all redemption options is better than just getting boosted travel points.\n\nThe welcome offer\n\nThe card\u2019s current welcome offer is 60,000 online bonus points after spending $4,000 on purchases in the first 90 days of account opening (worth about $600).\n\nGuss took advantage of the welcome offer with his card, noting that \u201cyou have to focus your spending a bit to hit that bonus, forgoing cash or other credit cards where you might have otherwise used them.\u201d But it worked out for him in the end, and he earned the bonus pretty easily.\n\nLow annual fee\n\nYou\u2019ll see annual fees of up to $695 with some of the top travel credit cards , which makes the $95 annual fee with this card worth highlighting. Guss used this exact point when comparing the fees of other travel cards.\n\nSince he knew he wasn\u2019t traveling as much as he usually does \u2014 which would\u2019ve helped him to take advantage of the perks other travel cards offer \u2014 the $95 annual fee was more reasonable, and he could choose to redeem his rewards for cash back instead.\n\nAbility to boost rewards\n\nBank of America offers the Preferred Rewards program , which is available to those with an average rolling balance of at least $20,000 in qualifying Bank of America or Merrill accounts.\n\nOne of the program\u2019s perks is a 25 percent to 75 percent boost in rewards points for qualifying Bank of America credit cards , depending on your membership tier. Although Guss is not a Preferred Rewards member, he wants to learn more about it so he can take advantage of this substantial bonus.\n\nAdditional travel perks\n\nIn addition to the card\u2019s rewards for booking through the Bank of America Travel Center, the Bank of America Premium Rewards card includes other convenient travel benefits. As a cardholder, you can enjoy up to $100 in annual statement credits for airline incidentals and up to $100 in statement credits toward Global Entry or TSA PreCheck every four years, as well as various travel insurance protections \u2014 such as trip cancellation and interruption insurance, baggage delay insurance and lost luggage reimbursement.\n\nPlus, the card doesn\u2019t charge foreign transaction fees , a big perk if you travel overseas. Overall, if a cardholder can take advantage of even half of these card benefits , that will more than make up for the $95 annual fee.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nAt first glance, the Bank of America Premium Rewards credit card may seem a little lackluster considering that you\u2019ll get the same redemption value whether you use rewards for travel or cash back. However, considering the volatility of the travel industry over the last few years, this flexibility can work to the cardholder\u2019s advantage \u2014 you won\u2019t have to worry about saving your rewards for high-value options. Instead, you can redeem your rewards for any option that works best for you, whether that\u2019s travel, cash back or gift cards.\n\nThe Bank of America content in this post was last updated on January 22, 2025.",

            "content": "Bank of America\u2019s stock (NYSE: BAC) posted a better-than-expected set of Q4 2024 earnings, led by stronger investment banking business and higher net interest income. Net profits more than doubled year-over-year to $6.67 billion, or $0.82 per share, while revenues were up 15% to $25.5 billion. Net interest income (NII) \u2013 the difference in between the interest banks earn on loans and pay for deposits \u2013 was up by 3% to $14.5 billion, coming in slightly ahead of estimates. The investment banking business was a particularly strong performer over Q4, with fees up 44% to $1.65 billion. Mergers and acquisitions activity has picked up from nearly a decade-low in 2023. Companies have also been focusing on issuing more debt and equity capital. Sales and trading revenue were up 10% over the quarter, with equities up 6% while fixed income, currencies, and commodities were up by an even stronger 13%. The broader U.S. banking sector has been faring well this earnings season led by rising stock markets which helped trading activity, softer interest rates, stronger dealmaking activity, and general positivity about the economy. For instance, Bank of America\u2019s rival JPMorgan just reported record annual profits for 2024, while Goldman Sachs has also seen profits pick up after witnessing a post-Covid lull.\n\nThe increase in BAC stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 50% in 2021, -24% in 2022, 5% in 2023, and 34% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could BAC face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months \u2013 or will it see a strong jump?\n\nLooking ahead, things could get better. Higher interest rates in recent years weighed on lenders as they had to pay more interest to depositors. However, with the Fed easing rates since September, we could see this softening in the near term helping drive up loan demand while lowering the costs of deposits. Bank of America expects NII of as much as $14.6 billion for Q1 2025 and has indicated that the metric could grow sequentially every quarter this year, reaching as much as $15.7 billion by Q4. NII is an important metric for Bank Of America, as it has a large deposit base compared to rivals.\n\nSeparately, the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency for a second term is also expected to benefit the financial sector at large. Investors are betting that the Trump administration\u2019s focus on deregulation could translate into a more lenient approach to bank oversight versus the Biden administration, with antitrust-related rules also potentially easing. This could help banks boost their revenues, via higher deal volumes, and lending activity, as well as possibly lower compliance costs which could directly boost profitability. Trump has also been in favor of tax cuts, which could also help the bottom lines of banks such as Bank Of America. Overall, lower interest rates and more political certainty post-election could spur investment banking and M&A-related activity. Additionally, lower interest rates and more political certainty post-election could spur investment banking activity, with increased debt and equity issuances with M&A-related activity also poised to increase. Overall, at its current price of $47 per share, BAC is trading around the Trefis\u2019 estimate for Bank of America\u2019s valuation.\n\nReturns Jan 2025\n\nMTD [1] Since start\n\nof 2024 [1] 2017-25\n\nTotal [2] BAC Return 6% 42% 153% S&P 500 Return 1% 24% 165% Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio 3% 20% 774%\n\n[1] Returns as of 1/17/2025\n\n[2] Cumulative total returns since the end of 2016\n\nInvest with Trefis Market-Beating Portfolios\n\nSee all Trefis Price Estimates\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

This enthusiasm from a large financial institution solidifies crypto\u2019s expected momentum for the next four years.\n\nAnd regulations could take form quickly.\n\nCircle CEO Jeremy Allaire said he expects executive orders will come \u201cimminently\u201d that open the door for banks to trade crypto and offer crypto investment to their clients, per Reuters.\n\nsaid he expects executive orders will come \u201cimminently\u201d that open the door for banks to trade crypto and offer crypto investment to their clients, per Reuters. President Donald Trump will also reportedly sign an executive order establishing a crypto advisory council to advocate for the industry's policy priorities, per Bloomberg.\n\nThe bigger picture: While Trump is trying to rally the crypto industry, he\u2019s also involving himself in exploits that crypto executives aren\u2019t ready to get behind.\n\nBoth Trump and First Lady Melania Trump rolled out crypto meme coins ( $TRUMP and $MELANIA ).\n\nand ). But crypto executives are worried these coins will fuel criticism of the industry and erode the trust they were hoping Trump\u2019s regulatory agenda would establish, per Bloomberg.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s inauguration, his coin was down 45% from its peak\u2014exactly what many crypto executives are afraid of.\n\nOur take: Enacting crypto regulation will help to boost adoption. But while momentum will grow, crypto payment use won\u2019t jump overnight. We expect just 19.4% of crypto owners will actually transact with crypto in 2026, versus 13.4% in 2024, per our forecast.\n\nEspecially if meme coins further damage public opinion of crypto, it will take time for consumers to trust the assets and for players like Bank of America to launch and scale their payment offerings.",

            "content": "Bank of America (BAC) is issuing $1 billion of restricted stock to its employees following the lender\u2019s strong fourth-quarter 2024 financial results.\n\nTo retain senior level employees, Bank of America, the second-largest lender in the U.S., is awarding stock bonuses on top of staff\u2019s regular compensation. The stock awards will be provided to employees who earn as much as $500,000 in total annual pay, according to a memo from CEO Brian Moynihan.\n\nBank of America says that 97% of its global workforce is eligible to participate in the stock awards. This is the eighth time that the commercial bank has paid its workforce stock awards. Since the bonus program began in 2017, the lender has paid out a total of $5.8 billion worth of stock awards.\n\nStrong Financial Results\n\nThe latest stock awards come after Bank of America reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter and all of last year. The lender announced $27.1 billion of 2024 net income, up 2.3% from the previous year. \u201cIt was another strong year for our company as we continued to drive growth and deliver for our clients,\u201d said Moynihan in the memo to staff.\n\nBank of America says it remains focused on increasing its revenue while also investing for future success, spending money on people and technology. The lender isn\u2019t the only Wall Street bank doling out rewards to workers. The biggest U.S. banks have raised pay packages to retain top talent, giving them more stock awards or cash bonuses.\n\nOn January 17, Goldman Sachs (GS) announced that it was giving CEO David Solomon and President John Waldron $80 million of stock awards each to remain at the investment bank an additional five years. Last autumn, Bank of America raised its minimum wage to $25 an hour starting this year. BAC stock has gained 47% over the past 12 months.\n\nIs BAC Stock a Buy?\n\nThe stock of Bank of America has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 19 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 17 Buy and two Hold recommendations assigned in the last three months. The average BAC price target of $52.94 implies 13.78% upside from current levels.\n\nRead more analyst ratings on BAC stock\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

            "content": "Bank of America has a rich history dating back to 1800 and even earlier. It was begun by immigrants as a group of separate and unrelated banks that, over the years, merged and grew together. One such is the Bank of Italy which was founded in 1904 by Amadeo Giannini to serve Italian immigrants that were facing discrimination. He later buys out the Banca de America e de Italia (Bank of America and Italy) which was also located in San Francisco. Over the years additional mergers and changes in Federal banking legislation, as well as the boom brought on by WWI and then WWII, helped boost the bank to national prominence.\n\nThings turned sour, however, in 1998 with a major bond default that led to yet another merger, this time with Charlotte, NC-based Nations Bank to officially become the Bank of America that exists today. At the time, the merger was the largest bank merger in history and the company has only grown in the time since.\n\nOther additions to the new Bank of America include MBNA (a major credit card operator), Fleet Boston (then the US 7th largest and one of its oldest banks), and Merril Lynch, now Merril, which was added to the group in 2008 to provide an investment banking branch. Together the company dominates as one of the Big Four Banks in America. Bank of America lays claim to nearly 11% of all US deposits which ranks in line with its peer group and Bank of America Securities is listed as the world\u2019s 3rd largest investment bank.\n\nToday, Bank of America Corporation provides banking and financial services for individuals, small businesses, institutions, corporations, and governments worldwide. The bank operates in three segments Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, and Global Banking bringing in a combined revenue greater than $90 billion in 2022.\n\nAs of 2022, Bank of America serves approximately 67 million consumer and small business clients with approximately 4,200 retail financial centers. The bank also operates more than 16,000 ATMs and digital banking platforms with approximately 41 million active users.\n\nIts Consumer Banking segment offers traditional banking and investment products for retail clients. These range from deposit accounts to savings, credit cards, consumer loans, and IRAs. The Global Wealth & Investment Management segment offers investment and wealth management solutions including, brokerage, banking, and trust and retirement products. The Global Banking segment provides lending products and services, including commercial loans and leases for businesses of all varieties. The Global Markets segment offers market-making, clearing, settlement, and custody services, as well as risk management, derivatives, and FX exchange services.",

The stock awards, an incentive beyond regular compensation, are available to employees earning up to $500,000 annually, according to a memo from CEO Brian Moynihan. Around 97% of the bank\u2019s global staff is eligible.\n\nThis marks the eighth year of the program, which has awarded more than $5.8 billion since its 2017 inception. Moynihan highlighted the company\u2019s strong performance in 2024, reporting $27.1 billion in net income, a 2.3% increase from the prior year. The bank is investing in its workforce and technology to position for sustainable growth.\n\nIn addition to stock awards, a limited number of employees will receive cash bonuses based on local requirements and individual compensation. Details on award amounts will be shared in the coming weeks.\n\nBank of America has consistently taken steps to support its employees, including raising the minimum wage to $24 per hour in 2024, with plans to reach $25 per hour this year. This move aligns with Wall Street\u2019s trend of offering enhanced compensation packages to retain top talent.\n\nTikTok Resumes After Trump Delay\n\nTikTok is partially restoring service in the U.S. after President-elect Donald Trump announced he would sign an executive order delaying a federal ban. In a statement, TikTok thanked Trump for providing \"clarity and assurance\" to service providers, enabling the platform to resume operations for over 170 million American users and support 7 million small businesses.\n\nThe decision, described as \"a strong stand for the First Amendment,\" followed Trump\u2019s Truth Social post urging companies to keep TikTok accessible. The app was shut down briefly after a Supreme Court ruling upheld the ban pending ByteDance's divestment to a non-Chinese entity.\n\nTikTok\u2019s future remains uncertain, with Trump proposing a U.S. joint venture owning 50% of the platform. ByteDance, however, continues to resist selling. Despite its partial restoration, TikTok\u2019s long-term status hinges on negotiations and compliance with U.S. laws. TikTok pledged to collaborate with Trump on a lasting resolution.\n\nLos Angeles Rebuild May Take Decade\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink estimates that rebuilding Los Angeles after the devastating wildfires could take up to a decade. Speaking to CNBC, the Los Angeles native emphasized the long-term challenges of recovery, including the impact on homeowners\u2019 insurance and infrastructure. The fires, which have ravaged neighborhoods, infrastructure, and businesses, highlight the need to redefine event risk in disaster-prone areas, Fink noted.\n\n\u201cHomeowners\u2019 insurance is becoming a larger component of homeownership,\u201d he said, stressing the urgent need for government action. The wildfires, which have caused at least 24 deaths and incinerated entire neighborhoods, have led to insurance losses estimated as high as $40 billion.\n\nThe destruction is unprecedented, with entire communities and critical services like schools and supermarkets reduced to ashes. Fink recalled his own connection to the region, lamenting the devastation of areas he enjoyed exploring as a child. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen destruction like this,\u201d he said.\n\nDISCLAIMER: None of this is financial advice.

The additional support will free up attorneys and other professional staff to take on more clients and cases, allowing VLI to help additional service members.\n\n\u201cThis funding will create more space to prevent veteran homelessness and reduce veteran suicide by giving our deserving heroes a hand up,\u201d said Antoinette Naddour, VLI\u2019s co-founder and executive director.\n\nOrangewood Foundation will use the Neighborhood Builders grant to expand its services to an additional 250 youth annually, providing a holistic approach to housing, workforce development and wraparound services to support them as they work toward long-term independence.\n\n\u201cWe are so grateful to have been selected to receive this generous and prestigious grant from our long-time partner, Bank of America,\u201d said Chris Simonsen, CEO, Orangewood Foundation. \u201cIt comes at a time when the number of young people we are serving is increasing dramatically and their issues and challenges are more complex.\u201d\n\nHomerun of the Holiday Season\n\nThe Angels Baseball Foundation hosted its 18th annual Kids Holiday Party at Angel Stadium in Anaheim on Dec. 17.

But once the Fed started cutting rates those gains halted, so investment banking helped pick up the slack.\n\nThe largest U.S. banks posted substantial fourth-quarter revenue and profit gains thanks to a resurgence in Wall Street dealmaking.\n\nInvestment banking revenue soared compared to the same quarter a year ago, with the largest banks all reporting increases of 25% or more. The two biggest, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) led the way with whopping gains of 49% and 44%, respectively.\n\nInvestors cheered the results. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) gained more than 8% last week, recovering most of the decline posted since early December, as shares of JP Morgan, Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C) and other banks surged.\n\nThat December downturn mirrored broader stock market concerns centering on lingering inflation pressure and how the Federal Reserve may respond. While that anxiety persisted into 2025, last week's results offered a measure of comfort for investors in big banks.\n\nDeals Drive Growth\n\nThe investment banking growth exhibited by large banks in the fourth quarter reflected increased activity in securities underwriting and mergers and acquisitions. The Fed's interest rate increases beginning in March 2022 had dampened both.\n\nCorporations steered away from financing operations with debt at higher interest costs. Likewise, higher rates weakened enthusiasm for mergers and buyouts. But that has begun to change now that the Fed has shifted gears, cutting its benchmark rate three times since September.\n\nIn December alone, U.S. corporations issued $67.8 billion in bonds, almost double the $35.7 billion in corporate issuance in the same month a year earlier. Meanwhile, a long-anticipated rebound in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) appeared to take hold in 2024, with global deals totaling $3.4 trillion, up 15% from 2023.\n\nMorgan Stanley estimates that private equity and venture capital firms still have about $3 trillion in uncommitted capital that could further fuel an M&A rebound in 2025. That, of course, would continue boosting investment banking revenue.\n\nGood Timing\n\nThe fourth-quarter investment banking boon came at an opportune time for large banks.\n\nFor much of the past two years, banks had enjoyed ongoing expansion of net interest income, courtesy of the Fed's rate hikes. But once the Fed stopped hiking and started cutting, those gains halted. So investment banking helped pick up the revenue and earnings slack.\n\nJPMorgan's results offer a prime example. The firm's net interest income in the fourth quarter fell marginally from the third quarter and dropped 3% from the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nYet overall revenue rose 10%, reflecting the investment banking surge and a 21% increase in asset management fees. The latter, of course, benefited from strong U.S. stock market returns. The revenue gain and a 7% decline in non-interest expenses produced a 50% increase in quarterly profit year over year.\n\nResults at other large banks told similar stories with the uptick in investment banking business constituting the common thread.",

            "content": "Warren Buffett and his team at Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.33%) (BRK.B 1.53%) have long dabbled in bank stocks, owning almost every major Wall Street bank at one time or another over the past several decades. It's an industry Buffett has deep ties to and has done incredibly well with if you think back to Berkshire's timely bank stock investments during the Great Recession.\n\nWhile Buffett and Berkshire seemingly soured on the sector after the pandemic began (another prescient investing call), Berkshire still owns several bank stocks in its massive $295 billion equities portfolio. Let's examine two of Berkshire's larger bank positions and see which might be the better buy right now for other investors.\n\nBank of America: Chasing the king JPMorgan Chase\n\nBerkshire has owned Bank of America (BAC -0.36%) for many years and it's the conglomerate's third-largest equity position, consuming 12% of the overall portfolio. Berkshire sold a large chunk of the stock last year and it's unclear if the selling will continue.\n\nWhen I think about Bank of America, I tend to think about it as the little brother of the country's largest bank, JPMorgan Chase. Not only is Bank of America the country's second-largest bank by assets, but it's the only other of the Big Four that can boast excellence and scale in so many different banking businesses, including commercial lending, investment banking, wealth management, and credit card lending. Still, its returns aren't quite at the same level as JPMorgan's. Bank of America's return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) has averaged about 13.2% over the last two years, which pales in comparison to JPMorgan's impressive 21.5%. This is a big reason for the valuation gap.\n\nWhile Bank of America is unlikely to ever catch JPMorgan, it can do better than 13.2% ROTCE. Bank of America has the stickiest consumer deposit base of the Big Four banks and as such benefits from a steepening yield curve, which is finally occurring right now after two years of an inverted yield curve. On the bank's recent earnings call, management guided for the quarterly net interest income run rate to potentially grow by $1 billion through the year, exceeding initial analyst estimates. Loan growth could return this year as well.\n\nMore recently, the bank has taken a back seat to Wells Fargo as investors have gotten excited about Wells Fargo soon exiting its asset cap. However, Bank of America should benefit from other tailwinds coming to the sector, including lighter regulation and the return of investment banking activity.\n\nCitigroup: This time seems different\n\nBerkshire took a new stake in Citigroup (C 0.89%) in 2022 and the stock currently makes up 1.5% of Berkshire's portfolio. Citigroup has far and away been the worst-performing large U.S. bank stock since the Great Recession and many investors have ditched the stock out of frustration.\n\nHowever, the market is starting to believe in CEO Jane Fraser's turnaround plan. Fraser took over as CEO at Citigroup in 2021 and began the difficult task of simplifying Citigroup's complex and sprawling organization. Citigroup is in the process of exiting or selling 14 of its consumer international franchises that it didn't have the scale to compete in. The company is also working to modernize its infrastructure after regulators slapped the bank with infractions for poor internal controls and taking too long to correct those.\n\nCitigroup also announced a plan to exit its consumer, small business, and middle market operations at its highly profitable division in Mexico called Banamex. However, the move has proved long and arduous and encountered many hiccups along the way. After failing to sell the bank, Citigroup split the consumer and small business operations from its institutional business in the country, which it plans to retain. The next step is an eventual IPO. All of these moves are intended to free up capital that Citigroup can use to continue to modernize the bank and invest in its high-returning businesses like investment banking, wealth management, and international money movement.\n\nAfter reporting strong earnings in the fourth quarter, Citigroup announced the authorization of a $20 billion share repurchase plan, something investors have been chomping at the bit for. As you can see in the first chart above, Citigroup trades below its tangible book value (TBV), or net worth. Repurchasing shares while trading below TBV is accretive to TBV, which bank stocks trade relative to. Growing TBV tends to translate into a growing share price.\n\nBuy $0.88 for $1\n\nI think investors can buy either of these stocks, which will serve them well long term. Bank stocks will never be high-flying artificial intelligence stocks but still deserve some allocation in your portfolio.\n\nRight now, I am making a valuation call and recommending investors buy Citigroup over Bank of America. Buying banks under TBV is where real money can be made in the banking sector if Citigroup can enhance its returns over time (a path the bank appears to be on). If Citigroup can eventually trade at half the valuation of JPMorgan, investors are going to do very well. The bank also carries a 2.8% dividend yield, the highest in its peer group, so investors will be compensated for their time.",

Additionally, it will assist in the Family Restorative Living Facility aimed at addressing the homeless population's need for a place to live due to Florida's increase in housing prices.\n\n\u201cThis funding will go a long way towards helping us meet the increasing need for services here in the St. Lucie County community,\u201d said Chrystal Netherton, CEO of GraceWay Village. \u201cThis year alone, we have seen a 35% increase in the need for meals to feed families and individuals facing economic challenges, so we greatly appreciate the support from Bank of America and are honored to be recognized as a Neighborhood Champion.\u201d\n\nNeighborhood Champions is part of the bank\u2019s longstanding efforts to build thriving communities by addressing issues fundamental to economic opportunity.

            "content": "Analysts at Bank of America say there's a slew of buy-rated stocks well positioned heading into earnings season. CNBC Pro combed through the firm's research to find companies the firm likes as quarterly reports begin. They include: Warner Bros Discovery, Birkenstock , Spotify and United Airlines. United Following on the heels of Delta's robust earnings report last week, analyst Andrew Didora is feeling bullish on shares of United. \"We expect UAL to report strong 4Q24 results and guide 1Q25 ahead of consensus when the company reports earnings after the close on January 21,\" he wrote. The firm raised its price target on the stock to $120 per share from $100 and says it sees robust revenue growth continuing. In addition, travel demand remains strong despite the macro uncertainty, according to Didora. \"The airline is the biggest beneficiary of the strong premium, corporate, and transatlantic growth mentioned in DAL's earnings report last week,\" he wrote. United was also added to Bank of America's prestigious US1 top ideas list. Shares are up 183% over the last year. Warner Bros Discovery Buy the dip in shares of the media and entertainment company, analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich said. The stock is down 6.3% over the last year, but the firm says the buying opportunity is just too compelling to ignore. \"WBD's 4Q earnings should reflect a continuation of the various headwinds in the business,\" she wrote acknowledging the challenges the industry faces. Still, the firm says the positive catalysts outweigh the negative. They include \"easing studio comparisons, potential recovery in advertising, further growth in DTC [direct to consumer] and potential profit inflection.\" \"We continue to believe WBD has a compelling assortment of assets,\" she added. The company is scheduled to report earnings later this quarter. Birkenstock The shoe company is firing on all cylinders ahead of earnings in late February, analyst Lorraine Hutchinson wrote following a recent meeting with company management. The firm says it sees several tailwinds in the months ahead including pricing power, product diversification and international growth. \"We view Asia as a largely untapped opportunity,\" she noted. Further, the company recently reiterated revenue guidance of 15% to 17% growth in fiscal year 2025, which Bank of America said is eminently \"achievable.\" Meanwhile, Birkenstock shares are up 20% over the last 12 months with plenty more room to run, Hutchinson said. \"We retain our Buy rating and view BIRK as a brand that will continue to take share globally,\" she went on to say. Spotify \"We reiterate our Buy rating and $515 PO. We believe SPOT is at an inflection point in profitability and FCF driven by: 1) deeper penetration in existing markets, 2) recent/future price increases, 3) new pricing tiers, 4) an improvement in advertising driven by digital initiatives and 5) new businesses such as audiobook.\" Birkenstock \"BIRK reiterated its FY25 guidance of 15-17% revenue growth. We view this as achievable given current brand momentum. We retain our Buy rating and view BIRK as a brand that will continue to take share globally. ... .We view Asia as a largely untapped opportunity,\" United Airlines \"We expect UAL to report strong 4Q24 results and guide 1Q25 ahead of consensus when the company reports earnings after the close on January 21. ... .The airline is the biggest beneficiary of the strong premium, corporate, and transatlantic growth mentioned in DAL's earnings report last week...\" Warner Bros Discovery \"WBD's 4Q earnings should reflect a continuation of the various headwinds in the business. ... .We continue to believe WBD has a compelling assortment of assets.

The lender also predicted it would earn higher interest income for 2025.\n\nFor the full year of 2024, the banking giant's revenue surpassed $100 billion, driven by strong growth in fee income, and its profit came in at $27.1 billion.\n\n\"Every source of revenue increased, and we saw better than industry growth in deposits and loans,\" BofA CEO Brian Moynihan said in an earnings release. \"We believe this broad momentum sets up 2025 very well.\"\n\nWall Street CEOs also voiced confidence that the incoming U.S. administration would maintain a business-friendly environment beneficial to banks. This comes as the country's top lenders report a surge in profits, driven by an uptick in dealmaking and trading activities.\n\nBankers expect global deal volumes to surpass $4 trillion in 2025, the highest level in four years.\n\nThe broader operating environment has been favorable for the banking industry, propelled by strong equity markets and analysts' expectations that President-elect Donald Trump will implement a deregulatory and lower-tax agenda.\n\nEarlier this month, Reuters reported, citing a source, that BofA's bonus pool for investment bankers will probably rise 10% for the previous year.\n\nThe bank's stock surged 30.5% in 2024, outperforming the broader equity markets.\n\nStock awards are typically issued to reward employees, retain top talent, and align their interests with the company's long-term success.\n\n(Reporting by Manya Saini in Bengaluru and Saeed Azhar in New York; Editing by Mohammed Safi Shamsi and Diane Craft)",

            "content": "As it has done in its recent quarterly results, Bank of America spelled out the level of digital engagement of its wealth and private banking clients.\n\nBank of America said yesterday that its global wealth and investment management arm logged a year-on-year gain in net income at $1.171 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by a rise in net revenue of $6 billion from $5.23 billion a year earlier.\n\nThe Charlotte, North Carolina-headquartered bank said noninterest expenses in its wealth and investment business rose to $4.438 billion from $3.894 billion. There was a small ($3 million) provision against credit losses, against a net a $26 benefit in Q4 2023.\n\nThe rise in revenue was driven by a 23 per cent rise in asset management fees, Bank of America said in a statement.\n\nTotal client balances rose 12 per cent to $4.3 trillion; in Q4, assets under management flows were $22 billion, with $79 billion since the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nInside its Bank of America Private Bank, AuM balances stood at $404 billion; and total client balances were $674 billion, with 720 net new relationships added in Q4 2024.\n\nThe Merrill Wealth Management business held $1.5 trillion in AuM balances, and 3,900 net new households were added in the last quarter.\n\nBoA also continued to stress clients\u2019 digital engagement, as it has done in recent quarterly reports. For example, it said that 92 per cent of its wealth clients are digitally active; digital wallet transactions rose by 46 per cent.\n\nGroup results\n\nBank of America said net income stood at $6.7 billion, or $0.82 per diluted share, compared with $3.1 billion, or $0.35 per diluted share, in 4Q2024. Revenue, net of interest expense, was $25.3 billion, rising 15 per cent on a year earlier.\n\nThe bank said the revenue gains were mainly caused by higher asset management and investment banking fees, and sales and trading revenue.\n\nThe bank had a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio \u2013 a bank\u2019s shock absorber \u2013 of 11.9 per cent on a standardized basis; the lender returned $5.5 billion to shareholders; $2.0 billion of which was done through common stock dividends and $3.5 billion in share repurchases.\n\n\u201cWe finished 2024 with a strong fourth quarter. Every source of revenue increased, and we saw better-than-industry growth in deposits and loans,\u201d Brian Moynihan, chief executive and chairman, said.",

            "content": "Is this a buying opportunity?\n\nEarnings season kicks off with banks and over the past two days, banks have posted robust earnings results, including Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).\n\nBut unlike Wednesday, when JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup stocks were all soaring on strong reports, on Thursday it has been a different story.\n\nBank of America stock, for example, was down 2% after reporting a 116% spike in earnings. M&T Bank, US Bancorp, and PNC Financial were all down about the same, or more. Only Morgan Stanley stock was rising Thursday, but it is primarily an investment bank and asset manager, and less a consumer bank.\n\nSo why was Bank of America and other bank stocks trending lower today?\n\nWhy earnings soared\n\nBank of America had an excellent quarter that in part looks much better by comparison to the fourth quarter of 2023. The year 2023 was a difficult one for banks, following the banking crisis that occurred in the spring of that year. But the fourth quarter was made even worse because the FDIC levied a special assessment against large banks to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund. The assessment was necessary after the fund had been depleted to help shore up banks following the banking crisis.\n\nSo, that certainly was a factor in Bank of America\u2019s huge earnings spike. But it was still a good quarter for the nation\u2019s second largest bank.\n\nThe company generated net revenue of $25.3 billion, which was 15% higher than the same quarter a year ago. It also beat estimates of $25.1 billion. It grew net interest income by 3% to $14.4 billion, which also topped expectations.\n\nThe bank made $6.7 billion in net income, or 82 cents per share. This was more than double the $3.1 billion in net income in Q4 of 2023, but that was significantly impacted by the FDIC special assessment. Still, Bank of America topped estimates of 77 cents per share.\n\nInvestment banking boost\n\nLike the other big banks, Bank of America got a boost from investment banking and institutional trading. Investment banking fees spiked 44% to $1.7 billion. Meanwhile, the Global Markets business, which includes institutional trading, saw revenue climb 18% year over year to $4.8 billion.\n\nIts bread-and-butter, Consumer Banking, posted a modest 3% revenue gain to $10.6 billion. Loan balances increased 1%, which helped lift NII, but deposits were down 2%. Noninterest expenses rose 8% and the bank efficiency ratio \u2013 which gauges the amount of expenses to generate revenue \u2013 remained at 53%.\n\nAlso, net charge-offs increased $23 million to $1.2 billion, driven by higher credit card charge-offs.\n\n\u201cWe finished 2024 with a strong fourth quarter,\u201d Chair and CEO Brian Moynihan said. \u201cEvery source of revenue increased, and we saw better than industry growth in deposits and loans. We also ended with strong capital and liquidity, enabling us to return $21 billion of capital to shareholders in 2024.\u201d\n\nSo why was Bank of America stock down?\n\nThere may be several reasons why Bank of America, and other bank stocks, were trending lower after a solid Q4. But none of them seem to be too worrying.\n\nThe pullback today may be in part to a lackluster earnings report from UnitedHealth, which missed revenue estimates and had higher than expected costs. Bank of America\u2019s retreat may also be tied to red day for the major indexes across the board, after three straight days of gains. The market\u2019s may have been impacted by a mixed inflation report on Wednesday or Thursday retail sales report, which was not as robust as analysts thought.\n\nBank of America executives are bullish, however. CFO Alistair Borthwick said the bank is \u201con track\u201d to grow net interest income in 2025. The company guided for $14.5B to $14.6B in NII in Q1 and $15.5B to $15.7B by the fourth quarter.\n\nFurther, it anticipates noninterest expense to rise 2% to 3% in 2025 and a net charge off ratio of 50 bps to 60 bps. The net charge-off ratio in Q4 was 0.54%, or 54 basis points.\n\n\u201cAsset quality is healthy, and client spending continued to grow at a moderate pace, reflecting a solid economic environment,\u201d Borthwick said. \u201cLooking towards 2025, we remain focused on delivering for our shareholders while supporting our clients\u2019 growth and driving market share.\u201d\n\nIs Bank of America stock a buy?\n\nBank of America has a median price target of $50 per share, which would be up about 8% from its current price. That sounds about right, as the valuation is reasonable.\n\nBut if the economy slows and inflation rises, that could have an impact as banks often go as the economy goes. Bank of America stock is certainly a hold if you own it, but if you are looking to add a good cheap bank stock with growth potential, you may want to weigh its upside against some others.",

            "content": "UPDATE: This article includes quotes from CEO Brian Moynihan and CFO Alastair Borthwick, as well as new details on Bank of America's guidance for 2025.\n\nBank of America expects its net interest income to reach unprecedented heights next year, the nation's second-largest bank said as it unveiled its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n\"We should report record NII in 2025,\" CEO Brian Moynihan said in a conference call with analysts on Thursday.\n\nIn the final three months of 2024, the bank's net interest income reached $14.5 billion, up from $14.09 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. In its guidance for next year, Bank of America expects that growth to reach $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2025 \u2014 an increase of about 7%.\n\nCFO Alastair Borthwick said the bank's confidence in its forecast has a lot to do with deposits, which he said have stabilized since the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath.\n\n\"There was a period there where deposit balances were declining as people got back to something more normal in their accounts,\" Borthwick said. \"But \u2026 consumer [banking] found its floor in August, wealth [management] found its floor in July, and that's giving some support then as we grow deposits. That's helping us with the NII growth.\"\n\nAverage deposits at Bank of America reached $1.96 trillion in last year's fourth quarter, up 3% from the same period in 2023. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of growth for the bank's deposits.\n\nAnother encouraging factor, Borthwick said, is loans. Average loans and leases at Bank of America rose to $1.08 trillion in the last three months of 2024, an increase of 3% year on year.\n\n\"Those two things \u2014 a little more confidence around deposit growth, a little more confidence around loan growth \u2014 those obviously compound through the course of the year,\" Borthwick said. \"So that will help us in the back half of '25.\"\n\n\n\nA strong end to 2024\n\nBank of America exceeded Wall Street's expectations last quarter, fueled by rising fee income from its wealth management and investment banking units.\n\nFrom October through December 2024, net income for America's second-largest bank reached $6.7 billion, up from $3.1 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nDiluted earnings per share were 82 cents, surpassing analysts' average estimate of 77 cents according to S&P. Revenue reached $25.3 billion, barely above analysts' estimates of $25.1 billion.\n\n\"We finished 2024 with a strong fourth quarter,\" Moynihan said in a statement on Thursday. \"Every source of revenue increased, and we saw better than industry growth in deposits and loans. \u2026 We believe this broad momentum sets up 2025 very well for Bank of America .\"\n\nThe megabank said this growth was largely thanks to fee income from two departments: Global Wealth and Investment Management, which saw its fees rise 23% year on year, and Global Banking, whose fees jumped 44%.\n\nDuring the conference call, Borthwick called Global Banking \"the most efficient business in the company.\"\n\n\"The business saw a nice rebound in investment banking fees in 2024, which we expect to continue in 2025,\" he said.\n\nOverall, the year-on-year improvement is in some ways not surprising. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Bank of America \u2014 along with its peers \u2014 was hit with a special assessment from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., stemming from that year's regional bank crisis . It also suffered a plunge in net interest income as the Federal Reserve hiked rates to historic highs.\n\nAs 2025 begins, the bank's leadership says economic conditions are much more favorable.\n\n\"Asset quality is healthy, and client spending continued to grow at a moderate pace, reflecting a solid economic environment,\" Borthwick said. \"Looking towards 2025, we remain focused on delivering for our shareholders while supporting our clients' growth and driving market share.\"\n\n\n\nAn old-school strategy\n\nFor Bank of America , the fourth quarter also saw the return of building more brick-and-mortar branches. The bank said in September that it planned to open 165 more locations by the end of 2026, including 40 in 2024.\n\nThe plan marks a reversal from years of focusing on digital banking, a shift that began more than a decade ago and was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. From 2010 to mid-2024, Bank of America reduced its total branch count by almost 40%.\n\nBut as the COVID crisis recedes into history, many of the changes it brought to banking \u2014 including remote work \u2014 are beginning to fade as well. And it's not just Bank of America ; JPMorgan and Wells Fargo have also been opening new branches in areas where their footprint is small.\n\nBank of America has said offering both digital and physical interfaces for customers is an important part of its strategy, not only for banking but for wealth management.",

CEO\n\nsaid the performance positions the second-largest U.S. bank to generate record net interest this year from deposits and lending.\n\nQuarterly profit totaled 82 cents a share, topping expectations by 5 cents on an adjusted basis, according to Zacks Equity Research. Revenue of $25.3 billion also topped estimates, spurred by higher asset management and investment banking fees and revenue from sales and trading, according to the earnings released earlier Thursday.\n\nThe Charlotte-based bank is confident that deposits and loans will continue growing, CFO Alastair Borthwick told analysts on a call. Investment banking fees soared 44% in the quarter, signaling a \u201crebound\u201d in the business that the company believes will continue this year.\n\nBorthwick cited \u201cpro-business sentiment\u201d emerging from Donald Trump\u2019s re-election as president and the expectation that corporate deal-making may accelerate.\n\nBank of America shares slipped 45 cents (0.96%) in trading today, after gaining $1.12 Wednesday in anticipation of the company\u2019s earnings report for the quarter and year ended Dec. 31.\n\nThe year-end results represent \u201ca solid finish to another good year at Bank of America,\u201d Moynihan told analysts. \u201cWe\u2019ve positioned ourselves well for growth in 2025.\u201d\n\nBank of America set aside $1.5 billion for credit losses in the quarter, up from a provision of $1.1 billion a year earlier. Credit losses narrowed from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, reflecting commercial losses that were partially offset by seasonally higher credit card losses.\n\nThe company forecast that net interest income will grow sequentially in 2025 from the first quarter to the fourth quarter when it\u2019s projected at $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion. As deposits increased last quarter, the bank\u2019s interest expenses on those deposits declined, boosting profitability in a trend Borthwick predicted will continue this year.\n\nBank of America released year-end results after Citigroup Inc. and JP Morgan Chase & Co. also posted higher-than-forecast quarterly results.\n\n\u201cThe outlook for banks is quite extraordinary,\u201d Mac Sykes, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in an email to MarketWatch. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a normalized rate environment combined with higher real rates, which, alongside a potential M&A boom, should significantly benefit the sector.\u201d\n\nSykes also cited stronger prospects for capital raising around the widening adoption of artificial intelligence by companies, as well as \u201cstable\u201d credit conditions and \u201cpro-growth government\u201d in Washington.\n\nCompared to a year earlier, fourth-quarter revenue grew across the board at Bank of America, helped by a wider usage of the bank\u2019s digital channels and a growing number of customers and financial services relationships.\n\nIn the consumer bank, 61% of sales transacted digitally, up from 49% a year earlier. Consumer banking revenue increased 3% to $10.6B from the third quarter of 2023 on higher net interest income and card income.\n\nAn increase of assets under management and related fees at Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank spurred revenue growth of 15% to $6 billion in Global Wealth & Investment Management. In Global Banking, revenue increased 3% to $6.1 billion on higher investment banking fees.\n\nHigher investment banking fees and sales and trading revenue lifted revenue 18% to $4.8 billion in Global Markets.",

And 78% of all households signed up with the bank are defined as being \u201cdigitally active,\u201d up from 75% a year ago.\n\nInteractions with Erica, the company\u2019s virtual financial assistant, were 171.5 million in the latest quarter, up significantly from 122.9 million last year. Zelle peer-to-peer payments logged $127 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $101 billion in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.\n\nDuring the earnings call, CEO Brian Moynihan noted that the company grew revenue year over year in each of its business segments.\n\n\u201cThe economy appears to be now settled into a 2- to 3%-GDP-type growth environment,\u201d he remarked, adding that the economy\u2019s healthy employment has helped make consumers resilient, and the strength \u201cof the American consumer can be seen in our data. So far, this in the first two weeks in January, they\u2019re spending money at 4% to 5% clip over last year,\u201d Moynihan said.\n\nGrowth in Checking Accounts\n\nThe bank also has seen growth in net new checking accounts and new commercial accounts, which has enabled Bank of America to grow its loans and deposit base. The company\u2019s earnings materials indicated that during 2024 the firm added 1.1 million net new checking accounts and 4 million credit card accounts. Consumer deposits stood at $942 billion in the latest quarter, growing a bit from $938 billion in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cEarly in the year, we highlighted that our expectation on consumer credit is that they would stabilize to normal levels,\u201d Moynihan said. Credit card loss rates of 3.79% in the fourth quarter were up 0.09% from the third quarter.\n\nCFO Alastair Borthwick said that commercial loans were up 5% year over year, and said that loan and deposit growth in the current year should outpace last year\u2019s.\n\nBank of America shares were down less than 1% on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe biggest story in consumer this quarter is deposits because these are the most valuable deposits in the franchise, And in the last six months, we believe we\u2019ve seen the floor begin to form after several periods of slowing decline,\u201d said the CFO, who added that \u201cconsumer banking deposits appear to have bottomed in mid-August.\u201d\n\nDuring the question-and-answer session with analysts, Borthwick said that Bank of America is seeing \u201cmore optimism with clients, a little more activity, a little more demand from clients for loan growth. So those two things a little more confidence around deposit growth, a little more confidence around loan growth \u2014 which obviously compound through the course of the year.\u201d\n\nManagement also noted on the call that average checking account balances are now stable at around $9,000 after having peaked in past years at $11,000 \u2014 and checking is helping to fund deposit accounts.\n\nAsked on the call about small business optimism and lending prospects, Moynihan said that \u201cin our business banking category \u2026 we have small business bank and we have our Global Commercial Bank, for middle market. Across that environment, the draw rates and lines of credit stuff are still much lower than they were in pre-pandemic.\u201d\n\nHe said that after the recent environment of high interest rates \u201ctheir optimism has changed\u201d as the regulatory environment may be shifting and the uncertainty about the election is now a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the optimism come up,\u201d said Moynihan, who added, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to translate that optimism into activity, and then you\u2019ll see the loan growth come.\u201d",

EPS of $0.82 came in ahead of the consensus estimate of $0.77. Revenue was a strong $25.3 billion, slightly above expectations of $25.1 billion. This performance marks a pivotal quarter, demonstrating significant financial growth and robust earnings despite a competitive environment.\n\nNotable achievements include year-over-year net income growth of 116% to reach $6.7 billion.\n\nMetric Q4 2024 Analysts' Estimate Q4 2023 Change (YOY) EPS $0.82 $0.77 $0.35 134% Revenue $25.3 billion $25.1 billion $22.0 billion 15% Net income $6.7 billion N/A $3.1 billion 116% Net interest income $14.4 billion N/A $14.1 billion 2.1%\n\nBusiness Overview and Key Success Factors\n\nBank of America provides a wide range of banking and financial services across several segments, including Consumer Banking, Global Wealth and Investment Management, Global Banking, and Global Markets. The company is known for its extensive infrastructure, robust digital engagement platforms, and significant investment in technology. This quarter, digital engagement stood out with 61% of sales occurring through digital channels, indicating successful tech investments. The company has also shown proficiency in managing regulatory requirements, a crucial factor in the banking sector.\n\nKey factors contributing to its success include strategic investment in digital platforms and strong capital management. Bank of America\u2019s CET1 ratio, a measure of financial strength, remained robust at 11.9%. Its diverse business model, which reduces reliance on any single revenue source, and strong market positioning remain fundamental to its strategy.\n\nQuarterly Achievements and Challenges\n\nDuring Q4 2024, Bank of America showcased broad financial strength across all segments. In Consumer Banking, revenue rose by 3% year over year to $10.6 billion and net income reached $2.8 billion, lifted by card and net interest income. An impressive growth of 22% was seen in investment assets despite a slight 2% decrease in average deposits. Additionally, combined credit and debit card spending increased by 5% year over year.\n\nThe Global Wealth and Investment Management segment also saw a 15% increase in revenue, strongly driven by higher asset management fees. Net income for the segment was $1.2 billion, with overall client balances hitting $4.3 trillion, reflecting a 12% growth from the previous year.\n\nGlobal Banking revenue increased by 3% year over year, with net income amounting to $2.1 billion. A significant 44% surge in investment banking fees stood out as a notable achievement. The segment also experienced a provision for credit losses of $190 million, compared to a provision benefit in the prior year.\n\nMeanwhile, Global Markets reported a 13% boost in sales and trading revenue, amounting to $4.1 billion, primarily driven by better trading conditions in its Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities segment. The segment's net income rose to $941 million, marking a considerable improvement from the previous year.\n\nA rise in provisions for credit losses, which reached $1.5 billion compared to $1.1 billion the previous year, suggests ongoing adjustments to macroeconomic conditions. Nonetheless, the bank maintained strong capital management, returning $5.5 billion to shareholders, including $3.5 billion in share repurchases.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nManagement at Bank of America maintains a positive outlook for 2025, with CEO Brian Moynihan noting plans to continue the momentum begun in 2024 from revenue streams and asset management enhancements. The bank anticipates additional growth bolstered by its diversified operations and ongoing strategic investments. It aims to capitalize on digital engagement and competitive market positioning to sustain growth trends.\n\nInvestors should monitor regulatory impacts and cost management, as these remain critical components of Bank of America's strategic playbook. Continued technological investments to improve customer experience and operational efficiency point toward sustained growth prospects, as does the solid trajectory in deposit and loan growth.",

It's called \"the phantom hacker.\"\n\nThe FBI said the scam is growing in popularity, and the public needs to be vigilant.\n\nABC7 heard from one woman who lost $20,000 in the scheme. She is a hair stylist with two children who was hoping to open her own business this year. That all changed when she received a phone call from a man who claimed to be with Bank of America.\n\nStruggling to recount what happened to her, Milan Jackson is choosing to speak out, hoping to warn others about the vicious scheme.\n\nThe North Side hair stylist said it all began a few months ago, when her phone started ringing while she was working with a client.\n\n\"I answer the phone, and it was a man who tells me that, 'This is Bank of America,' and that there was suspicious activity,\" Jackson recalled.\n\nJackson said she looked on the back of her Bank of America card and verified the phone number on the card matched the number from the caller. She said the man on the phone informed her that a hacker was trying to steal $20,000 from her account, and they needed to act fast to prevent it from happening.\n\n\"Very upset. I'm just trying to hurry up and make sure they can't get that money, because I had set up money aside for opening up a business,\" Jackson said. \"I then get transferred, and they walk me through how to potentially stop the fraud.\"\n\nThe number on your caller ID or cell phone might show that it's the bank. Scammers do not discriminate against anyone. They want money from anyone they can take it from. Rachel LaRocque, FBI Special Agent\n\nShe was told to log into her account and wire $20,000 to a different account where her money would be protected. Jackson proceeded with the wire.\n\n\"My anxiety is going up and he's like, 'Okay we only have this amount of time. I want to make sure we block this and prevent this from happening to you,'\" Jackson said.\n\nNearly seconds after completing the transfer, Jackson said she didn't feel right.\n\n\"I get this weird feeling, and so I go into Bank of America, and they confirm that this is a scam. I shut the phone off. I'm hysterically crying,\" Jackson said. \"People who do this to other people, you don't know what's in somebody's life.\"\n\nJackson said she's going through a separation, has two children and was planning to buy a building this year to expand her hair business.\n\n\"I can't believe this is my life,\" Jackson said. \"How did this happen, and how am I going to get this money back?\"\n\nThe FBI calls it \"the phantom hacker,\" and it's growing rapidly. Scammers impersonate bank representatives to convince victims that hackers have infiltrated their financial account. Victims are urged to move their money fast to protect their assets. In reality, there was never a hacker, and the money that was wired is now fully controlled by the scammer.\n\nFBI Special Agent Rachel LaRocque said a legitimate financial institution is not going to ask you to move your money elsewhere. She said consumers have to be skeptical, because hackers are becoming more sophisticated.\n\n\"And they may even be able to spoof that bank's phone number, so the number on your caller ID or cell phone might show that it's the bank,\" LaRocque said. \"Scammers do not discriminate against anyone. They want money from anyone they can take it from.\"\n\nMore information from the FBI about spoofing and phishing can be found here.\n\nJackson's dreams of opening her own brick-and-mortar store are now deferred. Her $20,000 is gone.\n\n\"I've been working 10 to 13 hours plus with no break,\" Jackson said. \"I have to expedite that money that was stolen from me, and it wasn't just stolen from me, but stolen from my kids, too.\"\n\nBank of America told the I-Team in cases like this, they attempt to get the money back, but there is no guarantee the bank will be able to recover the funds once their client authorizes the transfer. Bank of America said it will never call and ask a client to send money through Zelle or a wire transfer, ever.\n\nIf you have become the victim of a scam, the FBI is urging the public to report it, no matter how embarrassing it might be.

            "content": "Chase Bank and Bank of America are strong contenders in the banking world. As the two biggest banks in the United States, they both offer simplified banking and a number of benefits. However, Chase Bank edges out Bank of America in nearly every category, from the number of ATMs to variety of account types.\n\nWith that said, I personally have used Bank of America for my everyday banking needs since I was a teenager, and I have few complaints. I appreciate that it offers in-person banking as well as a simple mobile app (although Chase does too), and I have been able to avoid fees by keeping a certain balance in my checking account.\n\nAt the end of the day, you can't go wrong choosing either one of these banks. Chase Bank may be a better option if you are a young adult just getting started or a parent trying to introduce your kids to good personal finance habits. If you already have an account with Bank of America, sticking with it will allow you to make the most of its rewards program.\n\nHow we evaluate products We know checking and savings accounts can be critical tools for managing your money. They're one of the financial tools you use the most. That's why the features offered by a bank matter so much and we've taken that into consideration in our evaluations.

Learn More\n\nChase Bank vs. Bank of America: What both companies excel at\n\nVariety of account options\n\nBoth banks offer multiple checking, savings, and CD options. Chase organizes its accounts by customer type, with multiple options for students, everyday users, and investors. Bank of America also offers a variety of account options with a focus on different customer types such as students, current Bank of America members, and average users. However, the number of different Chase accounts for kids and teens stands out to me as compared to Bank of America's options.\n\nAutosave features\n\nBoth banks reward your business by offering savings features when you have a linked checking or savings account with the bank. Chase's checking accounts allow you to set up recurring saving goals when you have a linked Chase savings account.\n\nBank of America allows you to round up your debit card purchases if you have both a savings and checking account. You can transfer the difference to your savings account automatically.\n\nFee waivers\n\nWhile both banks charge monthly fees for nearly all of their accounts, if you meet certain requirements, these fees may be waived. For example, most student accounts for both Chase and Bank of America have waived fees. Additionally, if you meet certain minimum balance requirements, your fees get waived. This is how I avoid fees at Bank of America.\n\nStudent accounts\n\nNot all banks are built with younger customers in mind, so it's refreshing to see that both Bank of America and Chase have multiple options for kids, teens, and college students.\n\nBank of America offers checking accounts with no fees (as long as you're under 25) and no overdraft fees. Students can also qualify for Bank of America's Advantage Savings, which also has a waived fee and includes cashback rewards and personalized financial planning through the Bank of America Life Plan.\n\nChase offers more options than Bank of America when it comes to accounts for younger account holders. There are parent-connected accounts for kids between ages six and 12, high school students, and college students. None of these accounts come with fees, and most of them give you online banking access, autosave features, and quick mobile deposits.\n\nChecking accounts compared\n\nChase and Bank of America have numerous checking accounts, each meant for a different type of customer. While nearly every one of these accounts at both banks requires a monthly fee, each holds different features that make these fees worthwhile \u2014 or easy to avoid.\n\nChase Bank checking accounts: Bank of America checking accounts: Chase's accounts come with monthly service fees, some of which can be waived if you meet certain requirements 2 <p>$12 Monthly Service Fee OR $0 with one of the following, each monthly statement period:</p> <p>Electronic deposits made into this account totaling $500 or more, such as payments from payroll providers or government benefit providers, by using (i) the ACH network, (ii) the Real Time Payment network, or (iii) third party services that facilitate payments to your debit card using the Visa\u00ae or Mastercard\u00ae network,</p> <p>OR a balance at the beginning of each day of $1,500 or more in this account,</p> <p>OR an average beginning day balance of $5,000 or more in any combination of this account and linked qualifying Chase checking, savings, and other balances.</p> 3 <p>Your direct deposit needs to be an electronic deposit of your paycheck, pension or government benefits (such as Social Security) from your employer or the government. Person to Person payments (such as Zelle\u00ae) are not considered a direct deposit. Micro-deposits do not qualify as a direct deposit for the bonus. Micro-deposits are small deposits, typically less than $1, that are sent to your account to verify it is the correct account.</p>\n\nSome accounts come with overdraft protection 4 <p>With Chase Overdraft Assist\u2120, we won\u2019t charge an Overdraft Fee if you\u2019re overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the business day OR if you\u2019re overdrawn by more than $50 and you bring your account balance to overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the next business day (you have until 11 PM ET (8 PM PT) to make a deposit or transfer). Chase Overdraft Assist does not require enrollment and comes with eligible Chase checking accounts.</p>\n\nNo minimum deposit requirements\n\nSome accounts earn interest\n\nKids, high school, and college checking accounts available Accounts have maintenance fees that can be waived if you meet certain requirements\n\nOverdraft protection available on certain accounts\n\nMost accounts require a minimum opening deposit of $25-$100\n\nSome accounts earn a small amount of interest\n\nAccounts for students\n\nSavings accounts compared\n\nWhile you won't earn much in the way of interest with either company's savings account, Chase and Bank of America have different advantages within their savings accounts. Chase specializes in keeping minimum deposits low, while Bank of America prioritizes higher interest rates for Preferred Rewards members.\n\nChase Bank savings accounts: Bank of America savings accounts: Most savings accounts have monthly fees, and some can be waived under certain conditions\n\nAutosave features available on all accounts\n\nNo minimum initial deposit\n\nLow interest rate of 0.01% (as of 12/10/24) APY for basic Chase savings account Have monthly fees that can be waived\n\nOffers round-ups through its Keep the Change program that can add to savings\n\nPreferred Rewards members earn better rates and rewards\n\n$100 minimum deposit needed to open an account\n\nLow interest rate of 0.01% (as of 01/11/25) APY\n\nHigh-yield savings accounts offer significantly more interest. Many of these are offered by online banks and credit unions. Here are some recommendations for high-yield savings accounts that don't require a minimum balance.\n\nCDs compared\n\nBoth Chase and Bank of America offer various CD types and terms. Each has the same minimum deposit requirements, but Chase offers the highest annual percentage yield (APY) to customers with a qualifying checking account.\n\nChase Bank CDs: Bank of America CDs: CD terms range from 1 month to 10 years\n\n$1,000 minimum required to open any CD\n\nBest rates come from having a linked Chase checking account CD terms range from 28 days to 10 years\n\n$1,000 minimum required to open a Bank of America CD\n\n3 important differences between Chase Bank and Bank of America\n\n1. Minimum deposit requirements\n\nBoth Bank of America and Chase have minimum deposits for their CDs, each requiring $1,000 to get the ball rolling, which is not uncommon for CD accounts. But Bank of America requires an initial deposit for most of its checking and savings accounts, while Chase doesn't.\n\nBank of America requires $100 for some of its checking accounts and savings accounts. Chase, on the other hand, has no minimum requirement for any of its accounts. This reason alone might be enough to push me toward Chase if I was setting up my accounts for the first time.\n\nWinner: Chase, as it has no minimum requirements.\n\n2. Loyalty perks\n\nChase offers rewards specifically through its CDs. You may qualify for a higher interest rate if you have a Chase checking account.\n\nBank of America, on the other hand, has a loyalty program that offers credit card rewards, discounted rates on loan products, and no fees on certain accounts. You do have to maintain a high balance across all accounts to access these perks. The lowest Preferred Rewards tier starts with a $20,000 balance, while the highest requires over $1 million.\n\nWinner: Bank of America, thanks to its Preferred Rewards program that offers rewards like a $200 reduction in origination fees for mortgages and up to 0.25% off your auto loan rate, even at its lowest tier.\n\n3. Cash back\n\nChase sometimes offers bonuses for opening certain accounts. Bank of America goes a little further in its cashback offerings.\n\nIf you use the mobile app, you can see all of the cash back deals you're eligible for. Every time I log on, there is a wide variety of rewards available, offering between 1% and 20% cash back at popular retailers. For example, I've saved offers to earn 5% cash back at Sephora, 10% back at Safelite, and even 20% back for travel booked through Expedia.\n\nYou can use eligible Bank of America credit cards or debit cards to earn rewards.\n\nWinner: Bank of America since its offerings are more diverse.\n\nWhich company should you choose?\n\nWhen you should choose Chase Bank\n\nChase is a strong choice for the following types of customers:\n\nYounger consumers looking for fee-free accounts they can later upgrade.\n\nCustomers who want many CD options.\n\nThose who don't want a minimum opening deposit.\n\nWhen you should choose Bank of America\n\nWhile Chase wins in many regards, Bank of America is still a solid contender for many individuals. These types of people will benefit most from an account:\n\nCurrent Bank of America credit card customers who can earn a 25% bonus on their rewards.\n\nCustomers looking to earn cash back at select types of retailers.\n\nWhat factors to consider before choosing\n\nChase works well for younger consumers who can take advantage of the few fees and easy-to-use mobile and desktop options. If I was setting up my first checking or savings account, I would definitely consider a Chase account. This said, Chase offers many different accounts across the board, so most customers can likely find an account that works for them.\n\nBank of America also offers a variety of accounts but really works best for Bank of America loyalists. If, like me, you have other Bank of America accounts or credit cards, you'll reap the most rewards through Bank of America's Preferred Rewards program.\n\nFAQ\n\nIs Chase Bank better than Bank of America? Both Chase and Bank of America are powerhouses in the banking industry, so neither is inherently better than the other. To decide which one works better for your needs, browse through each bank's offerings and compare account features. What is the difference between Chase Bank and Bank of America? Chase Bank and Bank of America are two of the largest banks in the U.S. Both have branches and ATM networks all over the country, but their checking, savings, and CD offerings differ from each other. Bank of America focuses on offering cash rewards and extra features to its Preferred Rewards members. Chase Bank instead prioritizes offering a large number of account types across the board. From kids to students to average consumers and high-net-worth investors, Chase has an account that fits. What is the best bank to have? The best type of bank for you depends on your financial habits and needs. Those with little need to visit a branch should concentrate on online-based banks with few fees and an easy-to-use mobile app. If you're looking for a personalized experience, go with banks with a large network of branches that prioritize customer service. Either way, the best banks have a strong reputation, make the banking process easy, and keep their fees low.",

            "content": "The Bank of America Preferred Rewards program is a loyalty program that provides a range of financial perks if you're a customer who maintains a qualifying balance across your Bank of America and Merrill accounts. With benefits that increase as your combined account balance grows, the program offers everything from waived banking fees and higher credit card rewards to discounted loan rates and higher savings account rates.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nBank of America's Preferred Rewards program is designed for loyal customers who have several Bank of America deposit accounts and Merrill investment accounts.\n\nThe Preferred Rewards program is separated into five tiers, each requiring a different three-month combined average daily balance.\n\nThe higher you ascend in the Preferred Rewards tiers, the more rewards and incentives you receive.\n\nTo qualify for the program, you must have a Bank of America personal checking account and a three-month combined average daily balance of at least $20,000 in eligible Bank of America and Merrill accounts.\n\nWhat is the Bank of America Preferred Rewards program?\n\nBank of America is one of the best banks for customer rewards. Its Preferred Rewards program lets you receive certain perks and benefits that vary depending on how much money you have combined in qualifying Bank of America accounts. The eligible accounts can include various Bank of America deposit accounts as well as Merrill investment accounts.\n\nBank of America's Preferred Rewards program is designed for loyal bank customers who have a considerable amount of money held at the bank. The program is divided into five tiers, each with a different minimum balance requirement. The options start with the Gold tier, which requires a minimum three-month average combined balance of $20,000, up to the Diamond Honors tier, which requires a minimum combined balance of $10 million.\n\nThe higher your tier, the more discounts and benefits you can receive. The perks of being a Bank of America Preferred Rewards member include:\n\nWaived select service and monthly maintenance fees\n\nRewards bonuses on eligible Bank of America credit cards\n\nInterest rate discounts on auto loans and home equity loans\n\nDiscounts on foreign currency orders\n\nReduced mortgage origination fees\n\nInterest rate boosts on Bank of America Advantage Savings accounts\n\nAnnual fee discounts on Merrill Guided Investing and more\n\nHow to qualify for the program\n\nTo qualify for the Preferred Rewards program, you must have an eligible Bank of America personal checking account and at least a three-month combined average daily balance of $20,000 across your eligible Bank of America deposit accounts and Merrill investment accounts.\n\nAccounts that qualify for the program include Bank of America Advantage Banking (checking), savings, money market, CD, IRA, Merrill Cash Management Account (CMA), Merrill IRAs, 529 plans on your Merrill account, and revocable grantor trust accounts.\n\nOnce you've qualified, your membership in the Preferred Rewards program lasts for one year, regardless if your combined balance temporarily falls below $20,000. So, if you have at least $20,000 in your accounts, you should enroll in the program to take advantage of the benefits. Participating won't cost you anything.\n\nBank of America reviews your program qualification annually. After a year, if you fall below the $20,000 minimum balance required, you have a three-month grace period to get it back up before you lose your Preferred Rewards benefits. And, even if you do lose your benefits, the bank can still reinstate you within 24 months if your balance increases to meet the minimum.\n\nBank of America Preferred Rewards tiers\n\nThe Bank of America Preferred Rewards program has five tiers based on your three-month average combined account balance. The lowest tier is the Gold tier, and the highest one is the Diamond Honors tier.\n\nBank of America reviews your account status monthly. As your qualifying balance increases, the bank automatically upgrades you to the next tier once you reach the minimum balance required.\n\nThe rewards you receive will increase as you ascend the tiers. For example, Gold tier members receive a 25% rewards bonus on eligible Bank of America credit cards. However, if you're in the Diamond tier, you'll receive a 75% rewards bonus on those credit cards.\n\nThe table below shows the five Bank of America Preferred Rewards tiers with their required three-month average combined balances and select benefits. We'll cover each tier in detail.\n\nTier Credit Card Rewards Bonus Advantage Savings interest rate boost Mortgage discounts Gold ($20,000 - $49,999) 25% 5% $200 off origination fees Platinum ($50,000 - $99,999) 50% 10% $400 off origination fees Platinum Honors ($100,000 - $999,999) 75% 20% $600 off origination fees Diamond ($1 million - $9.99 million) 75% 20% 0.250% interest rate reduction (with PayPlan) Diamond Honors ($10 million+) 75% 20% 0.375% interest rate reduction (with PayPlan)\n\nGold tier\n\nThe lowest tier in Bank of America's Preferred Rewards program is the Gold tier, which requires a three-month combined average daily balance of $20,000 to $49,999. With this tier, you'll avoid select banking service and monthly maintenance fees (for four savings and four checking accounts).\n\nOne of the main advantages of the Preferred Rewards program is getting discounts on mortgages and car loans. With the Gold tier, you'll get $200 off origination fees if you take out a new mortgage or refinance your current one. If you need an auto loan, you'll get an interest rate discount of 0.25%. Plus, you'll get a 0.125% rate discount on a home equity line of credit (HELOC) if you need cash to remodel your home, consolidate debt, or accomplish other goals.\n\nOther Gold tier benefits include:\n\n25% rewards bonus on the bank's eligible credit cards\n\n5% interest rate boost on a Bank of America Advantage Savings account\n\n1% exchange rate discount for online and mobile foreign currency orders\n\n0.05% discount on Merrill Guided Investing annual fees\n\nPlatinum tier\n\nYou reach the Platinum tier with a three-month combined average daily balance of $50,000 to $99,999. If you're already a Gold tier member, you'll enjoy an automatic upgrade to the Platinum tier when your three-month combined account balance reaches this tier's minimum.\n\nLike with the Gold tier, you can avoid select banking and monthly maintenance fees. However, you also get 12 free out-of-network ATM transactions per year (up to one per statement cycle).\n\nThe Platinum tier gets you reduced fees and discounts at a higher level. For example, you'll receive a $400 discount on mortgage origination fees and a 0.250% interest rate discount on a HELOC. The rate discount for auto loans increases to 0.35%, and the credit card rewards bonus jumps to 50%.\n\nOther Platinum tier perks include:\n\n10% interest rate boost on your Bank of America Advantage Savings account\n\n1.5% exchange rate discount on mobile and online foreign currency orders\n\nAnnual program fee discount of 0.10% on Merrill Guided Investing accounts\n\nPlatinum Honors tier\n\nIf you often use non-Bank of America ATMs, the Platinum Honors tier will benefit you because it gives you unlimited fee-free transactions at out-of-network ATMs. To qualify, you'll need a three-month combined average daily balance of $100,000 to $999,999 across your eligible Bank of America and Merrill accounts.\n\nOnce you reach the Platinum Honors tier, your benefits and discounts increase as follows:\n\n20% interest rate booster on your Bank of America Advantage Savings account\n\n75% rewards bonus on your Bank of America credit cards\n\n$600 reduction on mortgage origination fees\n\n0.375% HELOC interest rate discount\n\n0.50% interest rate discount on new auto loan applications\n\n2% exchange rate discount on mobile and online foreign currency orders\n\n0.15% discount on annual Merrill Guided Investing fees\n\nDiamond tier\n\nThe Diamond tier of Bank of America's Preferred Rewards program is where you want to be if you travel often and complete transactions abroad. It offers unlimited fee-free international transactions and ATM use.\n\nTo reach the Diamond tier, you'll need a considerable amount of money in your eligible accounts \u2013 a three-month combined average daily balance of $1 million to $9.99 million. But in exchange, you get access to exclusive lifestyle benefits that include discounts and incentives on travel, fashion brands, dining, golf courses, spa resorts, and vehicle buying and leasing.\n\nSeveral benefits in the Diamond tier are the same as the Platinum tier offers. For example, the credit card rewards bonus, savings account boost, auto loan rate discount, foreign exchange rate discount, and Merrill Guiding Investing annual fee discount remain alike.\n\nBut if you're a current or aspiring homeowner, the Diamond tier offers attractive incentives, including a 0.625% interest rate discount on a HELOC and a 0.250% interest rate reduction on mortgages. You must enroll in PayPlan, Bank of America's automatic payment service, to receive the mortgage rate discount. If you don't, you'll still get the 0.125% discount provided under the Diamond tier.\n\nDiamond Honors tier\n\nThe top tier of Bank of America's Preferred Rewards program is the Diamond Honors tier, which requires a three-month combined average daily balance of $10 million or more. It's very similar to the Diamond tier except for the discounts offered on mortgages and HELOCs.\n\nAs a Diamond Honors tier member, you can receive a 0.375% interest rate reduction on mortgages with PayPlan enrollment and a 0.750% interest rate discount on new HELOCs.\n\nHow to enroll in Preferred Rewards\n\nEnrolling in the Preferred Rewards program is easy and free. To qualify, you must have a Bank of America personal checking account and a three-month combined average daily balance of at least $20,000 across your eligible Bank of America deposit accounts and Merrill investment accounts.\n\nYou can enroll before you meet the $20,000 minimum, but you must reach that level within 30 days of opening your Bank of America checking account. Once you reach that level, the bank automatically enrolls you in the Gold tier of the Preferred Rewards program. The benefits you receive will become available within 30 days of enrollment.\n\nYou can move up in the program's tiers by increasing the amount of money you have in your eligible accounts. The bank reviews your three-month average daily balance every month, and once it reaches the minimum for the next tier level, you will get an automatic upgrade.\n\nRemember that the program is based on a three-month average daily balance, so increasing the balance in just one month may not entitle you to an upgrade.\n\nSay you've been in the Gold tier with a balance of $40,000 for the past seven months and then increase your balance to $60,000 in the eighth month. At that point, your three-month average daily balance would be about $46,667. However, if you have a $60,000 balance in the ninth month, your three-month average daily balance would be $53,333, qualifying you for Platinum.\n\nWhich credit cards qualify for the program?\n\nAll the Bank of America Preferred Rewards program tiers offer reward bonuses on eligible credit cards through the bank. These range from 25% to 75%, depending on your tier.\n\nHere's a list of the Bank of America credit cards that you can use with the program.\n\nHow to get the most out of Bank of America Preferred Rewards\n\nNo matter which tier you're in, you can enjoy many benefits through the Bank of America Preferred Rewards program. To make the most of it, consider the recommendations below.\n\nGet and use an eligible Bank of America credit card\n\nBank of America offers some of the best rewards credit cards available, and its Preferred Rewards program can help you earn even more. All tiers provide a rewards bonus on eligible Bank of America cards.\n\nFor example, if you have a Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card that earns 3% on select purchases, you'd earn $3 cash back on a $100 transaction. As a Gold tier member, you get a 25% rewards bonus, which means you earn $3.75 in cash back on the same transaction. Your 50% rewards bonus as a Platinum tier member would equate to $4.50 per $100, and your 75% rewards bonus would get you $5.25 per $100 if you're a Diamond tier member.\n\nOpen a Bank of America Advantage Savings account.\n\nAs a Preferred Rewards member, you can receive a 5% to 20% interest rate boost on your Bank of America Advantage Savings account, which offers a standard rate of 0.01%-0.02% (as of 01/10/25).\n\nTake advantage of loan discounts\n\nWhether you're buying or refinancing a home, purchasing a new vehicle, or considering a HELOC, Bank of America's Preferred Reward program offers discounts you'll want to utilize. For example, you can get a reduction in mortgage origination fees between $200 and $600, depending on whether you're on the Gold, Platinum, or Platinum Honors tier.\n\nIf you're a Preferred Rewards member who is buying a new car, you can get an interest rate discount between 0.25% and 0.50%. You can also receive interest rate discounts anywhere from 0.125% to 0.750% on new HELOCs.\n\nInvest with Merrill Guided Investing\n\nMerrill, the investment arm of Bank of America, offers an advisory program called Merrill Guided Investing, where Merrill professionals help build, monitor, and rebalance your portfolio. You usually have to pay a program fee of 0.45%.\n\nMerill calculates the fee monthly based on your account balance from the prior month. So, if your account balance at the end of July is $2,000, then your cost for August is $0.75 ($2,000 x .0045 /12). However, as a Preferred Rewards member, you can get a discount on that fee for anywhere between 0.05% and 0.15%.\n\nFor example, being a Platinum tier member would get you a 0.10% annual program fee discount, so your fee would be 0.35% rather than 0.45%. With the same calculations used above, your cost for August would be $0.58 ($2,000 x .0035 /12).\n\nFAQs\n\nHow much are Bank of America rewards points worth? Bank of America reward points are worth $0.01 per point, so the cash equivalent of 1,500 points is $15. As a Preferred Rewards member, you can earn between 25% and 75% more points for your purchases. For example, with the Bank of America Travel Rewards card, you earn a standard 1.5 points for every $1 you spend. However, you can earn between 1.87 and 2.62 points for every $1 spent with the Preferred Rewards program. While these points are worth the same amount when you redeem them ($0.01 per point), more points earned will mean a higher return. Is the Preferred Rewards program worth it? If you have enough money to satisfy the $20,000 three-month minimum daily balance requirement to qualify, then the Preferred Rewards program is definitely worth participating in. There's no cost to join, and as a member, you can save money on banking fees, home and auto loans, foreign transactions, and more. The advantages outweigh any drawbacks. Is there a downside to Bank of America Preferred Rewards? The only possible downside to the Bank of America Preferred Rewards program is the high minimum balance required to participate in it. This may make it cost-prohibitive for many people who don't have at least $20,000 to put into Bank of America and Merrill accounts.\n\nBottom line\n\nThe Bank of America Preferred Rewards program offers substantial benefits if you have a significant amount of money in qualifying Bank of America deposit accounts and Merrill investment accounts. From waived fees and enhanced credit card rewards to discounted loan rates and investment fee reductions, the program is a valuable option for loyal Bank of America customers. While the minimum balance requirement may be a hurdle for some, if you can meet it, the program's perks make it worth participating in.\n\nFinanceBuzz is not an investment advisor.

            "content": "Digital payments are growing in Latin America as companies like Mercado Libre and TerraPay rapidly advance digital banking and digital wallets in the region.\n\nCentral bank instant payments mandates and modernized infrastructure in Brazil have also moved the needle to the point where the region is arguably moving faster toward digital transformation than anywhere else in the world.\n\nPYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s \u201cHow the World Does Digital\u201d report surveyed 67,000 consumers across 11 different countries. It found that Brazil was far ahead of all of them \u2014 including the United States \u2014 in digital engagement. Drilling down into the results, in 2023, 66.8% of Brazilians used mobile banking apps on their phones at least once a month, and 46.8% used these apps at least weekly.\n\nConsumers in Brazil are embracing digital payments as well. The report found that by 2023, two-thirds of consumers in Brazil had smartphones and 75% had debit cards. In the same year, 77% of consumers in Brazil were using Pix, the instant payments app for mobile phones launched by the country\u2019s central bank.\n\n\u201cAfter many decades of the status quo in payments, Latin America is going through a major transformation,\u201d Marcelo Moussalli, managing director and Latin America product head executive at Bank of America, told PYMNTS.\n\nThat transformation is being driven by the two largest economies in the region \u2014 Brazil and Mexico \u2014 representing roughly two-thirds of the total GDP of Latin America, he said. Regulators in those countries launched new payments initiatives aimed at modernizing their respective banking systems.\n\nThe top-down, mandate-driven approach has been focused on boosting competition while lowering transaction costs, increasing transaction security and fostering wider financial inclusion. Beyond the commonality of the goals, the governments in Brazil and Mexico took different approaches to get there.\n\nSimilar Goals, Differing Approaches\n\nBrazil, for its part, introduced the Pix real-time payments network. Mexico\u2019s innovations have included a peer-to-peer (P2P) network and a digital collection capability underpinned by QR code technology.\n\n\u201cIn both countries, these innovations are improving [payments] speed, visibility and the overall user experience,\u201d Moussalli said.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the adoption of real-time rails and new payment modalities has, in some cases, exceeded expectations, but there is still a robust greenfield opportunity, he said.\n\nBy way of example, in 2020, Pix\u2019s first year, the network captured 16% of Brazil\u2019s electronic payments volumes; that tally has grown to 40% as recently as this year. Mexico\u2019s real-time payments network has grown 6% year on year as measured in 2024, with 60 million individuals using the network, although the QR codes and P2P networks have notched less adoption than originally anticipated.\n\nThe trend is inexorable, however. Although some businesses have been hesitant to pivot more fully to these new payment modalities and may cling to traditional methods such as cash, as time goes on, \u201cit\u2019s going to be hard to do business in Mexico or Brazil\u201d without connecting to these rails, Moussalli said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to miss out on opportunities if they don\u2019t adopt new digital payment options,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true in commercial payments, where suppliers will increasingly demand to be paid in real time.\n\nAsked by PYMNTS about how traditional financial institutions can help enterprise clients embrace change, Moussalli said Bank of America launched support for QR codes, which clients can access through the CashPro banking platform. Clients scan codes from paper or electronic invoices, and within seconds the platform retrieves the invoice details from the beneficiary bank and displays those details for review and confirmation of payment.\n\n\u201cThis dramatically speeds up the payments process\u201d beyond the confines of paying suppliers and into the realm, for example, of mandatory transactions that companies make for employees\u2019 retirement benefits, Moussalli said. That \u201chelps eliminate bureaucracy in processing payments.\u201d\n\nThe feature has been so well-received in Brazil that it is being explored for use in Europe, he said.\n\nAlthough regulators initially drove innovation in financial services in Brazil and Mexico, the central banks are well connected to their respective markets and are working with banks and merchants to foster the shift to digital transactions, Moussalli said. Cash withdrawals from banks have plummeted in the double digits. There\u2019s particular promise in pivoting to digital payments in Mexico where cash is still tied to 85% of all retail transactions, especially for transactions below the U.S. dollar equivalent of $50.\n\n\u201cThe impact of these changes is ongoing,\u201d said Moussalli, adding, \u201cthere\u2019s no going back.\u201d",

            "content": "One of the biggest banks in the United States, Bank of America BAC, is scheduled to announce fourth-quarter 2024 results on Jan. 16, before the opening bell.\n\n\n\nAmong BAC\u2019s close peers, JPMorgan JPM and Citigroup C are slated to release quarterly numbers on Jan. 15. Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\n\n\nBank of America\u2019s third-quarter performance was decent amid industry-wide operating challenges. This time, we believe the company\u2019s performance will be similar to the prior quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues of $25.14 billion suggests 14.5% year-over-year growth.\n\n\n\nIn the past seven days, the consensus estimate for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter has been revised 1.3% upward to 78 cents. This indicates an 11.4% rise from the prior-year quarter, as relatively lower interest rates are likely to have supported BAC\u2019s bottom-line growth.\n\nEstimate Revision Trend\n\n\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBank of America has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company\u2019s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average beat being 4.54%.\n\nSurprise History\n\n\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMajor Factors to Impact Bank of America\u2019s Q4 Performance\n\nNet Interest Income (NII): Last year, the Federal Reserve cut the interest rates by 100 basis points (bps) to 4.25-4.5%. Being one of the most interest rate-sensitive among its peers, Bank of America\u2019s NII is likely to have benefited from relatively lower rates.\n\n\n\nAlso, clarity on the Fed\u2019s rate cut path and the stabilizing macroeconomic backdrop provided support to the lending scenario. Per the Fed\u2019s latest data, the demand for commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer loans was solid. Hence, BAC is expected to have witnessed a decent rise in loan demand.\n\n\n\nBased on the assumptions of two rate cuts in the quarters, the company expects NII to grow sequentially and be $14.3 billion or more. Further, loan demand is projected to be robust driven by solid pipelines in commercial loans.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII of $14.20 billion suggests a 1.7% increase from the last quarter. Our estimate for NII is $14.25 billion.\n\n\n\nInvestment Banking (IB) Fees: Global mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in the fourth quarter witnessed marked improvement after weakness in 2023 and 2022. Both deal value and volume were solid during the quarter, driven by solid financial performance, buoyant markets, interest rate cuts and a strong U.S. economy. Also, the potential easing of regulatory oversight on M&As by the incoming Trump administration fueled deal-making activities. Yet, lingering geopolitical issues were a concern. So, Bank of America\u2019s advisory fees are likely to have recorded a decent rise.\n\n\n\nFurther, the IPO market saw signs of cautious optimism driven by market volatility, geopolitical challenges and global monetary policy easing. The remarkable equity market performance resulted in a solid activity in follow-up equity issuances. Further, bond issuance volume improved on favorable economic conditions and corporate spreads at near historical lows despite seasonally low volumes in December. So, BAC\u2019s underwriting fees (accounting for almost 40% of total IB fees) are expected to have witnessed decent improvement during the to-be-reported quarter.\n\n\n\nThe company projects IB revenues to be up 25% year over year.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for IB income of $1.48 billion indicates a rise of 5.4% from the prior quarter. We expect IB income to be $1.43 billion.\n\n\n\nTrading Income: Client activity and market volatility were solid in the fourth quarter. The likelihood of a solid economy, gradually slowing inflation and easing monetary policy drove the client activity. Hence, BAC is likely to have recorded a decent performance in trading revenues this time.\n\n\n\nManagement projects trading revenues grow at mid-to-high single digits from the prior-year quarter.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales and trading revenues of $4.07 billion suggests a 17.4% fall sequentially. Our estimate for the metric is $4.06 billion.\n\n\n\nExpenses: While BAC managed expenses prudently in the past, expansion into newer markets by opening financial centers and efforts to digitize operations and upgrade existing financial centers are expected to have kept non-interest expenses elevated in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\n\n\nManagement expects non-interest expenses in the third quarter to be relatively stable sequentially.\n\n\n\nOur estimate for non-interest expenses stands at $16.6 billion.\n\n\n\nAsset Quality: Bank of America is expected to have set aside a substantial amount of money for potential bad loans (mainly in commercial & industrial and commercial real estate loan portfolios), given the expectations of higher for longer interest rate backdrop. Our estimate for provision for credit losses is pegged at $1.57 billion, indicating a rise of 1.6% on a sequential basis.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing loans (NPLs) of $6.3 billion implies an 11.9% jump sequentially. Also, the consensus estimate for non-performing assets (NPAs) of $6.34 billion suggests an 8.9% rise. Our estimates for NPLs and NPAs are pegged at $6.23 billion and $6.34 billion, respectively.",

While inflation is evening out, prices for many everyday expenses remain high, and high interest rates are leading to larger mortgage and car payments for many consumers. With the cost of living so elevated, many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, and may not be able to keep as much money in their bank accounts as they should.\n\nTo better understand how the current economy is impacting Americans\u2019 bottom line, GOBankingRates surveyed more than 1,000 adults from all across the country to find out how much Americans have in their savings and checking accounts \u2014 and the results were alarming. Here\u2019s what we discovered.\n\nKey Findings\n\nHalf of Americans have less than $500 in savings, with 39% having $250 or less in savings.\n\nThe largest portion of Americans (40%) keep a minimum balance of $500 or less in their checking account.\n\nMost Americans are stressed about their current savings. Over a quarter (29%) are \u201cextremely stressed\u201d and 37% are \u201csomewhat stressed.\u201d\n\nMost Americans Have Insufficient Savings\n\nExperts recommend having three to six months\u2019 worth of living expenses saved as an emergency fund, but most Americans are falling far short of this goal. While a quarter of Americans (25%) have $2,000 or more in a savings account, most have far less \u2014 19% have no savings, 21% have between $1 and $250, and 11% have between $250 and $500.\n\nOlder Gen Zers and young millennials (ages 25 to 34) are the most likely to have no savings, with 23% of this age group reporting that they have nothing saved. Baby boomers ages 65+ are the most likely to have sufficient savings, with 42% having over $2,000 in a savings account.\n\nChecking Account Balances Are Dangerously Low\n\nMore than 40% of Americans admit to keeping a minimum balance of $500 or less in their checking accounts. Gen X is the most likely generation to keep low checking account balances, with 49% of Americans ages 45 to 54 keeping a minimum balance of $500 or less. Baby boomers age 65+ are most likely to keep higher minimum balances, with 21% keeping a minimum balance of at least $2,000.\n\nWith many Americans keeping low balances in their checking account, it\u2019s not too surprising that over a third of Americans have had an overdraft on their account in the past year. While 24% said they have \u201crarely\u201d had an overdraft, another 11% said it happened multiple times.\n\nAmericans Are Stressed About Their Savings\n\nWith half of Americans having $500 or less in savings, it\u2019s no wonder that many Americans are stressed about their bank account balance. The survey found that 29% are \u201cextremely stressed\u201d about their current savings and 37% are \u201csomewhat stressed.\u201d\n\nMillennials and Gen X are most likely to be \u201cextremely stressed\u201d about their current savings, with 35% of those ages 35 to 44 and 36% of those ages 45 to 54 selecting this response. Baby boomers ages 65+ are most likely to be confident about their savings, with 19% feeling confident. As the generation most likely to have over $2,000 in savings, this confidence is warranted.\n\nHow Much Should You Have in Your Savings and Checking Accounts?\n\nThe exact amount of cash you should keep in your savings and checking accounts will vary from person to person.\n\n\u201cThe right checking and savings balances are unique to your financial situation,\u201d said Seth Diener, client portfolio manager and team lead at Diener Money Management. \u201cAssess your expenses, income stability and risk tolerance to determine how much you feel comfortable keeping readily available.\u201d\n\nWhile the exact amounts needed will depend on the individual, it\u2019s likely that the $500 or less many Americans keep in these accounts is not enough.\n\n\u201cTry to have three to six months of living expenses in a savings account for an emergency fund,\u201d Diener said. \u201cThis helps cover unexpected costs without going into debt. If you have under three months of expenses saved, make building up your emergency fund a priority. Even small, regular contributions help grow your savings over time.\u201d\n\nAs for your checking account, you should have more than enough to cover your monthly expenses.\n\n\u201cAim to keep one to two months of living expenses in your checking account as a buffer,\u201d Diener said. \u201cThis helps avoid overdraft fees and having to transfer from savings frequently.\u201d\n\nMethodology: GOBankingRates surveyed 1,006 Americans ages 18 and older across the country between Dec. 6 and Dec. 9, 2024, asking 24 different questions: (1) What is your preferred method of banking?; (2) How optimistic are you that you will add more than $2,000 to your savings account balance over the next year?; (3) How much do you anticipate your savings account balance to change over the next year?; (4) How would you characterize your current level of stress when it comes to your current savings?; (5) How much is the minimum balance you keep in your checking account?; (6) How much do you currently have in your savings account?; (7) How much of your paycheck do you put in your checking account?; (8) How much of your paycheck do you put into your savings account?; (9) How satisfied are you with your current bank?; (10) What\u2019s the worst part about your current banking situation?; (11) If you could change one thing about your current banking situation, what would it be?; (12) Which of the following bank accounts do you currently use/have open?

As per the aforementioned report, if the economy weakens, some lenders may face difficulties due to their exposure to commercial real estate and possible nonperforming loans. Nonetheless, financials start 2025 with significant momentum due to a less stringent regulatory agenda following the election and more prospects for mergers and acquisitions.\n\nBanks that are well-diversified and have solid fundamentals are better equipped to handle a soft landing situation. Sensitive to consumer spending, payment processors are likewise poised for expansion as more accommodating monetary policy and strong consumer activity coincide.\n\nLooking forward, according to Fidelity\u2019s report, the financial industry\u2019s prospects for 2025 seem promising, backed by consistent economic expansion in the United States. It is projected that the Federal Reserve\u2019s move to rate decreases in the second half of 2024 will boost confidence and lower credit risk. Falling rates have the potential to boost lending and deposit growth while also reducing net interest margins.\n\nAs of January 7, 2025, the market\u2019s financial sector produced returns of 5.51% over three years, 9.68% over five years, and 9.49% over ten years. These numbers, however, pale in comparison to the sector\u2019s remarkable success during the previous 12 months, which saw a return of 28.01%.\n\nThe year 2024 was remarkable for the financial sector, as seen by the Financial Sector Index, which rose over 30% as of mid-December and outperformed the broader market by almost 5 percentage points. This expansion came after worries over mid-sized bank failures in early 2024, which turned out to be isolated events rather than a problem affecting the entire industry.\n\nAccording to the Business Research Company, the market for financial services has expanded significantly in the last several years and is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% in the next few years.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bank Of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stands against the other best financial stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDeloitte\u2019s 2025 banking and capital markets outlook report states that banks can strengthen their basis for sustainable growth with creativity and discipline as the banking industry adjusts to a low-growth, lower-rate environment. According to the report, the baseline scenario for economic growth in 2025 is projected to fall to 1.5%, with possible deviations between 1.0% and 1.9% due to slowing consumer spending, greater unemployment, and sluggish business investment. By Q2 of 2024, consumer debt had risen to $17.7 trillion, and by March 2024, savings from the pandemic had been spent, further straining the economy. Inflation is forecast to be around 2%, allowing for three to four rate cuts, bringing the federal funds rate down to 350-375 basis points. Treasury yields are projected to fall, and following two years of inversion, the yield curve may normalize. With the exception of economies that are under pressure, global central banks will likely choose to cut benchmark rates.\n\nIs Bank of America Corp. (BAC) Cheap NYSE Stock To Invest In Now?\n\nA professional banker providing consultation to a customer in the security of his office.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe sifted through holdings of financial ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 financial stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nBank Of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 98\n\nOne of the Best Financial Stocks, Bank Of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), has over $3.0 trillion in assets, making it one of the biggest financial institutions in the US. It is divided into four primary categories: consumer banking, global wealth and investment management, global banking, and global markets. The consumer-facing business segments of the company comprise its branch network and deposit-gathering operations, retail lending products, credit and debit cards, and services for small businesses. Both the firm\u2019s private bank and Merrill Lynch operations offer wealth management and brokerage services. Investment banking, corporate and commercial real estate loans, and capital markets operations are all wholesale lines of business. Although Bank Of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) operates in several countries, its primary focus is the United States.\n\nBank Of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) has become one of the leading US banking franchises after years of problems during the 2008 financial crisis. The bank is a Tier 1 investment bank, a top four US credit card issuer, a top three US acquirer, has a strong commercial banking franchise, and owns the Merrill Lynch franchise, which has grown to become one of the top US brokerage and advisory firms. It also boasts one of the best retail branch networks and overall retail franchises in the US.\n\nBank of America (NYSE: BAC) makes a strong bull case with its diverse businesses and outstanding Q3 of 2024 earnings, which reported $25.49 billion in revenue, slightly above expectations. The bank benefited from Wall Street\u2019s activity, with fixed-income trading revenue jumping by 8% YoY to $2.9 billion and equities trading up 18% YoY to $2 billion, both exceeding expectations. Investment banking fees increased by 18% to $1.4 billion, showing strength in advisory operations.\n\nEvercore ISI maintained its Outperform rating on Bank Of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) shares and increased its price objective from $45 to $53. The analyst notes that after a \u201cpretty strong\u201d September and October, investment banking activity levels continued to decline into December, and that equity markets sold off by roughly 2% in December in \u201ca post-post-election breather driven largely by the realization\u201d that rate cuts might not be as imminent as thought. In a Q4 forecast for the big banks\u2019 group, the analyst stated that although December cooled, the firm anticipates a robust start to 2025 because Evercore generally views recovery in investment banking as a \u201cwhen, not if\u201d story.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway was the largest stakeholder in the company among the funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database. It owns 797.68 million shares worth $31.65 billion as of Q3.\n\nOverall, BAC ranks 5th on our list of the Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. While we acknowledge the potential for BAC to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "There is a bunch of stocks that are well positioned for upside in 2025, according to Bank of America. The firm said that companies like Amazon are just too attractive to ignore right now. CNBC Pro combed through Bank of America research to find buy-rated stocks to own in January and beyond. In addition to the e-commerce juggernaut, the names include Henry Schein, Crocs, Chewy and Wells Fargo. Crocs Shares of the shoe company are up more than 4% over the past year, and they have plenty more room to run, according to analyst Christopher Nardone. In a note to clients earlier this week, the analyst said he sees a margin growth inflection on the horizon. \"We expect margins will sequentially improve starting in 2Q and more so in 2H as CROX begins to lap the outsized HD [Hey Dude] investments,\" Nardone wrote. Crocs completed its acquisition of casual footwear brand Hey Dude in 2022. The analyst said investors are also not giving enough credit to Crocs' international strategy. \"We expect key growth markets in '25 will be India, China, and Western Europe,\" he said. Nardone lowered his price target on shares to $144 per share from $147, but he said the risk/reward is extremely compelling and investors should pounce. \"We think the stock is simply too cheap given our expectations for EPS to grow by 10% in F26,\" Nardone said. Amazon The e-commerce giant is firing on all cylinders. Analyst Justin Post named the company a top idea in 2025, and he said shares are going higher. \"We see potential for acceleration in Cloud revenue growth, further Retail margin improvement, and expect a strong ramp for Prime Video advertising in 2025,\" Post wrote. The analyst thinks Amazon has the chops to withstand tightening consumer spending, plus any tariffs put in place by the incoming Trump administration. In particular, Post said Amazon has a slew of tools it can use to reduce the tariff impact, including \"shifting exposure to lower-priced countries, increasing US-based 1P [first party] supply and Chinese vendors absorbing some costs....\" Artificial intelligence will also play a big role, with \"new AI automation in fulfilment and AI shopping capabilities for consumers,\" Post said. Shares of the company are up 42% over the past 12 months. Chewy Analyst Curtis Nagle said the online pet supplies retailer is a top pick. Chewy has robust earnings potential, and investors are overlooking it, he said. \"Combined with a shift to higher gross margin sales, Chewy should see significant earnings leverage on its at-scale expense base that should, in turn, drive [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization] growth,\" Nagle wrote. The analyst also said Chewy is gaining share online, and that it's making the right investments to grow the business in using private label brands, pet health and more robust advertising. Chewy shares are up 82% over the past year with further upside potential, the firm said. \"The pet industry appears to have bottomed with pet adoptions stabilizing and spending improving, which, coupled with share gains, should drive accelerating top-line trends at Chewy,\" Nagle said. Crocs \"Risk/reward is attractive at 9x P/E. \u2026 We think the stock is simply too cheap given our expectations for EPS to grow by 10% in F26. \u2026 We expect margins will sequentially improve starting in 2Q and more so in 2H as CROX begins to lap the outsized HD [HeyDude] investments. \u2026 We expect key growth markets in '25 will be India, China, and Western Europe.\" Henry Schein \"A best-in-class dental asset positioned to win long term. \u2026 We think HSIC stands out as a best-of-breed dental asset strategically positioned to compound EPS at healthy rates, which the company accomplished during the entire decade before COVID. The company is anniversarying last year's cybersecurity incident, which should improve headline numbers, as incremental share losses look manageable.\" Wells Fargo \"Top pick among our 40+ bank coverage universe. We consider Wells Fargo (WFC) as our top pick across our 40+ bank coverage universe.

            "content": "When some of the biggest banks on Wall Street reveal their full-year earnings this week, they will have more to celebrate than just rising profits.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s presidential inauguration on 20 January \u2013 scheduled the Monday after US bank results week \u2013 will raise the curtain on a period of looser regulation, lower corporation tax, and weak climate commitments.\n\nThese moves are likely to be welcomed by lenders such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, which have already been back-pedalling on net zero promises, and railing against higher capital rules. And if those changes deliver higher returns for investors, shareholders are unlikely to complain. \u201cInvestors have already welcomed these prospects given how shares in many US banks have performed since the US election result,\u201d says Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at AJ Bell.\n\nJP Morgan, which is expected to report a jump in annual profits on Wednesday, according to UBS, has seen its shares pop 10% since Trump\u2019s victory in November. Shares in Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have risen 13% and 11% respectively.\n\nThe prospect of Trump\u2019s anti-green agenda could result in further profit growth on the back of fossil-fuel-friendly industries. It comes amid a growing backlash against ESG (environmental, social and governance) goals by US politicians, particularly those on the right of the Republican party. Officials in Texas have started to penalise financial firms that dare to promote their green credentials, with the state\u2019s comptroller having added NatWest to a growing list of firms accused of boycotting its oil industry last summer.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders last April, Jamie Dimon, the boss of JP Morgan, hinted at plans to dilute the bank\u2019s climate pledges. He said JP Morgan would \u201cuse the word \u2018commitment\u2019 much more reservedly in the future, clearly differentiating between aspirations we are actively striving toward and binding commitments\u201d.\n\nNine months later, the bank joined peers such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo in announcing that it was leaving the UN-sponsored net zero banking alliance, which helps lenders to reduce their carbon footprints.\n\nJP Morgan said it would instead work independently to help clients \u201cengaged in energy transitions\u201d, and pledged to work on \u201cpragmatic solutions to help further low-carbon technologies while advancing energy security\u201d.\n\nIn September, the US Federal Reserve slashed a planned capital-requirement increase to 9% in September, less than half the 19% first proposed\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s second term in the White House is expected to lead to a bonfire of regulations, with the incoming president saying he would slash 10 regulations for every new one added. Bank bosses will be hoping that among them will be the so-called Basel III rules, which are meant to ensure banks hold enough capital to absorb potential losses.\n\nBasel III was part of international efforts to avoid a repeat of the financial meltdown in 2008, which forced governments to spend billions of dollars bailing out big lenders that took too much risk. Over the past two years, US bank lobby groups have embarked on a campaigning blitz against the capital requirements.\n\nRegulators had begun caving in under the pressure. In September, the US Federal Reserve slashed a planned capital increase to 9% in September, less than half the 19% proposed. The lobbying continued, and successfully delayed the decision until after the US presidential election.\n\nTrump\u2019s win cleared some final hurdles. Officials such as Fed vice-chair Michael Barr \u2013 who had pushed for stricter oversight of UK banks \u2013 resigned last week, citing the \u201crisk of a dispute\u201d once Trump takes office.\n\nAnalysts are now betting the Basel rules will be all but gutted. But the new administration will need to tread carefully to avoid any financial failures. Trump\u2019s decision to unpick some of the credit requirements of the Dodd-Frank banking rules in 2018 were partly blamed for sparking the mini banking crisis of 2023, leading to the collapse of a handful of lenders including Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nDodd-Frank required banks with at least $50bn (\u00a341bn) in assets \u2013 that is, those considered \u201csystemically important\u201d \u2013 to undergo an annual Federal Reserve \u201cstress test\u201d and to maintain certain levels of capital as well as plans for a \u201cliving will\u201d if they fail.\n\nCoatsworth believes Trump will stop short of pulling protections completely. \u201cTrump wants to make things easier for banks, but he won\u2019t want to risk any damage to the financial system,\u201d he says. \u201cThat means being more lenient with rules but not having them too loose. In general, the larger US banks are well capitalised following efforts to rebuild after the global financial crisis and that\u2019s going to provide some comfort to investors.\u201d",

            "content": "These Warren Buffett picks can help investors build a robust portfolio in 2025.\n\nAs one of the most respected portfolio managers in the world and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett continues to motivate value investors around the world. His investment formula is comprised of two parts -- knowing and understanding the company's business and execution capabilities in detail, and purchasing at a reasonable valuation.\n\nAlthough it's an easy formula, it's far more difficult to put it into practice. Hence, it makes sense to follow the experts and pick at least a small stake in some of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio stocks. Let's see why the following two stocks could prove to be compelling picks in 2025.\n\nBank of America\n\nWith Bank of America (BAC -0.16%) (a stock that makes up almost 11.3% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio), there is a lot to be excited about these days. Bank of America has shown resilience and financial fortitude despite several macroeconomic challenges.\n\nThe bank has demonstrated strength in consumer banking, wealth management, global banking, and merger and acquisition business lines. Subsequently, analysts are expecting the company's revenue and earnings per share to be $25.1 billion and $0.77, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2024. These estimates imply a solid year-over-year revenue jump of 14.3% and an earnings jump of 133%, respectively.\n\nThe bank's net interest income (NII, a key revenue metric) is following the trajectory projected by management, with NII reaching the lowest point or trough in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, followed by significant improvement or an inflection point in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Furthermore, management expects NII to continue growing and reach $14.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nWhile interest rate cuts were leading to NII contraction, the yield curve has now been uninverted -- meaning short-term interest rates are lower than long-term interest rates. Coupled with increased loan volumes in 2025, Bank of America stands to benefit from borrowing short-term and lending long-term.\n\nThe company has successfully managed its deposit relationships, as is evident from the increase in customer deposits from $750 billion in pre-pandemic times to $940 billion at the end of Q3 2024. The bank also added 360,000 net new checking accounts in Q3, marking the 23rd consecutive quarter of checking account growth.\n\nBank of America is also making rapid strides in digitization, since it is seeing 75% to 95% digital adoption across all lines of business. The company's AI-powered virtual assistant, Erica, has performed 2.4 billion client interactions by the end of Q3.\n\nAll this points to a healthy business, with NII on an upward trajectory, strong customer relationships, and a successful digitization strategy. Despite this positive picture, the stock is trading at just 1.26 times its book value -- a very reasonable multiple and notably below its 2022 peak of 1.6.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway sold nearly 235 million shares of this company in 2024. However, the asset management company still owns just under 10% of the bank. Considering the company's solid tailwinds, Berkshire Hathaway's sales seem ill-timed. Instead, investors can consider picking a small stake in the stock to benefit from its upside potential, while controlling the downside risks.\n\nAmerican Express\n\nAmerican Express (AXP -0.30%) has emerged as a compelling pick in 2025 for several reasons. Its premium customer base and optimal execution capabilities made it possible to deliver strong results in Q3 2024. It had earnings per share of $3.49, despite only a 6% year-over-year rise in billings (implying a difficult demand environment).\n\nSubsequently, the company raised its earnings guidance for 2024 from the previous estimate of $13.30 to $13.80 to a new range of $13.75 to $14.05. The credit quality of its premium customer base is impressive -- it only had a 1.9% write-off rate in Q3. The company's solid risk management is also evident in its robust reserve rate of 2.9%.\n\nAmerican Express is quite successful with younger customers. Spending across millennial and Gen Z accounts grew 12% year over year in the third quarter. These younger customers are also more loyal, as is evident in higher customer retention rates. The company also expects to double the lifetime value as compared to older generations.\n\nAmerican Express has also been focused on a product refresh strategy, enhancing existing products with new benefits and services. The company had refreshed 40 products globally by the end of Q3 and is expected to have refreshed even more by the end of 2024. A successful example of this strategy is the U.S. Consumer Gold card, which has demonstrated 30% higher acquisitions than the Platinum Card and has also become the No. 1 premium product for the younger demographic.\n\nDespite a premium customer base, loyal younger clientele, and robust product refresh strategy, American Express stock trades at just 3 times sales. Hence, considering the reasonable valuation and the solid business model, American Express seems to be an attractive buy in 2025.",

            "content": "0% intro APR offers on credit cards are an excellent way to save money on interest for large purchases or balance transfers. Bank of America has a suite of these, including cash back, travel, and student cards.\n\nBank of America's 0% APR introductory periods range from 15 to 18 months, depending on the card. While this is not the longest in the industry (generally 21 months), it's on par with what many cards offer and better than no intro. Each card also has a student and non-student version, making it even easier for everyone to find the perfect card for them.\n\nWe've rounded up a list of Bank of America's 0% intro APR cards to help you find one that meets your needs. Remember to consider how you plan to use the card and what type of rewards you prefer (keeping in mind that a longer 0% intro period often results in fewer other card benefits).\n\nHow we evaluate products When analyzing all of Bank of America\u2019s 0% intro APR credit cards, we considered the unique benefits that each card offered, whether that be customized cash rewards, flat-rate cash rewards, travel rewards, or a long introductory APR period, to determine what type of consumer each card might be best for. Because each of Bank of America\u2019s 0% intro APR cards lends itself to a different type of cardholder, we chose to include the full line-up of options, including the student versions of each card.\n\nBank of America credit cards with 0% intro APR offers\n\nThere are several solid options for Bank of America credit cards that come with 0% intro APR offers. Here are your best options:\n\nCompare Bank of America credit cards with 0% intro APR offers\n\nBank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card\n\nBest for customized rewards\n\nCard details: 0% intro APR period: 15 billing cycles on purchases (then 18.24% - 28.24% Variable APR)\n\n15 billing cycles on purchases (then 18.24% - 28.24% Variable APR) Annual fee: $0\n\n$0 Spending rewards: 3% cash back in the category of your choice and 2% cash back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs (up to $2,500 in combined choice category/grocery store/wholesale club quarterly purchases) and 1% on all other purchases\n\nThe Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card card is a great option if you want to earn cash back on your terms. You can earn 3% cash back in the category of your choice and 2% cash back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs (up to $2,500 in combined choice category/grocery store/wholesale club quarterly purchases) and 1% on all other purchases.\n\nIf you have big purchases coming up that compel you to open a 0% intro APR card in the first place, and they fall into any of these categories, you'd probably be a good candidate for this card. It also has a decent welcome offer, where you can earn a $200 online cash rewards bonus after you make at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of account opening.\n\nYou might also consider the Susan G. Komen\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards Visa\u00ae credit card from Bank of America, which has similar benefits to this one but with a donation to breast cancer research. Bank of America donates $3 and 0.08% of retail purchases in the first 90 days to Susan G Komen, as well as $3 for renewals for cards in good standing and without a balance.\n\nPros Choose your own bonus category\n\nWelcome offer\n\nNo annual fee Cons $2,500 limit on bonus categories each quarter\n\nCharges foreign transaction fees\n\nApply now or read our Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards review to learn more.\n\nBank of America\u00ae Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card\n\nBest for flat-rate cash rewards\n\nCard details: 0% intro APR period: 15 billing cycles on purchases (then 18.24% - 28.24% Variable APR)\n\n15 billing cycles on purchases (then 18.24% - 28.24% Variable APR) Annual fee: $0\n\n$0 Spending rewards: unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases\n\nI recommend the Bank of America\u00ae Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card if you prefer flat-rate rewards over earning categories. This cash back card doesn't have bonus categories like the Customized Cash Rewards, so you don't have to think about whether your purchases qualify for the most cash back. And unlike Customized Cash Rewards, there are no earning caps.\n\nThis reward structure could be a better option if you plan to spend in a lot of different categories within the introductory APR period and want to maximize your benefits.\n\nThis card also has a welcome offer where you can earn a $200 online cash rewards bonus after you make at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of account opening.\n\nPros Flat-rate cash rewards\n\nNo spending limits\n\nWelcome offer\n\nNo annual fee Cons No bonus categories\n\nCharges foreign transaction fees\n\nApply now or read our Bank of America Unlimited Cash Rewards review to learn more.\n\nBank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card\n\nBest for travel rewards\n\nCard details: 0% intro APR period: 15 billing cycles on purchases (then 18.24% - 28.24% Variable APR)\n\n15 billing cycles on purchases (then 18.24% - 28.24% Variable APR) Annual fee: $0\n\n$0 Spending rewards: 3 points per $1 spent on travel purchases booked through the Bank of America Travel Center and 1.5 points per $1 spent on all purchases\n\nThe Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card is ideal if you want a travel credit card instead of one that earns cash rewards. You can redeem points for statement credits for travel and dining purchases to cover your flights, hotels, meals, and more.\n\nBecause of the flat rewards rate on this card, I also recommend it for anyone who spends money in lots of different categories and doesn't want to keep track of bonus categories. In that way, it's essentially a travel version of the Bank of America Unlimited Cash Rewards.\n\nI think you'll especially like the Bank of America Travel Rewards card if you're a frequent international traveler since it has no foreign transaction fees, which sets it apart from most of the others on this list.\n\nPros Unlimited flat-rate travel rewards\n\nNo foreign transaction fees\n\nWelcome offer\n\nNo annual fee Cons No bonus categories\n\nApply now or read our Bank of America Travel Rewards review to learn more.\n\nBankAmericard\u00ae credit card\n\nBest for long intro APR period\n\nCard details: 0% intro APR period: 18 billing cycles on purchases (then 15.24% - 25.24% Variable APR)\n\n18 billing cycles on purchases (then 15.24% - 25.24% Variable APR) Annual fee: $0\n\n$0 Spending rewards:\n\nIf your goal is simply to find the Bank of America card with the longest 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers, the BankAmericard\u00ae credit card is likely your winner. It has:\n\n0% intro APR on qualifying balance transfers for 18 billing cycles for any qualifying balance transfers made in the first 60 days (then 15.24% - 25.24% Variable)\n\n0% intro APR for 18 billing cycles on purchases (then 15.24% - 25.24% Variable)\n\nSo, if you're working to pay off credit card debt and want a bit more breathing room before paying interest, or if you're planning a large purchase and want to pay it off over the longest possible period, this card could be your best option.\n\nThis card also has no penalty APR if you're late with your monthly payment. Many credit cards, including Bank of America's other cards, do charge a penalty APR. However, this card doesn't earn any rewards, which is a big fat caveat.\n\nPros Longest intro APR period on purchases and qualifying balance transfers\n\nLow interest rate after intro APR period\n\nNo penalty APR for late payments\n\nNo annual fee Cons No spending rewards\n\nNo welcome offer\n\nCharges foreign transaction fees\n\nRead our BankAmericard credit card review to learn more.\n\nBank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card for Students\n\nBest for customized cash rewards for students\n\nCard details: 0% intro APR period: 15 billing cycles on purchases (then 18.24% - 28.24% Variable APR)\n\n15 billing cycles on purchases (then 18.24% - 28.24% Variable APR) Annual fee: $0\n\n$0 Spending rewards: 3% cash back in the category of your choice and 2% cash back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs (up to $2,500 in combined choice category/grocery store/wholesale club quarterly purchases) and 1% cash back on all other purchases\n\nThe Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card for Students offers nearly identical benefits to Bank of America's flagship Customized Cash Rewards card, but it's designed for college students.\n\nPros Customized cash rewards\n\nWelcome offer\n\nNo annual fee Cons $2,500 quarterly limit on bonus categories\n\nCharges foreign transaction fees\n\nApply now or check out our Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards for Students review for additional details.\n\nBank of America\u00ae Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card for Students\n\nBest for flat-rate cash rewards for students\n\nCard details: 0% intro APR period: 15 billing cycles on purchases (then 18.24% - 28.24% Variable APR)\n\n15 billing cycles on purchases (then 18.24% - 28.24% Variable APR) Annual fee: $0\n\n$0 Spending rewards: unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases\n\nThe Bank of America\u00ae Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card for Students offers the same benefits as the non-student version of Bank of America's flat-rate cash rewards card. This one is a great option for students who want to earn the same rate on all spending without remembering categories.

It's a low-stress card with flat-rate travel rewards and a generous welcome offer. It offers all of the same benefits as the non-student version of this same card. If you go to college in another country, this could be an especially great choice.\n\nPros Unlimited flat-rate travel rewards\n\nNo foreign transaction fees\n\nWelcome offer\n\nNo annual fee Cons No bonus categories\n\nApply now\n\nBankAmericard\u00ae Credit Card for Students\n\nBest for long intro APR period for students\n\nCard details: 0% intro APR period: 18 billing cycles on purchases (then 15.24% - 25.24% Variable APR)\n\n18 billing cycles on purchases (then 15.24% - 25.24% Variable APR) Annual fee: $0\n\n$0 Spending rewards:\n\nThe BankAmericard\u00ae Credit Card for Students is a solid card for students planning a large purchase (like stocking your new dorm room, for example). With the same perks as the non-student version, this card offers a longer introductory offer than Bank of America's other cards.\n\nPros Longest intro APR period\n\nNo penalty APR for late payments\n\nNo annual fee Cons No spending rewards\n\nNo welcome offer\n\nCharges foreign transaction fees\n\nWhen a 0% intro APR card might make sense\n\nA 0% intro APR period typically removes any interest charges on balance transfers or new purchases for a certain amount of time, such as 12 or 18 months after opening. These offers are benefits that cardholders can receive in addition to any other applicable benefits and perks, such as a welcome offer or earning rewards.\n\nYou might consider using a 0% intro APR offer for these reasons:\n\nTo make a large purchase: Credit cards can be handy for making purchases if you don't have enough cash on hand or don't want to dip into your savings. Interest charges typically make carrying a balance a poor financial strategy and may lead to being in over your head with debt. However, a 0% intro APR offer could help you spread a purchase out safely \u2014 as long as you can pay the full amount before interest kicks in.\n\nCredit cards can be handy for making purchases if you don't have enough cash on hand or don't want to dip into your savings. Interest charges typically make carrying a balance a poor financial strategy and may lead to being in over your head with debt. However, a 0% intro APR offer could help you spread a purchase out safely \u2014 as long as you can pay the full amount before interest kicks in. To do a balance transfer: You might transfer a balance from another debt (like a loan or other credit card) to a card with a 0% intro APR offer to avoid paying interest on that debt for a while. This could help you get out of debt because your balance won't keep growing with interest. But you'd have to factor for the balance transfer fee with this strategy.\n\nGood to know For Bank of America's cards, you'll pay 3% on balance transfers in the first 60 days for cards with introductory transfer fee promotions and 4% on those made afterward.\n\nWhen it doesn't\n\nJust as there are some major benefits to 0% intro APR cards, there are risks and situations where it's not a good idea.\n\nOne situation where a 0% intro APR card could do more harm than good is if you are struggling with racking up credit card debt. If you're concerned you'll use the extra credit to run up a balance you can't repay, it probably makes sense to focus on learning to budget and controlling your spending first.\n\nIt's also important to weigh the fees and benefits of each card. Most credit cards charge balance transfer fees, for example, which you should include in your calculations to make sure a balance transfer is still worth it. You should also avoid applying for a card you won't use in the future.\n\nWhat to consider when applying for a 0% intro APR credit card\n\nWhen applying for a 0% intro APR credit card, it's important to consider which card can best help you meet your goals. If you need a card with a 0% APR intro period, you're probably either planning a large purchase or want to do a balance transfer to pay off existing credit card debt. It's essential to consider each card's offer length \u2014 Bank of America's all range from 15 to 18 months \u2014 and any balance transfer fees that could eat into your savings.\n\nIn addition to 0% intro APR offer details, consider other card perks, especially if you plan to keep the card long after the intro period ends. Ideally, you'll choose a 0% intro APR card that continues to be useful to you after the promotional interest period has ended. Continued benefits and advantages that match your spending can make your life easier. Other things to consider include types of rewards (i.e., cash back versus travel points), bonus categories, earning potential, and reward redemption options. You may consider each card's welcome offer, but since that's just a one-time perk, it likely shouldn't be the deciding factor.\n\nYou should also consider your credit as a whole before applying for any new credit card. Adding new accounts to your credit file can help you build credit over time, but it can also hurt your score if you regularly carry a high balance, miss your monthly payments, or apply for new credit.\n\nFAQs\n\nDoes Bank of America have a zero-interest credit card? Yes, Bank of America has many different credit cards with 0% introductory APR offers. You can choose the best option for you based on the length of the intro period you want, whether you want cash or travel rewards, and whether you want a flat-rate or bonus category rewards structure. What is the difference between an APR and an interest rate? The difference between an APR, or annual percentage rate, and an interest rate is that an APR could also include other costs. For example, an interest rate on a loan typically reflects the percentage of interest you would have to pay to borrow money. But an APR on a loan might reflect the total cost of borrowing money, including the interest rate and any additional charges or fees. When it comes to credit cards, the APR and interest rate are usually the same. What is the APR for the Bank of America credit card? Bank of America offers various credit cards that have different APRs depending on the specific card. One of these cards is the BankAmericard\u00ae credit card, which has 0% intro APR on qualifying balance transfers for 18 billing cycles for any qualifying balance transfers made in the first 60 days, then 15.24% - 25.24% Variable APR. It also offers 0% intro APR on purchases for 18 billing cycles, then 15.24% - 25.24% Variable APR. What is the difference between a credit card and a debit card? The primary difference between a credit card and a debit card is the source of the money being used to make purchases. Credit cards use money that's borrowed from a lender, such as a bank or other financial institution. Debit cards use your own money that's already stored in a connected bank account. What is the Preferred Rewards program? The Preferred Rewards program is a Bank of America program that rewards you based on your qualifying combined balances in Bank of America and/or Merrill investment accounts. If you qualify, you could receive a 25% (Gold tier) to 75% (Platinum Honors tier) rewards bonus on any eligible Bank of America credit cards.\n\nBottom line\n\nA credit card with a 0% introductory APR offer could be helpful if you want to do a balance transfer or have upcoming large purchases. And if the card also offers rewards and other useful benefits \u2014 as many Bank of America credit cards do \u2014 that's even better.\n\nKeep in mind that part of finding the right card account for you is researching credit card offers to see which product(s) might align with your lifestyle and financial goals.

This could widen up to almost $111 billion or even more, as compared with the gap of $86 billion at the end of September.The total unrealized losses as of now could nearly touch up to $500 billion, which would be a massive increase from $364 billion at the end of Q3.These losses among financial institutions involve nearly all banks insured by the FDIC in the United States, says Barron. The total potential losses would still be a little lesser in comparison to whopping $700 billion at banks at the end of the third quarter of 2022.As of now, Bank of America\u2019s big losses are in a portfolio that is classified, but is still quite significant.Under accounting rules, paper losses on portfolios like the Bank of America don\u2019t depress any reported capital.

            "content": "Business Insider's personal finance team compared Bank of America CDs to the best CDs and found them to be a standard offering. Bank of America CD rates are decent for a brick-and-mortar bank, but its rates are still lower than what you could find at online banks and credit unions.\n\nThe bank's CD rates will largely vary depending on the type of CD and term you get. Learn more about current Bank of America CD rates below.\n\nCurrent Bank of America CD Rates\n\nBank of America (Member FDIC) is a well-known national bank, but Bank of America CD interest rates are still short of the best ones available at online banks.\n\nSelect short-term CDs pay better rates than average CDs. In particular, the 7-month, 10-month, and 13-month Featured CDs might be worthwhile if you prioritize getting a CD from a brick-and-mortar bank that's under 18 months. Most of Bank of America CDs long-term CDs are less competitive than other brick-and-mortar banks, though.\n\nBank of America Fixed Term CD Rates\n\nThe current rates for Bank of America Fixed Term CDs are 0.03% to 3.75% APY (annual percentage yield).\n\nThe Bank of America Fixed Term CD is the national bank's traditional CD. These CDs come in a wide range of terms, from 28 days to 120 months. Bank of America pays low CD rates on most term fixed-term CD lengths, with the exception of terms between 90 days and 179 days.\n\nBank of America CD rates are the same in many areas, but they can vary depending on where you live. We used the zip code from New York City, New York, for the following Bank of America CD rates:\n\nCD Terms APY 28 days to 89 days 0.03% on all account balances 90 days to 179 days 3.75% on all account balances 6 months to 120 months 0.03% on all account balances\n\nBank of America Featured CD Rates\n\nThe Bank of America Featured CD rates are 0.11% to 3.80% (vary by location) APY.\n\nBank of America Featured CDs are the bank's promotional terms, which means their rates may only be offered for a specific timeframe. Once a Featured CD matures, it renews into a Fixed Term CD with a similar term.\n\nThe Bank of America Featured CD only comes with five terms: 7 months, 10 months, 13 months, 25 months, and 37 months. The 7-month, 10-month, and 13-month terms pay the highest rates. The 25-month CD rate is decent, while the 37-month CD rate is low.\n\nWe used the zip code from Los Angeles, California, for the following Bank of America CD rates:\n\nCD Terms APY 7 months 3.80% on all account balances 10 months 3.45% on all account balances 13 months 2.75% on all account balances 25 months 2.00% on all account balances 37 months 0.11% on all account balances\n\nBank of America Flexible CD Rates\n\nThe Bank of America Flexible CD pays 3.25% APY, which is a good rate compared to other banks with no-penalty CDs. It's only available in a 12-month term, and once it matures, it will renew into a 9-month term.\n\nThe Bank of America Flexible CD is a type of no-penalty CD. You won't have to pay for any withdrawals after the first six days of opening an account. No-penalty CDs aren't always offered by banks, so Bank of America's CD is a solid choice overall.\n\nOverview of Bank of America CDs\n\nBank of America has three types of CDs: Featured, Fixed Term, and Flexible accounts. Featured CDs are the bank's promotional CDs, while the Fixed Term CDs are the bank's standard term options. The Bank of America Flexible CD is a no-penalty CD.\n\nBank of America offers more variety than you'd get typically at banks. Not only does it offer more CD term options, but it also has a no-penalty CD, which isn't common. Still, you can find a few other places that still have even more CD options. For example, at a few institutions, like Ally or Marcus, you might be able to get a step-up CD or bump-up CD, too.\n\nBank of America CD Rates Pros and Cons\n\nBank of America CD Rate Pros\n\nHigh interest rates on select terms (7-month, 10-month, and 13-month Featured CDs; Fixed Term CDs between 90 days and 179 days)\n\nNo-penalty CD option with a good interest rate\n\nVariety of CD terms, so you could build a CD ladder to maximize returns\n\nBank of America CD Rate Cons\n\nLow interest rates on most Fixed Term CD lengths\n\nThe best online banks and credit unions for CDs may still pay even higher rates regardless of the term\n\nOther banks may let you open an account with less money upfront\n\nStandard-to-high early withdrawal penalties\n\nBank of America CD Alternatives\n\nBank of America CDs vs. Chase CDs\n\nBank of America and Chase each have CD terms of up to 10 years. Both banks pay relatively low rates overall, with higher rates on select terms.\n\nBank of America may be more appealing than Chase CDs if you like the 7-month, 10-month, and 13-month promotional CDs.\n\nChase CD interest rates range between 0.01% to 4.00% (vary by location) APY and may be a better option than a Bank of America CD but only if you qualify for a relationship rate. To get a relationship rate at Chase, you must have Chase Premier Plus Checking\u2120 or Chase Sapphire\u2120 Banking, and make at least five transactions from your checking account.\n\nChase Bank Review\n\nBank of America CDs vs. Wells Fargo CDs\n\nIf you want to open a CD with less than $2,500, Bank of America will have to be your default option. Wells Fargo traditional CDs require at least $2,500, and promotional CDs require a minimum of $5,000.\n\nIf your goal is to strictly find the most competitive CD rate, deciding between these two banks depends on the term.\n\nFor traditional CDs, Bank of America notably offers great rates for terms between 90 days and 179 days. Wells Fargo CD rates are decent for 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year terms, but they're not as high as the terms mentioned prior by Bank of America.\n\nMeanwhile, for promotional CDs, Bank of America's strongest options are its 7-month, 10-month, and 13-month terms. At Wells Fargo, the 4-month and 7-month Wells Fargo Special Fixed Rate CD offers the best rates overall out of all Wells Fargo CDs with rates ranging from 3.50% to 4.26% (varies by location) APY. Wells Fargo's top rates are higher than Bank of America's top rates, but Bank of America has better options for longer-term CDs.\n\nWells Fargo Bank Review\n\nHow to Open a Bank of America CD\n\nTo get a Bank of America CD, you can apply online. Bank of America also lets you schedule an appointment online with a banker if you'd rather open an account in person.\n\nThe CD application will ask you to provide basic information, like your social security number, email address, and home address. People who aren't U.S. citizens or U.S. permanent residents can provide their individual taxpayer identification number and foreign ID to open Bank of America accounts.\n\nOpening a Bank of America CD will require a minimum of $1,000. To deposit money into a Bank of America CD, you can transfer money from another Bank of America account or link an external bank account.\n\nShould You Open a Bank of America CD?\n\nBank of America CD rates are low overall, with the exception of select short-term options. The 7-month, 10-month, and 13-month Featured CDs, as well as Fixed Term CDs between 90 days and 179 days, are decent options compared to other brick-and-mortar banks. You'll still find the best CD rates at online financial institutions, though, regardless of which term you'd like to get.\n\nBank of America has standard minimum opening requirements for CDs, but its early withdrawal penalties are steep for certain terms. You might prefer a different bank if you prefer more lenient early withdrawal penalties.\n\nIf you're interested in a specialty CD, Bank of America does have a no-penalty with a good interest rate. However, other financial institutions may let you open an account with less money upfront.\n\nIn general, CDs may be worth considering if you are looking for a low-risk place to keep your money. CDs are FDIC-insured for up to $250,000 per person. The FDIC protects consumers if a bank failure occurs. They'll still have access to their money if a bank is shut down; it will be either moved to an FDIC-insured bank that acquires the failed bank's assets or sent to the person's home as a check.\n\nWhy You Should Trust Us: How We Reviewed Bank of America CDs\n\nAt Business Insider, we use our bank rating methodology for each banking product we review. For CDs, we consider a bank's interest rates, minimum opening deposits, early withdrawal penalties, CD terms, ethics, security, miscellaneous features customer support, and mobile app ratings. We give each of these categories a rating from 0 to 5, then average these scores together to get a CD's total score which can be anywhere from one to five stars.\n\nWe use a weighted average to get our star rating, which means we weigh certain features, like interest rates and fees, at a higher weight percentage than others. We understand that these areas can more heavily impact a person's overall banking experience.\n\nBank of America CD FAQs\n\nWhat are the current CD rates at Bank of America?

            "content": "Bank of America just did something it hasn\u2019t done in Richmond for a while: open a new-construction branch.\n\nIts from-scratch location at 12200 Bridgewood Crossing Drive in Midlothian opened for business in recent weeks near the intersection of Hull Street and Bridgewood roads.\n\nAnd the banking giant, which controls by far the largest share of deposits in the region, isn\u2019t done building.\n\nIts ground-up branch at 5000 W. Broad St. is set to open later this month across from Willow Lawn.\n\nThe bank also said it plans to spend $20 million in the next two years to update its existing local branch network, including the possibility of building new locations to replace aging outposts nearby.\n\nThat\u2019s after spending $20 million over the past five years updating the interiors of its other 15 branches in the region.\n\nThe two new locations replace existing nearby BofA branches. The new Bridgewood branch replaces its now-closed Brandermill location at 13500 Harbour Pointe Parkway, and the new Willow Lawn location will replace the Malvern branch at 4101 W. Broad St.\n\nThe moves come as the bank in recent years has been part of the industrywide trend of branch consolidation due mainly to the adoption of online banking services. BofA has 17 branches across the region, down from 24 a decade ago. But in that span its local deposits have doubled from $12.5 billion in 2014 to more than $24 billion as of last summer. That gives the bank control of around 42% of all deposits in the competitive Richmond metro market. Its nearest rivals are Truist and Wells Fargo at $8.4 billion and $8 billion, respectively.\n\nVictor Branch, BofA\u2019s Richmond market president, said that while technology has helped reduce banks\u2019 physical footprints, branches are not obsolete.\n\n\u201cOur clients are embracing the technology and we\u2019re doing it with a smaller footprint in brick-and-mortar, but we\u2019re finding clients are using the brick-and-mortar to do their more complex banking needs,\u201d Branch said.\n\nCandace Haggerty, local head of consumer banking operations, said those trends also have helped shape how BofA designs its branches. In newer branches and in those that have been renovated, the traditional out-front teller lines have been moved elsewhere or replaced by private meeting rooms.\n\n\u201cOur financial centers are where we give guidance on lending or smallbusiness needs or through Merrill Lynch,\u201d Haggerty said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time doing the everyday transactions in branches that they can do on their phones. That\u2019s really the change we\u2019re making, and it\u2019s working for us.\u201d\n\nAnother trend is that traditional drive-thru teller lines are no longer as vital as more customers complete more transactions via ATMs. New locations are being built without drive-thru tellers but do have drive-up ATMs.\n\nDespite the smaller footprint locally, BofA remains a major employer in the region with about 2,000 employees in the market, Branch said. About 1,500 of those work at the bank\u2019s technology and operations center on Villa Park Drive in Henrico County. The rest work either in branches or in the Bank of America Center at 1111 E. Main St. downtown.\n\nBranch said the bank recently added to its headcount in that building when it relocated its local Merrill Lynch team from the nearby Truist Center.\n\nBofA leases the new Bridgewood property from local developer Rebkee. It leases the Broad Street branch property from Miami-based Frontier Development.\n\nThe upgrades to the existing Richmond branches were part of a similar effort at its 3,700 branches nationwide, the bank said. It also plans to build 165 new locations nationally in the next couple of years.",

            "content": "JPMorgan is the latest major US bank to exit the NZBA. (Photo: iStock)\n\nUpdate: Trump promises to stop new wind farms and JPMorgan leaves NZBA On Jan. 7, during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump emphasized that he would not approve the construction of any wind farms during his term. At the same time, the U.S. financial sector seems to be feeling political pressure, with major banks increasingly choosing to exit the net-zero alliance. In less than a month, six of the largest banks in the U.S., including JPMorgan, have announced their withdrawal from the United Nations Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). The following is the report from Jan. 3:\n\nThe commitment of major US financial institutions to net-zero goals is facing increasing challenges. Following Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Bank of America also announced by the end of 2024 their decision to exit the United Nations' Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA).\n\nThis shift reflects the growing influence of president-elect Donald Trump's climate change skepticism, which has begun to resonate within the financial sector.\n\nCitigroup, Bank of America still pledge net-zero\n\nMorgan Stanle, Citigroup and Bank of America issued separate statements announcing their withdrawal but emphasized their continued dedication to achieving net-zero targets.\n\nCitigroup stated that it would remain focused on reaching net-zero goals while ensuring energy security and supporting customers' transition to a low-carbon economy. Similarly, Bank of America assured it would continue to assist clients in reducing carbon emissions.\n\nEarlier, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo also withdrew from NZBA in December 2024, though their statements did not specify the reasons for leaving the alliance.\n\nOne possible reason for the banks\u2019 withdrawal is the mounting political pressure they face. In November 2024, 11 Republican-led states, including Texas, filed a lawsuit against major US asset management firms like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, accusing them of reducing coal production and driving up energy prices through climate action, which allegedly violates antitrust laws by hindering market competition.\n\nMajor banks and corporations are increasingly cautious about antagonizing the incoming administration and are withdrawing from climate-focused initiatives. (Photo: iStock)\n\nPolitical pressure from Republican lawmakers\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee, also led by Republicans, issued a report citing substantial evidence of collusion and anti-competitive behavior within the financial sector. They criticized financial firms for imposing aggressive ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) sustainability goals on US businesses.\n\nCommittee Chairman Jim Jordan (Republican, Ohio) singled out climate alliances like Climate Action 100+ and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), accusing them of undermining fair competition.\n\nAlthough the exact impact of Trump's potential return to the presidency on these climate financial alliances remains unclear, the pressure from Republican lawmakers has only intensified since his election. As a result, major banks and corporations are increasingly cautious about antagonizing the incoming administration and are withdrawing from climate-focused initiatives.\n\nFounded in 2021, NZBA is the largest global banking climate alliance, with over 100 banks from 44 countries, holding a total of $71 trillion in assets. Members of NZBA commit to adjusting their lending and investment portfolios to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nSource: Reuters(1)\u3001(2)\u3001Financial Times\u3001Bloomberg(1)\u3001(2)",

            "content": "Investors have an opportunity to nab some solid yields in preferred securities, despite potential headwinds this year, according to Bank of America. Preferreds have features of both stocks and bonds. They trade on exchanges like equities, but also have par values and pay a stream of income. Like bonds, when the price of a preferred goes down, the yields rise. Despite a sell-off in December, preferred stock saw favorable returns last year. The broad market $25 par preferreds, as measured by the ICE BofA Core Plus Fixed Rate Preferred Securities Index, returned 7% in 2024 \u2014 better than investment-grade corporate bonds, said Michael Youngworth, head of global convertibles and preferreds strategy at Bank of America Securities. The index has an effective yield of 5.04% and yield to maturity of 6.28%. The $25 par preferreds are sold to retail investors, while $1,000 preferreds tend to be targeted to institutional investors. While many have long maturity dates or are perpetual, they usually have \" call dates ,\" which is when the issuer can redeem them. Yields are attractive, Youngworth said returns may be rocky this year now that the Federal Reserve is expected to be less aggressive in lowering interest rates than had initially been thought last summer and autumn. Tailwinds to headwinds \"The duration and technical tailwinds that helped to propel preferreds during the first 10 months of 2024 may become headwinds as rates may stay in an elevated trading range, a function of potentially inflationary policy and a more measured pace of monetary easing,\" Youngworth wrote in a note last Thursday. \"Ultimately, we think this favors shorter duration structures within preferreds,\" he added. However, he believes once there is more clarity on policy, it may provide an opportunity to buy duration . Here are some of the $25 par fixed-rate preferreds Bank of America recommends. They have at least two years of call protection or are selling at a more than 15% discount to their par price. Also included in Bank of America's recommendations are fixed-to-floating rate preferreds. These assets were among the top performers in the sector in December, when investors moved away from those with longer duration, Youngworth noted. The recommended fixed-to-floating rate preferreds also have at least two years of call protection. The coupon rates are fixed until the call date and if the security isn't called, the rate floats. Here are two of the bank's recommendations. Investors who favor broad-market exposure can invest in preferreds via exchange-traded funds. For instance, the iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF (PFF) has a 30-day SEC yield of 5.78% and 0.46% expense ratio. It had a total return of 7.88% in 2024. The Global X U.S. Preferred ETF (PFFD) has a 6.41% 30-day SEC yield and 0.23% expense ratio. It had a total return of 7.24% last year, according to Morningstar.",

            "content": "The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII (reported) of $22.88 billion suggests a 4.9% decline on a year-over-year basis. Our estimate for NII implies a fall of 4.7% to $22.93 billion.\n\nAlso, clarity on the Fed\u2019s rate cut path and the stabilizing macroeconomic backdrop are likely to have provided support to the lending scenario. Per the Fed\u2019s latest data, the demand for commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer loans was decent in the first two months of the quarter.\n\nNet Interest Income: In the fourth quarter, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points to 4.25-4.5%. This, along with the rate cut in September, is likely to have offered some support to JPMorgan\u2019s net interest income (NII) as the rise in funding/deposit costs declined.\n\nJPMorgan has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company\u2019s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average beat being 7.73%.\n\nIn the past seven days, the consensus estimate for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter has been revised 2.3% upward to $3.95. This indicates a marginal decline from the prior-year quarter as rising provisions for credit losses and higher operating expenses are likely to have hampered JPMorgan\u2019s bottom-line growth.\n\nJPM\u2019s third-quarter performance was solid despite industry-wide operating challenges. This time, we believe the company\u2019s performance will remain decent. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues of $40.92 billion suggests 6.1% year-over-year growth.\n\nAmong JPMorgan\u2019s close peers, Citigroup is slated to announce quarterly numbers on Jan. 15, while Bank of America will come out with its performance details on Jan. 16. Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar .\n\nJPMorgan is scheduled to kick start fourth-quarter 2024 earnings on Jan. 15. The largest American bank\u2019s earnings draw a lot of attention because of its presence in almost all finance sector businesses, offering insights into how the quarterly performance of other banks is likely to be.\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 9, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks and featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include, JPMorgan JPM, Citigroup C and Bank of America BAC.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestment Banking (IB) Fees: Global mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in the fourth quarter of 2024 showed marked improvement after subdued 2023 and 2022. This is expected to have supported JPMorgan\u2019s IB fees.\n\nBoth deal value and volume were robust during the quarter, driven by solid financial performance, robust U.S. economic growth, buoyant markets and interest rate cuts. Also, the potential easing of regulatory oversight on M&As by the incoming Trump administration fueled deal-making activities. Yet, lingering geopolitical issues were a headwind. JPMorgan\u2019s leadership in the space is likely to have supported advisory fees.\n\nAlso, the IPO market saw signs of cautious optimism, given the market volatility, geopolitical challenges and global monetary easing. The impressive equity market performance drove some solid activity in follow-up equity issuances. Further, bond issuance volume was decent on favorable economic conditions and corporate spreads at near historical lows despite seasonally slow volumes in December. Thus, growth in JPM\u2019s underwriting fees (accounting for almost 60% of total IB fees) is expected to have been solid during the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nManagement expects IB revenues (in the Corporate & Investment Banking segment) to jump 45% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe consensus estimate for IB revenues (in the Corporate & Investment Banking segment) of $2.55 billion implies an increase of 43.1% from the prior-year quarter. We expect the metric to be $2.59 billion.\n\nMarkets Revenues: Client activity and market volatility were solid in the fourth quarter. The likelihood of a strong economic expansion, gradually cooling inflation and easing monetary policy drove the client activity. Further, volatility was high in equity markets and other asset classes, including commodities, bonds and foreign exchange. So, JPMorgan is likely to have recorded decent growth in markets revenues (comprising nearly 20% of the company\u2019s total revenues) this time.\n\nManagement expects markets revenues in the fourth quarter to rise 15% year over year.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity markets revenues is pegged at $2.12 billion, suggesting a rise of 24.4% from the prior-year quarter. The consensus estimate for fixed-income markets revenues of $4.18 billion indicates year-over-year growth of 2.8%. We project equity markets revenues and fixed-income markets revenues of $2.56 billion and $4.25 billion, respectively.\n\nMortgage Banking Fees: Despite interest rate cuts by the central bank, mortgage rates did not come down significantly. The rates were close to 6.8% at the end of the fourth quarter. As such, refinancing activities and origination volume remained decent. Thus, mortgage banking fees are likely to have witnessed some improvement at JPMorgan.\n\nThe consensus estimate for mortgage fees and related income of $395.6 million implies a 50% jump from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the metric stands at $390.8 million.\n\nExpenses: JPMorgan\u2019s plan of entering new markets by opening branches, which is already on track, along with inorganic expansion efforts, is likely to have resulted in an increase in operating expenses in the fourth quarter. Also, investments in technology to strengthen digital offerings might have led to higher costs.\n\nManagement anticipates adjusted non-interest expenses to be almost $23 billion for the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for non-interest expenses stands at $22.94 billion.\n\nAsset Quality: JPMorgan is likely to have set aside a substantial amount of money for potential delinquent loans (mainly commercial loan defaults), given the expectations of higher for longer interest rate backdrop. Our estimate for provision for credit losses is pegged at $2.66 billion.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing loans (NPLs) of $8.46 billion implies a 22.2% increase year over year. The consensus estimate for non-performing assets (NPAs) of $9.05 billion suggests a 19.2% rise. Our estimates for NPAs and NPLs are pegged at $8.42 billion and $7.92 billion, respectively.\n\nJPM Management Guidance for 2024\n\nManagement expects NII to be approximately $92.5 billion compared with $89.3 billion reported in 2023.\n\nManagement expects adjusted non-interest expenses to be almost $91.5 billion. The figure includes the increase in the FDIC special assessment in the first quarter and the Foundation contribution in the second quarter. Also, it plans to spend roughly $17 billion on technology, up 9.6% year over year.\n\nFor 2024, card NCO rates are expected to be approximately 3.4%.\n\nFurther, it expects deposits across the franchise to be relatively flat and loan growth to be modest.\n\nWhat Our Model Unveils for JPMorgan\n\nPer our proven model, the chances of JPMorgan beating estimates this time are high. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is the case here, as you can see below.\n\nJPMorgan has an Earnings ESP of +3.20%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nJPM carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nJPM\u2019s Price Performance & Premium Valuation\n\nIn the fourth quarter, JPMorgan shares performed impressively. The stock outperformed the S&P 500 Index and its close peers \u2013 BAC and C.\n\nGiven the rally in JPM shares, it appears expensive relative to the industry. The stock is, at present, trading at the forward 12-month price/earnings (P/E) of 14.48X. This is above the industry\u2019s 14.08X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\n\nWhat to Do with JPMorgan Shares Ahead of Q4 Earnings?\n\nJPMorgan is well-placed to benefit from its scale and size, and leverage its leading position in several businesses. The acquisition of First Republic Bank in 2023 continues to support its financials. The company is expanding its footprint in new regions and plans to capitalize on cross-selling opportunities. While such expansion plans will lead to higher investment-related expenses, they bode well for the company\u2019s long-term prospects and will provide it an edge over its peers.\n\nYet, the volatile nature of the capital markets business will likely keep JPM\u2019s fee income growth challenging. The stock\u2019s high valuation weighs on it.\n\nHence, investors must check management comments regarding this year\u2019s NII prospects during the fourth-quarter 2024 conference call before making any investment decision. Also, they should keep an eye on macroeconomic factors and policy matters that are likely to influence the company\u2019s future performance.\n\nThose who already own JPM stock can hold on to it because it is less likely to disappoint over the long term. However, those who intend to buy the stock should consider the above-mentioned factors carefully and evaluate their risk tolerance before investing.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

            "content": "Professional Open Division to feature athletes from 20 countries, including Olympic medalists, Boston champions, and Top American Talent\n\nBOSTON \u2013 The Boston Athletic Association (B.A.A.) today announced that Hellen Obiri (Kenya) and Sisay Lemma (Ethiopia) will return to defend their Boston Marathon presented by Bank of America titles, headlining a field that includes 21 sub-2:09 men and 17 sub-2:23 women. Obiri seeks to become the first woman to three-peat since Fatuma Roba did so from 1997-1999.\n\nIn addition to two consecutive wins on the streets of Boston, Obiri earned a bronze medal at the Olympic Marathon in Paris and was runner-up at the TCS New York City Marathon in November. Sisay\u2019s 2:01:38 lifetime best ranks fastest among the men\u2019s field, and his winning margin last April was 41 seconds.\n\n\u201cBoston annually brings together the world\u2019s best each April, and this Patriots\u2019 Day is no different,\u201d said Jack Fleming, CEO of the Boston Athletic Association. \u201cComing off an Olympic year, top contenders from around the world have turned their attention to Boston and hope to etch their name into Boston Marathon lore with a victory.\u201d\n\nHELLEN OBIRI RETURNS AIMING FOR HISTORIC THREE-PEAT\n\nOnly four women have won three consecutive Boston Marathon Open Division titles \u2013 Bobbi Gibb, Sara Mae Berman, Uta Pippig, and Fatuma Roba. Trying to prevent Obiri\u2019s three-peat will be a host of international and U.S. stars. Ethiopia\u2019s Amane Beriso and Yalemzerf Yehualaw have the fastest lifetimes bests in the field (2:14:58 and 2:16:52, respectively) with Beriso finishing second in 2023 and serving as the reigning world champion. Also from Ethiopia is Sydney Marathon runner-up Rahma Tusa and Buze Diriba, fourth at Boston and Chicago last year.\n\n\u201cDefending a win is never easy, and to win the Boston Marathon twice in a row was hard, but I am happy to have done it,\u201d said Obiri. \u201cOn race day I will again push for the win and hope to make it three in a row.\u201d\n\nToughness and experience are often rewarded in Boston, and Kenya\u2019s Edna Kiplagat, Sharon Lokedi, Irine Cheptai, Viola Chepngeno, and Mary Ngugi-Cooper have just that. Kiplagat is a two-time Boston winner (2017 and 2021); Lokedi was second last year in Boston and fourth at the Olympic Marathon in Paris; Cheptai has earned four medals at the World Cross Country Championships; Chepngeno won the Boston Half in 2022; and Ngugi-Cooper has five top ten finishes in Boston. Together with Obiri and 2012 winner Sharon Cherop, the Kenyan contingent is perhaps the deepest in race history.\n\nSpeaking of champions, 2018 Boston Marathon champion Des Linden will line up in Hopkinton for the 12th time, headlining the fastest ever U.S. women\u2019s squad assembled in Boston which includes 14 athletes with sub-2:26 personal bests. Joining Linden will be Dakotah Popehn, 12th at the 2024 Olympic Marathon; Keira D\u2019Amato, the former American marathon record holder; Emma Bates, top American at the last two Bostons; Jessica McClain, fourth at the 2024 U.S. Olympic Trials in both the marathon and 10,000m; Sara Hall, national master\u2019s record holder; Sara Vaughn, top American at the 2024 TCS New York City Marathon, and Lindsay Flanagan, ninth at the 2023 World Championships.\n\nAmong the 20 countries represented in the professional field are Romania\u2019s Joan Melly, a past B.A.A. 10K champion and 2:18:24 marathoner, as well as Great Britain\u2019s Calli Hauger-Thackery who finished seventh at the 2024 Berlin Marathon in 2:21:34.\n\nSISAY LEMMA LOOKING TO REPEAT RUNAWAY 2024 WIN\n\nFive of the top seven men\u2019s finishers from last year\u2019s Boston Marathon return, led by reigning champion Sisay Lemma. Many of Lemma\u2019s challengers a year ago are ready for Round 2.\n\n\u201cI was very happy after winning the Boston Marathon last year, and in 2025 I know it will be an even bigger challenge to win again,\u201d said Lemma. \u201cI was unlucky, because of an injury, not to be able to participate at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris and I was not completely ready at the Valencia Marathon last December, but I will be 100% ready next April because the Boston Marathon is a special event.\u201d\n\nKenya\u2019s Evans Chebet, the two-time Boston Marathon champion who was third in 2024 is back, as are 2024 fourth and fifth place finishers John Korir and Albert Korir. John Korir \u2013 winner of the 2024 Bank of America Chicago Marathon \u2013 is the brother of 2012 Boston champion Wesley Korir.\n\nA strong U.S. men\u2019s group will match the depth of the U.S. women\u2019s field. Olympic marathoners Conner Mantz and Clayton Young will lead the American charge. Mantz and Young come off eighth and ninth place finishes at the 2024 Olympic Marathon, and each finished in the top ten at the 2024 TCS New York City Marathon. Mantz\u2019s lone Boston finish was 11th in 2023, though he has lowered his personal best to 2:08:12 in the years since. Last year\u2019s top-USA finisher (seventh overall) CJ Albertson is Mr. Consistency, having run five marathons between 2:08:17 and 2:10:57 in 2024. Zach Panning, Nathan Martin, Reed Fischer, and Colin Bennie \u2013 all of whom finished in the top ten at the 2024 U.S. Olympic Trials Marathon \u2013 are entered.\n\nCybrian Kotut and Haymanot Alew were second and third at last fall\u2019s Berlin Marathon and bring speed to the table, both with lifetime bests under 2:04. Daniel Mateiko of Kenya is a 58:17 half marathoner making his Boston debut, while Victor Kiplangat (the reigning world champion) seeks to become the first Ugandan to win Boston. Not to be forgotten are 2023 and 2024 Boston Half winners Abel Kipchumba and Yemane Haileselassie, nor cross country ace Muktar Edris who\u2019ll race his first marathon. Two-time Boston Marathon winner Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia, whose last finish in Boston came in 2019, aims to be at the front of the field. Tanzania\u2019s Alphonce Felix Simbu enters Boston coming off a fourth-place, 2:04:38 finish at last month\u2019s Valencia Marathon.\n\nA complete list of the Professional Open Division fields can be found below; updates to the start list will be made here as race day approaches.\n\nMedia credential applications for the 2025 Boston Marathon presented by Bank of America will open in February. Information will be posted to the B.A.A.\u2019s Media Relations page in the coming month.\n\n2025 BOSTON MARATHON PROFESSIONAL WOMEN\u2019S DIVISION\n\nWOMEN\u2019S FIELD COUNTRY PERSONAL BEST Amane

            "content": "Longtime observers of Bank of America can count on two annual traditions: Sometime after Labor Day, the bank tends to give an update on its long-running effort to raise its minimum hourly wage to $25.\n\nAnd in January, Bank of America trumpets the percentage of its workforce (often 95% or higher) that receives restricted stock bonuses.\n\nBNY tackled both last month. To be fair, BNY\u2019s December updates, of late, have become notable traditions, too \u2013 giving the U.S.\u2019s oldest bank a space to humble-brag about its own improved benefits.\n\nBNY is boosting its minimum hourly wage to $25, effective March 1, it said last month. The move marks the fourth compensation boost in five years for the bank\u2019s lowest-paid workers \u2013 a more than 50% jump since 2021, the New York City-based lender said.\n\n\u201cWe want talent to feel appropriately compensated and enjoy an industry-leading employee experience \u2013 and benefits are a part of that strategy,\u201d Shannon Hobbs, the bank\u2019s chief people officer, said in a release. \u201cOur differentiated approach helps us continue to be a top talent destination and drive a sense of ownership across our teams.\u201d\n\nIf there were a race to a $25-per-hour minimum wage, BNY presumably has beaten Bank of America by a few months. BofA signaled in September that it was raising its pay floor to $24 per hour. The bank has targeted $25 per hour by 2025 ever since 2021 \u2013 and has increased its minimum hourly wage by $1 increments each year.\n\nBNY\u2019s minimum wage, by contrast, has made a steeper climb. It boosted its pay floor by $2.50 per hour \u2013 from $20 to $22.50 \u2013 last March, and is doing the same this year. Granted, BNY\u2019s workforce is roughly one-quarter of Bank of America\u2019s \u2013 though it\u2019s unclear how many employees at each bank receive the minimum hourly pay rate.\n\nBNY last month also said it would offer 10 shares of company stock to all eligible new employees for the third year in a row. That would come at a value of $783 as of Tuesday \u2013 up from about $527 a year ago.\n\nBank of America, by comparison, has given out restricted stock awards on a wide scale for seven years \u2013 and in each of the last three years has included employees who make less than $100,000 annually. Typically, the bank\u2019s stock offerings to individuals vary by compensation, but BofA typically highlights the amount of the pool value: $1 billion in 2022; $800 million last year.\n\nBNY also boosted its short-term disability offering, it said last month, to provide up to 26 weeks at 100% of base pay for all employees from date of hire, instead of a disability time frame that varies based on length of service.\n\n\u201cCompensation, recognition and expansive health and wellbeing benefits continue to be part of BNY\u2019s competitive advantage,\u201d Hobbs said. \u201cWe work hard to ensure BNY offers a holistic global total reward program for our employees.\u201d",

            "content": "In the latest market close, Bank of America (BAC) reached $46.08, with a +1.5% movement compared to the previous day. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.11%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.42%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 1.89%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the nation's second-largest bank had lost 1.11% in the past month. In that same time, the Finance sector lost 3.95%, while the S&P 500 lost 1.7%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Bank of America in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on January 16, 2025. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $0.78, showcasing a 11.43% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $25.22 billion, up 14.87% from the year-ago period.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Bank of America. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.47% higher within the past month. Bank of America presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Bank of America has a Forward P/E ratio of 12.39 right now. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.69.\n\nWe can also see that BAC currently has a PEG ratio of 1.24. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Financial - Investment Bank stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.28 based on yesterday's closing prices.\n\nThe Financial - Investment Bank industry is part of the Finance sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 34, placing it within the top 14% of over 250 industries.",

As part of its commitment to workforce development as a pathway to economic mobility, Bank of America is connecting teens and young adults to paid jobs and internships across New Hampshire through additional programs like America\u2019s Youth Teenage Unemployment Reduction Network (MY TURN) Youth Employment Program, the International Institute of New England \u2013 Manchester\u2019s Career Pathways for Refugees and Immigrants, NH JAG Resiliency Skills and Career Pathways Education, and University of New Hampshire at Manchester workforce development and education initiatives.\n\n\u201cThe Student Leaders Program is a dual-purpose initiative that provides a rich experience for local high school students to make a difference in their community, while supporting our nonprofit partners,\u201d said Ken Sheldon, President of Bank of America New Hampshire. \u201cStudent Leaders, and other workforce development programs that Bank of America supports in New Hampshire, such as MY TURN New Hampshire\u2019s Summer Youth Employment Program, provide an important pathway to economic mobility for young people.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about Bank of America\u2019s commitment to support and strengthen New Hampshire, visit https://about.bankofamerica.com/en/local/new-hampshire.",

Overall, you typically want a card that earns cash back rewards if you prefer cash-related redemption options. But a card that earns points or miles would typically have travel-related redemption options.\n\nI suggest thinking about not only how you spend but also how you like to redeem your credit card rewards to choose between the two.\n\nYou want to redeem rewards for cash\n\nRewards for this card can be redeemed for statement credits, deposits to a Bank of America bank account, or credits into eligible Merrill\u00ae investment accounts. The nice thing about this card compared to the Travel Rewards card, which also lets you redeem points as credits and deposits, is that you can cash out your rewards at the same rate you earn them. So if you end up with $50 in cash back in your account, you can redeem that for a statement credit of $50.\n\nFor comparison, redeeming Travel Rewards points is more complicated and less rewarding. One point is worth $0.006 when redeemed for cash rewards, so I don't recommend the Travel Rewards card to anyone who plans to primarily redeem points this way.\n\nYou want to invest rewards\n\nThe option to invest rewards is unique for credit cards, and both of these have it. However, the Bank of America Unlimited Cash Rewards card actually gives you one more choice in which Merrill investment account you send your earnings to. You can cash out to either of the following:\n\n\n\nA Cash Management Account\u00ae with Merrill\n\nA qualifying 529 account held at Merrill\n\nOn the flip side, the Bank of America Travel Rewards card only lets you cash out to an eligible Cash Management Account\u00ae with Merrill. So, for investing rewards, I give this one to the Unlimited Cash Rewards (although this might only matter if you have a 529 plan).\n\nWhen to go with the Bank of America Travel Rewards\n\nYou should choose the Bank of America Travel Rewards if:\n\nYou'd prefer earning points over cash back.\n\nYou want to redeem points for travel purchases.\n\nYou want travel benefits.\n\nYou want more purchase protection and insurance.\n\nYou want to earn points\n\nAs I mentioned, you should generally stick with a card that earns travel rewards points if you plan to mostly or exclusively redeem your rewards for travel. The Travel Rewards card earns 3 points per $1 spent on travel purchases booked through the Bank of America Travel Center and 1.5 points per $1 spent on all purchases. For other cards that offer elevated rates on travel, you can also check out the no-annual-fee Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card, for example, earns up to 5 miles per dollar.\n\nYou want more ways to redeem rewards (including travel)\n\nThe redemption choices are fairly similar between these two cards, but the Bank of America Travel Rewards card has a leg up on the Unlimited Cash Rewards card for variety because it has many of the same redemption options as the Unlimited Cash Rewards plus a few extra options. This includes gift cards and mailed checks. These methods may not give you as much value as bank deposits or statement credits, and they definitely won't give you as much value as travel redemptions. But it can be nice to have more choices.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that more doesn't mean better, and there are a few cases when the Bank of America Unlimited Cash Rewards provides a little more flexibility. \"Statement credits,\" for example, aren't limited to travel and dining purchases like they are on the Travel Rewards. Also, \"credits into eligible Merrill\u00ae accounts\" includes eligible cash management and 529 Merrill accounts, while the Travel Rewards redemption only includes the cash management option.\n\nYou want other travel benefits\n\nThe best travel credit cards don't typically have foreign transaction fees because frequent travelers want to avoid extra expenses. The Bank of America Travel Rewards is no exception. Unlike Bank of America Unlimited Cash Rewards, which comes with a 3% foreign transaction fee, the Travel Rewards card doesn't charge anything for this.\n\nYou want more insurance and purchase protection\n\nBoth the Bank of America Unlimited Cash Rewards and Travel Rewards are Visa Signature credit cards. This means they have additional benefits for cardholders. But the Bank of America Travel Rewards provides more everyday purchase benefits and travel-focused benefits.\n\nFor comparison, the Bank of America Unlimited Cash Rewards offers these Visa Signature benefits:\n\nExtended warranty protection\n\nRoadside dispatch\n\nTravel and emergency assistance services\n\nVisa Signature concierge\n\nThe Bank of America Travel Rewards offers these Visa Signature benefits:\n\nSecondary rental car insurance\n\nLost luggage reimbursement\n\nExtended warranty protection\n\nRoadside dispatch\n\nTravel and emergency assistance services\n\nVisa Signature concierge\n\nBoth cards qualify for Bank of America Preferred Rewards\u00ae\n\nMany Bank of America credit cards offer access to the Bank of America Preferred Rewards\u00ae program. You have to meet certain requirements to become a Bank of America Preferred Rewards\u00ae member \u2014 such as having an active and eligible Bank of America checking account and having $20,000 or more in eligible accounts over three months \u2014 but you could earn up to a 75% rewards bonus on your credit card purchases if you reach the Platinum Honors tier.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs the Bank of America Unlimited Cash Rewards card worth it? Yes, the Bank of America Unlimited Cash Rewards card is worth it as a credit card that offers unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases and $0 annual fee. It also provides intro APR offers on purchases and qualifying balance transfers and you could earn a $200 online cash rewards bonus after you make at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of account opening. Is the Unlimited or Customized Cash Rewards card better? The Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card is likely better than the Bank of America Unlimited Cash Rewards because it offers higher cashback rates in spending categories such as gas, dining, grocery stores, wholesale clubs, and online shopping. But the Unlimited Cash Rewards could make sense if you want a simple rewards rate and fewer cards to carry. What is the maximum you can redeem with Unlimited Cash Rewards? There is no maximum you can redeem for with the Unlimited Cash Rewards. The Bank of America Unlimited Cash Rewards has no limit on cash back you can earn and no maximum redemption amount. These redemptions require a minimum redemption amount of $25: Statement credits\n\nOne-time Bank of America bank account deposits\n\nCredits to a qualifying 529 account with Merrill\n\nPay for Amazon purchases or check out with PayPal\n\nBottom line\n\nThe differences between Bank of America Unlimited Cash Rewards and Bank of America Travel Rewards primarily come down to how you earn and redeem rewards. You earn cash back with the Unlimited Cash Rewards card that you can redeem for statement credits and deposits, and you earn points with the Travel Rewards card that you can redeem for travel.\n\nThe Travel Rewards card has an edge for travel because it has no foreign transaction fees and includes limited travel insurance, but the Unlimited Cash Rewards wins for Merrill Edge fans.",

The Precision Institute in Wilmington was also selected.\n\nThe two nonprofits were recognized for their work addressing food security and economic mobility, and building career pathways for Delaware\u2019s neurodiverse population.\n\nEach organization will receive a $200,000 grant over two years and comprehensive leadership training for their respective executive director and an emerging leader, along with access to a national network of nonprofit peers.\n\nBank of America\u2019s signature Neighborhood Builders program continues to be one of the nation\u2019s largest philanthropic investments into nonprofit leadership development, while providing unique, multiyear, flexible grant funding annually to two high-impact nonprofits in nearly 100 communities nationwide.\n\nSince the program\u2019s inception in 2004, 31 nonprofits have been selected as Neighborhood Builders in Delaware, with the bank investing more than $6.2 million in philanthropic capital into these organizations.\n\n\"With this presentation, we celebrate 20 years of strengthening Delaware nonprofits that provide critical services to our local communities, address social challenges and promote economic mobility in the First State,\u201d said Chip Rossi, Bank of America Delaware president. \u201cProviding the Food Bank of Delaware and The Precision Institute with flexible funding and leadership training will position both nonprofits for long-term, sustainable growth, allowing them to continue to serve our communities for years to come.\u201d\n\nThe Food Bank of Delaware, a long-standing Bank of America partner and 2009 Neighborhood Builders recipient, distributes nourishing food statewide through food pantries located on-site at its Milford and Newark locations, a network of community pantries throughout the state, home delivery services, mobile pantries, weekend meals for kids, and its senior nutrition program. In addition to its critical food distribution services, the Food Bank provides workforce and community development programming. This new grant funding will allow the Food Bank to expand its workforce development and training programs, and direct critical services to the communities that need them most.\n\n\u201cLast year, the Food Bank of Delaware distributed more than 19.5 million meals to individuals, families and communities across the state,\u201d said Cathy Kanefsky, FBD president and CEO. \u201cBeing a repeat recipient of the Neighborhood Builders grant provides the Food Bank with vital unrestricted funding, allowing us to expand our economic mobility and workforce development programs, and to continue to provide critical food distribution services throughout Delaware.\u201d\n\nThe Precision Institute assesses and trains individuals impacted by autism and other developmental disabilities to prepare them for full-time employment in the technology and business services industries. The nonprofit\u2019s multi-week workforce development program helps neurodiverse job seekers identify their unique strengths, build communication skills, and develop essential technical competences to obtain jobs with competitive wages, benefits and opportunities for career growth. The Neighborhood Builders grant funding will underwrite the assessment and training program, support the nonprofit\u2019s newly launched driving simulator program for neurodiverse teens and adults, and help position leadership for long-term success.\n\n\u201cOutcomes are the most important aspect of our work at The Precision Institute,\u201d said Janet Atwater, executive director. \u201cThis award will fund our assessment and training program, which is offered at no cost to candidates, and contribute to the ongoing development of our driving simulator program, expanding our nonprofit\u2019s capabilities and services. Because there is an unemployment/underemployment rate of over 75% for neurodiverse individuals, The Precision Institute is dedicated to removing barriers to employment by providing accessible training programs that empower candidates to find their strengths and develop the skills they need to obtain meaningful employment and build successful careers.\u201d\n\nNeighborhood Builders is part of the bank\u2019s long-standing efforts to build thriving communities by addressing issues fundamental to economic opportunity. The invitation-only program is highly competitive, with awardees selected by a committee consisting of community leaders and past awardees.",

            "content": "The Gazette offers audio versions of articles using Instaread. Some words may be mispronounced.\n\nMany Americans have recently been exposed to the troubling reality that their government may be encouraging banks to withdraw financial services from people or firms that make their money in ways that politicians consider unsavory.\n\nThis problem gained even more attention when venture capitalist Marc Andreessen appeared on a November episode of The Joe Rogan Experience charging that at least 30 tech founders have been cut off from banking services due to actions by Biden-appointed regulators.\n\nThis phenomenon, known as debanking, refers to the practice of financial institutions refusing services for political reasons to individuals, companies, or organizations. Andreessen\u2019s remarks went viral, prompting many in the digital asset space to post online about their own experiences of being debanked.\n\nDebanking is a problem that impacts people nationwide. Earlier this year, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird joined a 15-state coalition demanding that Bank of America stop its debanking practices. The coalition's letter highlights that Bank of America has denied services to politically unfashionable institutions, such as firearm or ammunition manufacturers, and accuses the bank of labeling \u201cconservative and religious Americans as potential domestic terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe relationship between a firm\u2019s discretion, preference, and behind-the-scenes governmental pressure has grown more intertwined since the 2008 financial crisis. Following the crash, laws like the Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel III international banking agreement increased regulatory scrutiny of banks\u2019 risk management practices and created new pathways for the government to pressure financial firms. It\u2019s also worth nothing that current regulations forbid banks from telling customers why they\u2019ve been debanked in certain situations, which means that banks may be getting the blame for regulatory actions they have little influence over.\n\nOne of the most notorious examples of debanking was the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cOperation Choke Point,\u201d which pressured banks to cut off services to industries such as firearms manufacturers. Thanks to the efforts of the Competitive Enterprise Institute and other groups, the behind-the-scenes activities of regulators promoting Operation Choke Point were exposed, and the program was eventually killed by the first Trump administration. However, the Biden administration quickly resumed the pressure on banks. Recently, regulators have pushed banks to deny services to crypto-related businesses, a move now being referred to as Choke Point 2.0.\n\nPresident-elect Trump is likely to prioritize addressing debanking, especially given that his wife and son were personally affected, as mentioned in Melania\u2019s memoir. Debanking has also been of concern to some high-ranking congressional Democrats, further increasing the likelihood of bipartisan legislative action.\n\nEarlier this year, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and others expressed concern at allegations that J.P. Morgan Chase was disproportionately closing accounts belonging to Muslim Americans and other minority groups. Similarly, Rep. Maxine Waters (D \u2013 CA) said an a Politico interview that she doesn\u2019t \u201cbelieve that an American citizen should have their bank accounts closed down, and nobody tells them why, or you have nowhere to appeal.\u201d\n\nBank of America infamously debanked constitutional law scholar John Eastman after he took on President Trump as a client following the 2020 election. The bank also voluntarily provided the FBI with a list of customers who made transactions in the days around the January 6, 2021 near our nation\u2019s Capital and those who purchased firearms with the bank's credit and debit cards.\n\nIn response to the volume of debanking stories being shared online, The Institute for Justice (a free-market public interest law firm) is considering legal action to challenge this federal surveillance system, arguing that the Fourth Amendment protects Americans against unreasonable searches, including financial records. They are currently seeking individuals whose bank accounts were closed without explanation or who were blocked from other financial services to share their experiences.\n\nLawmakers have introduced bills aimed at curtailing regulators\u2019 overreach, such as the Financial Institution Customer Protection Act. Although this bill has not become law, it indicates a growing awareness and willingness to address the problem. The start of the new Congress in January is an opportune time for policymakers to take action to protect consumers and restore confidence to customers that their money and financial data will remain safe and secure.\n\nWaterloo native and Loras College graduate Patricia Patnode is a Research Fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute focusing on banking, finance, and consumer freedom issues.",

            "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) begins 2025 as the top AI chipmaker with its position among the world\u2019s most valuable companies firmly secured.\n\nAnd right out of the gate, there could be a catalyst on the way. Tech show CES 2025 kicks off this week (between January 7-10) with the keynote on January 6 featuring Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nLooking forward to the event, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya, an analyst who ranks in the top 2% of Wall Street stock pros, thinks there will be enough for investors to get excited about.\n\n\u201cWhile the big themes have already been mentioned in the media ahead of the event, we still see CES as a positive catalyst, re-asserting NVDA\u2019s platform dominance/opportunity in high-growth markets,\u201d the 5-star analyst opined.\n\nAmong the key opportunities is Nvidia\u2019s foray into robotics. By capitalizing on its overall expertise (from silicon to software), Arya sees Nvidia making a \u201cstrong push\u201d into robotics. That makes sense as extending AI applications from computing and tools like chatbots and co-pilots to the physical domain of sensors and robots looks like a logical progression. The challenge, however, will be to make the products \u201creliable enough, cheap enough and pervasive enough to spawn credible business models.\u201d\n\nThat said, there is the possibility that similar to the metaverse or autonomous vehicles, robotics could remain \u201canother cool but niche opportunity.\u201d \u201cSo,\u201d Arya goes on to add, \u201cwhile we don\u2019t doubt NVDA\u2019s capabilities, we are unsure as to when and how fast they can influence NVDA\u2019s financials.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, although Nvidia has been the poster boy for AI, over the past 6 months the stock\u2019s rally has stagnated as a range of issues have come to the fore. These have included an overall shift from semis to software, and issues related to China restrictions, as well as company-specific challenges like a Blackwell design flaw, a slower rollout of high-density (NVL 72) racks, and declining gross margins (dropping from mid-70s to lower levels). Arya thinks CES will provide the company with an opportunity to offer reassuring updates on: \u201c1) Blackwell shipments, 2) next-gen variants (GB300, optimized for newer versions of AI inference) and 3) potential timeline acceleration for Rubin which could help NVDA regain control of the (overstated) narrative around custom-chips from cloud vendors overtaking/reducing need to buy NVDA\u2019s merchant silicon.\u201d\n\nBottom line, ahead of the event, Arya rates Nvidia shares a Buy, while his $190 price objective suggests the stock will gain ~32% over the coming months. He also names Nvidia a \u201csector top pick.\u201d (To watch Arya\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThe broader analyst consensus echoes Arya\u2019s optimism. Of the 40 analysts covering the stock, 37 recommend a Buy, while just 3 suggest a Hold (Neutral) rating. This strong endorsement results in a Strong Buy consensus, accompanied by an average price target of $177.08, implying a potential 22.5% upside over the next 12 months.

            "content": "Although it may sound alarming at first glance, there\u2019s no need to worry. Bank of America and Citi aren\u2019t shutting down overnight\u2014at least not permanently. This January, the most prominent banks in the United States will close their doors, but not due to financial issues. Instead, it\u2019s simply because of national holidays.\n\nAs an important occasion, New Year\u2019s Day is recognized as one of the 11 federal holidays in the United States.Bank of America and Citibank observe the following federal holidays in 2025, during which their branches will be closed:\n\nNew Year\u2019s Day : Wednesday, January 1\n\n: Wednesday, January 1 Martin Luther King Jr. Day : Monday, January 20\n\n: Monday, January 20 Presidents\u2019 Day : Monday, February 17\n\n: Monday, February 17 Memorial Day : Monday, May 26\n\n: Monday, May 26 Juneteenth National Independence Day : Thursday, June 19\n\n: Thursday, June 19 Independence Day : Friday, July 4\n\n: Friday, July 4 Labor Day : Monday, September 1\n\n: Monday, September 1 Columbus Day : Monday, October 13\n\n: Monday, October 13 Veterans Day : Tuesday, November 11\n\n: Tuesday, November 11 Thanksgiving Day : Thursday, November 27\n\n: Thursday, November 27 Christmas Day: Thursday, December 25\n\nThese closures align with the Federal Reserve System\u2019s holiday schedule. While physical branches are closed on these dates, online banking services and ATMs typically remain available.\n\nBank Hours on December 31 and January 1\n\nFederal holidays legally require only government agencies to close. However, most banks follow the Federal Reserve\u2019s holiday schedule and typically close as well. As a result, major banks like Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citi will not be open on Wednesday, January 1, 2025.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve, Tuesday, December 31, banks will be open during their regular hours but are expected to close earlier than usual. PNC Bank reports that most branches will close by 4:00 p.m. local time.\n\nHowever, both ATMs and mobile banking services were available as usual. Customers can easily take care of essential tasks like money transfers and bill payments using their mobile devices.\n\nRegular banking hours will start again on Thursday, January 2, 2025.\n\nHow to Prepare for Bank Closures During the Holidays\n\nHoliday cheer is great, but not when you\u2019re stuck without access to your finances. With banks closing for federal holidays like New Year\u2019s Day, a little preparation can go a long way to avoid any \u201cbah, humbug\u201d moments. Here are some tips to keep your finances flowing smoothly:\n\nWithdraw Cash in Advance\n\nWhile most transactions can be done digitally, there\u2019s no substitute for cold, hard cash when you need it. Whether it\u2019s tipping the delivery driver or splitting a bill with friends, having some cash on hand ensures you won\u2019t be caught short during the holidays.\n\nSchedule Payments Early\n\nDon\u2019t let those due dates sneak up on you. If you\u2019ve got bills to pay or transfers to make, handle them a day or two before the holiday closure. After all, no one wants to start the new year with late fees hanging over their head.\n\nEmbrace Digital Banking\n\nEven if the branches are closed, your bank\u2019s app or website is always open for business. From checking balances to transferring money, these tools let you bank from the comfort of your couch. Think of it as a modern-day elf, working behind the scenes to help with your finances.\n\nCheck Your Data is Correct\n\nBefore the holidays hit, make sure your account details, such as phone numbers and mailing addresses, are up to date. This ensures you don\u2019t miss any important notifications or statements.\n\nPlan Ahead for Big Purchases\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking of buying that dream sofa or splurging on a holiday getaway, plan your payments and withdrawals to avoid delays caused by the holiday closures.\n\nWith these steps, you\u2019ll breeze through the holidays without any financial hiccups. After all, being prepared is the best gift you can give yourself!\n\nDid you know? Bank of America traces its roots back to 1904, when it was founded as the Bank of Italy in San Francisco. It was created by Amadeo Giannini to serve immigrants who were often overlooked by other financial institutions. After the 1906 earthquake, Giannini famously set up a makeshift bank on a wooden plank to help locals access their funds, proving that banking can rise to the occasion\u2014even in the toughest times!",

            "content": "Through the first nine months of 2024, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway unloaded $133 billion worth of stocks. Buffett reduced Berkshire's massive stake in Apple and sold nearly a quarter of its Bank of America holding.\n\nIn the third quarter, Apple, American Express (NYSE: AXP), Bank of America, and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) made up 70% of Berkshire's $271 billion stock portfolio. Buffett is raising cash at a time when the S&P 500 is trading at 30 times earnings, which is historically high for this popular market barometer.\n\nHowever, it's worth looking at the stocks Buffett is choosing not to sell right now. Buffett continues to hold shares of Coca-Cola and American Express, which says a lot about what he thinks of their competitive advantages and growth prospects.\n\n1. Coca-Cola\n\nWarren Buffett has often invested in top consumer brands over his investing career. When Buffett sees a quality business trading at an attractive valuation, he pounces, and his 1988 investment in Coca-Cola is a great example.\n\nCoca-Cola stock fell sharply in the 1987 Black Monday crash. But the company was growing earnings at double-digit rates, and it still had a tremendous international growth opportunity. In the aftermath of the sell-off, the shares traded at around 16 times earnings, which prompted Buffett to invest a fifth of Berkshire's equity in Coke stock.\n\nBuffett has never sold a single share of Coca-Cola. The stock has split a few times over the last 30 years, leaving Berkshire with 400 million shares at the end of the 2024 third quarter. Those shares are worth $25 billion at current share prices, and paying $776 million in annual dividends.\n\nCoca-Cola is not the high-growth company it was when Berkshire originally invested, but the company should continue to grow earnings as it gains market share. Coca-Cola experienced a slight decline in unit case volume last quarter, reflecting a weak consumer spending environment. But over the long term, management expects to grow revenue marginally faster than the 4% historical growth rate of the global beverage industry.\n\nThe stock trades at 21 times 2025 earnings estimates and offers a high dividend yield of 3.14%. Assuming the company grows earnings faster than revenue, it probably won't be enough to outperform the S&P 500 over time. However, Coca-Cola's strong brand and consistent sales performance make it a great stock to hold if you want to boost your passive income.\n\n2. American Express\n\nBerkshire has held a large stake in American Express stock for 30 years, and as of Q3 2024, it still held 151 million shares. After adding to the position in 1998, Buffett has continued to patiently hold the stock and let it compound in value with the growth of the business.",

In the Finance Management Analyst Program (FMAP) Tanner will be introduced to Bank of America and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Group. The CFO Group is responsible for the overall financial management of the company such as financial and regulatory reporting, balance sheet management, financial planning and analysis, treasury, investor relations, corporate investments, and tax.\n\nHow HPU helped you get there: \u201cHPU gave me the platform to take advantage of opportunities that presented themselves in my growth. To be able to be well-rounded in technical and non-technical areas allowed me an edge that separated me from my peers.\u201d\n\nMost impactful mentor at HPU: \u201cI am thankful to many people at the HPU that have taken the time to go out of their way to contribute to my success. In particular, I want to thank five individuals that have shaped the way I think and allowed me the opportunity to graduate in 3 1/2 years while being prepared for what\u2019s next. Thank you to the following: Dr. Jim Wehrley, Associate Professor of Finance; Thomas James Assistant Professor of the Practice of Finance; Dr. Daniel Hall, Dean for the School of Business; Dr. Elizabeth Hupfer, Assistant Professor of Philosophy; and Assistant Athletic Director of Academics April Wines.\u201d\n\n\n\nMost impactful moment at HPU: \u201cThe memories with my teammates winning championships and growing into the professionals we are today. It taught me the core fundamentals of discipline and hard work and, even more, what it feels like when you capitalize on your chances.\u201d\n\nHow has HPU\u2019s inspiring environment contributed to your success? \u201cIt has given me the friendships and knowledge to go out into the world and create things. To be able to say I have that ability is a blessing, the world needs creators to drive innovation forward and I believe HPU is a place that agrees with that.\u201d\n\nWhat are the life skills HPU helped you develop that prepared you for long-term success? \u201cNetworking and being vulnerable, you will not get anywhere without having the ability to communicate effectively and reinvent yourself. \u201c\n\nWhat are the values and virtues HPU\u2019s campus helped you develop that you\u2019ll take with you after graduation? \u201cKindness and awareness, two character traits that create a person that will have plenty of success in not just their career but in life.\u201d\n\nAdvice for underclassmen: \u201cFirst, everyone needs to define success for themselves. Success is not a single standard, and if you continue to chase what society deems as \u201cwinning\u201d, then you will never know what enough is. Second, I believe that in order to do great things you have to be worthy of the opportunity. If you seek out opportunities that test you, spend time learning why things are done the way they are, challenge the status quo, then you will be a difference maker and not easily replaceable. Third, give more than you get \u2013 a simple rule for life that has allowed me to live a happy life with great people surrounding me. \u201c\n\nAre you an HPU graduate with an exciting job or graduate school offer?\n\nShare your news with us for a chance to be featured!\n\nView more Graduate Profiles",

            "content": "A sign is displayed on the Morgan Stanley building in New York, US, July 16, 2018. \u2014 Reuters\n\nMorgan Stanley terminated its membership of a major climate-banking group, joining a wave of Wall Street firms that recently quit a global alliance intended to aid the reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions, according to Bloomberg.\n\nMorgan Stanley is leaving the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, the lender said on Thursday. Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp said earlier this week that they were doing the same.\n\nThe defections are playing out against a tense political backdrop in the US, as the country\u2019s biggest financial firms find themselves the targets of Republican campaigns that have characterised net zero groups as climate cartels.\n\nSuch attacks have picked up, and as recently as November, Texas led a move to sue BlackRock Inc, Vanguard Group Inc and State Street Corp for allegedly breaching antitrust laws by using climate-friendly investment strategies to suppress the supply of coal. BlackRock said the suggestion that it invests in companies with the goal of harming them is baseless.\n\nOther banks that have recently quit NZBA include Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Wells Fargo & Co. All said they remain committed to their own net zero emissions goals and to helping clients reduce their carbon footprints.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to report on our progress as we work towards our 2030 interim financed-emissions targets,\u201d Morgan Stanley said by email. Daniel Storey, a spokesperson for NZBA, declined to comment.\n\nMorgan Stanley adjusted some of its green targets in 2024. Among these was a funding goal for plastics, with a report published in September omitting an earlier pledge to facilitate the prevention, removal or reduction of 50 million metric tonnes of plastic waste from the environment by 2030. The bank also has warned of the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of withdrawing financing too quickly from high-carbon clients that plan to decarbonise.\n\nNZBA had been one of a number of finance-industry groups affiliated with the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. GFANZ ended 2024 by adjusting the way it operates. Going forward, financial firms will be free to draw on GFANZ for guidance and assistance without being members of one of the sector alliances.\n\nThe defections that have hit NZBA follow similar exits across climate groups in other corners of the finance industry. In 2023, a coalition of insurers saw a mass exodus amid litigation threats. And in 2022, an equivalent group for asset managers parted ways with Vanguard Group, the world\u2019s second-largest money manager. Other investment firms followed.\n\nThe Texas lawsuit against the three-biggest US money managers referenced their participation in the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, which is another climate group associated with GFANZ.\n\nGFANZ was formed more than 3 1/2 years ago in the run-up to the COP26 United Nations climate conference in Scotland. Back then, it had two aims: to raise the number of financial institutions committing to net zero, and to facilitate industry discussion on the challenges of the low-carbon transition.\n\nIn an updated statement, GFANZ said it has \u201cachieved its initial goal of developing the building blocks of a financial system capable of financing the transition to net zero.\u201d\n\nIn order to \u201csuccessfully transition the economy, we must accelerate progress in public policy and technology developments, and close three critical gaps: data, action, and investment,\u201d the group said. GFANZ now plans to \u201cturn its focus to closing the investment gap to help unlock the more than $5 trillion a year opportunity created by countries modernising their energy systems and putting economies onto a low-carbon path in the next decade,\u201d it said.",

            "content": "Airport lounges might seem like a luxury benefit only used by the super-wealthy, but they're actually surprisingly affordable. When I left my job as a full-time personal finance editor last year to travel the world, I quickly discovered that airport lounge access doesn't cost as much as you'd think. You can typically snag a day pass for around $35 to $75.\n\nWith the right credit card, you might even be able to snag Priority Pass lounge access for free.\n\nPriority Pass membership can get you access to a network of over 1,600 airport lounges and experiences worldwide. Here's how you can get Priority Pass airport lounge access affordably and in some cases, at no extra cost.\n\nRead more: Breeze Through Airport Security. These Credit Cards Offer TSA PreCheck for Free\n\nHow much does Priority Pass cost?\n\nThe prices for an annual Priority Pass membership range from $99 for the Standard plan (with a $35 charge for each lounge visit) to $469 for the Prestige plan (with unlimited complimentary visits).\n\nIf you only plan to visit a lounge once or twice a year, paying for a day pass or the standard plan is your best bet. If you're taking more frequent trips, you'll want a plan that gives you unlimited access.\n\nLuckily, there's a cheaper way to get it than purchasing the Prestige plan directly from Priority Pass: credit cards.\n\nPopular credit cards that offer Priority Pass\n\nSeveral premium travel credit cards offer cardholders (and sometimes authorized users) complimentary Priority Pass Select membership, which grants unlimited lounge visits just like the Prestige plan.\n\nSince the Prestige plan costs $469 annually, any credit card with an annual fee below that amount is already a better deal, even before you consider the card's other benefits.\n\nSome of the most popular travel cards people turn to for Priority Pass include:\n\nCapital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card* with a $395 annual fee\n\nChase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae* with a $550 annual fee\n\nThe Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express with a $695 annual fee (see rates and fees)\n\nBank of America Premium Rewards Elite Credit Card* with a $550 annual fee\n\nSeveral business cards and hotel or airline co-branded cards also offer Priority Pass, but those cards appeal to a narrower audience and aren't significantly cheaper than the options above.\n\nWhat's the cheapest way to get Priority Pass airport lounge access?\n\nLooking at the four cards above, there's a clear standout: the Capital One Venture X has the lowest annual fee, at $395. Capital One also lets you add up to four authorized users, who all get their own Priority Pass membership at no additional charge.\n\nClearly, the Venture X is the winner, right?\n\nWell, that depends. If you're not going to use the card for any other travel benefits, then maybe. If you're traveling often enough to want a Priority Pass membership, there are other factors to consider.\n\nIn addition to offering Priority Pass, the four cards above come with a litany of benefits, including statement credits that offer quantifiable cash value. If you use these credits to offset purchases you were going to make through normal spending, they can help lower the card's annual fees significantly. Let's take a look at the value you can get from each card's statement credits and effective annual fees if you use all of them.\n\nFor ease of comparison, I'm only counting credits that have a defined cash value attached and don't come with complicated restrictions. Some credits aren't available every year, so the calculations below reflect each card's first-year value.\n\nPriority pass credit card values Card name Annual fee Total cash value of credits and benefits Effective annual fee *Capital One Venture X $395 $420 -$25 Chase Sapphire Reserve $550 $755 -$205 The Platinum Card from American Express $695 $1,294 -$599 Bank of America Premium Rewards Elite Credit Card $550 $550 $0\n\nNotice a trend?\n\nIf you can maximize all the credits without overspending, these cards are effectively free and you might even come out on top.\n\nOf the four cards above, the Amex Platinum technically has the lowest effective annual fee, at -$599. The Platinum's credits are split into many different parts, some of which may be harder to maximize than others. Among the options listed, it's also the card with the highest actual annual fee, meaning it requires the largest upfront investment with no guarantee you'll be able to \"earn\" it back.\n\nHow to get Priority Pass at the best value\n\nFor most people, the Venture X card will provide the best balance between minimizing the effective annual fee and ease of using the credits. The card only has two credits, one for TSA PreCheck/Global Entry and one for the Capital One Travel Portal, which offers a large selection of flights, hotels and rental cars.\n\nI didn't factor each card's rewards into the calculations above, but it's worth noting that the Venture X card offers a 10,000-mile anniversary bonus each year after the first (worth $100 if redeemed as a statement credit toward travel). This bonus, combined with the $300 annual travel credit, keeps the card's effective annual fee negative even in years without the TSA PreCheck/Global Entry credit.\n\nIf you can use all of the travel credits, the Amex Platinum might be a more rewarding way to enjoy airport lounge access with other perks to boot.\n\nThe credit card that offers Priority Pass for free\n\nIf you'll be making four or fewer trips in a year, there's another lesser-known card that could get you a Priority Pass membership for no annual fee: the U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Connect Visa Signature\u00ae Card*.\n\nThe card got an upgrade in September that changed some of its rewards and benefits and removed its previous $95 annual fee. Despite the annual fee elimination, the card kept its Priority Pass and TSA PreCheck/Global Entry credit benefits, essentially giving the card a few premium card perks for the price of a no-annual-fee card.\n\nSo what's the catch?\n\nYou'll only get four complimentary lounge visits per year with Altitude Connect's Priority Pass membership. Any guest you bring also counts against the four-visit allowance. That might not be enough to tempt frequent travelers, but it's perfect for occasional travelers or anyone curious about airport lounges who doesn't want to commit to an annual fee card.\n\nDo you need airport lounge access?\n\nYou don't need airport lounge access to enjoy traveling. You might learn, like I did, that this particular perk isn't always as glamorous as it seems. If you're in and out of airports often, lounge access could elevate your travel experience.\n\nIf you're new to airport lounges, I don't recommend springing for unlimited lounge access until you've decided that it's an experience you value. Investing a few hundred dollars or opening a new credit card -- which can have larger implications on your credit score and overall finances -- isn't a decision you should make lightly. If you're on the fence, buy a day pass and try it out with no commitment.\n\nAfter testing the waters, if you plan to visit lounges frequently, it's smart to find a credit card that aligns with your travel goals. For most travelers, the Capital One Venture X will be the best pick. For more frequent trips, the American Express Platinum can give you the best bang for your buck.\n\nAs for me, if I decide I want lounge access again, I'd turn to the U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Connect Visa Signature\u00ae Card. With no annual fee, airport lounge access feels like a nice perk, rather than a benefit I'd feel forced to use each time I fly to get my money's worth.\n\nFull list of credits compared in the table above: Capital One Venture: $300 annual travel credit through Capital One Travel\n\nUp to $120 credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck fee every four years Chase Sapphire Reserve: $300 annual travel credit for any travel purchase charged to the card\n\nUp to $100 credit for Global Entry, TSA PreCheck or NEXUS fee every four years\n\nComplimentary DashPass for one year when you activate by Dec. 31, 2027 ($96 retail value through DoorDash)\n\n$5 monthly DoorDash credit ($60 annually)\n\nComplimentary Lyft Pink All Access membership for two years when you activate by Dec. 31, 2024 ($199/year retail value through Lyft) The Platinum Card from American Express: Up to $200 annual credit for select prepaid hotel bookings through American Express Travel\n\nUp to $20 monthly credit for select digital entertainment subscriptions (Up to $240 annually)\n\nUp to $12.95 monthly Walmart+ credit ($155 annually)\n\n$15 monthly Uber Cash for US rides, plus a bonus $20 in December (Up to $200 annually)\n\n$Up to 200 annual credit for airline incidental fees from one qualifying airline of your choosing\n\nUp to $50 semi-annual credit for Saks Fifth Avenue ($100 annually)\n\nUp to $199 annual credit for a CLEAR\u00ae Plus membership Terms apply to American Express benefits and offers.

That was the case for Virginia Tech against Minnesota in the Duke's Mayo Bowl on Friday night at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte.\n\nThe Hokies were missing 14 of their 22 starters and among those was their secondary which saw four players enter the portal and one declare for the NFL Draft. Virginia Tech's younger players put up a fight but in the end, the Gophers were able to find the end zone three straight times in the first half on their way to a 24-10 victory. Here are three overreactions after the Tech finishes the season at 6-7.\n\nThis loss hurts going into 2025\n\nAgain, I can't get too wrapped up in a game where the Hokies were missing a number of players because of the portal and draft, but it felt like Minnesota was playing this like Virginia Tech did last year against Tulane.

That's nothing against the young players for Virginia Tech who have some key experience.\n\nWould we have liked to have seen Virginia Tech's roster at full strength? Yes, of course.

            "content": "Several major U.S. banks, including Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, and Bank of America, have recently announced their departure from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This global coalition was established to help financial institutions align their lending and investment portfolios with the Paris Agreement\u2019s climate goals.\n\nHowever, this wave of exits highlights the growing tension between climate commitments and political pressures, particularly in the U.S.\n\nA Retreat from Climate Commitments: U.S. Banks\u2019 Bold Move\n\n\n\nThe NZBA, launched in 2021 under the umbrella of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), committed its members to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n\nThe alliance required banks to set interim targets, reduce emissions associated with their portfolios, and report progress transparently. It also encouraged funding for projects like renewable energy and reforestation to offset emissions.\n\nBy 2023, the NZBA had gained significant traction, with over 100 member banks collectively representing 40% of global banking assets. This made it a key player in mobilizing financial resources for the transition to a low-carbon economy. Yet, political and market dynamics have increasingly complicated these ambitions.\n\nPolitical Backlash and Legal Challenges\n\nIn the U.S., political opposition has intensified against net-zero initiatives. Republican-led states have accused financial institutions of prioritizing climate goals over economic interests.\n\nIn November, Texas and 10 other states sued major asset managers like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, alleging antitrust violations tied to climate activism. These lawsuits argued that such actions limited fossil fuel financing, reduced coal production, and raised energy prices.\n\nThis political climate has pressured banks to distance themselves from alliances perceived as restrictive or politically charged. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, and Bank of America\u2019s decisions to exit NZBA follow earlier withdrawals by Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and others, citing similar concerns.\n\nSo, What Now After the Exit?\n\nDespite leaving the NZBA, these banks remain committed to their sustainability goals. Morgan Stanley reiterated its pledge to report on interim financed emissions targets for 2030, emphasizing its continued support for clients transitioning to greener practices.\n\nThe bank has committed to achieving net-zero financed emissions by 2050. To support this long-term objective, Morgan Stanley has set the following 2030 targets for major emitting sectors:\n\nThe firm plans to collaborate with clients to develop and implement strategies that facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Additionally, Morgan Stanley emphasizes the importance of transparent reporting and has committed to disclosing its progress toward these goals regularly.\n\nCitigroup also noted its progress on independent net-zero goals, while Bank of America stated it would continue working with clients to meet their sustainability needs.\n\nCitigroup has pledged to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, including both its operations and the emissions associated with its financing activities. As part of this commitment, Citi aims to decarbonize its own operations by 2030.\n\nThe bank has developed a Net Zero Framework that includes:\n\ncalculating baseline financed emissions for carbon-intensive sectors,\n\nidentifying appropriate climate transition pathways,\n\nsetting emissions reduction targets for 2030 and beyond, and\n\nimplementing strategies through client engagement.\n\nSimilarly, Bank of America remains committed to achieving net-zero GHG emissions across its financing activities, operations, and supply chain before 2050. To support this goal, the bank has set interim targets for 2030, focusing on reducing emissions in key sectors such as auto manufacturing, energy, and power generation.\n\nTheir strategy includes mobilizing $1 trillion by 2030 through their Environmental Business Initiative to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon, sustainable economy.\n\nAdditionally, Bank of America achieved carbon neutrality in its operations in 2019 and continues to work towards making its operations more sustainable.\n\nThese approaches reflect a strategic balancing act among major bankers. On the one hand, these institutions seek to maintain credibility as leaders in sustainable finance. On the other, they aim to avoid political and financial risks that could arise from their association with climate-focused alliances.\n\nBroader Challenges Facing NZBA\n\nThe challenges confronting NZBA extend beyond political opposition. Questions about the availability and quality of carbon credits, critical for offsetting emissions, have raised concerns about the alliance\u2019s effectiveness. Ensuring that credits meet stringent environmental and social standards is essential to maintaining the credibility of net-zero commitments.\n\nOperational complexities also pose difficulties. For instance, NZBA requires members to harmonize emissions reporting and reduction efforts across diverse portfolios and jurisdictions. This has led to administrative bottlenecks and slowed progress in achieving interim goals.\n\nAnother challenge is the perception of double regulation. Flights between the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA), for example, face overlapping compliance requirements under both CORSIA and local emissions trading schemes.\n\nSimilarly, banks must navigate overlapping climate regulations across multiple frameworks, further complicating their compliance efforts.\n\nGFANZ\u2019s Evolving Role\n\nThe Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), which oversees NZBA and other sectoral alliances, has adapted its strategy in response to these challenges.\n\nGFANZ announced it would no longer require financial institutions to join specific alliances to benefit from its guidance. Instead, it will focus on addressing critical gaps in data, investment, and public policy to accelerate the transition to net zero. The Alliance stated in a statement that it has:\n\n\u201cachieved its initial goal of developing the building blocks of a financial system capable of financing the transition to net zero.\u201d\n\nThis shift aims to unlock over $5 trillion annually to modernize energy systems and decarbonize economies globally. By prioritizing actionable investments and public-private partnerships, GFANZ hopes to sustain momentum despite recent defections.\n\nBut What Does it Mean for Sustainable Finance?\n\nThe exits from NZBA signal broader uncertainties in the sustainable finance sector. While financial institutions recognize the importance of addressing climate risks, they face competing pressures from stakeholders with differing priorities.\n\nInvestors demand accountability on climate goals, yet political forces challenge these commitments, particularly when viewed as detrimental to traditional industries like fossil fuels.\n\nMoreover, the scaling back of collective initiatives like NZBA could slow progress in mobilizing the trillions of dollars needed for the low-carbon transition. Without unified frameworks, banks may pursue fragmented approaches, reducing the overall effectiveness of global climate action.\n\nOpportunities And the Road Ahead for Net Zero Banking\n\nDespite these setbacks, opportunities remain for financial institutions to lead in sustainable finance. By leveraging innovative tools like sustainable bonds and green loans, banks can support decarbonization while mitigating political and financial risks.\n\nMoreover, investing in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and emerging carbon capture technologies offers pathways to align profitability with climate goals.\n\nThe exits of major U.S. banks from NZBA highlight the delicate interplay between climate ambition and political realities. While these developments may slow collective action, they also underscore the need for adaptable strategies to sustain progress. By addressing challenges proactively, the financial sector can continue to play a pivotal role in the global transition to a sustainable future.",

Learn More\n\nGetting more with the Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card\n\nThere are two paths to maximizing credit card rewards: spending and redeeming. With the Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card, you can get 25% to 75% more rewards when redeeming if you have high enough balances in your affiliated checking, savings and investment accounts. But because of the way the card\u2019s spending caps are structured, it\u2019s more difficult to maximize rewards just through spending.\n\nWith the Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card, you\u2019ll earn:\n\n3% for the spending category of your choice (gas/EV charging stations, online shopping, dining, travel, drug stores or home improvement/furnishings). You can update your choice category for future purchases once each calendar month, or do nothing and it stays the same.\n\n2% at grocery stores and wholesale clubs.\n\n1% on everything else.\n\nThere's a combined quarterly cap of $2,500 spending. That means you'll get 2% or 3% on the first $2,500 spent each quarter in those categories together, but once you hit that limit, you'll earn only 1% in cash back until the following quarter.\n\nShopping strategically will help, a little\n\nTo earn more when shopping with the Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card:\n\nShop where it counts most. As with other credit cards, the Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card earns rewards based on how each merchant is categorized. If you buy a food item as a gas station, for example, it would likely be coded as a gas purchase, not a grocery store purchase.\n\nYou can check to see how each purchase is categorized when you go to your account online and click on the drop-down menu on a certain transaction.\n\nMax out your bonus spending caps. If you can meet the Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card's spending caps each quarter without overspending, you'll get more value out of this card. How much you earn can depend a lot on what spending category you choose.\n\nBecause of the card's combined spending caps, your rewards shift depending on how you max out these caps \u2014 that is, how you split up that first $2,500 each quarter:\n\nIf you maxed out all your quarterly spending caps the 3% cash back category of your choice, you\u2019d earn $300 in rewards in a year.\n\nIf you maxed out half your spending caps for your chosen category and half your spending caps at grocery stores and wholesale clubs, you\u2019d earn $250.\n\nIf you maxed out all your spending caps at grocery stores and wholesale clubs, you\u2019d earn $200.\n\nTo earn the most rewards possible, you\u2019d have to max out your spending caps only for your chosen category and avoid grocery stores and wholesale clubs. But this is unhelpful advice. Let's say you choose gas as your 3% cash back category: On average, Americans spent about 60% more on food at home than they did on gas in 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Many might also find it challenging to hit those spending caps in the first place.\n\nInstead of bending over backward all year just to eke out an extra $50, it\u2019s easier to focus on maximizing your rewards through redemption. Your gains will be much higher, all for minimal effort, if you have a high enough balance in the right checking, savings or investment account.\n\nRedeeming wisely: Preferred Rewards will boost your earnings\n\nYour Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card offers three redemption options:\n\nStatement credit, which is a credit applied toward your current balance.\n\nDirect deposit into a Bank of America\u00ae checking or savings account or an eligible account at Merrill.\n\nPersonal check, which may take about 14 days to reach you by mail.\n\nFor statement credit or deposits into a Bank of America\u00ae checking or savings account, there is no minimum redemption amount. The same is true when you deposit into a cash management account at Merrill. Redemptions by check have a $25 minimum. You can also set up your rewards to redeem automatically once you've accumulated a certain amount ($25 or more).\n\nTo get the most from your card, redeem for direct deposit. Your rewards bonuses will be larger if you have a high balance in your combined Bank of America\u00ae, eligible Merrill accounts and qualify for the Bank of America Preferred Rewards\u00ae program:\n\nWith a combined balance of $20,000 to $49,999, you\u2019ll get 25% more rewards.\n\nWith $50,000 to $99,999, you\u2019ll get 50% more rewards.\n\nWith $100,000 or more, you\u2019ll get 75% more rewards.\n\nSay you maxed out half your spending caps at grocery stores and wholesale clubs and half for gas, for example. If you didn't have a Bank of America\u00ae account, you'd get $250 in a year. But if you had qualifying accounts with more than $100,000 combined, you'd get $437.50 in the same year.\n\nPreferred Rewards aren\u2019t automatic. If you qualify for the program, you have to enroll to start getting the benefits, which you can do here. You can qualify when you have both a Bank of America\u00ae personal checking account and a three-month combined average balance of $20,000 or more in a Bank of America\u00ae checking or savings account or an eligible Merrill account, according to Bank of America\u00ae\u2019s website.\n\nKeeping $100,000 in your account would dramatically increase your total earn rate on the card, from 3% on gas and 2% at grocery stores and wholehouse clubs to 5.25% and 3.5%, respectively.\n\nIf you don't happen to have $100,000 available to put into an account and you aren\u2019t getting many loyalty benefits out of the Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card, it might just be easier to earn bigger rewards on other cards, like the Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express, rather than trying to qualify for the Preferred Rewards program.\n\nEarn more with loyalty\n\nWith the Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card, there isn\u2019t a quick and easy way to increase your earnings. It\u2019s designed as a utilitarian cash-back card, not as a card for maximizing rewards. The only way you can really get ahead in a big way is by staying loyal to Bank of America\u00ae and maintaining a high balance in your bank account or investment account.",

Stocks made fresh all-time highs in 2024, pushing the S & P 500 to notch two consecutive years of annual gains above 20%. Wall Street continued its bets on artificial intelligence-related trades, across energy and technology, and remained optimistic on inflation progress and economic growth. \"This remains a stock pickers market,\" analyst Anthony Cassamassino wrote in a Thursday note to clients. Here are some of the firm's top buy-rated picks for the first quarter: Bank of America is staying bullish on Chevron , forecasting roughly 24% potential upside ahead for the stock. The firm reiterated its buy rating on the oil producer on Dec. 10 and added the company to its \"US 1 list,\" which represents a slate of investment ideas from its buy-rated U.S. coverage. Chevron shares were down slightly over the past year. The company has struggled due to lower margins on its refined product sales and amid uncertainty over Chevron's pending $53 billion acquisition of rival Hess. PayPal is another stock Bank of America is optimistic on. Analyst Jason Kupferberg upgraded shares to buy from neutral on Dec. 9, forecasting ample free cash flow generation and stock buybacks ahead as the payments company has already made significant progress in its growth initiatives. The company's upcoming investor day on Feb. 25 could also be a positive catalyst for the stock, he said, assigning a price target that now implies roughly 21% potential upside from Tuesday's close. \"Just over a year after C-level management change, PYPL is demonstrating increased turnaround progress, warranting a higher valuation multiple,\" Kupferberg wrote in the December note to clients. \"We see potential '25 acceleration in underlying TP [transaction profit] growth, recent holiday season e-comm spending data points have been encouraging, and we don't think potential modest improvement in branded TPV [total payment volume] growth is priced in.\" Online pet food retailer Chewy , cloud-based advertising company Trade Desk and Wells Fargo are among the other names that made Bank of America's list of short-term ideas for the first quarter. Trade Desk, which rose 66% over the past year, could gain nearly 32% from its most recent close, according to Bank of America. The firm remains bullish on the company's \"longer-term fundamental thesis,\" particularly on its competitive positioning in the digital ad market. The company stands to benefit from ad dollars shifting from traditional media to online channels as it should lead to higher spending on Trade Desk's platform.",

Members of the NZBA commit to transitioning operational and attributable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from their financing activities to align with net zero pathways by 2050, and to set 2030 financed emissions targets, initially focused on key emissions intensive sectors.\n\nThe NZBA forms part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a UN-backed umbrella group of net zero-focused financial sector coalitions, which also includes the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM), Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA), Net Zero Financial Service Providers Alliance (NZFSPA), the Net Zero Investment Consultants Initiative (NZICI), the Paris Aligned Asset Owners (PAAO), the Venture Climate Alliance (VCA), and the Net-Zero Export Credit Agencies Alliance (NZECA).\n\nAfter rapid expansion in the early years of the decade, members of the various GFANZ groups have come under significant pressure, particularly from Republican politicians in the U.S., who have been warning financial institutions including banks, insurers, asset owners and investors of potential legal violations from their participation in climate-focused alliances and of plans to exclude the companies from state business, as part of a broader anti-ESG political campaign.\n\nSeveral of the groups have seen high-profile departures over the past several months, with one of the coalitions, the Net Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), even disbanding in 2024 following a string of exits.\n\nCiti announced a commitment in early 2021, on the first day of Jane Fraser\u2019s tenure as CEO, to a 2050 net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) financing target, and the bank has followed up with interim targets for financed emissions reductions for key emissions-intensive sectors, such as energy and power. In a statement published announcing its decision to leave the group, Citi reiterated its commitment to reach net zero, and pledged to support GFANZ in its new focus on \u201cmobilizing capital to emerging markets in support of the low-carbon transition.\u201d Citi stated:\n\n\u201cIn light of this shift, and Citi\u2019s progress towards its own net zero goals, we have decided to leave the Net Zero Banking Alliance and focus our attention on supporting GFANZ during this new phase.\u201d\n\nBank of America\u2019s net zero finance goal also dates to early 2021, and the bank has also set a series of financed emissions reduction targets for key sectors. In a publication in late September 2024, the bank reiterated its goal to achieve net zero in its financing, operations and supply chain by 2050, and set new financed emissions targets for the Iron & Steel and Maritime Shipping sectors.\n\nIn a statement provided to ESG Today confirming the firm\u2019s departure from the NZBA, a Bank of America spokesperson said:\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work with clients on this issue and meet their needs.\u201d\n\nBoth Citi and Bank of America remain as members of the GFANZ Principals Group, which sets the strategic direction and priorities for GFANZ, and monitors progress.",

However, its EPS is projected to rebound with a growth of 12.2% year-over-year, reaching $3.67 in fiscal 2025.\n\nBank of America has risen 30.1% over the past 52 weeks, outperforming the S&P 500 Index's ( $SPX ) 23.2% return and the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund's ( XLF ) 28.2% increas e over the same period.\n\nShares of Bank of America recovered marginally on Oct. 15 due to its better-than-expected Q3 2024 earnings of $0.81 per share , which exceeded the consensus estimate. This performance was supported by strong capital markets results, particularly a 24.5% rise in underwriting income and an 11.7% increase in sales and trading revenues. Additionally, total deposit balances rose 2.4% year-over-year to $1.9 trillion, reflecting continued growth in core banking operations. Despite declining net interest income due to higher deposit costs, the positive momentum in investment banking and trading revenues boosted investor sentiment.\n\nOverall, analysts' consensus view on Bank of America stock is cautiously optimistic, with a \"Moderate Buy\" rating. Out of 22 analysts covering the stock, 13 recommend a \"Strong Buy,\" three suggest a \"Moderate Buy,\" and the remaining six give a \"Hold\" rating. This configuration is less bullish than one month ago when the stock had 14 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings.\n\nAs of writing, BAC is trading below the average analyst price target of $48.65.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "Overall, AT&T delivered mixed results on both the top and bottom lines in Q3. The company reported revenue of $30.2 billion, falling short of forecasts by $250 million. Earnings, however, outperformed expectations, with AT&T\u2019s non-GAAP EPS of 60 cents for Q3 exceeding projections by 3 cents per share. Additionally, the company generated $5.1 billion in free cash flow during the quarter.\n\nThe strong gains in this telecom stock have been bolstered by increases in subscriber numbers. In its last reported quarter, 3Q24, AT&T reported a net gain of 226,000 fiber subscribers, marking 19 quarters in a row with 200,000-plus net fiber adds. This was complemented by strong gains in postpaid phone customers, which totaled 403,000 net adds.\n\nUp first is AT&T, a true blue-chip stalwart in the market, a legacy name in the US telecom industry, and one of the world\u2019s most iconic brands. As one of the three largest wireless providers in the US, AT&T boasts a market cap of $162 billion, placing it firmly in the large-cap category and ranking it as the fourth-largest telecom company worldwide. This year, AT&T has also rewarded investors, with the stock rising nearly 36%.\n\nThe stock analysts at Bank of America are following this reasoning, highlighting such stocks as their top picks for 2025. We\u2019ll take a closer look at two of these stocks. They\u2019re undeniably large-cap equities, and, according to the TipRanks database, they carry \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 ratings from the Street\u2019s consensus. Let\u2019s delve into the details and uncover why BofA considers them top picks for the new year.\n\n\u201cThink about what\u2019s in large-cap value. It\u2019s big regulated companies that are going to get a break under a regulatory light administration,\u201d Subramanian opined.\n\nSavita Subramanian, head of US equity strategy at Bank of America, has been closely monitoring the situation. On the macro picture, Subramanian aligns with BofA\u2019s S&P 500 target of 6,666 for 2025, which represents about a 13% increase from current levels. Translating her optimism into actionable advice, Subramanian recommends that investors focus on large-cap value stocks.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of bullishness about 2025 \u2013 and not just because of the 23% gain in the S&P 500 in this outgoing year. Polling has shown a high level of public confidence that the incoming Trump administration will implement pro-business policies, including deregulation and tax cuts, which are anticipated to further stimulate economic growth.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn addition to bringing in sound subscriber numbers and generating plenty of cash, AT&T is also one of the market\u2019s most reliable dividend payers. The company\u2019s modern dividend history stretches back to 1984, and the firm declared its 1Q25 payment this past December 12. That payment, set at $0.2775 per common share, annualizes to $1.11 and gives a forward yield of 4.91%. The dividend is scheduled for payment this coming February 3, and will mark twelve quarters in a row at the current rate.\n\nIn his coverage of AT&T for Bank of America, analyst Dave Barden notes the company\u2019s subscriber gains and cash flows as attractive data points, and writes of the firm, \u201cOur top large cap telecom pick for 2025 is AT&T. Consistent operational performance is delivering improved financial results that are beginning to be reflected in an improved stock valuation. Steady investment in both wireless and fiber are positioning AT&T to grow subscriber share in both markets. This will drive higher adj. EBITDA and free cash flow that will flow to investors through share buybacks and a steady dividend. We believe there is room for AT&T to outperform its medium-term guidance.\u201d\n\nBarden goes on to put a Buy rating on T shares, and his price target of $28 suggests a one-year upside potential for the stock of ~23%. (To watch Barden\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThe Strong Buy consensus rating on AT&T\u2019s stock is based on 18 recent analyst reviews that include 15 to Buy and 3 to Hold. T is currently selling for $22.77 and its average price target, now at $26.65, points toward a gain of 17% in the year ahead. (See AT&T stock forecast)\n\nBlock, Inc. (SQ)\n\nBank of America\u2019s next pick for 2025 is Block, a leading fintech company founded in 2009 by tech billionaire Jack Dorsey. Formerly known as Square, Block has established itself as a leader in payment processing and continues to successfully operate the Square brand in that niche. Moreover, Block has expanded its portfolio to include the popular Cash App digital payment tool, among others. Prominent among Block\u2019s other apps are the bitcoin wallet Spiral and the online music streaming service Tidal.\n\nTurning to operations, Square and Cash App are Block\u2019s largest subsidiaries and its main generators for earnings and revenues. Square approaches the online payment landscape from the merchant end, while Cash App services the segment from the buyer\u2019s end \u2013 together giving Block solid product offerings in most aspects of e-commerce transactions.\n\nFor merchants, Square smooths out the processes of transacting business, providing software that can be accessed from smartphones and tablets, and hardware that can turn these mobile devices into mobile card readers and cash registers. Merchants benefit from flexibility, in both their location and in how they can take payments. Cash App users can streamline their financial accounts, gaining universal access to their money plus a wide range of payment options. The app lets users tap into checking and savings accounts, apply for credit services, and even monitor stock and crypto investments.\n\nGetting into financial results, Block\u2019s last reported quarter, 3Q24, saw gross profits of $932 million from Square and $1.31 billion from Cash App, for year-over-year gains of 16% and 21% respectively. Total net revenue in the quarter was $5.98 billion, up 6.4% year-over-year \u2013 although $280 million below the estimates. At the bottom line, Block\u2019s non-GAAP EPS came in at 88 cents, in-line with expectations. For the 12-month period ending this past September 30, the company had an adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion, up 59% year-over-year.\n\nThis stock caught the eye of Bank of America analyst Jason Kupferberg, who sees the company at the start of a potentially strong performance ramp. Kupferberg writes of Block, \u201cSQ is our top Payments pick for \u201925. As a US-centric re-acceleration story, we believe shares can outperform. The critical Square GPV metric should show modest improvement in 4Q, and more so in \u201925 as new initiatives take hold. SQ should also benefit from a more robust US SMB backdrop, plus mgmt has provided initial high-level \u201925 guidance, reflecting a healthy (and we think under-appreciated) combination of topline growth and profitability (best among large-caps). We also think SQ could achieve its Rule of 40 target modestly ahead of schedule.\u201d\n\nThese comments support Kupferberg\u2019s Buy rating on SQ, while his $115 price target implies that the shares will gain 35% in the next 12 months. (To watch Kupferberg\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nAll in all, Block has garnered 28 recent analyst reviews, earning a Strong Buy consensus rating based on a breakdown of 23 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell. The shares are currently priced at $84.99, with an average price target of $100, suggesting an upside potential of ~18% over the one-year horizon.

Between preparations for New Year\u2019s Eve, planning for the new year, are banks open on these dates? If you need to make any changes or transactions, whether it\u2019s withdrawing cash or simply making sure everything is in order before the start of the year, it is necessary to know what the bank hours are for these dates. So, we are going to tell you everything you need to know so you can plan everything better and enjoy a great start to the year!\n\nWhat happens to banks on December 31st and January 1st?\n\nYou have to keep in mind that on December 31st a lot of people go out to celebrate the new year with their families, and that January 1st is one of the 11 federal holidays in the United States, so public institutions and government offices will remain closed to celebrate the holiday. But what about banks? On the last day of the year, December 31st, banks will operate on regular business hours, but many branches will close earlier than usual, so operations will most likely end around 4:00 PM (local time).\n\nFor New Year\u2019s Day, as we said, most banks will close their doors, as will Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citi and many others, so keep in mind that if you need to make urgent transactions you will not have access to the branches.\n\nAnd what do I do if I\u2019m in a hurry?\n\nFortunately, we live in the age of technology, and although banks are not offering in-person service, banking services do not stop during holidays, so ATMs and mobile banking applications will be fully operational, so you will be able to carry out any transaction that you normally do (transfers, bill payments and balance inquiries).\n\nWhen will things go back to normal?\n\nThe next day, remember that this closure is only for national holidays, so on January 2, all branches will be operational as every other day.\n\nWhat other days are federal holidays in the USA?\n\nBelow, we are going to leave you the list of national holidays, in which government offices, banks, and most businesses will close their doors:\n\nNew Year: January 1.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. Day: Third Monday in January.\n\nPresidents\u2019 Day (or Washington Day): Third Monday in February.\n\nMemorial Day: Last Monday in May.\n\nIndependence Day: July 4.\n\nLabor Day: First Monday in September.\n\nColumbus Day (or Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day): Second Monday in October.\n\nVeterans Day: November 11.\n\nThanksgiving Day: Fourth Thursday in November.\n\nChristmas: December 25.\n\nPlease note that if the holiday falls on a Saturday, it will be moved to the previous Friday, and if it falls on a Sunday, it will most likely be moved to the following Monday.\n\nAny tips for planning?\n\nTo avoid any inconvenience during these festive days, it is best to anticipate the closings. So, if you need to withdraw cash or make some specific transactions, you can do so on December 31st or days before. Take advantage of digital banking as well because it is a way to always have your bank with you and be able to make the necessary transactions when necessary. Finally, check the hours of your branch because although most banks close earlier on New Year\u2019s Eve, some branches may have different hours.\n\nRemember that New Year is New Year for everyone, and we all like to enjoy this day with our family. So, if you are in a hurry to make a transaction, do it earlier and anticipate this closing!\n\nLife returns to normal on January 2nd. Have a Happy New Year!",

In the most recent example, the FDIC announced consent orders against Sutton Bank in Attica, Ohio, and Piermont Bank in New York City.\n\nOther banks that have been slapped with similar consent orders include Blue Ridge Bank , Cross River Bank , Lineage Bank and Choice Bank.\n\nIn these orders, regulators tell the banks they need to step up their oversight and monitoring of their fintech partners, and insist their boards must be involved. When the fintechs take on new customers, it's the bank's responsibility to make sure they aren't criminals, terrorists or money launderers. As the fintechs process transactions, the banks have to monitor them to make sure they meet all Bank Secrecy Act, anti-money-laundering and countering financial terrorism rules.\n\nClick here to read the full article.\n\nIf a company with an existing bank relationship approaches Five Star Bank, \"we need a pretty convincing story on why they want to leave that bank,\" said Abraham Rojo, head of digital banking and BaaS at Five Star, pictured at right.

About 53% of U.S. contact center agents who describe their stress level at work as high say they will probably leave their organization within the next six months, according to CMP Research's 2023-2024 Customer Contact Executive Benchmarking Report.\n\nSome think this is a problem artificial intelligence can fix. A well-designed algorithm could detect the signs that a call-center rep is under pressure and do something about it, such as send the rep a relaxing video montage of photos of their family set to music.\n\nFirst Horizon is using artificial intelligence and such video \"resets\" to bring a state of calm and well-being to the people who talk to customers on the phone all day.

Michael Nagle/Bloomberg\n\nJPMorgan Chase accuses TransUnion, others of stealing 'trade secrets'\n\nArticle by Penny Crosman\n\nJPMorgan Chase has sued TransUnion for what it calls an \"elaborate, decade-long scheme\" by Argus, a unit of TransUnion, to \"secretly misappropriate JPM 's valuable trade secret data.\" The data the bank is referring to is anonymized credit-card information. The case does not involve personally identifiable data.\n\nIn the lawsuit the New York bank filed against TransUnion in Delaware Federal District Court, it said Argus Information & Advisory Services collected the bank's credit card data while under contract as a data aggregator for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Argus then, without permission and in violation of its contracts with those agencies, used that data in the benchmarking services it sells to other banks, according to the bank. The complaint also named Verisk Analytics, which bought Argus in 2012, as a defendant.\n\n\"While Argus did not have access to any of our customers' personally identifiable information, this data is valuable and competitively sensitive,\" said Seth Wheeler, Chase's chief data and analytics officer. \"Argus used Chase's data for its own commercial gain, and it's time this pattern of behavior stops once and for all.\"\n\nClick here to read the full article.\n\nDavid Paul Morris/Bloomberg\n\nU.S. Bank announces partnership with Greenlight to provide family app\n\nArticle by Frank Gargano\n\nU.S. Bank in Minneapolis has partnered with the Atlanta-based family finance fintech Greenlight Financial Technology to help customers teach their children healthy spending habits.\n\nConsumers with the $684 billion-asset bank that have eligible U.S. Bank checking accounts can gain free access to Greenlight's platform and linked debit cards for children and teenagers up to 17 years old.

            "content": "The FDIC and NCUA recognize minority depository institutions, or MDIs, which are institutions that are led by minority group. One type of MDI is a Black-owned bank. These institutions serve to lessen economic inequality and provide banking and loan services to underserved communities.\n\nWe've provided a detailed list of 36 Black-owned banks and credit unions divided by state to help you find a Black-owned bank that fits your banking needs.\n\nEarly History of Black-Owned Banks\n\nBlack-owned banks have a long history of serving Black Americans, and they continue to serve communities today.\n\nThe first national bank in the U.S. was created in 1791. While it initially opened in Philadelphia, it had branches across the country. But as slavery continued, the bank did not serve all Americans.\n\nThe end of the Civil War eventually brought millions of Black Americans freedom from slavery. And even though then-President Abraham Lincoln established the Freedman's Savings and Trust Company (\"Freedman's Bank\") in 1865 to help serve freed slaves, Freedman's Bank failed in 1874 due to corruption and risky investments. Though it had once boasted 37 branches and $57 million in deposits, thousands of Black customers lost their savings.\n\nEstablishment of Modern Black-Owned Banks\n\nAgainst a backdrop of racist practices in the banking industry, including denial of access, Black-owned banks arose to help disenfranchised Black Americans. In 1888, Capital Savings Bank in Washington, DC, became the first Black bank to open, and the Savings Bank of the Grand Fountain United Order of True Reformers in Richmond, Virginia, became the first chartered Black-owned bank in the United States, later opening in 1889. More Black-owned banks followed.\n\nToday, these banks are considered \"minority depository institutions\" (MDI) by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The FDIC defines an MDI as \"a federal insured depository institution for which (1) 51% or more of the voting stock is owned by minority individuals; or (2) a majority of the board of directors is minority and the community that the institution serves is predominantly minority.\" There are dozens of Black-owned financial institutions in the United States, including credit unions.\n\nBlack-Owned Banks Versus Black-Led Banks\n\nThe FDIC divides MDIs into two groups: banks where 51% or more of the voting stock is owned by a minority group, and banks where a majority of the board of directors is part of a minority group, and the community that the institutions serves is predominantly a minority group. The former is considered to be owned by a minority group, while the latter is considered to be led by a minority group. For Black-owned banks, each bank is either Black-owned or Black-led, respectively. We provide that information for each bank we cover.\n\nThe NCUA, which is the credit union version of the FDIC, doesn't differentiate between credit unions in the same way, since credit unions are owned by their members. The NCUA requires credit unions to have a majority-minority board, membership, and community served. This means a credit union's board members must be over 50% minority, its current members must be over 50% minority, and the community it serves must be over 50% minority. These requirements are similar to, but not the same as, the requirements for a bank to qualify as Black-led.\n\nWhere to Find Black-Owned Banks and Credit Unions in the U.S.\n\nAlabama\n\nAlamerica

States, and access to traditional banks is limited in many majority-Black communities. The importance of Black-owned banks lies in their abilities to provide access to banking services for underserved communities.\n\n\"Even though we have federal fair lending and anti-discrimination laws, Black people still suffer from racial discrimination in the banking sector,\" says Robert E. James, II, chairman of the National Bankers Association, a trade organization and advocacy voice for the nation's minority banks. Black-owned banks and credit unions can be \"financial anchors for communities that have been historically deprived equal access to credit, capital, and even basic financial services,\" says James.\n\nWithout access to traditional financial institutions, many Americans turn to high-interest payday loans or pawn shops for access to capital. Lenders often allow people to use alternative forms of credit if they have a poor or low credit score so they can obtain the loan. However, high interest rates and additional fees can make these high-interest loans harder to pay off on time.\n\nAccording to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, many people are unable to pay off these loans and end up having to either get another loan or roll over their loan for another period of time, which adds further fees.\n\nBlack-owned banks in Black communities can offer access to FDIC-insured checking and savings accounts, financial literacy programs, reasonable loans, and more.\n\nDecline of Black-Owned Banks\n\nLike their non-minority peers, many Black-owned banks suffered during the Great Depression, though the decline of Black-owned banks was more severe because of their locations in lower-income communities hit hard by economic decline. There was a resurgence in Black banking in the 1960s and 1970s, but the industry was again struck by economic decline in the 1980s and during the Great Recession in 2008.\n\nAs of December 2024, the 23 Black-owned banks tracked by the FDIC (which insures banks). It's a small percentage of the total industry, but a percentage nonetheless.\n\n\"The No. 1 reason for the sharp decline in Black banks has been lack of access to capital,\" James tells Business Insider. \"Some of that has to do with small scale, being privately held, and the like. Also, our relative small scale has meant that our banks haven't been able to achieve the economies of other, larger banks, hampering our opportunities to grow and expand.\"\n\nBanks can raise capital by providing a variety of services and products, like loans or bank accounts, and imposing fees. Since Black-owned banks primarily serve minority communities, these institutions aren't able to offer the same variety of products and services as national banks, and as a result, have more limited opportunities for access to capital.\n\nBlack-Owned Banks FAQs\n\nWhat is the largest Black-owned bank? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. According to the FDIC, City First Bank and Liberty Bank & Trust are the two biggest Black-led and Black-owned banks as of the third quarter of 2024.\n\nWhat kinds of services do Black-owned banks offer? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Black-owned banks and credit unions offer a range of personal and business banking services, including bank accounts, online banking services, credit cards, retirement accounts, and mortgage lending.\n\nWho can bank at a Black-owned bank? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. To bank with most Black-owned banks, you need to either live in a certain state or open an account at a branch \u2014 so you can probably only bank with them if you live nearby. But there are a couple, such as OneUnited and Liberty Bank & Trust, that allow you to open an account online from anywhere in the United States.\n\nWhere can I learn more about Black-owned banks and credit unions? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. To learn more about Black-owned banks and credit unions, read \"Let Us Put Our Money Together: The Founding of America's First Black Banks,\" a publication of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. If you want more information on MDIs, including those owned by Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and Native Americans, visit the webpage of the National Bankers Association. For historical data on MDIs (banks only), visit the FDIC's webpage.\n\nHow many banks in the US are Black-owned banks? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. The FDIC currently lists 23 Black-owned banks in their Minority Depository Institutions list. However, that does not include Black-owned credit unions.\n\nWhy You Should Trust Us: How Business Insider Chose the Banks and Credit Unions on This List\n\nEach bank we selected is an FDIC-designated minority depository institution. The FDIC defines an MDI as a bank in which \"minority individuals own 51% or more of the voting stock, or a majority of the board of directors is a minority and the community that the institution serves is predominantly minority.\" We chose banks on the FDIC's official MDI list as of Q3 2024.\n\nEach credit union we selected is an NCUA-designated minority depository institution. The NCUA defines an MDI as a credit union in which \"more than 50% of its current members are minority individuals, more than 50% of its current and eligible potential members are minority individuals, and more than 50% of its current board members are minority individuals.\"\n\nWe narrowed down our list by setting 10,000 members as the minimum threshold for a credit union to be considered. You can find smaller credit unions that may be closer to you on this list.\n\nLeslie Quander Wooldridge Leslie Quander Wooldridge is a writer, editor, consultant, and coach whose articles have reached tens of millions of readers.

            "content": "There\u2019s a lot of bullishness about 2025 \u2013 and not just because of the 23% gain in the S&P 500 in this outgoing year. Polling has shown a high level of public confidence that the incoming Trump administration will implement pro-business policies, including deregulation and tax cuts, which are anticipated to further stimulate economic growth.\n\nSavita Subramanian, head of US equity strategy at Bank of America, has been closely monitoring the situation. On the macro picture, Subramanian aligns with BofA\u2019s S&P 500 target of 6,666 for 2025, which represents about a 13% increase from current levels. Translating her optimism into actionable advice, Subramanian recommends that investors focus on large-cap value stocks.\n\n\u201cThink about what\u2019s in large-cap value. It\u2019s big regulated companies that are going to get a break under a regulatory light administration,\u201d Subramanian opined.\n\nThe stock analysts at Bank of America are following this reasoning, highlighting such stocks as their top picks for 2025. We\u2019ll take a closer look at two of these stocks. They\u2019re undeniably large-cap equities, and, according to the TipRanks database, they carry \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 ratings from the Street\u2019s consensus. Let\u2019s delve into the details and uncover why BofA considers them top picks for the new year.\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nUp first is AT&T, a true blue-chip stalwart in the market, a legacy name in the US telecom industry, and one of the world\u2019s most iconic brands. As one of the three largest wireless providers in the US, AT&T boasts a market cap of $162 billion, placing it firmly in the large-cap category and ranking it as the fourth-largest telecom company worldwide. This year, AT&T has also rewarded investors, with the stock rising nearly 36%.\n\nThe strong gains in this telecom stock have been bolstered by increases in subscriber numbers. In its last reported quarter, 3Q24, AT&T reported a net gain of 226,000 fiber subscribers, marking 19 quarters in a row with 200,000-plus net fiber adds. This was complemented by strong gains in postpaid phone customers, which totaled 403,000 net adds.\n\nOverall, AT&T delivered mixed results on both the top and bottom lines in Q3. The company reported revenue of $30.2 billion, falling short of forecasts by $250 million. Earnings, however, outperformed expectations, with AT&T\u2019s non-GAAP EPS of 60 cents for Q3 exceeding projections by 3 cents per share. Additionally, the company generated $5.1 billion in free cash flow during the quarter.\n\nIn addition to bringing in sound subscriber numbers and generating plenty of cash, AT&T is also one of the market\u2019s most reliable dividend payers. The company\u2019s modern dividend history stretches back to 1984, and the firm declared its 1Q25 payment this past December 12. That payment, set at $0.2775 per common share, annualizes to $1.11 and gives a forward yield of 4.91%. The dividend is scheduled for payment this coming February 3, and will mark twelve quarters in a row at the current rate.\n\nIn his coverage of AT&T for Bank of America, analyst Dave Barden notes the company\u2019s subscriber gains and cash flows as attractive data points, and writes of the firm, \u201cOur top large cap telecom pick for 2025 is AT&T. Consistent operational performance is delivering improved financial results that are beginning to be reflected in an improved stock valuation. Steady investment in both wireless and fiber are positioning AT&T to grow subscriber share in both markets. This will drive higher adj. EBITDA and free cash flow that will flow to investors through share buybacks and a steady dividend. We believe there is room for AT&T to outperform its medium-term guidance.\u201d\n\nBarden goes on to put a Buy rating on T shares, and his price target of $28 suggests a one-year upside potential for the stock of ~23%. (To watch Barden\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThe Strong Buy consensus rating on AT&T\u2019s stock is based on 18 recent analyst reviews that include 15 to Buy and 3 to Hold. T is currently selling for $22.77 and its average price target, now at $26.65, points toward a gain of 17% in the year ahead. (See AT&T stock forecast)\n\nBlock, Inc. (SQ)\n\nBank of America\u2019s next pick for 2025 is Block, a leading fintech company founded in 2009 by tech billionaire Jack Dorsey. Formerly known as Square, Block has established itself as a leader in payment processing and continues to successfully operate the Square brand in that niche. Moreover, Block has expanded its portfolio to include the popular Cash App digital payment tool, among others. Prominent among Block\u2019s other apps are the bitcoin wallet Spiral and the online music streaming service Tidal.\n\nTurning to operations, Square and Cash App are Block\u2019s largest subsidiaries and its main generators for earnings and revenues. Square approaches the online payment landscape from the merchant end, while Cash App services the segment from the buyer\u2019s end \u2013 together giving Block solid product offerings in most aspects of e-commerce transactions.\n\nFor merchants, Square smooths out the processes of transacting business, providing software that can be accessed from smartphones and tablets, and hardware that can turn these mobile devices into mobile card readers and cash registers. Merchants benefit from flexibility, in both their location and in how they can take payments. Cash App users can streamline their financial accounts, gaining universal access to their money plus a wide range of payment options. The app lets users tap into checking and savings accounts, apply for credit services, and even monitor stock and crypto investments.\n\nGetting into financial results, Block\u2019s last reported quarter, 3Q24, saw gross profits of $932 million from Square and $1.31 billion from Cash App, for year-over-year gains of 16% and 21% respectively. Total net revenue in the quarter was $5.98 billion, up 6.4% year-over-year \u2013 although $280 million below the estimates. At the bottom line, Block\u2019s non-GAAP EPS came in at 88 cents, in-line with expectations. For the 12-month period ending this past September 30, the company had an adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion, up 59% year-over-year.\n\nThis stock caught the eye of Bank of America analyst Jason Kupferberg, who sees the company at the start of a potentially strong performance ramp. Kupferberg writes of Block, \u201cSQ is our top Payments pick for \u201925. As a US-centric re-acceleration story, we believe shares can outperform. The critical Square GPV metric should show modest improvement in 4Q, and more so in \u201925 as new initiatives take hold. SQ should also benefit from a more robust US SMB backdrop, plus mgmt has provided initial high-level \u201925 guidance, reflecting a healthy (and we think under-appreciated) combination of topline growth and profitability (best among large-caps). We also think SQ could achieve its Rule of 40 target modestly ahead of schedule.\u201d\n\nThese comments support Kupferberg\u2019s Buy rating on SQ, while his $115 price target implies that the shares will gain 35% in the next 12 months. (To watch Kupferberg\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nAll in all, Block has garnered 28 recent analyst reviews, earning a Strong Buy consensus rating based on a breakdown of 23 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell. The shares are currently priced at $84.99, with an average price target of $100, suggesting an upside potential of ~18% over the one-year horizon.

This discount signifies the existing interest rate scenario and that the loans sold are primarily lower-yielding loans with longer duration than the entire portfolio. HomeStreet will retain the servicing of the loans.\n\n\n\nHMST plans to use the proceeds for repayment of FHLB advances and brokered deposits that carry significantly higher interest rates than the company\u2019s core deposits.\n\n\n\nMark Mason, CEO, president & chairman of HomeStreet, said, \u201cEntering into this agreement ... is the first step in implementing a new strategic plan, which we expect to result in a return to profitability for the bank and on a consolidated basis early next year.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe deal marks a significant milestone for HMST as it paves the way to profitability after four consecutive quarters of adjusted losses.

The loan pool has been sold at a discount of roughly 1% to par value to BAM, with VLY retaining customer-facing servicing responsibilities.\n\n\n\nThis move aligns with Valley National\u2019s efforts to manage the CRE loan portfolio prudently and reduce its exposure to the loan category, thus mitigating concentration risk.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
